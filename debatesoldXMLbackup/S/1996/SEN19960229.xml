      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to take urgent measures to save the Murrough in Wicklow town from coastal erosion.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to investigate the proposal from Limerick County Council to locate a land fill site in Slieve Felim, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to encourage members of the dental profession to carry out certain orthodontic treatment in an effort to reduce the high cost of such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross's and Senator O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Cotter may give notice on <Col N="1050" /> another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items 1 and 3.  Item 2, which was originally ordered for today, is being deferred by agreement.  Item 1 will be taken from the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m.  There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.  Item 3, statements on Northern Ireland, will be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Last week we had a seven hour debate on Northern Ireland.  With regard to item 3 it is my intention to give time to as many people as wish to contribute.  If those who wish to do so indicate this to the Whips, we will be able to decide on a suitable time arrangement for these statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the proposed Order of Business.  We will decide later on the amount of time which should be given to those who wish to contribute to the statements on Northern Ireland.  We welcome the outcome of the summit meeting yesterday between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, and we call on the IRA to cease fire.  It has been clearly demonstrated on this island since the ending of the ceasefire that the people of Ireland, North and South, want peace and a continuation of talks and discussions.  I hope yesterday's summit will result in the start of peace talks and an end to violence once and for all.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald in his expression of the wishes of all the people of the island that the progress which was made yesterday in London results in peaceful progress towards political talks.  I hope the issue of prisoners will not be delayed too long and that the political talks will not have to be concluded before it is addressed.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the two Governments for what I believe was a good day's work.  I hope Sinn Féin and the IRA will respond and that we will proceed in an atmosphere of non-violence because the alternative is unthinkable.  I accept each statement should be brief but if a large number of Members offer, would the Leader consider extending the debate past 4 p.m.?</P>

      <P>We will have an opportunity this afternoon to express our views on Northern Ireland in more detail.  It is appropriate that all sides of the House join with Senator Fitzgerald in congratulating the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister and the others involved in yesterday's summit and in supporting his clear call and that of many others that the IRA should now take the opportunity for peace and resume their ceasefire.  In doing so it would allow Sinn Féin to become involved in the peace process and all of us to move forward in negotiations for peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Government on its good work in getting the peace initiative back on the rails.  I particularly pay tribute to Mr. John Major who took a bold line and showed he was in charge and that he was not going to be dictated to by the unionists. He acted fairly and I hope that, in the next general election in Britain, Irish people there will support him for the brave stand he took.</P>
      <P>Could we have a debate on telephones and Telecom Éireann?  A big scam involving telephone sex numbers is taking place.  This was highlighted in the Sunday papers and on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; on radio this morning. People are receiving large bills because of calls made on these telephone lines. We should have a debate on how the Government can keep ahead of these scams and abreast of modern technology. This would not be easy but we should debate how it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> Two or three years ago we had a debate on the collecting of money by charities and we should have another such debate.  There never seems to be accountability on the part of many charities.  We never see balance sheets at the end of the year showing how much money they raised and what they did with it.  There are people with collection boxes on every street and outside every chapel gate.  No doubt they collect for worthy causes but we would like to see how much money goes directly to these causes and how much is spent on administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that there will be statements this afternoon on Northern Ireland but I am certain that they will get the same derisory coverage from RTE that this House was given yesterday.  It is time we either rip the television cameras from here or RTE treats the House as the second Chamber of Parliament.  I am sick and tired of seeing it superseded not only by the Dáil but by Oireachtas and Dáil committees and all other output not involving this House.  Last night we discussed an important Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion.  It dealt with a topic in which everybody has an interest &mdash; the capture by multinationals of national sporting events &mdash; and not a single word of it was broadcast.  The motion was proposed by Senator Mooney, who is involved in broadcasting. The tiny clip shown was the nomination of our new colleague, Senator McAughtry.  It is not good enough and we should not put up with it.  Without <i>The Irish Times</i> and its journalist, Mary Cummins, this House would not exist in the public eye.  I intend to raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The House should consider whether it should take out the sham cameras or get proper coverage of its proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader of the House a number of times for a debate on the funding provided by the Government to county enterprise <Col N="1053" /> boards.  The problem has become more serious.  The county enterprise board in County Donegal has sanctioned £900,000 worth of small projects.  It has £90,000 which covered two projects in 1995.  We had 27 projects on an agenda for a county enterprise board meeting and we were not able to approve a single project.</P>
      <P>I will keep raising this issue until we have an opportunity to debate it.  We have had to listen to many clichés about community involvement and bottom-up development, yet in every rural area the county enterprise boards are dead in the water.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate so we can express our frustration. A senior executive administering one of the county enterprise boards said he had no doubt they would fold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 77 such organisations in the country and none of them has funding.  We are entitled to have a debate to try to find out what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Magner.  It would seem in Montrose, where the editorial decisions are made, that Ireland is treated as if it had a unicameral Parliament.  It is not good enough.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should immediately raise the matter with the Director General of RTE.  It is obviously not possible in the programming time available to the broadcasting unit in RTE to give reasonable coverage to this House. There has been a debate as to the usefulness of this Chamber of Parliament and it is not helped by the coverage.  I also agree that were it not for <i>The Irish Times</i> and Mary Cummins, the people would have no knowledge of what happens in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE lobbied long and hard to have Parliament covered by television and radio.  I ask the Leader of the House to take the matter up urgently.  We are <Col N="1054" /> treated in an outrageous fashion; we are considered fill-ins for days when there is nothing else to show.  It is not good enough.  It is a perverse and not particularly subtle assault on democracy.  I know there is frustration in the unit which compiles the parliamentary broadcast in RTE because they have sought and not been given the resources or time for the coverage.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an immediate debate on the crisis in closed institutions, particularly child care institutions. In the last couple of years we have had problems with Madonna House, Trudder House and revelations about the Goldenbridge orphanage.  At 6.30 a.m. this morning I had a call from a journalist to tell me two child care workers had been removed from an Eastern Health Board funded home and I am investigating that matter.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 I have consistently suggested we need an ombudsman and an inspectorate with the right to go into all closed institutions, particularly child care institutions.  There can be no confidence in the child care institutions until we have independent scrutiny.  There is an excessive degree of secrecy and an almost automatic reversion to denial in the health boards whenever there is a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>All sides of the House agree there is a serious problem with RTE's reporting of the proceedings of the House.  Last week we had Statements on Northern Ireland to which I made a contribution which I had prepared well.  The amount of coverage given was amazing and my contribution was excluded.  That was prejudice.  I support the criticisms expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that we should have a debate on the county enterprise boards.  I have found the county enterprise board in County Carlow is working well and helps many small industries.  The chief executive officer and his staff help people to avail of funds other than <Col N="1055" /> county enterprise board funds.  A debate on the issue would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Senators referred to Northern Ireland and yesterday's breakthrough which has revitalised the peace process.  The House will welcome the generous remarks of Senator Fitzgerald in his appeal to Sinn Féin to use its influence to persuade the IRA to allow the peace process to become a reality.  We all echo that sentiment and we hope there is now a framework within which real progress can be made.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell requested a debate on the telephone system and on charities. There is no time available in the shortterm but I will see if the issues can be dealt with at a later date.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner, Senator Sherlock and others raised the issue of RTE's coverage of the House.  I made representations to RTE on this matter recently.  I am assured more resources will be made available to Seanad coverage which will make it possible for Private Member's Time to get greater coverage in future.  However, it would be no harm to take the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and to request a meeting with RTE.  I will ensure that action is taken.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan and Senator Townsend raised the question of the county enterprise boards and I am sure time can be found for a debate on the issue.  Perhaps the Senators might get together and agree an all-party motion on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche raised the issue of child care and the ramifications of recent cases.  The issue has also been raised by Senators McGennis, Henry, Honan, Maloney and others recently.  I have arranged that there will be a debate on this day fortnight on the issue and I will confirm the arrangements later today.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked if the Statements on Northern Ireland could be extended and the Whips can discuss that possibility.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 49, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Cross subsidisation whereby less expensive schemes make a subvention to more expensive schemes shall not be permitted.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have all been satisfied with the mix of private and public health care in this country.  On Second Stage I pointed out that the VHI, which is the only provider of health insurance at present, had managed to keep approximately 30 per cent of the population as its subscribers. Over the past five or ten years there have been financial problems in the VHI and this has led to a certain inequity towards its subscribers.  Over 80 per cent of its subscribers are in plans A and B.  Approximately 11 per cent are in plan A which gives semi-private accommodation in a public hospital; over 70 per cent are in plan B which gives private accommodation in a public hospital; approximately 10 per cent are in plan C which gives semi-private and private accommodation in private hospitals other than the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital; approximately 6 per cent are in plan D where patients can have semi-private cover in the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital; and approximately 3 per cent, 39,000 people, opt for plan E which gives private cover in both those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem with people choosing whichever plan they want.  People will choose a particular plan depending on how much they can afford or whether they feel they will be better off <Col N="1057" /> in a private or a public institution.  The more expensive plans were set up approximately 12 years ago.  The institutions covered in those plans are described as high tech hospitals. However, it is important to point out that a lot of the technology there is also available in public hospitals.  One does not have to go to these hospitals for high tech medicine.  The hotel style accommodation in private hospitals is of a higher standard.  I question the equity of people on the lower plans subsidising hotel accommodation in these institutions which are serving a small number of better off people in the higher plans.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get the VHI's figures. I have no intention of finding a mole in the VHI to ascertain what is happening in each category.  There was a report in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> that the lower schemes were subsidising the higher schemes.  Yesterday in the <i>Irish Independent</i> the chief executive of the VHI was quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>Those who pay the more expensive premiums can be treated in hospitals such as the high-tech Blackrock Clinic and Mater Private.</P>
    <P>Mr. Duncan said these plans were profitable and if axed subscriptions would rise by about 5pc.  &ldquo;It is correct to say that claims are greater than subscription income from plans C, D and E,&rdquo; he said.  However, it is incorrect to say they were being unfairly subsidised by plans A and B.</P>
    <P>They must be subsidised by someone.  It is unfair that people who cannot afford to subscribe to the higher plans are subsidising those plans.  The money must be coming from somewhere if the claims are more than the subscriptions in plans C, D and E.  Plans D and E are the problem plans.  It is not as if an important technique can only be carried out in these institutions.  I am concerned that the maintenance is being subsidised.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on Second Stage that clinicians are not making many of the decisions on what will or will not be an <Col N="1058" /> in-patient process.  Day care is now mandatory for certain procedures. These decisions are made by people who work in the VHI.  I wonder are the same procedures mandatory for people on plans D and E as for those on plan B. Equity needs to be shown in this regard. When a former Minister for Health, Mr. Barry Desmond, allowed the VHI to introduce plans D and E, he wanted separate payment systems so that there would not be cross-subsidisation.  A firm policy was agreed with the chief executive of the VHI, but that was over ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The VHI does not have to disclose its internal costings and it is not under the insurance ombudsman, who only deals with insurance companies covered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The VHI got into such a terrible mess about five years ago as a result of these expensive plans that the then Minister for Health had to call in someone to review them.  Deputy Harney pointed out that the VHI might have been trading illegally because its reserves were not sufficient to cover the claims.  I cannot remember the exact details, but I know that Mr. Noel Fox was brought in and he introduced a plan in 1993 to try to rectify this financial situation. Part of his plan stated:</P>
    <P>The introduction of two special plans D and E to cater for the high tech hospitals is now recognised to have been erroneous.  The pricing of the two plans, particularly plan E, was bound to be at a level which would appeal to a relatively small number of subscribers.  Furthermore, these subscribers are in the higher income brackets and older age categories, and as such have a greater demand for healthcare and a higher claims rate.  It was inevitable that plans D and E would suffer from adverse selection (i.e. the tendency for those subscribers with a poor health record to select the highest level of cover they can afford).  Anyone subscribing to plans D and E would also desire to be treated in the high tech hospitals even <Col N="1059" /> for procedures which could be treated just as effectively in another acute private hospital at a far lower cost to the VHI.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the present plan structure will need to be radically overhauled over the next two years.  [I do not know if that happened]. . . . . . Any member wishing to avail of their facilities [those of the high tech hospitals, although we should not refer to them as that because modern technology is now more widely available] for procedures which can be carried out effectively in one of the traditional acute private hospitals will be given the option of purchasing additional cover.  This additional cover will not be subject to community rating but will be economically underwritten.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that ever happened. This plan made many recommendations which were never put into place.  It also stated that &ldquo;Larger increases are being applied to plans C, D and E in an attempt to bring them a step closer towards becoming self-financing.&rdquo;.  This happened initially but it did not continue, otherwise the chief executive would not be quoted as saying that &ldquo;claims are greater than subscription income from plans C, D and E&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a great inequity for over 80 per cent of VHI subscribers who are not the most affluent in our society but who value private health care.  I pointed out before that under this system people had a choice of doctor and they also had control over the timing of an elective procedure.  We have to see if it is just to subsidise hotel accommodation for the higher schemes from the moneys collected from the lower schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Henry in this area.  It is very disturbing news that there is cross subsidisation of what could be termed super care.  It is unfortunate that those who have maintained their subscriptions <Col N="1060" /> to the VHI over the years now find themselves to some extent subsidising this super care in what could be described as grade triple A hotel accommodation. I wonder if this in the best interests of health cover.  The whole health system would collapse without private health insurance.  However, will we create an albatross for private health care if we continue on this basis?</P>
      <P>I would like to get a breakdown of the figures.  I do not know if such figures are available to the Minister but the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, of which I am a member, attempted on a number of occasions to get a proper breakdown, which did not seem to be available.  I fear that the problem is not with payment to consultants in this case.  I cannot prove that but perhaps the Minister can shed some light on it.  Many of the consultants I know are inside the system of agreed payments and, thankfully, an increasing number are coming into that category.  I hope that the initiative shown by the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies a couple of years ago in attempting to get a list published was helpful in that area.  It brought into the public domain who was or was not accepting the VHI fee structure.</P>
      <P>I would like to get the breakdown of the figures in order to know whether it is the accommodation which is being subsidised or the cost of consultants and technology.  If the former is the case, it is definitely time for it to be reviewed. Subscribers are greatly worried about this and it has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions.  It is a matter of public debate that we are subsidising the super care available under the D and E plans of the VHI.  We should establish the situation and explain to the public what is happening. I hope the Minister can throw some light on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also hope that the Minister can enlighten us on this confusing matter.  When I contacted the VHI about this issue they seemed to come up with two different answers, depending <Col N="1061" /> on whether they looked at the situation on an actuarial basis or a community rating basis.  I was led to believe by the end of conversation that if they did what we wanted in this amendment they would have to reduce the charges for plans D and E and increase the charges for the lower plans.  I cannot reconcile that with the statement by Brian Duncan in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent.</i> Perhaps the Minister can help us on that.</P>
      <P>It is important for people to have confidence in the VHI and remain as members.  Those who can afford to pay for their health care should do so because although we spend in the region of £2.4 billion on our public health services, they are stretched to the limit.  We do not want the 1.3 million subscribers to the VHI to come into the public health care system because there would then be less available for everybody.  My party and I are in favour of a mix of private and public health care.  It is in all our interests to ensure that the VHI organisation continues to be acceptable to its 1.3 million subscribers and that the services it provides continue to attract members.</P>
      <P>I cannot work out whether what Mr. Brian Duncan said in yesterday's newspaper is true or whether the more expensive schemes are being subsidised by the less expensive ones, which would be unacceptable.  Perhaps the Minister can inform us about that.  When I asked the VHI I was given different answers on actuarial and community rating bases.  I could not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I shared the views of Senator Henry until we had the situation examined last year.  The best starting point is to refer to motor insurance, where those who are high risk pay higher premia and those who have accidents lose their no claim bonuses and their premia are increased &mdash; the insurance is related to risk.  The policy position on VHI is that we do not relate the level of premia to risk, which is the essential ingredient of community rating. <Col N="1062" /> Therefore, by definition, in general terms the young and healthy subsidise the old and ill.</P>
      <P>There is a subsidisation involved in the community rating.  We all agree with that policy because otherwise older people and those with a history of illness could not obtain any cover.  The policy of community rating does not arise as an issue in Senator Henry's amendment but it is true that in all VHI schemes the young and healthy &mdash; those who do not need hospital services &mdash; subsidise those who get ill and go to hospital.  No penalty is applied to the premia of those who use hospital services more than others.  That level of subsidisation is part of the policy. However, there is not subsidisation between the different schemes.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran is right in saying that the level of information available from the VHI, even to the Joint Committee, is not very good.  Last year, we brought in an independent firm of actuaries over an 18 month period to advise the Department on this issue.  Based on confidential information available to my Department, in reference to the principle of community rating there is no subsidisation by less expensive schemes of more expensive ones.  The matter was examined by an independent firm of consultant actuaries whose advice the Department of Health had sought. These actuaries found that no such subsidisation existed.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill requires the VHI to notify the Minister of proposed premium increases and gives the Minister the power to veto any such increases for stated reasons.  The Bill, therefore, gives the Minister the power to ensure that increases are justified on commercial equity and other grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report we received from the actuaries last year said that there was no subsidisation of more expensive schemes by less expensive ones on the basis of their examination over more than a year.  Section 3 of the Bill gives me the power to ensure that in regard to proposed increases in the future the VHI will not be able to implement that <Col N="1063" /> element.  Therefore, the VHI would have to notify me or my successor if it wanted to move to a situation of subsidisation. Consequently, we can maintain the current situation where there is not cross subsidisation of more expensive schemes by less expensive ones.  In fact, if there is any evidence of cross subsidisation it is the reverse position.  It is not relevant to the amendment, but there is probably some element of subsidisation of the less expensive schemes by the more expensive ones.</P>
    <P>How does one reconcile the figures if so many of the plans are losing money? The VHI is losing money on a trading basis, and if last year's accounts had not included £10.3 million in investment income it would show a loss.  Under its mandate in the 1957 Act, the company is supposed to trade on a break even basis &mdash; it is a non-profit organisation but it should cover its costs.  It was strong at the time when it could make investments from which income is now derived, but if there was no such income from previous good balance sheets the company would be losing money.  If expenditure and premium income for last year are compared, there is quite a discrepancy, which was made up by drawing investment income and putting it into the accounts.  More than £10 million was used last year and more than that, I understand, in previous years.  I think that reconciles the figures.</P>
    <P>The other reason I cannot accept the amendment is that if the restraints it suggests were imposed on one insurance company, under the EU directives and single market rules it would have to apply to other competitors.  The legislation which regulates the market is the Health Insurance Act, 1984, but this amendment would in my view be considered anti-competitive as it would be a restraint on the market.  In Senator Quinn's business, for example, not every section of a store has to show a profit.  A business may have different pricing policies for different elements and removing that option by law would be considered anti-competitive and we <Col N="1064" /> would not receive sanction from Brussels to do so.</P>
    <P>The issue does not arise.  I had the same view as Senator Henry 12 months ago, when I would have said there was cross-subsidisation &mdash; that arose from the debate on the establishment of the big private hospitals in the 1980s. However, the position has changed and one factor which led to that is the manner in which price increases are organised. Since 1989 the average price increase for Plan A has been 4.65 per cent; for Plan B, 5.27 per cent; for Plan C, 6.39 per cent; for Plan D, 7.85 per cent; and for Plan E. 8.59 per cent.  The increase for Plan E is therefore almost double that for Plan A.  As Senator Honan said, this is further complicated by community rating.  We all share a health insurance policy whereby people who do not get ill and do not avail of the services subsidise those who do.  To compare this with motor insurance, those regarded as a low risk clearly subsidise the high risk people when there is no loading for risk on the premium.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Henry raised this issue because there is much misunderstanding about it.  Senators will see why I want to bring more commercial expertise on to the VHI board, because we had to ask our own actuaries to establish the facts when the information was not readily available from the company.</P>

      <P>I cannot quarrel with the Minister's confidential figures from actuaries and as a Plan B subscriber I am pleased to hear the subventions may be going in the other direction. However, I am not quite so enthusiastic about the comparison with motor insurance to the effect that Mazdas and Nissans keep Jaguars and BMWs on the road.  I see the logic of his argument and from an anti-competitive view I would like this provision to apply everywhere. The great advantage of a scheme like VHI is that the young and healthy subsidise <Col N="1065" /> those who have the ill-luck to get sick and it is marvellous if one goes through life without having to draw on the VHI.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the next section of the legislation allows him to monitor what happens in this area.  It is the secrecy which has caused much of the trouble here.  I would not mind if specialised medical technology was involved, but many people on the lower schemes resent the thought of subsidising what is effectively hotel accommodation. As Senator Honan said, the private health care system is most important and if the rumours in the medical press about the Minister's proposals on where consultants will be able to work are true, if geographic whole-time becomes the order of the day, it will become even more so.  These areas are vital for the future of medicine.  I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), nothing in the Competition Act, 1991, shall prevent or restrict any health insurer from exercising any of the powers or doing any of the things provided for in section 2.  The Minister may, at any time, suspend, vary or revoke the exemption provided to health insurers by subsection (1) if he thinks it necessary to do so for the common good.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that the VHI will enter into agreements with health care providers in the future.  Although it may not be warranted, there is some public worry about this and section 2 may be open to challenge.  In the other House the Minister did not see that happening, but he left the door slightly ajar.  The VHI should not be open to challenge but it could be under proposed competition <Col N="1066" /> legislation from another Department &mdash; I am not fully <i>au fait</i> with the position but it has been brought to my attention.  Perhaps the Minister could provide the House with his information on the subject because undoubtedly he has investigated the matter and is in a far better position to allay fears.  The Attorney General must have given advice because the legislation would not have been drafted if he did not.  If the Minister outlines that advice we could see how we should proceed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The application of competition law, which reflects the position in European law, is a key economic policy of Government which cannot be set aside in respect of any one sector of business activity.  One clear consequence of our membership of the European Community was to embrace both the principles and mechanisms of a fully competitive single market. Each section would make its case for being an exception to the rules of competition.  I am not aware that any Government, whatever its political make-up, regarded the Competition Act as other than applying to the economy as a whole without favour or exception.</P>
      <P>The exemption of health insurance from the scope of the Competition Act would have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the Act.  Such a step would be wholly inconsistent with the thrust of policy of successive Governments to foster an open, competitive and efficient business environment both for the benefit of the consumer and the better operation of the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's current initiative is to strengthen competition law by increasing the powers and resources of <Col N="1067" /> the Competition Authority.  It is open to the VHI to consider seeking to avail of those protections which the Competition Act provides in terms of the rules of competition.  The avoidance of abuse of a dominant position is the key, not exclusion from the Competition Act itself, which is in effect the general policy position on the Competition Act that has been pursued by all Governments in recent years.</P>
    <P>The insurance market is opening up as a result of the EU directive and that will also apply to health insurance.  We laid out our statutory position in the 1994 Act.  The insurance regulations were published last March for consultation and I hope that, after that consultation, the final version will shortly be brought before the Oireachtas and that it will lay out in precise detail the ball park in which competitors will have to play in the heath insurance market. However, in the light of the movement towards more competition, to exempt the VHI from the Competition Act would be a retrograde step and would not be consistent with general Government policy.</P>
    <P>That does not put the VHI in any difficulty. It is not an offence to be in a dominant position in the market; the offence is to abuse that dominant position. If the VHI does not do this, there will be no difficulty.  Some people may ask how we can be sure that at a later date somebody might regard this abuse as normal business practice.  There is provision under the Competition Act for companies or service providers like the VHI to discuss the situation with the Competition Authority and agree Protocols and procedures with the Authority which it would regard as fair, just and equitable.  I have advised the VHI that it should proceed on that basis.  If the VHI negotiates its arrangements for Protocols and procedures with the Competition Authority in advance, it will have an assurance in place that the Authority will not fine it subsequently if it abuses its dominant position.  The <Col N="1068" /> VHI should do this rather than seek an exemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear this.  The Minister seems to be talking about a type of licence that would allow the VHI to enter into a form of arrangement with the Authority and that would be helpful.  Can he confirm if derogations or exemptions have been provided to help health insurers in other EU states?  We have heard reports of this occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran. I have also been informed that national health service contracts in the UK do not give rise to contractual rights and liabilities and in the United States, certain activities of health service providers may be exempt from anti-trust laws.  The European Court of Justice has recognised the need for non-selective insurance providers which will have an obligation to deal with all applicants, regardless of their age or state of health. It has control to limit its outgoings even if it has a negative effect on trading goods and services.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, all health insurers are obliged to act as non-selective insurance providers.  The VHI is concerned that, because of this Act, it may be open to challenge under some of the provisions of the Competition Act, which is why it is seeking a limited exemption.  In doing so, it believes it is acting like health insurance providers in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health insurance is different from other services because there can be supplier induced demand.  It is recognised by many people with responsibility for the management of national health services that demand for such services can be manipulated by the providers.  The VHI is concerned that providers can stimulate demand because often the ordinary patient does not know if they require these services and the person providing them can make these patients believe they do.  The VHI is seeking this exemption to curtail its costs and the <Col N="1069" /> insurance costs to its members and in the perceived knowledge that health services in other EU countries have this limited exemption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Over the years, many sections of the economy, especially those in the general State sector who are service providers in one way or another, have said they would like to have been exempt from competition.  One can see it in the provision of telecommunications services, where the debate is still active, and the ESB.  Anywhere there is a dominant service provider and the market is opening up in line with EU policy and practice the issue always comes up with a case to be made for a particular sector.  It has been Government policy not to make exemptions.  Indeed, the Department of Enterprise and Employment propose to extend rather than restrict the scope of the Competition Act.</P>
      <P>It is not that the VHI has a dominant position which was the issue in the Ballinderry case but the abuse of it.  The VHI can make provision in accordance with the Competition Act to have its practices, Protocols and procedures agreed by the Competition Authority in advance of putting new practices, Protocols and procedures in place.  That should give it the safety net it needs and ensure it is not running foul of the Competition Authority subsequently if it was accused of abusing its dominant position.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Honan raised points which also came up in the other House.  For the information of Members, I will read what I said in that debate which deals with the question of whether parallel cases of exemptions arose in Europe and the Attorney General's advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government made its decision not to exclude health insurance following consideration of all the issues involved and advice thereon, including that of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. However, the Attorney General's <Col N="1070" /> advice, generally, in regard to section 2 was that it is legally sound and that it does not conflict with the provisions of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Section 2 removes legal doubts which arose following the Supreme Court judgment on the Ballinderry case in regard to the VHI's legal powers to enter and not enter into contracts with service providers.  Furthermore, the issue of whether any exercise by the VHI of a power to be conferred on it under the section would be in conflict with the Competition Act is a separate issue, which, in the event of a challenge would ultimately fall to be determined by a court on the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of health insurance from the Competition Act ambit is a matter of policy.  It was not the intention that section 2 would exclude the VHI from the parameters of the Act, and it is a matter for the VHI to work within it.  While it is Government policy that health insurance is governed by the Act, the matter will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>On the issue as to whether cases in Europe have allowed other insurance companies in Europe to be exempt from the competition directives of the EU, the Deputy [Máire Geoghegan-Quinn] said on Second Stage that the European Court of Justice had recognised explicitly the need for insurance providers who are obliged to offer cover to all applicants regardless of age and health and to be able to limit their outgoings, even if this had a negative effect on their trade in goods and services.  The reference is understood to refer primarily to the Duphar case.  This is not regarded as constituting a parallel for exempting the VHI from domestic competition law, and I have a series of reasons for this. . . .</P>
    <P>First, the case was about a statutory public sickness fund, and not a private health insurance scheme.  Second, the main issue related to Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which deals with the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports between member <Col N="1071" /> states.  Third, the courts did not specifically address the Treaty articles on competition, Articles 85 and 86, as these only apply to undertakings to which a public sickness fund was not deemed to apply.</P>
    <P>The point about insurers having to make cover available, regardless of age and health status which featured in the case, is lessened under our regulatory framework, which will provide for the operation of a risk equalisation scheme.  The case was concerned with very specific cost control measures carried out on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, and not with a sweeping measure, such as the exemption of all private health insurance from the Competition Act, [1991] which the Deputy's amendment would appear to constitute.</P>
    <P>To put the matter in context, we are preparing the market in Ireland for competition, which I believe will come. We have reached agreement in Brussels for the policy as stated in the 1994 Act. We have almost completed our negotiations on the regulation which, for example, will pick up such controversial items as the level of care for psychiatric illness.  We are making progress towards enhancing the provisions under the regulations and we hope to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas in a couple of weeks to finalise matters.</P>
    <P>In general terms, competition will come and competitors will have to operate within the guidelines set down in the health insurance regulations.  This Bill, in its totality, will improve the VHI's ability to face competition.  It is another element in a series of initiatives to prepare the VHI for a more competitive market.  But in the context of policy in these Houses being to prepare VHI for competition in accordance with the EU directive, to exempt VHI from the terms of the Competition Act, 1991, or from the scope of the Competition Authority would be an adverse step.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister is making progress on the regulations on psychiatric services, in particular. I know it has been a hot issue as people had felt psychiatric services might be discriminated against in some instances.</P>
      <P>I accept to a great extent what the Minister has said with regard to competition but are we taking matters for granted as my understanding of the future of the VHI is that it will be a non-profit organisation.  Competitors who can enter the market with attractive and innovative schemes could through their ingenuity leave the VHI with only senior citizens and high risk category patients as members and thereby put the future of the VHI in jeopardy.  I say this in the context of what the Minister said earlier in the debate in so far as I know, and he confirmed here today, that the VHI has had to subsidise its running costs over the last number of years through the sale of assets.  In a competition situation, where the VHI cannot continue to sell the family silver forever, will not be in a position to introduce innovative schemes and compete with companies some of which would have massive profits, is the VHI heading down a dangerous stony road? Can the Minister see the VHI being able to survive under the type of health insurance climate before us without some sort of exemption?  That is my basic worry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his previous reply.  The VHI was not looking for a special exemption from the Competition Act, 1991, as it believed the VHI and all other insurance providers who might enter the market would also have the same exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say he did not believe the VHI would be exposed to threats of proceedings under the Competition Act, 1991, and that the Ballinderry case was a different issue. However, when the Ballinderry case was being dealt with in the courts, the judgment was given against the VHI <Col N="1073" /> because it had abused its dominant position, but I think the judgment stated that they would have had a case under the Competition Act, 1991, if they did not win the case on the basis of the dominant position.  That is why the VHI was concerned that it would be exposed to being sued under the Competition Act, 1991, in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I share concerns expressed about the VHI and much of what we are doing is in order to strengthen its position.  If one goes back to the debate on Senator Henry's earlier amendment, it is fair to say that the VHI nearly went under.  If one looks at the position in the late 1980s and the balance sheet at the time, there were huge deficits; but the company has been brought back to having an income versus expenditure balance sheet.  The VHI still needs investment income; but rather than income from the sale of assets, it is income from investments which were made in the past when the VHI was stronger.  If we have not put in place the statutory provisions in the 1994 Act and those we will be putting in place by way of health insurance regulations, the fears which people are expressing would be valid.</P>
      <P>If a UK insurance company could cherrypick the market, the VHI would not survive at all.  The cherrypicking would involve giving cheap insurance to all the low risk people and letting the VHI pick up all the high risk people.  It is absolutely essential that nobody can do that, which is why we needed a 1994 Act and why we needed to get EU agreement to the central concepts of community rating, which has been achieved.  We are going on now to ensure there will be fair competition and that the regulations will protect the position of the VHI and ensure everybody who competes with the VHI must trade on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran said that a company could come in from abroad and sell very attractive schemes.  He is right.  That is why we started restructuring the management of VHI to provide for a new <Col N="1074" /> chief executive and four managers to look after different sections of the company. The VHI must pay more attention to marketing and its financial controls, for instance.  It must begin to trade as a fully commercial company, conscious that other companies which trade under the same rules in the market may provide more attractive packages.  It must position itself for that.  This is one of the reasons that, in the context of a later section which increases the numbers on the board from five to 12, I have said that we will not make it a representative board.  We want people with commercial skills.  The VHI is not providing health care so we do not need solely doctors and medical people on the board.  It is a commercial company in the insurance business.  The rules of the insurance business and the commercial world will apply and those are the skills we need to import on to the board.</P>
    <P>There is a systematic progression to strengthen the VHI which has spanned the change of Government.  It started in the 1994 Act and continues in this Bill and the regulations.  In tandem with that process, one has the restructuring of the management in VHI.  It would be helpful to the new management structures in VHI to have a bigger board which includes skills other than those available at board level at the moment.  The five people on the board at present also have valuable skills but I simply make the point that a commercial insurance company requires certain skills at board level.  We will take this into account when appointing new members.</P>

We are long way from that situation.</P>

      <P>Over one-third of the population are VHI subscribers.  We could end up with the wrong one-third, that is, the mature one-third who make serious demands on health care.  The future of the VHI depends on the VHI attracting young people as subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>That exacerbates my worry.  The Minister says the VHI will become fully commercial and I appreciate that.  It still cannot go into a profit making situation.  Its competitors may be large financial institutions which will be able to promote attractive and innovative schemes which will gather in many subscribers and tilt the balance.  The luxury they will have is that if one of those schemes goes down, they will be able to absorb the loss.  The VHI will not have the luxury of being able to promote innovative schemes because it will not be able to take the risks.  They may take good financial management decisions but they will not be able to take the risks other financial institutions in the health insurance market will be able to take.  If they do, they may bring the whole house down around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inequality of trading to some extent and it is a worry for the VHI.  The Minister's statement indicates that he has seen at least some red flags. The public and Members of this House would not want the VHI to go under.  It has been an excellent health provider in this country and has compensated the Government approach to health through the years.  Health services would have crumbled years ago if the VHI had not provided cover for private care.  It is in all our interests to protect <Col N="1076" /> and maintain private sector health insurance.  This Bill and all other health insurance legislation should have that in mind.</P>
    <P>While I am reassured to some extent by the Minister, I have serious worries as regards the ability of the VHI to compete on a favourable basis in the health insurance market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I want the position of the VHI strengthened. We are debating the Bill because I have concerns about the VHI.  This Bill strengthens the VHI position and the regulations which we will introduce shortly will further strengthen the relative position of the VHI.  It will ensure that other companies will have to compete on a level playing field.</P>
      <P>If the VHI was trading on a fully commercial basis in accordance with its mandate and community rating, it would be in a better position to provide a service than an insurance company which is required to show a profit and pay a dividend to shareholders.  If the requirement of one company is to break even and the requirement of another company is to show a profit and pay a dividend, the company with the break even mandate, if it does its job properly, is in a better position in the market.</P>
      <P>Competition is most likely to come from United Kingdom companies, some of which have been looking at the market. Some of the biggest UK insurers are mutualities and are not, in essence, companies which are solely profit oriented. The competition therefore will not be along the lines suggested by the Senator when he spoke about large finance companies taking a risk in one sector and cross subsidising losses.  The mutualities are not solely profit driven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is cause for concern and that is why we are legislating, introducing regulations and restructuring the management of VHI.  The changes have not been concluded yet.  That is the main justification for the changes I will be making at board level.  It is in accordance with what is happening in Europe, where everything is opening up to competition. <Col N="1077" /> The VHI cannot operate isolated in a protected environment and free from the forces of competition which must be faced by every other sector in Europe.  I want to strengthen the VHI so it maintains its position as the dominant provider in Ireland because it has done a very good job.  It had its bad moments in the past but overall it has provided a great service for people.  It is because of the concerns that we are making the changes to strengthen the VHI position in advance of competition.</P>

      <P>The investment income is important to the VHI at the moment and has decreased considerably in the last few years.  Is the investment income applied to the schemes on a percentage basis?  For example, is only 3 per cent used to prop up plan E while 80 per cent goes towards any deficits in plan A and B or, alternatively, is most investment income used for the higher and more expensive, but apparently loss making, schemes?  This is important.  Senator Finneran talked about selling off the family silver.  If the investments have gone down this much, it would be a serious worry for all of us.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> According to the information I have, there is not that kind of subsidisation through the investment income.  It is simply investment income which is available and is put in to get you to the break even point.  The Senator is right, the VHI will have to match premium income with its expenditure on a break even basis.  One must take that into account together with what the Senator said on Second Stage about how expensive hi-tech medicine is becoming.  Medical inflation is running at about 8 per cent compared to the consumer price index rate of 2.25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pressures on the VHI will inevitably lead to premium increases but I will have to agree to them first.  I hope that when the VHI seeks any premium increase it will follow Senator Finneran's advice to offer more attractive packages in the market place, particularly <Col N="1078" /> for young people, and thus be in a better position to face competition. Senator Doyle is right in saying that if it becomes imbalanced and if sufficient young people are not attracted to the VHI, the whole basis of community rating becomes doubtful.  In a worst case scenario the VHI could end up with a lot of high risk people.</P>

We must make sure, however, that the investment income coming from such schemes will not be used to subsidise loss making schemes.</P>

It would be an unfortunate situation if the £10 million was only for keeping schemes D and E going.  Is the Minister in a position to provide us with that sort of information?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think what you are saying is correct, but I cannot prove it to you for the reasons Senator Finneran outlined.  Even when the VHI appeared before an Oireachtas Committee it did not seem to be able to give precise financial information which Deputies frequently requested.  It is commercially sensitive information, especially with competition coming in, and because of that the VHI is reluctant to give a demographic breakdown of subscribers to individual schemes.  If you gave too much information you would be pointing out areas that competitors <Col N="1079" /> should target.  I would like the VHI to note the views of the House that it should not use commercial arguments to avoid providing the fullest information to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>One of the most important financial issues facing the VHI, which was identified by the Kennedy review group, was that under the EU insurance directive it is required to conform to solvency margin criteria.  In 1993, £10.5 million had to be drawn down from its investment income in order to fund its operational costs.  In 1994 and 1995, the results were significantly improved by the decision of the board to release an age equalisation reserve.  But for the fact that it had that reserve, which it released quickly rather than over a number of years, the VHI would have been in trouble.</P>
      <P>A combination of measures are needed to increase the VHI's income and reduce its claims costs.  The Kennedy review group recommended a comprehensive review of its product portfolio, particularly as it will shortly face competition from Britain.  Such a review is needed in order to attract young people into the VHI.  Young people currently feel the VHI has little to offer them, yet these are the very people who need to be attracted in order to fund the sick and the elderly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 45 to 48, and in page 6 to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;under section 2, it shall notify the Minister in writing of the proposal not less than 30 days before the date on which the proposed increase is intended to have effect and, in determining the amount of the increase, shall have due regard to any representations made by the Minister to the Board during the said 30 day period.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may make regulations enabling him to issue, within 30 days of the notification of a proposed increase referred to in subsection (1), written directions to the Board requiring the Board not to implement the said increase. Any such regulations shall provide that the Minister shall, when giving a direction to the Board pursuant to the regulations, at the same time give to the Board his or her reasons in writing for the direction.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Board shall comply with a direction issued by the Minister pursuant to the regulations referred to in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(4)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of any thing previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> On this occasion the Minister has tried to address the situation but I have gone a little further.  The amendment would involve the Houses of the Oireachtas in debating proposed VHI premia increases.  It is appropriate that both Houses should have the opportunity, if they so wish, to debate any proposed increases in health insurance.</P>
    <P>The situation to date has involved an arrangement between the VHI and the Minister of the day whereby the VHI informs the Minister of a decision to increase premia.  Other than that there is no great involvement with the Minister and there is certainly no direct involvement with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the new situation it would be appropriate to discuss health insurers' applications for premia increases, not alone in the VHI's case but in others also.</P>
    <P>It would also give us the opportunity to talk about the issues we discussed in the other section &mdash; how the VHI could develop different schemes to maintain and increase its position in the health insurance market.  It would provide an ongoing forum to evaluate the performance of the VHI when it applies for an increase.  Members would then have the right to refuse applications for premia increases from the VHI or other companies on the basis that they were taking the easy option rather than trying an innovative approach with new schemes on the market.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas should have the opportunity to debate proposed increases and to reflect on the performance of the VHI and other health insurers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the VHI has a monopoly position in the health insurance business it is appropriate for its premium levels to be subject to approval by the Minister for Health. That does not need to be set in stone in the Act, it could be done by ministerial regulation.  The Kennedy review group mentioned that when competition is introduced it would not be appropriate that the VHI would be the only health insurance group which would be subject <Col N="1082" /> to ministerial approval for increases. The review group said that if and when a competitive market place starts to develop, this requirement would be inappropriate and would inhibit the ability of the VHI to operate commercially. Why has the Minister inserted this provision?</P>
      <P>The VHI will be the only insurance operator, in the health or any other sector, whose premiums would be controlled by the Minister.  That is acceptable at present because it is in a dominant position, but if other insurance companies come here to compete for the same market how will the VHI operate commercially?  In any case, when the VHI faces competition, that in itself will impose control on the premiums it will be able to charge.  If the VHI continues to raise its premiums and other competitors offer better packages, then it will not get the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Before I comment on the amendment, the provision being sought under section 3 places an obligation on the board to give notification of proposed premium increases to the Minister and allows for each such increase to take effect automatically unless the Minister issues a reasoned direction against implementing it.  The present position is that the board of the VHI must inform the Minister that it intends to raise premiums, to reconstruct packages or to charge more for them, although he can do nothing about it.  I and my predecessors had to take political responsibility after having been informed of increases, although we were not able to do anything about them.  That is not a good situation.</P>
      <P>The power being sought is not being vested in the Minister as the political head of the Department but as the 100 per cent shareholder in the VHI.  Shareholders have rights.  While the board of the VHI runs the company, the Minister is the shareholder.  There is validity in the shareholder having such a function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> We have introduced this in a straightforward manner.  The company notifies the Minster for Health of premium increases.  If the Minister for Health does not act, then the premium increases come in automatically after 30 days.  That protects the commerciality of the enterprise.  We have seen over the years where State companies were subject to political rather than commercial decision making.  If the political side second guesses the commercial side, difficulties can arise &mdash; this happened in a number of State companies in the past.</P>
    <P>Under the subsection (1) (a) the board is obliged to inform the Minister of any proposed increase in premiums at least 30 days before such increases are to have effect.  I believe this is reasonable in view of the need to have applications analysed by the Department of Health in sufficient detail. Under subsection (1) (b) the board may implement any increase notified to the Minister after the period of 30 days has elapsed unless before the expiry of the period the Minister has directed in writing that this should not be done.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) imposes a duty on the Minister to give the board his or her reasons for directing that an increase should not be implemented.  This will be done at the same time as giving the direction.  Subsection (3) stipulates that the board must comply with the direction of the Minister under the section and must, therefore, not proceed to implement the increase or increases in question.  This is reasonable in view of the fact that we want to maintain a strong public-private mix among the 33 per cent of our population who are VHI subscribers.  At present the Minister needs this control over increases in premiums.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there will be increases in premiums and a Minister who does not intervene may be under political pressure to do so.  If we adopted the approach proposed by Senator Finneran that the Minister would have a regulatory power as regards this section and that regulations <Col N="1084" /> would need to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate, then the political side would be second guessing the commercial side.  Members of the Seanad or the Dáil would be subject to pressure from constituents who are VHI subscribers and who do not want to pay an increase, although they may be putting the company at risk.  We must strike a balance.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of this amendment because the provision in the section is very straightforward and we do not need to proceed by way of regulation, as the Senator suggested.  Regardless of whether the Minister did or did not intervene, if a VHI increase was signalled, there would be no problem with this or the other House discussing the issue on a motion.  However, I do not want to establish a situation where the sanction for a price increase, which is totally in the hands of the VHI at present, would not only move to the Minister but to the Houses of the Oireachtas and that the VHI could not increase premiums unless they were sanctioned by the Oireachtas.  This would be very cumbersome and would put its competitive position at risk since this would only apply to the VHI and not to other companies.  Because it would take more than 30 days, the VHI could be at a disadvantage in relation to its competitors.</P>
    <P>If the VHI is further restructured, this section would need to be removed at a future date.  I want to increase the board from five to 12 and to bring in marketing, accounting and actuarial people &mdash; a mix of commercial and business skills which need to be added to the board's existing skills.  I will take the advice of the new board on how to proceed.</P>
    <P>The report on the VHI to which Senator Honan referred on a number of occasions suggested that we should reorganise the VHI on the same basis as Telecom Éireann or An Post so that it would move towards independent semi-State commercial status where it would control its decisions.  In the same way as charges in other sectors do not always need to be sanctioned by the Minister, <Col N="1085" /> once that restructuring takes place this provision would need to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The VHI may continue to be in dominant position in the market and one of my successors may decide they want to retain the power to control premium increases and that they would only occur with the permission of the Minister. However, if there was competition in the market at that stage, then it would be the control mechanism, and a company which was out of line would lose business.  That is how I see things progressing in the future.  This is an interim measure to strengthen the VHI's position as it approaches competition.  I do not know the degree of competition in two years time, but there will be some.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in the future this section may need to be removed &mdash; I do not dispute that.  I propose that the Minister take advice from the Houses of the Oireachtas as well as departmental officials.  While I appreciate that Members would be under pressure to vote in a particular way, I have no doubt the Minister would be under the same pressure from his parliamentary party or partners in Government.  I do not see that as an argument in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas are involved.  The Minister said that we would have the opportunity to discuss this in a motion, but why not do so by way of legislation?  Since the Oireachtas must enact the legislation, why not enact legislation upon which its Members can ponder as the opportunity presents itself?  The opportunity will be presented in the event of the Voluntary Health Insurance applying for an increase in premia.  That would be a real opportunity for Members of the Oireachtas to look at the performance of the VHI, how it had adapted to the competitive market and how it had fared against its competitors.  If it is the wisdom of the Houses that the VHI had not pursued its commercial objectives with the right schemes, Members of the Oireachtas would have the chance, if not to pass judgment, at least to prompt <Col N="1086" /> the VHI in a certain direction and, perhaps, give it food for thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As a general principle it is an interference in the commercial decisions of a body such as the VHI for a Minister to have this power.  I cannot argue in favour of the principle because politicians, generally, have a bad record of running commercial companies in the public sector.  That is a given.  Once the decision goes into the political domain, the decision is made on political grounds rather than commercial grounds.</P>
      <P>The Senator might ask if that is the principle, why am I inserting this section in the Bill?  There are two reasons.  First, as the VHI changes, the Minister for Health as shareholder should have a role to ensure that the VHI is making decisions which secure its future. Second, the Minister as the political head of the Department has a role to ensure that the rights of consumers are protected, particularly when our policy is to continue to have a public/private mix in the health services and where one in three persons in the country is a VHI subscriber.  I can justify that departure from the principle but not to the degree of making it a decision of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would be too cumbersome and is too direct an intervention by the political sphere into the commercial decision making of a body such as the VHI.  That is why I am reluctant to accept the amendment as drafted.</P>
      <P>However, I agree with many of the Senator's arguments.  I have no doubt that if there is a serious increase in VHI premia next year and if I do not prevent it, I will be in one or both Houses to explain both myself and the VHI on foot of a motion put down by one of the Members.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 11, to delete &ldquo;2&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The constitution of the board of the VHI, which is being increased from five members to 12, is a matter best left to the Minister's discretion and it should not be addressed specifically in the legislation.  It also appears strange that the only restriction on board representation should apply to health service providers.</P>
      <P>At present, there are two health service providers on the board.  The Minister said earlier that the VHI is in the business of providing health insurance. However, the VHI is the primary source of funding for private health service providers so limiting the numbers to two out of 12 is inappropriate.  Health care providers are operating at the coalface in the delivery of these services.  They are in a unique position and they have relevant experience and input in the system. The Minister, in limiting their representation on the board of the VHI, is not adequately reflecting the importance of the expertise and practical knowledge they can bring to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the skills base of the board must be widened. People with actuarial, financial and marketing skills are necessary for the board.  However, it is strange that it will not be at this or any future Minister's discretion to decide how many of each category should be on the board. <Col N="1088" /> The Blood Transfusion Service Board did not have much medical expertise and we saw the problem that arose with that board and the hepatitis C scandal. When that board was criticised by both the Hederman-O'Brien report and the Bain report, which was carried out by consultants called in to investigate the report, the Minister reacted by appointing Professor Shaun McCann and other medical personnel to the board.  That board suffered because of its lack of health service providers or medical experts and the Minister addressed this quite properly by appointing those experts.  Now there are two health service providers &mdash; two doctors &mdash; on the board and recently a medical director was appointed.  That, it is generally acknowledged, has transformed the board as well as the appointment of a new chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>Limiting the number of health service providers to two on a board which has been increased to 12 members is not right.  That discretion should be left to the Minister and he or she should decide the appropriate number.  It is not necessary to state it in the legislation. My amendment seeks to increase the number to four, although I would be happy to leave the number of health service providers to be appointed to the board to the Minister's discretion.  We are making a mistake in the legislation as drafted.  I hope we have learned lessons from the past and particularly from the experience of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the Minister is anxious to increase the number on the board from five to 12.  The board of the VHI must be commercial and compete with other commercial bodies.  The board must have members with actuarial, financial and marketing experience.  It is important that the board be strengthened and that is one of the purposes of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to speak about the health boards with which we are all familiar. These boards consist of people who represent the different professions &mdash;<Col N="1089" /> nurses, doctors, dentists, psychiatrists, etc.  They are there in a representative capacity; they are elected to serve on the boards by their groups.  I doubt that the Minister wishes the health service providers on the VHI board to represent their professions but to use their expertise to make the VHI more competitive and competent.  For that reason I oppose Senator Honan's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister on Second Stage paid tribute to the two health service providers on the board of the VHI because they always put the VHI before their own interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally my professional hackles were raised when I saw this as I thought it was getting rid of the medical profession.  Then I saw that it was removing more people.  &ldquo;Health service provider&rdquo; is a broad term and, while I am sure the Minister is right in extending the size of the board and seeking experts with marketing and actuarial skills, health insurance is not quite the same as other forms of insurance.  It would be a good idea if there was no limit on the number of people who were on the board.  After all, the effects of the schemes may not be fully recognised by those working outside the health service; by this I mean people who are working in administration within the health service as well as people who are providing hands-on medical care.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has tied himself to just two persons who are health service providers because under the definition of the term &ldquo;health service provider&rdquo; in the Bill, a large number of people will be excluded.  I agree with Senator Doyle that it is incorrect to appoint people to the board whose aim is to represent their own interest groups.  On the other hand, it could be very useful to appoint individuals with practical experience who could state what would be the effects of mandatory day care or encouraging doctors to prescribe generic drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has limited his choice in view of the fact that the definition <Col N="1090" /> of it is so broad.  If this had involved the medical profession alone, I could have understood his action.  The Minister has paid tribute to the people already serving on the board and the appointment of a medical director represents a great improvement.</P>

      <P>In practice, these eminent people bring quite an amount of professional expertise to some debates.

      <P>I do not want a situation to develop in the VHI where I or anyone else is subject to continuous lobbying to make it a representative board.  If I do not have such control and, say, the IMO or the Irish Hospital Consultants Association seeks equal representation &mdash; and the IMO has a number of competitors who will also seek representation &mdash; someone might then ask for a nurse to serve on the board.  There are four nursing organisations and if I appointed a representative from the Irish Nurses Organisation, SIPTU would seek equal representation.  I would then be asked why a chief executive officer from one of the health boards could not be appointed.  The health boards have great experience and they purchase many services from the VHI.  I have already been approached with regard to representation on behalf of the staff of the VHI who feel that their interests should be protected at board level.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to introduce new expertise to a company which will be obliged to trade commercially and face much competition in the future.  To provide in law that two of the people on the board be health service providers is a good control mechanism.  This will be the intention of future Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are familiar with the system and will be aware that I have received many representations from colleagues in Government parties and friends in other parties.  I have been given the CVs of some excellent people with cover notes attached to state that the individuals in question would be exceptional in discharging their functions on a suitable State board.  I do not doubt that these people are very capable.  If there is an open door policy, however, a process of lobbying will begin and we will not get the type of board envisaged for the VHI.  The number of people serving on the board must be limited to 12 for the same reason.  If it is at the Minister's discretion to appoint 15 people rather than 12, the momentum of the lobbying <Col N="1092" /> system will drive towards the higher number.  I do not believe that this would be right either.</P>
    <P>The present members of the board include its chairman, Mr. Noel Hanlon, with whom Members will be familiar. Mr. Hanlon is also chairman of Aer Rianta.  The two medical consultants on the board are Mr. Michael O'Keeffe, the brother of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and Mr. John Keane.  The remaining members are Ms Susan Kelly, a tax lawyer, the daughter of a late former Member of the Houses, and Maureen Lynott, a former VHI executive, who brings to the board her experience of working in the organisation.  There are a range of useful skills in place at present. However, I would want to add to them by not duplicating existing skills so that the board will be more commercially oriented in dealing with the issues discussed in the context of earlier amendments to, and sections of, the Bill.</P>

My anxiety relates to the fact that some of our expertise might be excluded by the Minister providing for two health care providers when the definition of that term is so broad.  I accept that the Minister has been badly stung in the past by representations from colleagues.  I am glad the membership of the board has been increased.  However, I am dismayed that the Minister is imposing an exclusion on that large group.  At first I thought only the medical profession would be affected but now I see that the scope is much broader and I am sorry about that, but obvioulsy the Minister had his own troubles with regard to this in the past.</P>

      <P>It would be preferable if the constitution of the membership of the board was left to the Minister's discretion.  I sought provision for four health service providers because the Bill only provides for the appointment of <Col N="1093" /> two.  This is the only group subject to such a limit.  I am not asking that the membership of the board be increased to 15; I merely request that the Minister retain discretion to appoint whomever he wishes within the specified membership of 12 and is not restricted to limiting the number of health service providers to two.  That is my preferred option and is the subject of the amendment. As Senator Henry stated, this does not involve medics but all health care providers.</P>
      <P>The VHI's business is to provide insurance.  If that business was limited to providing insurance, the Department of Enterprise and Employment would be responsible for its regulation.  It is not, however, simply an insurance business, it is a health insurance business.  At present, the VHI is the only health insurance company operating in the State and provides services to 1.3 million people.  The expertise of health service providers is very relevant to the working of the board.</P>
      <P>The board of the Blood Transfusion Service did not have relevant medical expertise at its disposal, and we are aware of the scandal and difficulties that developed in that case.  Such difficulties were addressed by appointing people with medical expertise to that board.  I am not seeking the appointment of two doctors to the board.  However, it should be left to the Minister's discretion to appoint to the board the number of health service providers he believes are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want any category to enjoy a particular numerical representation on the board.  It would not be right to appoint four doctors to the board. Appointments should be at the Minister's discretion and should not be limited by legislation.  There is no provision in the Bill which states that only two actuaries or marketing experts should serve on the board.  Effectively, there could be ten marketing experts on the board and only two health service providers. It is unlikely that this will happen but the Bill does not restrict representation <Col N="1094" /> from any group except that of health service providers.  This is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to second guess what will happen with regard to the reconstituted board of the VHI.  To date, the VHI has enjoyed a monopoly.  The issue of whether the board had to seriously consider the organisation's position did not arise, except when it incurred debts.  Apart from that, they had to continue to provide a service and keep their heads above water.  This will go under new legislation required by EU competition law.</P>
      <P>As a member of a health board in the past I have often seen situations arise between budgets where the most laudable proposals and schemes have received the support of everybody, including medics, councillors, Deputies and some ex Ministers.  Unfortunately, it is a different story when it comes to belling the cat; everybody protects their own patch.  Health boards have become a geographical rat race, with people protecting services in their own county to the exclusion of other counties.  This was the case in my county in the past and we have since borne the brunt of its consequences.</P>
      <P>We must give the VHI a free hand to a great extent, otherwise it will not survive.  Reference was made to the danger it is in and concern was expressed that it may not survive increased competition when other financial institutions from the UK, Europe and elsewhere will enter the Irish market with innovative schemes.  They may have far more dry cash and be in a position to take better risks than the VHI, leaving it to deal with schemes in a burdensome part of the market.  This could lead to its collapse.  We do not want this to happen and I am prepared to give the VHI every chance.  Good financial decisions and marketing will be the hallmarks if the VHI is to survive in this new market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of expertise to which Senator Henry referred is very important.  Health care provider expertise <Col N="1095" /> must be included and while it is available in the insurance market, it is not available in the health care sector. Given this, there must be a balance and we must know what is happening on a national basis.  Private health insurance must cover the medical situations to be dealt with; otherwise it is pointless to have health insurance if it does not respond to medical requirements.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that we have public health care and private health care running in parallel.  Both are trying to achieve the same goal, which is care for those who are ill.  One must make a profit or break even to do this, the other is backed up by the taxpayer. In view of this, good financial management and marketing will be the hallmark of the VHI if it is to survive.  There is much merit in the views expressed by Senator Honan and Senator Henry and I do not agree with the view that those who speak with a background in health do so in a sectional way.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> With regard to the membership of the board of the VHI in the future, given that there are only five members whose names I have put on the record, I should not let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the work they have done. They have acted well in a difficult situation. They have not acted in a representational way or in a way that represents any specific interest, rather they have acted in the interests of the VHI and have brought a mix of skills to bear on this.  I indicated the professions of those involved and Senators will note the skills that are being utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expertise of service providers are relevant to the working of the VHI. However, if the wider commercial mandate of the VHI is considered, its primary role is that of an insurance company. I wish to see a mix of skills, such as marketing, sales, banking, insurance, accounting, actuarial, because it would benefit the VHI if they were brought on board.  Consumers' interests must also be represented.  There is room for the <Col N="1096" /> man or woman on the street who would introduce to the board the expertise of those who have to write the cheques to ensure that families are covered for insurance.</P>
    <P>I am not acting in a manner which reflects on service providers or those involved in the medical profession etc. However, I wish to confine it because, for example, it is not a parallel argument to question why there was not a provision stipulating that there could only be two accountants.  I did not make such a provision because I am not going to be lobbied by accountancy people to do so.  However, I have no doubt that I will be lobbied on behalf of medical personnel and individual providers.</P>
    <P>The pressure on the Minister of the day will be to put more and more service providers on the board.  This is why I am putting a limit to it in the section. With the best will in the world, especially in coalition Government when partners must be accommodated in addition to one's own party, one could end up with a large group of very interesting people; but will all of them bringing the same mix of skills to the deliberations of the board?  I want it to be wider, and it is the only agenda I am following.</P>
    <P>With regard to the parallel with the health boards, Senators who have served on such boards will fully understand me here.  It is not always true that the expert is the best person in situations such as this, because there is a wider, democratic function also.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> In page 7, before section 7, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7. &mdash; (1)  Not later than the 31st day of March, 1996, there shall be established by the Government, on the request of the Minister, a body to become known as the Voluntary Health Insurance Users' Commission and which is in this Act referred to as &lsquo;the Commission&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Commission shall consist of a chairman and not less than seven other members who shall be appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>(3)  When appointing a member of the Commission, the Government shall fix his/her term of office which shall not exceed five years and, subject to subsections (7) and (8) of this section, he/she shall hold office on such terms and conditions (other than terms or conditions relating to remuneration or the payment of allowances) as are determined by the Government at the time of appointment.</P>
    <P>(4)  A member of the Commission may at any time resign office by letter addressed to the Government and the resignation shall take effect as on and from the date of receipt of the letter by the Government.</P>
    <P>(5)  A member of the Commission whose term of office expires by the effluxion of time shall be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    <P>(6)  There shall be paid by the Board to members of the Commission such remuneration (if any) and allowances (if any) as the Board, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determines.</P>
    <P>(7)  A member of the Commission may be removed from office by the Government for stated reasons, if, and only if, resolutions are passed by each House of <Col N="1098" /> the Oireachtas calling for his/her removal.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where a member of the Commission is nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas, he/she shall, upon accepting such nomination, cease to be a member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>(9)  (a)  A person who is for the time being entitled under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas to sit therein shall, while so entitled, be disqualified from becoming a member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>(b)  A member of the Board of the VHI or an officer or servant of the Board shall be disqualified from becoming or being a member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>(10)  The quorum for a meeting of the Commission shall be four or such higher number as the Commission may, if it thinks fit, from time to time, by resolution determine.</P>
    <P>(11)  Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Commission shall regulate its procedure and business.</P>
    <P>(12)  The Commission may investigate and decide complaints made by subscribers of the Voluntary Health Insurance about services, operations or customer relations. The Commission may also investigate matters in relation to existing and proposed health insurance schemes and health-related insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>(13)  A complaint described in subsection (12) of this section may be made to the Commission by any VHI subscriber in writing.</P>
    <P>(14)  When the Commission proposes to investigate a complaint made under this section, the Commission shall afford the Board an opportunity to comment on the complaint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> (15)  As soon as may be after they decide on a complaint made under this section, the Commission shall send to the person making the complaint and to the Board a statement in writing of their decision on the complaint.</P>
    <P>(16)  When the Board receives a statement of a decision from the Commission in relation to a complaint, the Board shall, not later than fourteen days after its receipt, inform the Commission in writing whether or not the Commission's decision is accepted by the Board.</P>
    <P>(17)  The consideration by the Commission of a complaint made to it under this section shall be carried out in private.</P>
    <P>(18)  Unless it considers it inappropriate, the Commission shall, as soon as may be, publish particulars of its decisions on a complaint in such manner as it considers suitable and where it considers that the publication should be by the Board, or should include publication by the Board, the particulars shall be published by the Board in such manner as shall be agreed between the Commission and the Board.</P>
    <P>(19)  This section shall not apply to a complaint which, in the opinion of the Commission is frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    <P>(20)  As soon as may be after the end of each year, the Commission shall make to the Minister a report of its activities during that year.  It shall also make interim reports on general matters in relation to existing and proposed health insurance schemes and health-related insurance schemes.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is very important that there be an independent body to deal with complaints that may arise from the public. This is the intention of the amendment. The body will be known as the Voluntary Health Insurance Users' Commission. <Col N="1100" /> It will provide an essential service to subscribers, allowing them to take complaints to an independent body.  The VHI has moved towards a complaints structure, but it is not independent; it is an in-house structure and is not in a position to take matters to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>At present the only opportunity available to a VHI subscriber to bring finality to a complaint is to take legal proceedings.  There should not be an onus on a subscriber to a company which is 100 per cent owned by the Minister to take legal proceedings to establish whether a complaint made against that company is right or wrong. There is a great wish among the public and subscribers to the VHI that a users' commission should be in place to deal in an independent fashion with complaints made by people who feel aggrieved and that they have a case to make.  It is not asking too much of the Minister to establish such a structure in a company fully owned by him.  We have a responsibility to subscribers to the VHI.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way taking from the VHI's position.  I have subscribed to it for most of my adult life and so has my family.  I availed of its services on only one occasion when I was treated for an eye infection on an out patient basis. Some people do not have to make claims to the VHI for hospital treatment; this is their luck.  Everybody believes, as I do, that people's health is to a great extent their wealth.  There should be a proper independent structure to deal with cases where the VHI is not prepared to cover, in full or in part, people's medical bills.</P>
    <P>My amendment is practical and necessary.  It affords the Minister the opportunity to say to the VHI that although he has no complaint against it and does not believe it has acted in bad faith in the past or has let him down, he believes that in the interests of the public and subscribers there should be a proper structure in place.  If he responds positively to my proposal to establish such a body, he will gain great public credit.  There are complaints procedures <Col N="1101" /> in other commercial State bodies.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission investigates complaints against RTE and the Garda Complaints Board investigates complaints against the Garda Síochána.  This amendment is a golden opportunity for the Minister to ensure members of the public are protected by an independent users' commission which would give them independent evaluation of any claims in dispute between them and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Senator Finneran has proposed that the Bill provide for the establishment of a statutory body to be known as the VHI Users' Commission.  Under the amendment the commission is intended to investigate and decide on subscribers' complaints about services, operations and customer relations.  It is also proposed that the commission could investigate matters which are not specified relating to existing or proposed insurance schemes of the board.  The amendment does not provide that the VHI board must accept the findings or recommendations of the commission.</P>
      <P>The amendment envisages a Government appointed commission of not less than eight persons.  It provides for any payments of remuneration and expenses to members of the commission to be charged on the VHI but it makes no provision for the assignment of officers and servants to enable the body to perform its functions.  Therefore a critical question which arises for answer is: who will provide the funds to establish and run such a body?  Subsection (1) of the amendment prescribes that the commission shall be appointed by the Government.  This would appear to comprehend an obligation on the Government to provide staff and other resources to comply with the provision under law.  The text of the amendment should deal specifically with this matter. Accordingly, I consider it to be incomplete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be procedural reasons for this because it is not possible to have an <Col N="1102" /> amendment accepted in the Seanad if it proposes a charge on the Revenue.  The necessary financial underpinning is probably not included in the amendment because it would have been ruled out of order if the Senator has proceeded on that basis.  If I understand it correctly, this amendment is not complete and there is a financial consideration which the Senator cannot put on the table because of the procedures of the House.</P>
    <P>The 1994 report of the insurance ombudsman stated that the operational cost of her office and the insurance ombudsman's council amounted to £190,000 in that year.  This gives an idea of the cost which could be involved in the running of an independent complaints body.  The initial outlay would involve additional start up costs associated with equipment, accommodation, publications and so on.</P>
    <P>The imposition of a further charge on the VHI would not be sustainable in view of the steps it has already taken to resource the operation of a members' advisory council and because it already subscribes to the insurance ombudsman scheme.  Furthermore, the Health Insurance Act, 1994, provides that if and when market circumstances warrant, the establishment of a health insurance authority to operate a scheme of risk equalisation in support of the system of community rating will be financed by a levy on registered insurance undertakings. Therefore, the VHI will be subject to the levy.</P>
    <P>To put this kind of independent complaints procedure in place would cost a great deal of money and it would not be fair to ask the taxpayer to pick up the bill for this.  If we were to go along that road, it would be appropriate for the charge to be met by the VHI.  However, it is already contributing to the insurance ombudsman scheme by way of levy and it has set up a members' advisory council which has cost implications. I foresee the establishment of a health insurance authority to carry out the functions I indicated and this will involve another charge on the VHI.  It <Col N="1103" /> would be too onerous to put another complaints procedure in place for which the VHI should pick up the bills.</P>
    <P>The insurance ombudsman scheme is in place and the holder of the office acts independently and is an excellent arbiter. The VHI is part of this scheme.  The terms of reference of the insurance ombudsman provide that she receives references in relation to complaints, disputes, claims made in connection with or arising out of policies or insurance effected or proposed to be effected with members of the scheme.  Approximately 50 insurance companies participate in the scheme.  VHI members are on an equal footing with the generality of insured persons as regards access to independent redress for their grievances.</P>
    <P>The insurance ombudsman is able to assist by conciliating between injured persons and the insurance undertaking and by adjudicating on matters in dispute. It is particularly noteworthy that the undertakings who are members of the scheme have agreed to be bound by the insurance ombudsman's decision. The policy holder is free to accept or reject the decision and can take legal proceedings if not satisfied.  The insurance ombudsman publishes an annual report which ensures that there is transparency, which is a necessary element of such a system.  Accordingly, there is already in existence an effective agency which has the qualities of professionalism, independence and transparency for dealing with the grievances of the VHI members as these relate to the application of the terms and conditions of their policies.</P>
    <P>Under the VHI rules, which are made available to all policyholders, it provides that any difference of opinion between the board and a subscriber may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Irish law.  This provides a further avenue through which the settlement of disputes can be pursued.</P>
    <P>Conscious of what had been said in debates in the Oireachtas about the need to protect the subscribers' position, <Col N="1104" /> the VHI has set up a members' advisory council.  This is an important body.  It held its inaugural meeting on 19 January under the chairmanship of Mr. Finbarr Flood of the Labour Court and it has 12 ordinary members drawn from different backgrounds.  The VHI is not represented on the council.  The council's terms of reference are to review all communications between the VHI and its members, including product terms, and to suggest ways in which they can be improved; to propose codes of good practice in relation to all aspects of the VHI's business, including the standards of service required for hospitals and doctors; and to review such other aspects of the VHI's operations as are considered appropriate from time to time.  It is envisaged by the board that the terms of reference will be reviewed by the council in the light of experience.  Accordingly, the council has been given a wide remit with provision to further define its terms of reference and this is welcome.</P>
    <P>There are three mechanisms in place at present.  The first is the insurance ombudsman, who is an &ldquo;ombuds-woman&rdquo; at present, who is doing a good job.  There are 50 insurance companies which come within the scheme and it provides one avenue of redress for the VHI members.  The second is that under the rules of the VHI there is an arbitration system in accordance with Irish law which can be triggered if a subscriber is dissatisfied with a bill, for example.  The third is the members' advisory council.  In January this year the advisory council held its first meeting. We should wait to see how it operates. I believe it will be good.  However, I do not think it would be proper to put in place an independent complaints procedure when, in effect, the advisory council only held its first meeting in January. It is untried but I put confidence in it because of those involved.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendment.  Perhaps before the end of my term as Minister for Health I will return to the House on this issue.  Indeed, one of my successors may <Col N="1105" /> return to the wider issue of the VHI's future structure.  If the measures which have been put in place prove inadequate there may be merit in taking the course suggested by Senator Finneran.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of supports for the VHI subscribers, although I do not agree with a commission.  The previous section, which broadens the membership of the board and takes on members from a wider background, is vitally important.  I was delighted to hear the Minister make a comparison with the structure in the health boards. Great work can be done, but people who have a broader perspective must be involved.</P>
      <P>At present if a person goes to hospital and is seeing a consultant privately they must opt for private hospital care.  Many people who do not have a large income believe they would not have hospital cover for the bed or the consultant unless they have VHI cover.  Many people subscribe to the VHI for this reason.  It is important that the structure of the VHI is broadened and representative, and that is provided for adequately in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit of Senator Finneran's amendment is right in that it is important for consumers that an overview is taken of the VHI insurance scheme.  The Minister makes a strong case in saying that the medical advisory group has only just been set up, the insurance ombudsman is a recent innovation and it would be worthwhile to let some time pass to see how they operate before we decide to set up a commission which could be quite expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put forward arguments to counteract the intention of my amendment.  Public opinion is that the VHI acts as judge and jury and this state of affairs will become more pronounced when it has to operate in a commercial, competitive environment and has to watch every penny.  Cases that might not at present be disputed by the VHI may be disputed <Col N="1106" /> in future because the VHI will be bound by national and EU law to operate in a competitive market.  There will be far more complaints in the new circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that we have a users' commission.  The VHI's move to set up the in-house advisory council was designed to counteract the public's feeling that there should be a users' commission. It is a pre-emptive strike on the part of the VHI.  The insurance ombudsman is not as powerful a mechanism as the Minister might have us believe. There are VHI subscribers who are not aware of the possibility of taking a case to the insurance ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right that my amendment had to be tailored in order to be moved because there would be financial considerations involved.  The amendment would not have gone further than the Clerk's office had it not been tailored because it would have been adjudged to impose a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Implicit in the amendment is the opportunity for the VHI to partially finance a users' commission.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  Why would the VHI not want to subscribe to a body which would act on behalf of its members?  There should be a statutory body to independently assess complaints by members of the VHI.  This would give people an opportunity to voice their complaints.  The VHI would have to check each claim carefully and it would be loathe to make payments. The only adequate protection its subscribers can have is a users commission with statutory powers to independently evaluate claims.  Over one million members pay £1,000 a year for health insurance and they should have the protection of an independent evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This commission would not cost a lot of money.  It would be a good idea, because the VHI would not take chances on refusing payments and therefore there would be few complaints before it.  This commission is <Col N="1107" /> essential for the 1.3 million people who are members of the VHI.  We have a duty to ensure that a company which is owned by the State has a proper statutory structure to deal with complaints.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment because there is a need for such a commission.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is merit in Senator Finneran's arguments. If the VHI users' advisory council was not in place, I would introduce similar amendments.  I agree with the Senator that it was put in place after consultation between the VHI and the Department of Health and in response to anxieties expressed by subscribers. However, I do not think it was a pre-emptive <Col N="1108" /> strike.  The situation was evaluated and the consensus was that the problem would be best met by this type of council.  The VHI is not represented on the board of 12 people, which is chaired by Mr. Finbar Flood, who has significant conciliation experience from his role at the Labour Court.  It only met for the first time in January this year, so we should wait to see how it works &mdash; I believe it will work.  There would be unjustifiable duplication which would cost money if we proceeded along the lines suggested by Senator Finneran.</P>

As I said, not only am I a subscriber and a consumer of the company, I also derive the main part of my income from it, so it is important to me that everything in the Bill works well.  I am sure the VHI was quite happy when I was elected to this House; it helped the company's financial situation in that I now spend two-thirds of my time here rather than spending all my time drawing money down from it.</P>

We all realise the importance of the VHI, particularly now that it faces competition.  We must maintain a viable private health care service and at present the VHI is the only insurance company providing such care.  It serves 1.3 million people, a significant sector.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be in the Seanad to give Members an insight into what has been happening in relation to yesterday's communiqué on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the Joint Declaration, which was agreed 26 months ago, the two Governments stated that it was their aim &ldquo;to foster agreement and reconciliation, leading to a new political framework founded on consent and encompassing arrangements within Northern Ireland, for the whole island, and between these islands.&rdquo;  A little over a year ago in the Framework Document, we agreed that a vital dimension of this process was &ldquo;the search, through dialogue with the relevant Northern Ireland parties, for new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships&rdquo;; and we said we were conscious of the &ldquo;widespread desire, throughout both islands and more widely, to see negotiations under way as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been a matter of frustration and disappointment that it has taken so long for these negotiations to get underway. The long stalemate has been costly in terms of our hopes for peace and agreement, but nevertheless we are insistent that we must press ahead to the negotiating table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Negotiations are not an optional extra or a favour to be granted or withheld. They are essential.  The issues which they must address are profound and difficult. In essence, they will seek to answer the question: is it possible for the people of Northern Ireland, the people of the island as a whole and the people of these islands to find an agreed way to live and work together?  In looking for the answer, we must be guided by the core values of consent and parity of esteem.  The shared commitment of both Governments to these fundamental principles, as set out in the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document, was clearly reaffirmed yesterday.  We also reiterated our determination to secure the earliest and most inclusive possible negotiations to address comprehensively all the relevant relationships and issues in an interlocking three stranded process. Yesterday, the two Governments mapped out the route to those negotiations and made a joint commitment to a fixed and specific date for negotiations.</P>
    <P>There will be intensive multilateral consultations between the two Governments and the parties from next Monday, 4 March, until 13 March.  This stage will be launched by Sir Patrick Mayhew and myself when we meet in Belfast on Monday to work out in more detail the structure and precise timetable for those consultations.  The consultations are to seek widespread agreement on a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly and without preconditions to all party negotiations.  They will also aim to reach agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda of substantive all party negotiations.  They will also consider whether there might be advantage in holding a referendum in Northern Ireland with a parallel referendum held by the Government in this jurisdiction on the same day, to mandate support for a process to create lasting stability based on the repudiation of violence for any political purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The two Governments will then review the outcome of these consultations and will, in accordance with our respective responsibilities, take the necessary decisions.  Legislation for an elective process will then be brought forward at Westminster by the British Government.  Decisions will be announced as appropriate on arrangements for the negotiations, which will begin on 10 June, the earliest attainable date once allowance was made for an elective process.</P>
    <P>In short, the two Governments have supplied what was previously absent from the peace process: a fixed and unchangeable date for the start of all party negotiations, and a clear and rigorously timetabled course to that destination.</P>
    <P>The two Governments will continue to work together in partnership to fulfil our obligations to the peoples of both islands.  In the short and medium term, many important decisions will fall to us to be taken.  We are committed to achieving the most widespread agreement possible with the parties on the details which remain unresolved, but in the final analysis we appreciate it is we who will have to come to settled judgments on many matters.  We share an unshakeable determination that the fixed date of 10 June for the start of negotiations will be met and will take whatever actions are required to ensure this is achieved.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, while the co-operation of the two Governments is a necessary condition for progress, it is not of itself sufficient for the negotiations to succeed once they have started.  An equally heavy obligation rests on the Northern parties, whose obligations extend not merely to those whom they represent, but to the people of Ireland and Britain as a whole.</P>
    <P>Today there is a particular focus on the future intentions and actions of Sinn Féin and the republican movement as a whole.  Both Governments want Sinn Féin to play a full part in the political process and in future negotiations.  We know that it has made a leading contribution <Col N="1113" /> to the development of the peace process and that without its inclusion in negotiations, the task of achieving real stability and an agreement to which all can subscribe will be rendered extraordinarily problematic, though come what may, we are determined to carry on working for peace.</P>
    <P>Equally, however, we have made it clear that violence and politics are polar opposites.  For reasons which we have made abundantly clear on several occasions since the ending of the IRA ceasefire on 9 February, neither Government is prepared to resume full political contact with Sinn Féin until there is a total resumption of that cessation. Consequently, Sinn Féin would not be able to take its place at the negotiating table on 10 June, which would be profoundly regrettable, not just for it and its supporters but for all of us.  On the other hand, the restoration of the ceasefire now would make it possible for us to go back to work with them from next Monday onwards.</P>
    <P>The IRA sought to justify its unjustifiable return to violence by reference to the failure to initiate negotiations.  Leading members of Sinn Féin have spoken of the need for a fixed date for those negotiations and evidence of a fresh dynamic in the peace process.  There now exists such a fixed date.  There is now a new dynamic.  It is time for Sinn Féin to return to the IRA and to use the full extent of its influence to draw the inescapable inferences from these developments: that, even in terms of the IRA's own logic, a logic which to the rest of us can seem deeply illogical, there is no reason for it not right away to reinstate its ceasefire.  It would be the most tragic and futile of losses if even a single other person were to be killed or injured because of a failure to take that decision or of any delay in so deciding.</P>
    <P>The friends of Ireland throughout the world are closely following these latest developments in our peace process. President Clinton last night welcomed the announcement of a path to negotiations for a just and lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.  He went on to call <Col N="1114" /> on those who have resorted to violence to heed the voice of the people and cease their campaign of terror.  The republican movement finds itself at a fork in the road.  Does it abandon violence once and for all and proceed along that path to negotiations, or does it take a wrong turning and carry on with its campaign of terror?  The choice is stark: the right and honourable course is clear. If the IRA chooses not to renew its ceasefire, then all those who have worked incessantly and taken grave risks to assist Sinn Féin take the right road will draw their own grim conclusions about the quality of the republican commitment to peace.</P>
    <P>If negotiations are to be successful, however, then all of us will have to contribute to making them so, including the Unionist parties.  As the communiqué makes clear, borrowing the words of the international body, confidence building among the participants in negotiations &ldquo;would also require that the parties have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the legitimate concerns of their traditions and the need for new political arrangements with which all can identify.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These negotiations seek nothing more or less than a radical reordering of all our relationships on the basis of equality and justice.  Any settlement is bound, therefore, to rest on compromise all round.  There can be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority.  At the same time, consent is a coin with two sides.  The duty to seek consent is owed not only by the nationalist tradition to the unionist tradition, but also by the unionists to the nationalists.</P>
    <P>Negotiations will pose a particular challenge to the leadership of the unionist community.  Will they be able to find in themselves the reserves of generosity and imagination which will be required to make Northern Ireland a place in which both communities feel they have a stake.  Last week, in their policy paper <i>The Democratic Imperative</i>, the Ulster <Col N="1115" /> Unionist Party declared that it was &ldquo;conscious that there is more than one political/cultural tradition in Northern Ireland; that all democratic traditions require respect and accommodation; and that this will mean the design of institutions that we have not previously had&rdquo;.  These are welcome and direct acknowledgements of truths which constitutional nationalism also recognises. What is now important is that the unionist parties show, in direct negotiations, that they are prepared to draw the necessary conclusions and share in the necessary actions.</P>
    <P>The Government has long recognised the need for unionist fears and concerns to be understood and accommodated. No more profound guarantee could be offered than that of our adherence to the principle of consent, and our acceptance of all that flows from that principle. We also understand the very deep scars inflicted on the unionist community by 25 years of IRA violence, and feel shame and regret that these evils were done in the name of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We also appreciate that the negotiating process must be designed in a way which offers reassurance to all democrats that the fundamental tenets of non-violence are to apply.  Accordingly, the two Governments recognised yesterday that as a confidence-building measure all participants would need to make clear at the beginning of negotiations their total and absolute commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence set out in the report of the international body.  These challenging and stringent principles offer firm guarantees that violence will not be countenanced as a means of influencing negotiations and that participants will abide by the outcome of those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell principles also oblige all parties to commit themselves to the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  This will be, therefore, a basic objective of the negotiations. At the start of negotiations all parties would also need to address the <Col N="1116" /> international body's proposals on decommissioning.  As Prime Minister Major said yesterday, these issues, however difficult, cannot be dodged.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Mitchell report recognised that there will be in negotiations a dynamic interplay between progress on the decommissioning issue and progress on political questions.  It would be unrealistic to expect that any one issue, or complex of issues, in the negotiations will be fully settled and resolved on its own and in advance of all others.  The requirement that the approach proposed by the international body be addressed at the start of negotiations does not mean, and cannot be interpreted as meaning, that serious negotiation on all other issues must wait until the decommissioning question is definitively settled.  What is important is that all participants address all issues in good faith from the beginning.  The need to tackle decommissioning must not be allowed to impede negotiation on the three strands of relationships.</P>
    <P>The unionist parties have also stated that the creation of an elective process is an enabling condition for their participation in negotiations.  The Irish Government are prepared to lend support to any proposal for an elective process which to our satisfaction is broadly acceptable to the Northern parties, has an appropriate mandate and is within the three stranded structure.  In the Dáil last night the leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Ahern, sought clarification as to why, in paragraph 9 of the communiqué, the Taoiseach alone was described as insisting that an elective process be situated within a three-stranded negotiating structure.  The answer is quite simple.  Paragraph 6 of the communiqué clearly states that both Governments are committed to &ldquo;inclusive negotiations to address comprehensively all the relevant relationships and issues in an interlocking three-stranded process.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 sets out the position of the Irish Government in relation to the elective process.  A central element of this position is that any proposal for the <Col N="1117" /> elective process must meet the three conditions laid down in the report of the international body, as I have specified. Both Governments are agreed that while the election itself will be confined to Northern Ireland, any elective process must lead directly and without further preconditions into all-party negotiations within an interlocking three-stranded structure.</P>
    <P>The fact that the details of an elective process are for the parties in Northern Ireland, together with the British Government, to determine, does not mean that the overall purpose and role of that process, and its interconnection with the three-stranded negotiations themselves, are not matters of entirely legitimate concern to us.  The Irish Government will remain fully involved in ensuring that the elective process meets the criteria on which we must, as the Taoiseach indicated, be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The atrocities perpetrated at Canary Wharf and later were in human terms irreparable, the losses inflicted can never be made good and the families of the victims will carry their crosses forever. Their political impact was also immense.  However, now we all have another chance to make the peace process succeed.  There now exists a firm timetable for entry into negotiations. The steps outlined in the communiqué offer all parties an honourable opportunity to enter dialogue and to begin the difficult process of building a lasting accommodation.  Can anyone refuse to join in that endeavour?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time available I will confine myself to making some observations which may appear to be disjointed, as one does not have time to develop a full and consistent theme.</P>
      <P>I want to express appreciation to both Governments for their achievement in agreeing a communiqué and setting the peace process back on the rails.  All of us feel indebted to them for the efforts they have made in bringing about what has been a welcome conclusion to very delicate and difficult negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> The clear purpose of the communiqué is to lead to the introduction once again of negotiations towards rendering permanent the peace process through all-party talks.  It must be said that the communiqué poses a direct challenge to the IRA especially and to Sinn Féin, as the group which can apparently talk to them most freely if not represent them directly.  I think the IRA must have the message clear now that whatever right they might claim is not inherited from the people of Ireland, North or South. The need to repudiate violence and return properly and legitimately to all-party negotiations through Sinn Féin in this instance is something which my party wants to see achieved.  Having said that, they must face the fact, as I say, that the Irish people reject violence or anything done in their name.  For me, the word &ldquo;republican&rdquo; has a special sacred meaning and, as a republican, I have felt sick over the years at the way in which that term has been applied to people who, in fact, have repudiated the very meaning of republicanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I almost resent the use of the term in that sense but I will not dwell on that too much today.</P>
      <P>Everyone has played their part in setting the process back on the rails and, in respect of my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, I have witnessed this over the last few weeks.  There is no doubt that he has played a significant role on an all-party basis in bringing about the successful conclusion which both Governments achieved yesterday.  It is no secret that my party had close links with the process on the basis of discussions and contacts from the beginning of this peace process, under former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I, personally, was involved in a sense in earlier days with some of the Redemptorist priests, whom I have known because they are from my home county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to have it known that this is a matter of common purpose between all parties here.  We are happy with the <Col N="1119" /> achievement of the Government; but, equally, it would recognise that Fianna Fáil played no little part in all of this and in establishing a trust and confidence which must be built on.  The big problem with which we are dealing is distrust, which did not just arise over the last 12 months or with the failure to expedite and put the talks and the process firmly in place.  It goes back long before that.  Certainly, it goes back 70 years, if not before.  Unfortunately, this distrust is founded on an undue preoccupation with what has divided the people in Northern Ireland and a lack of awareness of what they can share and achieve together.  I do not in this context talk of a united Ireland.  I note that many unionist MPs use that term for the purpose of rejecting what they say it means.  Let us talk about coming together in common purpose.  There is much to be healed because of the experiences of 70 years and we must work very hard in these weeks and months to bring this healing about.</P>
    <P>The peace process is not just something at which we will work over the weeks and months between now and the all-party talks in June.  It will lead to a culmination that is acceptable to all.  A peace process is something that goes on and on.  The only way it can be put in place is if people come away from the barriers they have erected and see the potential on both sides to share and cooperate. The unionist people particularly have been deprived of this potential for a considerable period of time because of barriers that have been erected in their name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to continue along the lines outlined by the last two speakers.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their team on what was achieved yesterday.  It was a victory for politics and politicians.  It was a vindication of hard persistent work, keeping open the channels of communication, pressing forward in a focused way even in the most difficult of circumstances, understanding and respecting complexities <Col N="1120" /> and not falling into the traps of simplistic, instant solutions, recriminations or emotional self indulgence.  A good day's work was done yesterday and great credit is due to all concerned. I join with Senator O'Kennedy in applauding the role of his party over the difficult weeks when national solidarity was important and was maintained.</P>
      <P>Yesterday was a tribute to the durability of the institutions set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.  These institutions and structures have endured and provided an invaluable framework within which major crises, such as that we have been through, can be contained, where stock can be taken, where regrouping can take place and ultimately progress can be made.  For those involved in these processes, much of it is mundane and tedious.  It can mean that they must bite their lips on many occasions and bide their time.  The pace of progress may not satisfy some of those commentators who find it so easy to rush to judgment but who themselves must never shoulder the blame or carry the responsibility and whose motives, unlike those of politicians, must never be subject to scrutiny.  So far however, those structures have endured and worked.  Please God, they will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The communiqué and the arrangements announced in it offer an honourable way forward for Sinn Féin.  It will not be easy, but the alternative is to pursue a policy of nihilism, condemn their own people to endless suffering and deny their own talented, energetic people an opportunity to turn their energy and passion into building new political arrangements in which they will have at least part ownership.  It is an open challenge and given their history, the circumstances within which they operate and the continuing power of the Provisional IRA, it will not be an easy one to follow.  However, they should know and must be told that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people on both sides of the Border want them in and want them to play a full and valuable part in shaping all our futures. <Col N="1121" /> However, it is up to them and, sadly, the alternative is too awful to contemplate. I hope that in the coming weeks every effort will be made to encourage Sinn Féin to go this way and I know that if they do, they will have all our support and encouragement.</P>
    <P>I want to address a point to the unionists. I ask them to read <i>The Irish Times</i> poll of yesterday.  They may not believe us when we say we have no imperial ambitions or that their own best interest lies in a peaceful agreed Northern Ireland which respects and copperfastens their rights and identity.  I ask them to look at <i>The Irish Times</i> poll which shows an overwhelming desire for a peace in Northern Ireland, which does not threaten but provides space in which there is a place for leadership.  Unionist political leaders should follow their Church leaders, business leaders and trade union leaders.  The public is ahead of them in its desire for peace and its willingness to make concessions and take risks.  I appeal to them all to show courage and I am certain if they do, it will be rewarded.</P>
    <P>The electoral system will become a major part of the proximity talks.  It is a matter of importance and one which I hope will be resolved between the parties themselves.  The important point is that the election should not be about personalities.  It must be about policies and proposals for the future.  The most important factor is that it must be fully representative.  No legitimate point of view must be excluded from the talks. It is especially important that the small loyalist groups, which have shown restraint, courage and vision with little support from their mainstream parties, get representation.</P>
    <P>The list system on a province wide basis would best ensure that this happens with no threat to the bigger parties. The list system would provide the names of those who would take part, but the index system would be even better. It would simply allow the parties a certain number of seats.  This would allow the smaller parties, who might be <Col N="1122" /> short of expertise, to vary their representation as appropriate.  It is a small technical point and I am sure there is plenty of expertise available.  However, it is important that these practical matters are resolved at an early stage.  That is for the parties and it would be a tragedy if the whole process was to get bogged down on this or any other issue.</P>
    <P>The only point we want to make today is that the peace process is back on the rails.  It is revitalised and has a sense of focus.  All we can do is wish it well and do everything in our power to help it succeed.</P>

      <P>I read the communiqué with a combination of satisfaction and sadness.  I was satisfied that the peace process appears to be in train again.  I was sad because the agreements reached yesterday could have been reached at an earlier date and this, one would have hoped, would have saved innocent lives.</P>
      <P>One must welcome the communiqué and one hopes there will be no retreat ever again from the stage we have reached.  There are obviously huge problems ahead in negotiating terms. All the negotiations will be difficult, protracted and complicated.  Even those negotiations starting next week will be difficult.  I listened with great interest to what the Leader said about the possible problems of the electoral system.  There are a variety of possibilities which one could entertain and we might learn some lessons for our systems in due course.  There are any number of variables, including a list system, an index system or a combination of list and straight vote.  Our diplomats are extremely skilful at thinking of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing to ensure is that all the relevant parties come to the table.  I would have one or two problems with <Col N="1123" /> some of the mindset revealed by the phraseology.  I suspect that the phrase, &ldquo;the people of these islands&rdquo;, is used for the first time in these documents.  We managed to avoid the phrase &ldquo;the Irish people&rdquo; in either the Downing Street Declaration or the Joint Framework Document where the Irish people no longer exist.  We should speak of the peoples of these islands as distinct from the people of these islands, but I will assume no ideological implication of a type that a suspicious mind might read into it is intended.  Having said that, the most important thing now is to get the negotiations going.</P>
    <P>I urge Sinn Féin and the IRA to accept the terms of this communiqué and to indicate their agreement to enter into all-party talks.  Now that a date has been expressed, they have been granted the main conditions they requested.  It would be utter treachery to the republican tradition in this country if they were now to find ways of rejecting the invitation as contained in this communiqué.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lee for allowing me a few minutes to make two points.  The name of the game has changed since yesterday.  Our expectations were too extravagant.  Let us not have extravagant expectations again.  I believe we were not single minded and determined in the last 17 months; when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all of us involved on both islands.  We must avoid being lulled into the comfort of peace and assuming it will stay, without hard work.  There was a time for optimism, but now is the time for realism.</P>
      <P>The elective process is dangerous.  In the months up to 10 June, we must work hard to keep the temperature cool.  We must make sure that during the electoral process we do nothing to raise temperatures or inflame passions.  Those who go forward for election tend to be seduced by the extremes.  We seldom hear moderate words during an election campaign.  We can even see that in the American primaries at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> We must not be baited into saying unhelpful things.  I was impressed by the words of the Tánaiste when he spoke of building a lasting accommodation and asked whether anyone could refuse to join in that endeavour.  Our part during the next few months is to be careful about what we say because an election period is a very dangerous time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One only has to look back on how we all felt just a few weeks ago when the ceasefire ended, to realise what an achievement yesterday's communiqué is, and how much progress both Governments have made.  The communiqué provides a vehicle for all parties to move forward into the substantive process of peacemaking.  Anyone who does not move forward at this stage will be left behind.</P>
      <P>The two Governments have responded clearly to the voice of the Irish people at peace rallies and in opinion polls.  It was a clear message from the collective heart of the people, not just that they did not want violence but that a political mechanism must be found to move the process forward. That opportunity is provided in the joint communiqué.</P>
      <P>I add my voice to those calling on Sinn Féin and the IRA to grasp the opportunities there for them.  They now have a date for all party talks.  Is that simple fact enough for the IRA to cease killing people?  Sinn Féin can now tell the IRA army council that we have a date for all party talks without preconditions, that it has no right to keep Sinn Féin out of the process by continuing the campaign of violence.</P>
      <P>Sinn Féin talks about its democratic mandate, but what democratic mandate does the army council of the IRA have? It has none, and if it does not listen to Sinn Féin, which has a mandate, it will be left behind by the tide of history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if Sinn Féin allows its policy on the use of violence to be dictated by the IRA army council, its commitment to the democratic process will be legitimately questioned.  It is a stark question.  According to the news, <Col N="1125" /> Gerry Adams is concerned that he still may not have enough to bring to the IRA to ask them to call a ceasefire. However, he has the date for all party talks which is what it sought.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous to suggest there might now be some other preconditions to the reinstatement of the ceasefire.  Seamus Mallon said yesterday this was the moment of truth, and it is.  I urge Sinn Féin to go to the IRA and the IRA to take this opportunity because it may be the only one it will get, at least in the near future.</P>
    <P>The co-operation and commitment of both Governments will be needed to move the process forward, but I have no doubt that commitment is there.  The intensive process beginning next Monday will demand considerable commitment, but the groundwork &mdash; including listening, talking and reassuring &mdash; has been done.</P>
    <P>Trust can be built up, but it must be laid on the line that people who try to stall or otherwise thwart the process &mdash; as detailed in paragraph 10 of the communiqué &mdash; will fly in the face of the very people they represent, whether they are nationalists or unionists.  The ordinary people of Northern Ireland want their leaders to be constructive.  As Senator Manning said, in many ways the people are ahead of their leaders, particularly the unionist leaders.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I expressed my concern at the use of the term &ldquo;pan-nationalist front&rdquo; being used more and more by senior unionist leaders including Ken Maginnis.  That terminology implies the drawing up of battle lines, and it is dangerous language to use in the present context.  The use of such terms implies that a nationalist front is lining up against a unionist front in a confrontational manner.  We need to hear the opposite kind of language at the moment.</P>
    <P>Understanding, compromise and partnership can only be achieved by politicians having the courage to trust one another as so many people in Northern Ireland have been trying to do over the last 17 months during the ceasefire. <Col N="1126" /> The leaders in the North must show the same courage that people there have shown in genuinely trying to trust one another and understand the concerns of the other community.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Manning when he said that whatever electoral process is agreed must include representatives of the smaller loyalist parties, the PUP and the UDP.  They have a crucial role to play and must be at the table.  I have read something about this other election system that has been suggested.  It has possibilities, particularly in regard to ensuring that those two parties are represented.</P>
    <P>The Mitchell principles must be an integral part of the process as it moves forward.  The way forward will demand the courage to give as well as to take.  I hope all political leaders will reflect on the stark options before them, and will take the opportunities available.  They can either stick with the old certainties and not go anywhere, or enter into genuine dialogue and take part in the intensive work towards a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>None of us wishes to minimise the problems or the commitment that will have to be made by all sides to try to understand other people's difficulties as well as their own.  It is a unique opportunity for all of us and I hope everybody will grasp it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and endorse the Tánaiste's remarks, in particular when he said that come what may, we are determined to carry on working for peace.  That is an important statement. The Progressive Democrats welcome the communiqué from yesterday's summit in London between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, both Governments and their advisers on creating a balanced and sensitive formula to which everyone committed to democracy can subscribe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we condemned the London bombings in the House on 20 February, at the outset of the debate the Tánaiste enunciated the principles which underpin <Col N="1127" /> democracy.  It is only by taking those principles fully on board that the problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>In calling on Sinn Féin to use its influence to have the IRA restore the ceasefire, which for 18 months lifted the cloud of death and destruction from above our heads, it is important for us to recommit ourselves to the democratic way of consent, political compromise and dialogue.  These things lie at the heart of the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The parliaments of both islands, and their members, have a solemn obligation to defend and protect those democratic principles which are not always as secure as we believe them to be.  The principles were accepted by all but one of the parties at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It was only in respect of one particular aspect that one party, Sinn Féin, could not accept all the principles.</P>
    <P>The announcement that all party talks will commence on 10 June fulfils a central and continuing need of Sinn Féin. In these circumstances I see no reason why the republican movement cannot abandon the path of violence once and for all.  The principles of non-violence were asserted in the report of the drafting committee of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  At that time Sinn Féin confirmed that it accepted all the parts of that report save one.</P>
    <P>If Sinn Féin wishes to participate in all party talks and if the central objective of its policy has been brought into effect, I see no reason why there should be any equivocation on its part about restoring the ceasefire.  In this context, it might learn something from the restraint shown by loyalist para-militaries and their spokespersons. There are obligations not just on Sinn Féin but on all the parties which wish to participate in the talks to fully absorb the democratic principles which the Tánaiste enunciated for us on 20 February. John Alderdice made a telling intervention in <i>The Irish Times</i> when he said that in a democratic society, democratically elected politicians tell the generals <Col N="1128" /> what to do, not the other way around.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the O'Brien Family who buried their son in Gorey yesterday.  I do not believe what they said was particularly unusual &mdash; it reflected very accurately what many Irish people think.  However, the circumstances in which they made that statement and the renunciation of violence implicit in it were extremely unusual.  That is something on which we should reflect.  We should also reflect on the fact that people have power.  A large number of people marched at the weekend demanding an end to violence and when seen on the television across the water these marches and the O'Brien family statement had a powerful effect. People should not underestimate their power.</P>
    <P>On the question of an election or a referendum &mdash; I believe it should be described as a plebiscite because it is not to change our Constitution &mdash; I share the views expressed by Senator Quinn about the dangers of an election. Tempers can fray and people can say things which are divisive.  It is important that restraint is shown by all sides during that election.  That is not to say that I oppose the principle of an election but I believe that words of caution need to be expressed in advance of it.</P>
    <P>We must not reflect on how we divide or unite this island but on how we share it.  That brings us back to something which the late Senator Wilson spoke about repeatedly &mdash; he described sharing this garden and how we should bring love and Christianity to bear.  I believe his words still echo.</P>
    <P>We are at a critical point or, as the Tánaiste described it, a fork in the road. We have two choices &mdash; the democratic path of consent and comprise or the path to utter destruction and chaos.  If people consider those two stark choices sufficiently, they will come to only one conclusion &mdash; the path of the democratic politician.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on seeking <Col N="1129" /> agreement with the British Prime Minister to enhance the peace process.  On 9 February following the IRA bomb at Canary Wharf there was a palpable sense of despair among the people on these islands.  After 17 months during which democratic politicians had attempted to find a political route out of the conflict which claimed over 3,000 lives in 25 years, the IRA threatened to take us back to the start of that conflict.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to the resilience of democracy that following the resumption of the IRA's bombing campaign the peace process has been put back on course.  It is a tribute also to the restraint shown by loyalist paramilitaries who refused to let the IRA bomb them back to violence.  Most of all it is a tribute to the will for peace displayed by the citizens of these islands who have demonstrated in recent weeks that they will not allow their peace to be wilfully shattered. Last Sunday 2,000 citizens came together in Mallow, my home town, to walk for peace.  They joined the estimated 100,000 people throughout the country in sending the IRA a simple message to stop.</P>
      <P>Since Canary Wharf Sinn Féin has asked democratic politicians to give it a message to take to the IRA.  Yesterday John Bruton and John Major gave it that message in the form of a framework for peace.  A date for all-party talks has been fixed, a structure has been arranged within which consultation on an elective process can take place and the possibility of a North-South referendum has been ventilated.  The two Governments have committed themselves to work in partnership with parties which are committed exclusively to peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The door is now open to Sinn Féin to come in from the cold to which the IRA consigned it two weeks ago and to take part in all-party talks starting on 10 June.  The ball is in the republican movement's court and Sinn Féin can either take the communiqué to the IRA and demand a renewed and permanent ceasefire or it can watch the process from the sidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> Sinn Féin's reaction during the past 24 hours has perhaps been predictable. While extending a cautious welcome to the proposals, it has advanced a number of caveats, principally in relation to the proposal for an election.  Having scrutinised the communiqué, I do not believe that its reservations are justified.  It is understandably concerned that it may be treated differently from other democratic parties during the consultations and negotiations envisaged under the terms of the communiqué.  No party likes to be denied parity of esteem, but in this case the remedy is in Sinn Féin's hands.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin knows that the two Governments, which draw their authority exclusively from the democratic process, cannot allow the line between democracy and violence to be blurred.  The two Governments have responded generously to Sinn Féin's predicament following the IRA's decision to end the ceasefire. It is now up to Sinn Féin to exert pressure on the IRA to resume its ceasefire. Yesterday the people of these islands were presented with what may be the last chance for peace for a generation and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that that chance is not frittered away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I unreservedly and wholeheartedly welcome what has been achieved.  Over a week ago I stood here and was scathing of the failure of political leadership which had led us to the current impasse. I was scathing of the political leaders who had sat around for 18 months and allowed the opportunity of peace to slip like sand through the collective fingers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Canary Wharf and the other horrors in London have helped to settle people's minds.  I believe too much time has passed and that we have now reached the position that we should have been in 12 months ago if we had seen real political leadership.  However, in the time since we last spoke on this issue, the people have spoken in their tens of thousand not only to the leadership of Sinn Féin but to the IRA Army <Col N="1131" /> Council.  They also spoke clearly and unequivocally to the leaders of the political parties here and on the other island.  A real effort has been made and it would be less than generous not to recognise that.  There has been a real change of heart and of mind.</P>
    <P>When I watched yesterday's debate in the House of Commons &mdash; I noticed the editorial analysis in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> came to the same conclusions &mdash; I was intrigued by the willingness to move which was not apparent a few weeks ago.  This was the power of the people, the will of the thousands of men, women and children who walked on streets all over this island, north and south, and in the United Kingdom to demand peace and political leadership.  A real effort has been made and we should recognise, assist and underpin that in every way.</P>
    <P>What has been announced is a complex process fraught with potential difficulties. There are many minefields into which we could unknowingly stray and all too easily destroy the peace.  The period of intensive negotiations from next week, which are quite similar to the proximity talks suggested by the Tánaiste, will demand a huge amount of goodwill.  Those intensive negotiations must be underpinned by goodwill; there must be a willingness to go the extra mile.  There must also be a willingness to be scathing and open in our hostility to anybody who puts up artificial barriers to progress.</P>
    <P>Around Easter the British Government is to introduce legislation on elections in Northern Ireland.  I share the view of other Senators that this is a potentially dangerous area.  Elections by their nature are not only democratic but also raise the heat of political debate. Things can be said and done to appeal to the margins and there are potential dangers in that regard.  There will be a special responsibility on all political leaders in Northern Ireland during those elections to ensure nothing is said or done to exacerbate the situation and tumble us back into the abyss.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> As Senator O'Sullivan said, there are some interesting proposals about the system of election.  I wholeheartedly support the views of the SDLP and DUP leaderships &mdash; there is an extraordinary combination &mdash; when they both suggest that the list system would at least marginalise the least number of people.  The referendum proposition is an extraordinary way of bringing the people into the process.  However, I will be interested to see the wording of the referendum.</P>
    <P>In all the negotiations over the last 18 months one thing has distressed me repeatedly &mdash; the absence of the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo;.  Peace without justice is a chimera and we continuously forget that.  St. Augustine made an interesting and intriguing comment about the nature of monarchs and monarchies and the concept of justice.  He spoke about justice as the cement that kept civilised society together.  Yesterday, in London, a memorial was unveiled to those who died in the Gulf War and the quotation used was that of St. Augustine on justice. The quotation is quite long but the gist of it is: Kingdoms without justice are mere monarchies of robbers.</P>
    <P>This debate has gone on for 18 months and it should have reached this point a long time ago.  However, let us not lose sight of one fact.  Unless we can create institutions on this island, North and South, that will ensure not just peace for the present but justice for eternity, we are going nowhere.  There is a huge burden on the shoulders of every political leader.  It is time all politicians in the Oireachtas and in the Houses of Parliament got together to ensure that we measure our phrases and words carefully and that we do nothing that does not support the real efforts now taking place.</P>
    <P>I commend everybody involved in this initiative.  I was harshly critical before of what I regarded as a lack of leadership but we are now seeing the dawn of political leadership.  I hope that will lead to peace and, above all, peace with justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will augment that of Senator Manning and other Senators in an appeal to the IRA to come back into the peace process.</P>
      <P>It was right and proper for Sinn Féin to be told that they cannot be engaged in dialogue until IRA violence stops. The killing of the innocents and the maiming and scarring of dozens of others in Canary Wharf was the same type of random killing that has been condemned so often by Sinn Féin when loyalists have attacked Catholics at bus stops, pubs and bookmakers' shops.  The two Englishmen who were killed in Canary Wharf were killed because they were English and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>We hope the IRA will put down their arms, and soon.  If they do so, it need not be seen as surrender to the British but in deference to the overwhelmingly expressed wish of the Irish people, North and South.  The ceasefire showed that the IRA has able spokesmen in Sinn Féin.  This is where the IRA's trust should be &mdash; in democratic debate and not in bombing.</P>
      <P>Peace means many things to each of us.  It means an improvement in the economy, more jobs, a higher and more enriched quality of life, a burden lifted from our people and a reason to smile and celebrate.  However, when I imagine a peaceful situation, I think of the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the old and the single mothers in the areas where the paramilitaries on both sides have been most active and from where they have drawn their support.  They made those people believe that nobody else cared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have walked the streets on both sides of the peace line.  I have spoken to the children in primary schools and heard their headmasters say that they will not gain many O levels.  Most of the pupils will leave school to go on the dole, their potential unrealised.  This is the case in Catholic North Queen Street in Belfast, in the Protestant Shankill Road and in their counterparts throughout Northern Ireland.  Outside schools graffiti scream sentiments that are eye popping, sulphurous and evil.  A heavy <Col N="1134" /> pall hangs over these areas.  Yet, every once in a while, I have been invited into a little house, neatly kept, where pride of place on the mantelpiece is given to a photograph of a graduate with scroll, robes and mortar board.  It represents a triumph over the type of adversity that cannot be imagined in this State which is so much at peace with itself.</P>
    <P>Do the IRA not want the peace, the jobs, the ease of mind and to bring their people closer to the quality of life that exists in leafy suburbs?  The way to do that is to come to an agreement.  The working classes of both sides should sit down and resolve not to rise until their people are guaranteed a better life.  The two working class communities in the North have more in common than divides them.  The politicians closest to the loyalist paramilitaries have articulated their case with impressive fluency.  They and Sinn Féin must be represented at talks aimed at a just settlement of our problem.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister remind Sinn Féin of the benefits the ceasefire brought to them &mdash; freedom of the airwaves, access to Governments, fundraising in America and so forth.  However, what is rarely admitted by Nationalists in the North and what I never hear in the South is that Northern Ireland, as at present constituted, has to be the most closely monitored area on the planet for fair treatment electorally, in the workplace and where the State is concerned.  All the abuses carried out by the old Stormont are subject to correction by law. Each day discrimination is being exposed and dealt with firmly.  Fr. Seán McManus, who has worked for so long in the USA to expose imbalances in employment patterns, told me last summer that he is now satisfied with the machinery in place to ensure fair play. All of this is evident and can be demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Those who warn about a return to the old Stormont rely on black and white television footage to make their case. They do not use colour television films because colour began to return to the <Col N="1135" /> lives of those who had been badly treated by the State when colour was introduced to the television screen. There has been no need for republican violence or loyalist reaction for many years now.  The loyalist arms are cold. The IRA should put theirs down and take their place once again with the Irish people.  With democratic progress will come a new understanding and a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the quarrel that separates Protestant and Catholic goes back for almost a century the IRA were wrong for losing their patience after only 17 months. I hope and trust that the IRA army council now realises this and will be fair to the emphatically expressed wishes of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I, too, congratulate all those who negotiated over the last two weeks to bring the peace process further.  I congratulate John Major in particular.  In a week when he had terrible political trouble he managed to put this communiqué together.  I was in Belfast last week and a woman said something which I found profoundly depressing.  She said that too many groups wanted victory rather than peace.  It is most important that we set our minds on making peace rather than make victory the objective.</P>
      <P>By now the IRA must know that the breakdown in their ceasefire was a disastrous mistake.  Having looked at the marches that took place all over the country last Sunday, they must know that the dreadful deeds they carried out in our name are condemned and disowned by everybody.  I became familiar with some of the Sinn Féin leaders at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and I call on them to use their considerable political skills to have the ceasefire reinstated immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the privilege of having Gordon Wilson, who was the father of a victim of the troubles in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1136" /> serve as a Member of this House.  Was he eventually a victim when we consider his untimely and sudden death and the great work he invested in trying to move the process along?  We cannot allow any more victims or victims' families in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  It is very important that the IRA is aware that this is our view.</P>
    <P>I always try to speak on behalf of the prisoners on both sides.  They are important and it would be terrible if they were left in a political limbo until June.  We must remember that there are loyalist and republican prisoners.  Many people have stressed their importance to the development of the peace process and the establishment of the initial ceasefires. When elected, Senator McAughtry was wise to state that he would do everything possible to ensure that loyalist guns remain cold.  We must do all we can to ensure that all guns remain cold.  In any movement regarding the prisoners, some of whom have served 20 years in prison, we must remember that they and their families were disappointed and humiliated by the events which occurred when the IRA ceasefire broke down.  We must rise above this and ensure that their predicament does not become a political football.</P>
    <P>I realise that dangerous times lie ahead in the run up to elections.  I am worried about the elective process because, regardless of the situation, margins are appealed to and tensions heightened.</P>
    <P>Many people visited Northern Ireland during the past 17 months and I hope that this does not stop.  To my horror, people informed me last week that they had cancelled trips to Northern Ireland for the St. Patrick's Day weekend.  This will not help.  Anyone who has established connections with Northern Ireland or plans to visit it in the coming months, should try not to make it seem more of a fortress than it is already. Those contacts should be maintained because they are very important to people in Northern Ireland, particularly <Col N="1137" /> Unionists.  In many situations, nothing is more fearful than the unknown.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the British Prime Minister and the various Government Ministers on both sides of the divide who were involved in bring about this extremely important communiqué. The level of work, commitment, courage and dedication necessary to put this document together was quite extraordinary. The document contains a fine formula to return peace to this island.</P>
      <P>It is clear, from the debates in both Houses, that people desire peace on this island.  Last Sunday the people of Ireland, North and South, marched in their hundreds of thousands to convey the message that they want peace.  This is a very challenging, important and difficult time for those at centre-stage, Sinn Féin and the Unionist parties.  It is extremely important that Sinn Féin, which has followed a particular path for so long, reviews its political position and situation.  It should consider the events of the past 25 years and what could happen in the future if they choose to adopt the democratic process.  I say to Gerry Adams and his supporters that it is easy to return to the old route but it takes much courage and strength of character to change one's ways.  This will involve serious consideration and consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed by Mr. Adams's comments, on the RTE lunchtime news, that we will not have all-party talks and that Sinn Féin is not being excluded from such talks by the IRA, but by the Taoiseach and Mr. Major.  That is untrue and it is important that Sinn Féin accepts the reality that the ceasefire must recommence if they are to become involved in all-party talks.  It is a fundamental, basic democratic principle from which one cannot shy away.  This is a very challenging time for Sinn Féin and the IRA who must face the reality of changing their political position.  They must decide that they will break into a new era by being courageous and becoming involved in the democratic process.  This will take much courage <Col N="1138" /> but they are receiving good and sound support from both Governments.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's communiqué, particularly paragraph 10, was very encouraging. It states that the parties will proceed to reach widespread agreement on proposals for a broadly acceptable elective process leading directly, and without preconditions, to all-party negotiations on 10 June 1996.  In the interim, a very important week of discussions will take place between 4-13 March. That will be a difficult week for all parties to put forward their cases and positions. However, it is important that Sinn Féin and the IRA realise that the political process is very different from the military one and that that process is much slower than their former path.  I appeal to them to consider this fact and ensure that they opt for the democratic process because it is the wish of the people that they do so.</P>
    <P>I compliment elements of the Unionist parties, particularly Messrs.  Adamson, McMichael, Ervine, Barr and Hutchinson, who have been very responsible in not retaliating against recent events.  They have shown courage and leadership.  I was encouraged by Mr. Ervine's response to the communiqué when he stated that the people of Northern Ireland need no longer look into a black hole and consider it their future.  He has given leadership to his community and his people.  The challenge is now with Sinn Féin and Mr. Trimble, who must abandon the old ways of his party and look to the future in a much more progressive and positive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following recent events, people have moved from the optimism and hope experienced at the time of the publication of the Downing Street Declaration, the subsequent publication of the framework document and the issuing of a joint communiqué last November.  I agree with Senators' comments that we permitted ourselves a period of understandable optimism.  This awakened us <Col N="1139" /> to the idea of new visions and openness in relation to other points of view, particularly in the context of the very deep differences that exist between the parties in Northern Ireland and the differences in values between the two traditions on this island.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the ceasefire came as a great shock to most people, both North and South, including participants in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and those involved in cross community and cross-Border contact. Although we knew, and were being continuously told, that people were worried and fearful about a breakdown, many were reluctant to believe it would take place, so great were the fruits of the ceasefire. Almost immediately after the Canary Wharf bombing I recall talking to a person in the North who is closely involved in community development and who has in many ways been living in a kind of paradise of openness, growth and experience over the past 18 months.  She told me she was shocked at the idea that she would have to tell her teenage daughters that they would not be able to go into Belfast in future without giving some consideration to security matters.</P>
      <P>Although the most appalling things happened since the breakdown of the ceasefire, if we can get it back on track we will enter the next stage of the process with a more realistic view in some respects.  It is not that the time for optimism is over, but that, in addition to optimism, we will have a period of intense realism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious there are many Senators with esteemed qualifications in history.  Members of Sinn Féin are fond of drawing analogies with other conflicts around the world and how they were resolved.  They are especially fond of drawing analogies with the end of apartheid in South Africa.  The two conflicts are not directly comparable.  Nevertheless, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness continuously refer, in a warm and emotional way, to what happened in South Africa.  I have heard <Col N="1140" /> them express views on this on a number of occasions and have reminded them that it took four years for South Africa to get to the point from the release of Nelson Mandela to the holding of elections.</P>
    <P>It may appear the process in South Africa was very fast but this was not the case.  The four years before the elections have been been preceded by a period of approximately six years when the most intense changes took place in the white community, especially in the business community, where minds and hearts opened up.</P>
    <P>On the issue of changes and comparisons with other peace processes, if members of Sinn Féin use and want to use South Africa as a model they should look at what happened there and bear in mind that Nelson Mandela, the ANC and its armed wing indicated from a very early stage that, once the process had started in a serious way, they would put aside the option of armed conflict.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the comparisons are not direct because in South Africa a majority, comprising an enormous number, were excluded by an oppressive and vicious system from any effective participation in political life.  Members of Sinn Féin should look again at the history of South Africa.  They should look at the role of the referendum which de Klerk called at a certain stage in the process when it appeared it was falling apart.  It resulted in him getting the authority of the white community to continue.</P>
    <P>If members of Sinn Féin want to look at other peace processes around the world they should not only look at the positive elements from their perspective, and possibly that of the IRA, but also at what the negotiators from the physical force side were prepared to yield.  In the South African peace process, it was clear from shortly after Nelson Mandela left jail that violence was being set aside and that this was the cornerstone of what the ANC was prepared to offer to a non racial &mdash; not a multi racial &mdash; South Africa.  In this respect Sinn Féin stands at the cross-roads <Col N="1141" /> where it has an option to take a specific path of participation.</P>
    <P>During the peace rallies of last weekend many people from all walks of life, age groups and backgrounds in Ireland walked quietly and determinedly to show their support for the peace movement. I took part in the rally in Dublin. It was remarkable and moving that the people on the sidewalk &mdash; I have marched down O'Connell Street on many occasions in support of different causes &mdash; clapped the marchers who clapped in return.  It was a collective, community feeling where people were simply saying they wanted peace.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic as we proceed not to expect that there will be difficulties. However, the bullet which the IRA must bite is that the overwhelming majority of people on the island want a process of negotiation leading to a peace settlement.  They do not want a process that has the threat of violence hanging over it.  I recognise that the IRA, and especially Sinn Féin, have come a long way in their thinking over the past 18 months.  However, Nelson Mandela, references to whom they continuously employ, told people: &ldquo;. . . walk the extra mile with me&rdquo;.  Sinn Féin must tell the IRA to walk the extra mile with those in Sinn Féin, and there are many, who have positively opted for the democratic process and who are seeking to take the gun out of Irish politics.</P>
    <P>If we can get this we then require on the Unionist side equivalent generosity. We also need imagination.  We do not need the Unionist parties to simply stress their majority; we in the Republic are aware of it.  In the context of the Framework Document and the Downing Street Declaration, the principle of consent has been enunciated and accepted by all parties in the House. The Unionist majority is not something which is being debated; it is accepted.</P>
    <P>We need a leap of imagination from the Unionists which will allow them to join the process, and not simply in a protective sense of hanging on to what they hold.  When one enters into a peace process, and again referring to the analogies <Col N="1142" /> with successful peace processes elsewhere, one must be prepared to give ground.  We, and they, must give ground.  We and they must approach the process with an open mind and be prepared to acknowledge in a deeper way our differences and our respect for those differences.</P>
    <P>The past 18 months and what has happened in terms of bringing the process to an end have particularly shown that although huge numbers of people and organisations have made efforts to develop cross-Border and cross-community links, the process has not been wide or deep enough to bring about the kind of change of heart and opinion which happened in South Africa in the case of the white community and in the context of the Arab-Israeli negotiations.</P>
    <P>We must keep moving on two levels. There is undoubtedly the political level but parallel to and underpinning this are the attitudes of ordinary people and cross-community and cross-Border contacts. In this context the proposals put forward by Mr. John Hume on what may correctly be called a plebiscite as opposed to a referendum are particularly interesting.</P>
    <P>In the context of the theology &mdash; I will not say ideology &mdash; of the IRA, a small number of people close to or members of the IRA and Sinn Féin see a kind of mystical mandate emanating from 1918. The plebiscite process would allow all the people, North and South, to have a say on the parameters of the negotiating process by, for instance, giving their assent to the key recommendations of the Mitchell report.  The proposal for a plebiscite has a great deal of merit because it would validate what is clearly the will of almost every man, woman and child on this island.</P>
    <P>Various Senators spoke about the dangers of an election and the elective process.  I have listened to Mr. David Trimble over the past few weeks.  Many regard the interview he gave on RTE last Sunday as narrow and rigid but its content, particularly his comments on elections, showed a great deal of movement and a great area to be explored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> It is difficult for most democrats, particularly outside Ireland, to understand what we have to fear from an election. On the other hand, all of us on this island cogently understand what elections in the North imply.  However, to say to people abroad we have an inherent difficulty with elections is asking for a degree of understanding which is not there.</P>
    <P>Points have been made about the use of a list system in any election and the Leader suggested an index system.  Such systems would remove personal bitterness and bare knuckle fighting from an election, would allow it to be about ideas in the context of negotiations and the mandates of the negotiating parties and allow the smaller loyalist parties to be involved.  These points are critically important.</P>
    <P>During the last 18 months there has been a flowering of community activities in many communities which have the closest contact with both republican and loyalist paramilitary organisations. There has been the development of many strong and fine personalities who have been involved in community organisations in both communities. However, many of them have no political party with which to identify; such is the nature of change in Northern Ireland since the ceasefire.  A list type system would allow some of these organisations and the smaller loyalist linked parties to participate.</P>
    <P>One does not have to stress that the participation of women in political parties in the North is at an incredibly low level.  When I visit community based organisations there, I meet hundreds of women, many of whom are of extraordinarily fine calibre.  They are not involved in political parties but are very much involved in community politics.  I hope that a more refined electoral process, involving the list system, would allow for the much broader participation of women on those lists.  The participation of women in serious numbers in the whole negotiating process can only benefit both communities.  I hope <Col N="1144" /> the negotiations and proximity talks may result in developments on this issue.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for their tremendous work.  I thank the officials of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their work over the past few weeks.  From personal contact with them I know the personal toll involvement in the process has taken on many of them.  It is appropriate that in a generous way we should congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on their achievement yesterday, which gives us an opportunity to recover some of what we lost and to go forward in a more realistic vein to the next stage of the process.  I compliment the leader of Fianna Fáil for the thoughtful speeches and articles he has contributed, which showed an extraordinarily effective bipartisanship during this difficult period. The leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, also played an extremely constructive role.</P>
    <P>The ball is now in the court of Sinn Féin and I hope it has the capacity to respond in a historically appropriate way to a historic opportunity, not just for us here but for everybody on this island, particularly the young people who were born during the troubles and have had for the last 18 months a taste of normal life.  They have experienced the growth, blossoming and sheer enjoyment which Belfast and other cities have offered over the last 18 months.  I think of the joy of the crowd the evening Van Morrisson played in Royal Avenue before the US President, Mr. Bill Clinton, came on stage.  I hope that what happened yesterday will allow us to recapture some of this mood, particularly for young people, and to move forward with realism,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real danger of a disaster with coastal erosion just outside Wicklow town at the Murrough, which is a place of great recreational value and declared a special amenity area.  It is threatened by coastal erosion because of storms which have been particularly prevalent in recent months.  I had the frightening experience last week of seeing the damage done by recent storms and I was shocked by it.</P>
      <P>Up to January this year there was a steady but slow erosion but since then the erosion has become swift and serious.  About ten metres has been removed in the last ten years but most of that has happened in the last few months.  I cannot overemphasise to the Minister of State the seriousness of this matter.</P>
      <P>I know there are problems with public funds and the Minister of State may plead that there is a limited amount of money, some of which has already gone to Bray.  However, the problem with coastal erosion is that it is forever &mdash; it would be very difficult to reclaim the land which is so important to the people of Wicklow and further afield.  The possible extent of this disaster could be considered a nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot know that the rate of erosion will continue at the same pace as in the past &mdash; it may speed up.  There is a serious danger of the railway being undermined in a short time and that would be far more expensive to put right than spending an emergency £600,000 which is now necessary. Houses will be threatened if storms continue and the Veha factory is a short distance from the site.  I urge the Minister of State to regard this as a potential disaster <Col N="1146" /> for an amenity area and a threat to houses and public transport in the area.  It will be cheaper in the long run to provide funds now than if major repairs have to be made in the future.</P>
    <P>At present about 500 metres are affected but the main problem extends over only about 30 metres.  The problem should be tackled at this stage before 500 metres becomes badly affected. There is a potential for £10 million worth of damage if the road close to the shore is eroded, if buildings are removed and compensation has to be paid, the buildings replaced and if at least one factory is swept away.  To preserve this amenity for the people of Wicklow and to save public money in future, I urge the Minister of State to act on this potential disaster immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time with me.  He has graphically demonstrated to the Minister of State the consequences of inaction at this stage.  The Murrough is a unique area because it has an extraordinary ecosystem.  It has the potential to be a tremendous nature reserve.  It shares two major uses at present &mdash; it is the area where most of the industry in Wicklow town is sited and it also has an important role as a recreational area for the people of Wicklow town.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ross said, there has been a frightening increase in the level of damage along the Murrough in a relatively short period of time.  There have been problems with coastal erosion along the coast of Wicklow from Bray through Greystones and Kilcoole as far as the Murrough where the coast is volatile. However, the coastline at the Murrough is particularly volatile because it is made up predominantly of gravel material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago the tide inundated a part of the north beach in Arklow which is similar to the Murrough.  The surge of the tide caused a bigger breach and it cost millions to immediately carry out repair work.  If the repair work had not been carried out many more millions of <Col N="1147" /> pounds worth of damage could have been caused in Arklow.  We face the same situation now with the Murrough &mdash; the loss of a valuable community amenity area, a recreational area and a potential area for development as a nature or wildlife reserve in the future.</P>
    <P>In terms of the economic life of Wicklow town we face the loss of its industrial heartland.  One could argue that industry should not have been sited on the Murrough but the industry is there. Some years ago an engineer, for reasons best know to himself, decided it was where industry would be sited and that is where it is.  There are many houses &mdash; and huge capital investment &mdash; on the Murrough.  I urge the Minister of State to make the investment now because if we do not do so we will have to invest infinitely more money later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Ross and Roche for raising this matter.  Ireland has one of the largest coastlines in Europe.  At 5,800 kilometres our coastline is larger than that of France.  Our coastline is a resource of great value in economic, environmental, ecological and sociological terms.  It is a fragile resource and, in many instances, non-renewable, and the systems operating in the coastal zone will significantly depend on the preservation of the coastal environment.  Erosion is one of the major threats to the coastal environment.</P>
      <P>The loss of sand dune systems, for example, can disrupt the natural habitat of a number of birds and other animals. In certain circumstances, erosion can pose a social threat to isolated coastal communities.  Apart from the obvious economic disruption, erosion threatens the communications and transport links for these communities.  Being cut off from the mainland would have serious and potentially catastrophic consequences for these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study by the national coastal erosion committee of the County and City Engineers' Association, undertaken in <Col N="1148" /> 1992, estimated that 490 kilometres of the coastline required immediate attention at an approximate cost of £125 million. Primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether that be a local authority, a group or a private individual which has a vested interest in protecting his or her own property.</P>
    <P>The main function of the Department of the Marine is to assist in the overall management of the coastal zone and, where appropriate, the Department will provide a foreshore licence to facilitate protection works.  The Government is conscious of the threat posed by erosion and the need for coastal protection.  In 1994 the Government first decided that the EU Structural Funds should be made available to help address the serious erosion problem, and allocated moneys from the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, amounting to £5.1 million, to tackle priority erosion problems in that six year period.</P>
    <P>The aim of the investment programme is preservation of the State owned foreshore, local authority owned property including county road networks, tourist amenities including beach and dune systems, and natural habitats and their ecology.  Such preservation works support rural development, tourism, environmental protection and other activities which contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.</P>
    <P>The County and City Engineers' Association estimated that £125 million is required to tackle all the most urgent erosion problems.  Given that funding under the Operational Programme is limited to £5.1 million, it was obvious that priority projects for possible funding under the programme needed to be identified.  To draw up a targeted programme of priority coastal locations, consultations were held with coastal local authorities and submissions detailing their top four priority proposals were sought.  Given the limited funding available and demand levels, all the local authorities were advised that <Col N="1149" /> value for money from investments in coastal protection schemes must be achieved.  In other words, the cost of undertaking any scheme must be considered against the benefits, tangible or intangible, arising.  Such benefits would include property, infrastructure, transportation, livelihoods, community concern, conservation value and commercial value.  These proposals are now on hand in the Department and works being undertaken to the end of 1999 will be chosen from among the priority proposals submitted.</P>
    <P>A number of the projects identified by the local authorities have been aided by the Department during the past year. In 1995, £773,000 was invested in protection works at ten locations &mdash; the Maharees Peninsula and Waterville in County Kerry; Courtown and Duncannon in County Wexford; Inishboffin and Roundstone in County Galway; Bertra Beach in County Mayo; Killiney, County Dublin; Laytown, County Meath; and preparatory work in Bray, County Wicklow.  I am sure Senators Ross and Roche will understand that the funding available in any one year is limited and as a result it is only possible to undertake a small number of works in any year.</P>
    <P>The submission from Wicklow County Council detailed the protection proposals in order of priority.  The first priority was Bray promenade and sea front which needs a rock groyne, breakwater and nourishment of the beach. The estimated cost is £2.4 million.  The second priority is north beach, Arklow which requires the construction of a rock groyne and offshore breakwater. The cost is estimated to be £700,000, subject to study and design.  The third priority is Greystones which wants a sea wall along the clay cliff running between La Touche Hotel and Carrigeden.  The cost would be in the region of £150,000. The fourth priority, to which the Senators referred, is the Murrough, County Wicklow which needs additional gabions and rock armour to the area north of the existing works.  The cost is approximately £342,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> As many Members are aware, there is a long-standing commitment to undertake a major protection scheme at Bray. Planning for this scheme has been under way for some considerable period.  The Department of the Marine, in conjunction with Bray Urban District Council and Wicklow County Council, intends commencing this scheme during 1996. This major protection scheme which will cost £2.4 million will be undertaken in a phased manner over two to three years. The overall cost of the project represents almost half of the moneys available for coastal protection under the Operational Programme and will use the bulk of the funding available over the next two years.  In these circumstances it is difficult to see how additional funding can be directed to projects in County Wicklow pending completion of the works at Bray.  In the meantime, Wicklow County Council, in conjunction with local property and business interests, should undertake whatever remedial works are required to stabilise the present shoreline recession.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senators that the points made will be borne in mind.  As the Members will realise, when we are talking about coastal protection we are dealing with huge sums of money.  In view of this, the Department of the Marine would be willing to talk to local authorities, including Wicklow County Council, to ascertain if community employment schemes could be utilised for such works.  Such an approach may enable some immediate works to be undertaken which, while perhaps not of the Rolls-Royce type, would halt further erosion pending more moneys being made available in future to undertake a more substantial long term job. In the meantime, the major works planned under the Operational Programme will continue.</P>
    <P>In view of the dramatic and graphic description of developments in the erosion process recently, I will relay the Senators' comments to the relevant officials in the Department and ask that the matter be examined again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the views and concerns of a community in the Slieve Felim area, the hill country of North Tipperary and Limerick, about a proposal to locate a dump, euphemistically known as a landfill site, in the Slieve Felim mountain region.  These people have struggled hard for many years to overcome the natural disadvantage of living in a remote mountain region.  I have seen many positive protests by these communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my 30 years in political life I have not seen as much determination and concern as was expressed at public meetings in Rear Cross and Cappaghmore and in the other community halls in that region.  Rear Cross is a small mountain village well known in Tipperary folklore and in stories about our fight for freedom.  The hall and adjoining schoolhouse were packed with people attending these meetings.  The proceedings were relayed from the hall to those in the schoolhouse and outside who could not get into either building. This community has more rich qualities &mdash; not wealth which others have &mdash; than any community I have been privileged <Col N="1152" /> to work with over the years.  These people are concerned about a decision which will affect them and their children for generations, to locate a proposed landfill site in the heart of beautiful mountain country.</P>
    <P>Where decisions of this kind are proposed, much less adopted, by local or national Government, will the Minister guarantee that the community directly affected, such as the mountain people of Slieve Felim, will have free and full access to all information on the proposed landfill site?  They should not have to seek or demand this information &mdash; it should be made available to them from the beginning.  These people collected money from those who could ill afford it in an attempt to match the money available to local and national governments so that they could be well informed.  I want a commitment from the Minister that they will have access to all the information available to the local authority &mdash; Limerick County Council in this instance &mdash; and the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>They should also have access to all the conclusions and findings of any examinations which were conducted and the reasons and justifications for such conclusions.  A firm of consultants advised Limerick County Council and these people should be entitled to the consultants' terms of reference.  If one looked at the best location for a dump or landfill site in purely engineering terms, one would probably choose the most remote area, in terms of a wide open and free place.  A dump might not intrude visibly in such a place but it would be an environmental disaster.  I wish to know the terms of reference of the consultants who seem to have recommended the location of a landfill site in the Slieve Felim region.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the Seanad is discussing the Waste Management Bill at the moment.  Consumerism is a characteristic of society in our towns and cities. The waste from our consumer society must be dumped or located somewhere. However, we decide to dump it in areas which are not contributing to the huge <Col N="1153" /> growth in waste, which is a regrettable feature of our society in recent times. Someone decided that a place of pristine beauty and remoteness, such as Slieve Felim, was an ideal place to locate the waste from our towns and cities &mdash; Limerick city, in this instance. Rural communities are paying the price for the waste in our cities and the lack of management on the part of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Our local authorities are meant to have a primary responsibility to protect the environment.  In that capacity, they should clearly demonstrate that they will always give first priority to protecting and enhancing the environment to ensure that what we inherited from previous generations &mdash; the people of Slieve Felim did not inherit much in terms of national wealth although they did in terms of character and culture &mdash; is not intruded upon in an offensive way by the location of a dump site in the heart of beautiful hills.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are currently discussing the provisions of the Waste Management Bill, which contains some welcome initiatives which we agreed on an all-party basis.  The Bill contains initiatives and provisions which are much more stringent in respect of the power of local authorities to locate landfill sites or dumps of this nature than those which operate at present.  Why, in those circumstances, are the local authorities proposing to locate a landfill facility at a site in the Slieve Felim area before these provisions come in?</P>
    <P>This area is classified as severely disadvantaged for agricultural and every other purpose.  It is a remote area with a falling population and low income levels. However, through a remarkable effort, the community has built up its own tourism programme and attracted people from other countries to visit beautiful Slieve Felim and walk through the hills.  It is a unique and beautiful area which tourists from congested cities want to visit.  It is unacceptable for their efforts to build up some degree of security and protect what they have to <Col N="1154" /> be set at naught and for us to impose further man-made obstructions on their development.</P>
    <P>If information is available from the Department of the Environment or the county council, the local people should have maximum access to it.  The community in Slieve Felim is very concerned about what happens today but they are much more concerned about what will happen for the generations to come. They are greatly worried about the future quality of the water if this proposal is adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy for raising this important matter.  He will be aware that waste management planning is a matter for each county council and county borough corporation in respect of its functional areas.  These authorities are directly responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste operations.  It is also a matter for each authority to determine the waste management facilities and services which will be provided by the authority.</P>
      <P>In this case, Limerick County Council has indicated its intention to develop a landfill site for waste in the western part of the county.  The council has also indicated that, following examination of some 60 potential locations, a site in the Slieve Felim mountains has been selected for further investigation.  Consultants engaged by the council are currently assessing the suitability of the site for use as a landfill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Limerick County Council decides to proceed with the development of a landfill facility at the site, it will be obliged, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, to submit the proposal to the Minister for the Environment for certification.  The application for certification will have to be accompanied by a detailed environmental impact statement which will describe the likely effects which the proposed development would have on the surrounding environment, <Col N="1155" /> and the measures which would be taken to avoid, reduce or remedy these effects.  The local authority would be obliged to make the statement available to all interested parties for inspection or purchase and any person could make written observations and submissions to the Minister who would be obliged to take them into account during consideration of the matter.  It would be a matter for the Minister in due course to decide whether to issue certification, with or without modifications, following consideration of all the material made available to him in accordance with the regulations.  It would be inappropriate for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, or me to comment further on the matter at this stage in view of the Minister's role as the certifying authority for such a development, if the council decides to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Waste Management Bill, 1995, which has been passed by Dáil Éireann and is currently being considered by this House, provides for an extensive system of planning, supervision and control in relation to waste management facilities.  Under the Bill the Environmental Protection Agency will be given responsibility for the licensing, on an ongoing basis, of waste recovery and disposal facilities, including local authority landfills.  This will ensure that high standards apply to <Col N="1156" /> the design, management and operation, closure and aftercare of such facilities. Section 62 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, already requires the agency to draw up criteria and procedures for the selection, management, operation and termination of landfill sites.  The task is being addressed by the agency on an ongoing basis and will be the subject of eight or more technical manuals.  Senators may wish to note that that first two of these manuals were published by the agency today and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
