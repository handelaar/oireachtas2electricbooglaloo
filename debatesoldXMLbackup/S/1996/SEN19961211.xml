      <P>I have notice from Senator Rory Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to guarantee that beef prices will be maintained or improved in the spring of 1997, thereby ensuring that farmers who winter fatten cattle will not be disadvantaged financially.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide £2.6 million in the capital programme for the provision of a library and administration building at Sligo regional technical college.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Calnan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to ensure that the remedial works for which he has already provided money will get under way in order to prevent flooding of houses, business premises, private property and roads in the Long Bridge, Dunmanway area, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide the necessary funding to the Irish Wheelchair Association for its proposed national respite and holiday centre at Donamon, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> The need for the Minister for Health to make a decision regarding the provision of a formal personal assistant service to enable people with disabilities to live independently; and if he will establish an independent living fund.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to respond to a request from Clondalkin Chamber of Commerce concerning the need for the CCTV surveillance system to be constructed in Clondalkin village and that it be given priority in terms of her Department's budget and spending allocations for 1997.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Enright of the following matter:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if she is aware of the conditions at Tullamore Garda station, particularly in regard to fire safety at the station, and in view of the increased number of personnel employed at the station if she will ensure that major improvement works are immediately carried out.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make finance available for the upgrading of Castlebar swimming pool.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to make a statement on the present status of the CIE site at Horgans Quay, Cork; and if there has been any interest shown by people in purchasing and developing it.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Kiely's and Senator Reynolds' matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2, 3 and 26, motion 24.  Item 1 will be taken until 1 p.m. and it is hoped to complete all Stages, with not more than 15 minutes for each speaker.  Item 2 will commence at 2 p.m. and will be taken until the conclusion of Second Stage.  I understand few speakers are offering at this point and it should conclude quickly.  Second Stage of item 3, a Fianna Fáil Bill, will be taken immediately after the conclusion of item 2 until 6 p.m.  It is hoped to complete Second Stage.  Item 26, motion 24, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>My office has not yet received an amendment to item 26, motion 24.  Will the Leader clarify the position in that regard?</P>
      <P>I commend all those associated with yesterday's announcement of new jobs in the Dublin area.  I am aware of today's report in relation to the western seaboard and the House should have an opportunity to discuss it early in the new year.  However, it is important to give credit where it is due regarding the IDA's work on inward investment in the Dublin area against massive foreign competition in terms of the major announcements yesterday.</P>
      <P>Many Senators on this side have requested on several occasions a debate on the National Roads Authority.  In light of the major increase in funding for non-national roads in the Estimates, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue.  Many Senators would welcome such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider the forthcoming electoral Bill which has been discussed in many places.  I do not intend to preempt the discussion, but there is much cynicism about this matter.  The arguments for and against the Bill will be dealt with when it reaches the House but, before it is published, the Government should formally ask Members of both Houses for their views.  It is not that anyone wants to pull fast electoral tricks.  If doing the right thing feeds cynicism and results in less rather than more participation, we will have done a bad day's work.  We need to coolly look at the problems which are likely to be created.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that in the next Bill he publishes, every candidate will get an equal chance.  Those of us on the Independent benches in Seanad Éireann felt out in the cold the last time despite our views on the Bill.  I ask that a consultative process be considered.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention the level of support for Members of this and the other House.  The Government has a position on the development and modernisation of the public service and the public sector.  Every Member should use information technology; there should be an IT link between their office and home.  The Minister should ask the Department of Enterprise and Employment to put in train arrangements so that there is an IT link between a Member's office and home.  It would allow the easy transmission of information from the Seanad Office to Members quickly, and with less trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that is the place to raise it.  However, there is a need to raise it in the House also.  Public representatives should be models of good practice by introducing, using and participating in information technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>What action does the Leader propose to take if names of Seanad Members rather than Dáil Members appear in the Price Waterhouse/Dunnes Stores report?  I noted yesterday that, for the first time in the Dáil, reference was made to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Everything I heard until then excluded any reference to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Is it appropriate for the Dáil to tell the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges what it should do?  Surely, we should regulate our affairs?  Is it intended to hold a meeting of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss this matter?  If it is decided to take action, what can we do?  That is a matter to which the committee will have to give some thought. Will the Leader confirm that this is a matter for the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and not the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis.  If the issue of disciplining Senators arises, it should be a matter for the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Either there is a joint Committee on Procedure and Privileges on these matters or the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges should act on behalf of and investigate and discipline its Members.  That is only fair and correct, otherwise there is no point having a Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>On the question of information technology raised by Senator O'Toole, he will be happy to know a consultants' report is being prepared at present which includes IT in Leinster House.  Part of this falls under the remit of the Oireachtas Joint Services Committee.  I agree with the Senator that this is long overdue.  He will remember the Leader presented a report to the House on the Library and information technology.  We have been unsuccessful in getting it implemented but I hope there will be some movement before the dust settles on the 27th Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent statistics have shown an alarming increase in the number of attacks on women.  The seriousness of the problem was brought home to us by the murder of a lady in my constituency last week.  Will the Leader of the House consider holding a wide ranging debate on the increase in the number of attacks on women and the causes of that increase?  During the debate on the reporting of incest cases in the courts, an interesting and rare speech on the subject was delivered by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Minister said at the time that she had commissioned a research study on the possible links between, for eample, the media and violence.  It would be appropriate for the Seanad to hold a wide ranging and philosophical debate on this serious problem, especially in view of the increase in violence against women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we debated European Monetary Union and the single currency but the time provided was not sufficient to enable every Member who wished to participate.  In addition, a number of points and questions were addressed to the Minister for Finance but, because time ran out, he did not have an opportunity to respond. At the conclusion of the debate the Cathaoirleach expressed the hope that the debate would be resumed, but it has disappeared from the Order Paper.  I ask the Leader of the House to restore it to the Order Paper.  For a debate of that nature to be successful in all its aspects, it is important that the Minister have the opportunity to respond to the queries raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>The references of Senator O'Toole and Senator Magner to the role of information technology are reminders of the degree of blockage that has occurred in that area. A motion proposed by Senator Magner and Senator Manning was before the House at least two years ago, when Senator Manning was Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad.  It is unbelievable that there could be such delay in this relatively simple matter.  If this were a commercial organisation the decision would have been implemented very quickly.  If Members of the status and influence of Senator Manning and Senator Magner have been unable to move faster &mdash; and I am not blaming them &mdash; there must be active resistance to it.  Where are the blockages occurring?  Why is this development not happening faster?  The Leader of the House must ensure the blockages are removed.  If the public knew the primitive conditions in which Members of the Oireachtas must operate, it would suffice to make the Oireachtas a laughing stock if nothing else did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange an urgent debate on the problems in Northern Ireland?  The situation is bogged down in megaphone and telephone diplomacy and that is not a role this House should adopt.  Surely this House can offer a contribution or recommendation?  We are at least on a par with other organisations which are interviewed daily in the media and I am tired of looking at television pictures which feature rocket launchers in the background.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking a debate on Northern Ireland.  I also want the Leader to contact people in the media who are responsible for showing background pictures of paramilitaries in action with rocket launchers, rifles and weapons of every type.  Such pictures are a deterrent to the public which is already frightened there will be another outbreak of violence in the North.  This House has been silent on the matter, apart from a couple of requests for a debate.  I appeal to the Leader to let this House <Col N="1018" /> have a voice and make a recommendation or contribution of some kind.  Most us are aware of the situation on the ground in Northern Ireland and we are entitled to express our views in the Seanad.  That is why we were elected and I ask the Leader to give us an opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social Welfare to examine the position of women working in the home?  I emphasise the word &ldquo;working&rdquo;.  Women who do not draw unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or other social welfare payments are debarred from participating on training schemes.  This is discrimination.  I ask the Leader to impress on the Minister the vital importance of allowing women working in the home to go on these training programmes if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the relevant agencies the contents of the damning report which shows the west is the poor relation in terms of job creation in recent times?  The imbalance shown in the report is an indictment of the Government and these agencies.  While we welcome the job creation in Dublin and on the east coast in the last few days, more than 50 per cent of those who take up those jobs will come from the west, thus creating more pressure for the system in Dublin. The Minister should bring more balance into job creation in the interest of development of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to consult the Minister for the Environment regarding the recent decision of the Cavan County Manager to contest in the High Court a case to prove his liability to fill the potholes in the county.  This is the most obscene thing I have heard in recent years.  It is totally inappropriate that a senior official should spend taxpayers' money in court to defend himself against doing something for which he is liable.  I understand he intends pursuing the case to the Supreme Court.  I ask the Minister to stop this nonsense and to tell the Cavan County Manager to do the job he is employed to do and stop wasting taxpayers' money.  That applies to other county managers also.  The public should not have to take the most senior official in a county to court in order to have basic road works carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party spokesperson on Northern Ireland I add my voice to the call for a debate on this subject.  We may not be able to influence the course of negotiations, and we would not take that role on ourselves in any event, but there are points we could usefully make.  We could express our total rejection of and abhorrence at sectarian attacks on churchgoers, which cannot be tolerated anywhere in the civilised world.  We could also indicate our approval and support for those in the Protestant <Col N="1019" /> community who showed courage in dissociating themselves from such behaviour.  We could make a useful contribution to the ongoing debate without intruding on the negotiation process, which is not at a positive stage.</P>
      <P>Like my party leader in the Dáil, I have only one position on the matter of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I want full disclosure at all stages from all parties and there should be no barrier on such disclosure from the earliest moment.  Whatever can be done to achieve that should be done as quickly as possible in the interest of vindicating public life in Ireland.  In that context, it is understandable that people are sensitive about the Dáil interfering with the Seanad.  It is extraordinary that, in the other House, the Taoiseach failed to disclose, in the course of a week long debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask you to put a question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader inquire from the Taoiseach why he failed to disclose to the Dáil that he personally had solicited funds and that his Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Minister for Health had benefited and, almost treating the Oireachtas with contempt, acknowledge it in a television interview at the end of the week?  That question has to be asked and answered; democratic accountability should be discharged in the Oireachtas, not on RTÉ.  I hope that matter will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the obvious success of the initiative that is being taken on traffic free-flow in Dublin, will the controversial Luas plan, which would be very expensive, be shelved as there is no agreement on it?  Will we have gardaí deployed in the country towns where we have problems?</P>
      <P>There is a major issue in Cork county at the moment regarding electro-magnetic radiation and the fears that have been generated as a result of the ESB plans to put a major development between Aghada and the lower harbour.  Has there ever been any scientific analysis or investigation into whether such fears are justified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have the Luas relocated to Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the Opposition in welcoming the tremendous number of jobs which will be created in north Dublin and the record this year of both the Industrial Development Board and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in the number of jobs that have been attracted against very intense foreign competition.  It is something in which we can all take pride and comfort.  I think I would be <Col N="1020" /> right in sending the congratulations of the House to the Minister and to the IDA.</P>
      <P>I take the point raised by Senator Wright and Senator Finneran about the report on developments in the western seaboard area.  The fact that the report is there should be seen as a prelude to further action and investment in trying to provide jobs and I would be happy, early in the next session, to have a full debate on that topic.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright also raised the question of a debate on the National Roads Authority.  I am disappointed that I have not been able to have that debate up to now, but it is something for which I will provide time.  I am sorry it has not happened up to now.</P>
      <P>He also raised the question regarding item 26, motion 24.  As the Senator appreciates, as yet I do not have the same level of strategic advice that I was used to in handling these matters but I am sure he will not be unhappy with the way the matter is handled.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the electoral Bill, its contents and the desirability of asking the views of both Houses.  I would welcome that and I could make time available next week if there was agreement in the House that such contributions would be useful.  Perhaps we can discuss the matter later.</P>
      <P>He also raised the question of IT and the provision of resources for Members, allied to the question of the Library which Senator Lee raised.  It is an important issue.  As Leader of the House I had a discussion on this matter recently with senior officials in the Office of Public Works who wanted to get my views arising out of the earlier report.  The most useful thing we could do now is to ask the officials of the Office of Public Works, who have very elaborate plans in preparation for the redevelopment of the Library and the provision of proper Library resources, to address these plans to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who can then relay them to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee is quite right; this matter has taken far too long.  However, much work is being done behind the scenes to decide how a full integrated library and research service can be provided and it would be worthwhile to get an update on that.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Magner raised the important issue of what might happen should the names of Members of this House appear on the Price Waterhouse list and if we are informed of this by Judge Buchanan.  This should be a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I will formally ask the Cathaoirleach to convene a meeting of that committee so we can get legal advice on this matter.  I agree with Senator Magner and Senator Dardis.  We should discuss the matter fully in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised the question of attacks on women and violence generally and I would be happy to accede to his request for a wide ranging philosophic debate, as he called it, on this matter. It might be useful to invite the Commissioner of <Col N="1021" /> the Garda Síochána to attend such a debate so there can be a degree of informed interaction between the Commissioner and Members of the House.  I thank the Senator for his suggestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard raised the question of the European Monetary Union debate.  I understand that the debate has not yet concluded.  Senator Howard is not correct in saying there was insufficient time last week.  My understanding is that the debate ended that day with some time remaining as not enough speakers were offering. I have been informed that other speakers would like to contribute to that debate so it should be reasonably simple either to restore that matter to the order paper or find another form of words so the debate can continue.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan and Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of a debate on Northern Ireland.  I will try to organise one for next week although I cannot promise this.  The Tánaiste has an extremely heavy workload at this time arising from the summit and matters related to the last few weeks of the Irish Presidency.  However, if it can be done it will be done.  I will pass Senator McDonagh's suggestions on to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Senator Finneran raised the question of the Cavan County Manager.  I do not have any function in this matter but I note the robust remarks the Senator made and do not disagree with them very much.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  On a matter like this, full disclosure means full, not selective, disclosure.  The other House is to come to a decision this evening as to how it will handle the matter and we should await that decision. Nobody in this House or the other House should be afraid of the fullest possible disclosure.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your recent election and wish you a long and successful tenure in your high office.</P>
      <P>This is a technical Bill and should not be controversial.  It provides for a number of small but important amendments to the Milk Regulation of Supply) Act, 1994, which provided for the abolition of the Cork and the Dublin District Milk Boards and the establishment of the National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the State. It also provided for the sale of the former boards' ancillary businesses and included certain provisions to protect the interests of the staff affected by the abolition of the former boards and the sale of the businesses.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to say that, in all the most important respects, this Act has worked very well. The milk boards were abolished and their ancillary businesses sold as going concerns.  The National Milk Agency was established and, I am glad to say, is operating very effectively.  All the main objectives of the Act have been achieved.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to resolve a few small problems of a technical nature which have emerged over time and to make some small but important improvements in certain areas.  The first amendment concerns the disposal of the businesses and assets of the former boards.  In order to protect the interests of the staff and to maintain employment at the highest possible level consistent with economic viability, it was decided that the old milk boards' ancillary businesses should be sold as going concerns.  The boards' businesses were overstaffed and making financial losses.  A staff rationalisation programme was agreed with staff representatives which provided that a certain number would be offered voluntary early retirement and the remainder would transfer to the employ of the new owners on the sale of the businesses.  I am pleased to say that the whole operation was completed without any compulsory redundancy.</P>

    <P>As provided for in the Act, I established an interim board to oversee the management of the businesses in the period leading up to the sale and also to be responsible for the sale itself.  The sale took place by tender.  Progressive Genetic Cooperative Society, which was representative of the milk suppliers in the former Dublin board's region, were successful in acquiring the business of the former Dublin board while the former Cork board's business went to Pendine Investments Limited, a consortium comprising Progressive Genetics, Dairygold and the South Western Cattle Breeders Society.  The interim board was advised that a better return could be achieved for the State by selling one of the assets, a premises in Cork city which had been the <Col N="1023" /> headquarters of the former Cork board, separately from the ancillary business.  A small technical amendment to the Act is necessary to allow conclusion of the sale of this property purely for its asset value rather than as part of a going business concern.</P>
    <P>The interim board consists of two civil servants from the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry, respectively, and a chairman from the private sector.  As Senators will have gathered from what I have already said, the work of this board is largely concluded.  The board itself is of the view that the time for its dissolution is approaching and I accept this view. However, there are a few residual business matters still outstanding and it is not easy to establish a time scale for their completion.</P>
    <P>The Act itself already makes provision for the abolition of the board but not for the conduct of any business it might leave unfinished.  Rather than leaving the board in existence to deal with a trickle of outstanding business, I want to clear the way for its abolition by providing that any business it may leave unfinished, any assets unrealised or any liabilities undischarged, shall become the responsibility of my Department.  I want to stress that I am very pleased with the way the interim board has carried out its work and this amendment is solely to ensure that there will be no lacunae after it is dissolved.</P>
    <P>There are some amendments concerned with the election of producer representatives to the board of the National Milk Agency.  Senators will remember that the Principal Act provides for the registration of milk producers who are party to a registered contract and the election of producer representatives to the board of the agency by those registered producers.  However, when the contracts came to be registered it was noted that in some cases there was more than one person named as the producer and all parties to the contract were registered in the Register of Producers.  This meant that, in some cases, there would be more than one person entitled to vote in respect of the same contract.  This is obviously unfair.  To remedy that, it is proposed to amend the Act to provide that, where more than one person is named as the producer in a contract, the person whose name appears first will be regarded as the principal producer and will be entitled to vote in an election of producer representatives. This is just a step which must be taken to ensure fairness in an election.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of ensuring regional balance in the producer representation on the agency.  At present, the industry is structured so that there is a number of large-scale pasteurisers, mostly in the eastern region, with a big number of suppliers.  On the other hand, there is a considerably larger number of small-scale establishments in other regions with fewer suppliers.  The agency has expressed the fear that. if the entire electorate is to form one constituency, the suppliers to the large-scale <Col N="1024" /> establishments will predominate in securing representation on the agency, to the virtual exclusion of suppliers to the small-scale firms.  I accept this could be the case and, to prevent it, it is proposed to amend the Act to allow the electorate to be divided into constituencies.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of representation on the board of the agency.  During the debate in the Dáil, the matter of representation by consumers on the agency was discussed.  It was suggested that the existing number of such representatives be increased.  I was pleased to agree that a provision be included in the Bill that the number of consumers should be not fewer than two which is twice the current representation.  As the main role of the agency is to ensure the all year-round supply of drinking milk, it is appropriate that consumers, who are the main beneficiaries of such a system, would be adequately represented on the agency.  I am of the view that two representatives would be of great benefit to the agency in carrying out its work.</P>
    <P>The <i>per capita</i> consumption of drinking milk in Ireland is among the highest in the world.  There are benefits from this both for the economy, given the important role of milk in Irish agriculture, and the health of our people, given the nutritional value of milk as a food product. We want to preserve this situation and that means ensuring an all year-round supply of fresh, high quality and reasonably priced milk for liquid consumption.  It is in this context that I intend to increase consumer representation and am confident that this amendment will find favour with Senators.  On Committee Stage, I will table a minor technical amendment which will tidy up, from a legal draftsman's view, the wording of the point relating to increased consumer representation.</P>
    <P>These are the measures in the Bill before the House.  They are relatively minor to the extent that they do not entail any changes of policy or any radical alteration in the means of achieving policy objectives.  Nevertheless, they are important in ensuring the effective and efficient achievement of the goals already laid down.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing controversial in this legislation and I have no difficulties with it. It has taken some time for it to pass through both Houses since the original Bill to abolish the boards was initiated.  One of the problems at the time, of which the Minister was well aware, was the status of staff.  I am pleased to see there were no compulsory redundancies and that the staff's concerns were addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a query about the first-named person on the contract being the person to vote.  I understand the reasons for it and do not oppose it.  However, if a husband and wife were tenants in common or joint owners of a farm with a large contract and hence the people registered on the contract, it seems as if they lose out in that one <Col N="1025" /> person with a small contract would have the same single vote as these two people with a large contract.  I am uneasy about this although I understand the reasons for it.  Legally we do not know whether those people would be treated as joint owners, so we are stipulating that it has to be the first named person on the contract.  I hope the elections will proceed quickly.  The Bill is technical legislation which is not contentious.  It completes the process of dissolving the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards and replacing them with a National Milk Agency.</P>
    <P>There have been failures in our stewardship of certain areas of agriculture, such as the recent controversies regarding antibiotics in pork. However, this can not be said about the milk sector.  Through self-regulation, including strict penalties for the abuse of antibiotics, the dairy industry has achieved a high health status in the national herd.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of the high quality milk we produce.  One of the reasons for this is the pooled collection system.  If there is one bad apple in the barrel that producer impacts negatively on his neighbours.  The same impact is not as evident in beef production, even though a producer who abuses growth promoters can affect the overall industry.</P>
    <P>We have a high quality milk product which has benefited from the rationalisation of the creameries.  It is a forward looking industry which can make a significant contribution to the welfare of the nation.  The liquid milk producers have made a significant impact on the country's economy and ensured a year round supply of high quality milk.  This is a significant achievement and there is a long history of producing milk to high standards in which the consumer can have confidence.  We hear a lot about the primacy of the consumer and this is as it should be.  This is an industry where that primacy has been evident for many years.</P>
    <P>The old division between liquid and creamery producers is breaking down.  As a result we should be moving towards a single system of registration for milk producers.  The arguments in favour of traceability in the beef industry should be applied to the milk industry.  We need to be consistent and every milk producer should be registered.  There is traceability in that the dairy takes a sample from each producer; however, a single State system of registration would be sensible if we are serious about traceability and consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The quota system has served us well.  However, the enlargement of the EU and the next world trade round will place that system under scrutiny and there will be a battle to maintain it in its present form.  To what extent is it to the national benefit to maintain it in its present form?  I can understand that if the quota system were abolished, there would be a major shake up in the industry.  Smaller producers would need to be protected in those circumstances but we have <Col N="1026" /> producers who could compete successfully with producers anywhere and given the chance they would do so.</P>
    <P>One of the great deficiencies of the quota system is that when the market signals an increase in production, Ireland plc, so to speak, is constrained in terms of being able to respond to that.  Americans and New Zealanders are the people who benefit nationally and not us.  There is no reason to believe that at the more efficient end of the dairy industry in Ireland we could not compete successfully with these people.  To a certain degree it would be in the national interest to have a liberalisation of the quota regime.  I accept there would be a fall out for smaller producers and a system would need to be devised to protect them.  If we look at the question of enlargement and at what happened to milk production in eastern Europe, there would be serious consequences if a quota system were imposed on eastern Europe as milk production there declined by 25 per cent as a result of the destruction of the command economy model. How will we reconcile that with a continuation of a quota system in the more developed countries of an enlarged Union?</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy will come under review in the next decade by virtue of enlargement, the next trade round and the cost to the European budget of support for agriculture in the enlarged Community.  At a recent conference on regional development in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham it was stated that 12 billion ecus per year is required to fund the CAP eastwards.  That is a significant amount of money and the only way it can be funded is through an increase in the European budget.  One wonders about the will of the paymasters in Germany and elsewhere to fund that type of increase, although it is the German will to have political development to the east to ensure its eastern flank is protected, so to speak, that is driving the train to European enlargement.  Perhaps Germany would be prepared to pick up some of the extra costs.  In global terms, while this is a significant amount of money, it is not a severe burden on the budgets of the wealthier states. Consumers in the east spend a large proportion of their income on food because they have low incomes in the first place.  If a regime is imposed which increases food prices rapidly, there will be serious political fall out in those countries.</P>
    <P>We have reached the point where we will have to debate what will be done in the event of enlargement and in anticipation of the next trade round.  We are coming close to those deadlines. I encourage the Minister to have a meaningful national debate on these issues.  In the agricultural sector, the IFA has carried out the greatest amount of analysis and has had the most public debate on the issue and the Agricultural Science Association's conference last year in Kilkenny addressed some of these issues.</P>
    <P>There should be wider public and political debate.  I look forward to developing these more <Col N="1027" /> fundamental issues at a later date when we consider enlargement and the world trade round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much debate on this issue.  I intend to dwell on the dairy industry in general.  The Bill is designed to deal with technical problems that have arisen following the disposal of the Dublin and Cork district milk boards.  I have no difficulties with the points made by the Minister, especially with regard to the consumer; we are all aware of the issue of consumer confidence regarding food.</P>
      <P>As a member of these boards over many years I can confirm that there have always been problems regarding the elections.  It is right to ensure that these are resolved in advance, rather than having to address them as they arise.</P>
      <P>The dairy industry is one of the economy's strongest and most valuable assets.  It provides for liquid milk and a huge volume of manufacturing milk.  It also provide one million steers for the export market.  Indeed, it is impossible to put a figure, with any degree of accuracy, on the value of the national herd to the economy.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the quota system in 1984, producers have had to take a reduction of approximately 9 per cent, despite problems with transport to the market.  This has resulted in great expense because of production requirements to stay within the quota system.  During the debate in 1984, in which I participated, undertakings were given that following the raising of consumption of milk products, markets would be secured in other areas and the quotas would be extended.  However, unfortunately, this has not happened and is not likely to happen.  I fail to understand how other countries, some of them in the EU, have increased their production.  For example, the Italian quota has increased by approximately 10 per cent and the Greek by 16 to 18 per cent.  This does not make sense.  At the same time, some American countries, Australia and New Zealand have also increased their volumes of production, both during and after the GATT agreement.  Will the Minister provide figures on this, as we have great difficulty obtaining them?</P>
      <P>There are three main areas of concern with regard to the EU dairy hygiene regulations: the somatic cell count, bacteria count and antibiotics. The most important one from the producers' viewpoint is the somatic cell count.  Prior to the introduction of this regulation, the somatic cell count was approximately 1.2 million units.  The regulation requires that all milk producers reduce the cell count to 400,000 units.  I am glad to say that 95 per cent of farmers have now achieved that level in a very short period.  However, it was not achieved without incurring serious expense. In most cases, herd culls have been approximately 35 per cent, although they have been as high as 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some instances, the regulation has resulted in a reduction in the number of lactations in herds <Col N="1028" /> from nine to six.  This has proved to be very expensive for producers because farmers had to dispose of cows in their herds.  It was impossible to put a figure on the expense involved because this was done over a very short period of four to five years.  A simple explanation is that we must replace older cows with younger stock to maintain those standards.  The time when farmers could retain cows for up to nine or ten lactations is over; they are now down to about six lactations if they are to maintain a standard of 400,000 units as far as the sematic cell count is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad we can say in this Chamber that there are no antibiotics in either manufacturing or liquid milk, which is very satisfactory as far as milk producers, processors and, more importantly, consumers are concerned.  This has also been achieved at great expense to producers.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the bacteria count.  Practically 98 per cent of producers, both liquid and manufacturing, have reached the premier grade as far as milk is concerned.  This is very satisfactory but it has not been brought about by just dreams and imagination.  It has been brought about by the modernisation of milking parlours, cubicle houses, slatted units and the surroundings in which cows are kept &mdash; whether in housing, padded grazing or laneways leading to those premises.  Farmers have gone to enormous expense over the last six to seven years to achieve these standards, and in certain cases they continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of rumbling at the moment by the processors, in particular, that attempts are being made to bring down the price of milk.  I warned them that farmers, by and large, have responded to demands laid down by EU regulations and they are not prepared to accept any substantial reduction in the price of milk.  The return to the producer has taken a substantial reduction in the last five to six years.  Six or seven years ago the consumer contributed about 47 per cent of the total cost; unfortunately this has now been reduced to 38 per cent, and I can stand over those figures.  This unacceptable situation cannot be allowed to further deteriorate.  I warned the processors that farmers are not prepared to tolerate substantial reductions in the price of the raw material, which is milk.</P>
    <P>We saw what happened in the beef industry when costs went from £1.05 per pound to 80p per pound but the consumer benefited only marginally.  The price of beef has increased to 90p &mdash; and in some cases up to 95p &mdash; per pound but there has still been no change in the price to the consumer.  In that instance the processors have been very unfair to the producers and we are not going to allow the same thing to happen in the milk industry.</P>
    <P>We are now working on a quota system which is regulated by the EU and we are not allowed to produce a gallon of milk over that quota.  There are also rumblings from the Department in relation to the super levy.  As a milk producer, I tell him not to worry about the producers because <Col N="1029" /> they have their own way of regulating that situation, which they have done over the years.  I accept that some super levy was due last year &mdash; it is about 33,000 million gallons over quota at the moment &mdash; which will cost a substantial amount of money.  However, while I accept there will be some over-supply, producers can reduce the volume of milk in January, February and March.</P>
    <P>I have made these points to ensure the Minister, the Minister of State and Commissioner Fischler are clearly in the picture as far as milk producers are concerned.  It is a very valuable industry and we cannot allow those on the processing side to damage the incomes of those on the production side, in view of the very serious expense they have undertaken over the past six or seven years.  We can stand up in any forum and say we have the highest quality milk in Europe. Therefore, we cannot at this stage accept any reduction in the price to the producer.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill.  I am a milk producer and I have no problems with it.  The Minister has my full support for the few small amendments to the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for a number of small amendments to the Act, which we support.  The Minister stated that the 1994 Act &ldquo;provided for the abolition of the Cork and Dublin District Milk Boards and the establishment of the National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the State&rdquo;.  The most important aspect of the original Act was to regulate the supply and distribution of liquid milk.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated: &ldquo;I am pleased to say that, in all the most important aspects, this Act has worked very well&rdquo;.  I am sure it has but I am also sure that sections of it might not be too pleasing.  Senator D'Arcy referred to how hard it is to supply milk and the high quality of our milk. Our milk is of first class quality due to the response of our dairy farmers to EU regulations.</P>
      <P>Section 6(2) of the 1994 Act states the contract shall be one which:</P>
      <P>.....</P>
      <P>(b)  provides for supply all the year round by the producer of raw milk with a specified minimum percentage of the producer's production being supplied during a prescribed period (&ldquo;the winter months&rdquo;) or for supply during the winter months only;</P>
      <P>(c)  in the opinion of the Agency, provides adequate compensation to the producer for raw milk supplied under contract throughout the year, taking into account, in particular, in relation to the winter months, the economic cost of production of raw milk of suitable quality for heat treatment for liquid consumption all the year round;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  in respect of every year of its existence after the first year, is supplemented by an agreement by the parties submitted to the <Col N="1030" /> Agency not later than the end of June in that year which, in the opinion of the Agency, provides sufficient guarantee that adequate compensation will be made to the producer for raw milk supplied under the contract during the following winter months taking into account, in particular, in relation to the winter months, the economic cost of production of raw milk of suitable quality for heat treatment for liquid consumption all the year round.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with adequate compensation.  Is there a uniform system of adequate compensation for suppliers of liquid milk?  Do co-operatives and liquid milk processors have the same system of adequate compensation in all areas?  Producers, particularly of manufacturing milk, cannot supply as much milk in the summer as other producers because they have to calve their cows in November and October to ensure adequate supply for consumers in the winter period and they should receive some compensation in the summer months.  I speak for the vast majority of liquid milk producers &mdash; which is what the Bill is about &mdash; who do not believe the compensation is adequate.  The Minister and the National Milk Agency should ensure there is adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>The first purpose of the Bill is to sell the building in Cork as an asset rather than a going concern, a move with which we all agree.  The second purpose is to amend the provision relating to the election of producers.  This is the third amending Bill to the original 1994 legislation. Almost a year ago, on 20 December 1995, I said in the House:</P>
    <P>I am not sure if a Bill similar to this asking for the elections to be delayed until 1997 might not come this time next year.</P>
    <P>My prophecy has been proved correct.  I envisaged that the elections would not be held in 1996.  However, I doubt there will be another amending Bill and I am confident that they will be held in 1997.  It was suggested that there were complications regarding the register of producers but I am sure they will be ironed out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment the Minister accepted in the other House from the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, that the number of consumer representatives should be increased from one to two.  I compliment the Deputy on tabling the amendment and the Minister for accepting it.  We depend on consumers and their concerns must be respected.  They must receive top quality milk and they are getting it because of the standard of milk produced in Ireland.  It is correct that consumers should be adequately represented in the milk agency.</P>
    <P>Although this is a technical Bill, the debate provides an opportunity for an overview of the dairy industry.  In that respect, it is timely given the mounting difficulties in the industry.  The number of milk producers is likely to decline from approximately 41,000 in 1994 to 30,000 by the year 2000.  The policy of strict control of milk <Col N="1031" /> output in the superlevy regime, while maintaining the incomes of those lucky enough to have a decent milk quota, will ultimately lead to a declining and stagnating industry.  Since the quota regime was introduced in 1994, the national milk quota has been reduced by 9 per cent, despite a recognition of the special position of Ireland, its dependence on dairying and that is a peripheral European island.</P>
    <P>It was promised priority access to future quota allocations when the quota regime was introduced.  However, as Senator D'Arcy said, in the meantime the Italian quota has increased by 11 per cent while the Greek quota has increased by 20 per cent.  The Minister should address this serious anomaly and use his clout as the President of the European Council of Agriculture Ministers to ensure it is corrected.</P>
    <P>Regarding the superlevy and the major problem of temporary leasing, dairy farmers' superlevy fines are heading for a record £33 million this year.  This will also cause problems for those who entered contracts with agencies for the supply of liquid milk.  Section 6(1) of the 1994 Act states:</P>
    <P>The Agency shall, on the application of either party, register a contract for the supply of raw milk for heat treatment for liquid consumption made between a producer and a processor provided the requirements of this section are complied with.</P>
    <P>I am aware that producers have entered contracts to supply a certain amount of milk, perhaps 100 gallons a day, during the winter months.  If they do not have other quotas, they will find this impossible because they will be fined to such an extent that it will not be worth their while to produce the milk under contract.  They will also lose their contracts for future years.  This is a serious matter and should be addressed in the light of the superlevy problems and because it might leave consumers without sufficient liquid milk during the winter months.</P>
    <P>More quotas are needed and the failure of the Minister to pursue this issue is a disgrace given the plight of small dairy farmers.  In addition, a new generation of young dynamic farmers could avail of the opportunity to produce milk if extra quotas were available.  Many small diary and young farmers who are anxious to embark on dairy farming enterprises are on the breadline. Their names will not appear in the newspapers or in the Price Waterhouse report as having received £5 million from Ben Dunne.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the wrongs in the other industry.  There is a marked contrast between the dairy and the beef and pigmeat industries.  We should ask ourselves why there is so little fraud or improper practices in the dairy industry when they are so widespread in other parts of agriculture.  There are no antibiotics in milk because the system ensures that farmers found guilty of using them are fined so heavily <Col N="1032" /> that they make sure not to use them again.  This gives confidence to consumers that the milk produced in Ireland is of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the justice system is dealing with those found guilty of providing or using growth promoters for profit.  Another problem is the use of antibiotics in the meat industry and the Minister was very slow in getting to grips with it. The major difference is that the dairy processing industry is dominated by co-operatives.  There is accountability in this industry but, by and large, there is none in the beef and much of the pigmeat industries.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and the amendments are necessary.  The Minister said he would introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to increase the number of consumer representatives from one to two.  What will be the composition of the milk agency?  How many producer and processing representatives will be included?  Will the existing number increase?  The Minister said that because of the fear that too many producer representatives will be elected from one part of the country he has decided to have constituency elections.  What constituencies does the Minister envisage and will this be acceptable to producers? How will the constituencies be established?  I welcome this technical Bill and have no problem accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to contribute to the debate.  There is nothing controversial in the Bill which has the support of my party.  It is largely technical legislation that could be said to be a tidying up exercise.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the quota system which regulates the milk supply and which is coming up for review in the year 2000.  At present 25 per cent of milk is produced by dormant milk producers.  A dormant milk producer does not keep, feed or milk cows, but they get up to £300 per week under this system; we must look at it. Some active milk producers must pay up to 50p per gallon to dormant milk producers for the privilege of producing milk.  Included in this group are many young farmers who have put in place coolers and have done everything possible as regards dairy hygiene.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the quota system will be changed.  We should ensure any changes to the system are to the advantage of producers, the industry and consumers.  There is much evidence to suggest the consumer is paying too much for milk.  Some of the most progressive producers would like the quota system to be abolished but if that happened, it would be disastrous for others who have invested heavily in the industry because they were under the impression the quota system would last for a long time.  No matter what changes take place, there will be winners and losers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can produce milk at a lower cost than most other countries because of our climate.  We have a great advantage because our milk production system is based on grass.  Cows can eat grass when <Col N="1033" /> in fields and silage when housed.  Milk consumption has increased in Europe, America, Canada, Australia and the free world while beef consumption has decreased.  Under the present quota system we will not be able to take advantage of the increase in milk consumption because we will not be allowed to produce more. Radical changes are needed in the quota system but we will have to be careful if it is retained.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry and farmers' co-operatives have shown the way in terms of how an industry should be handled.  They raised standards, cut out malpractices and did not ask the taxpayer or a State body to do it.  They should be congratulated for acting in the national interest.  It would be good if I could say that those responsible for the beef industry acted in the same way as the farmers' co-operatives and those in charge of the dairy industry but unfortunately I cannot.  We should put on record our thanks to those in charge of the dairy industry for the wonderful job they have done.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions on the Order of Business I have asked for a debate on the milk quota system.  We have had debates on issues which were not as important to the national interest.  We should have a debate that is confined to the milk quota system at the earliest opportunity, I am sure Senator Rory Kiely would agree with that.  I have no problem with the Bill which has my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I do not have particular difficulties with the Bill which will tidy up some of the anomalies in the National Milk Agency legislation.  I wish to raise the issue of the milk quota regime and the seriousness of the situation for farmers in my constituency.  Since 1984 when the milk quota system was introduced 1,000 farmers in County Clare have gone out of milk production.  There are now 2,500 milk producers in County Clare and it is estimated that a further 1,000 farmers are at risk of going out of milk production over the next couple of years under the existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The most vulnerable section of the farming community, the small milk producer in the west, has been devastated.  Farmers' incomes, particularly in west County Clare which derived largely from milk production, have been devastated.  The situation is chronic.  Many of these farmers were heavily penalised because of the over-supply of what would be considered small amounts of milk in the overall context of milk supply in the Community and, indeed, in Ireland.  In 1993 when a detailed survey on retaining the maximum number milk suppliers in County Clare was undertaken by Leader and the rural resource development company, 43 per cent of farmers were supplying less than 9,000 gallons; 38 per cent were supplying between 9,000 and 20,000 gallons, while the remainder, 14 or 15 per cent, supplied in excess of 20,000 gallons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The devastation caused by the number of farmers who have gone out of business has been <Col N="1034" /> matched by the devastation in incomes for those who supply 43 per cent of milk in County Clare, that is, less than 9,000 gallons.  However, it will not stop here because, as I said, 1,000 farmers will be put out of business over the next couple of years under the existing arrangements.  What is causing most alarm is that the farming community is aware that EU regulations govern up to the year 2000 and that, with enlargement and further developments in milk production among our competitors in Europe, we will be placed at a further disadvantage.</P>
    <P>If we continue with the present policies, farmers whose income derives mainly from milk will be put out of business.  This does not not take into account the fact that a sizeable number of small farmers in livestock production wish to get involved in milk production.  A substantial investment is required to meet the European quality standards and regulations to which we want farmers to adhere.</P>
    <P>The survey conducted in Clare showed that about 75 per cent of farmers need to make investments, ranging from very small to very large, in order to meet EU quality regulations.  This imposes a further burden on people who are already seriously curtailed in the amount of income they can generate from the limited quotas available. That has not been helped by the stop, start policy with regard to grant schemes.  At present it appears that substantial moneys will not be claimed because no clear indication was given earlier in the year that grants would be available if farmers made such investments.</P>
    <P>The statutory instrument laid before the House in October last year gave effect to EU directives in this area.  However, we did not have an opportunity to debate the directives even though they are detailed and comprehensive.  In view of the speed at which the situation is changing, there is a necessity to put the management of the national milk quota on a statutory basis through new legislation.  Although S.I. 266 covers part of the existing position, there is an ongoing problem in this area that will get more acute and difficult for the people who are most vulnerable, the small farmers in western areas.  Therefore, it is necessary to put milk quota management on a statutory basis in the same way as the National Milk Agency was put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>New, progressive legislation is required which will take account of the special problems of small dairy producers who are dependent to a large extent on the income they derive from milk production to maintain their family farms.  Unless this happens there will be devastation in this area in forthcoming years.  A small number of producers will have a monopoly of the milk quota to the detriment of the vast majority of small dairy producers and their families.  No Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could accept such a situation.</P>
    <P>If the milk quota system in Europe is replaced or abolished between now and the year 2000 and <Col N="1035" /> milk prices drop drastically as a consequence, the outlook for small dairy producers will be bleak. The incomes which are so important for their survival in western areas will be devastated and they will be totally dependent on handouts from the Department of Social Welfare.  This is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.  I appeal to the Minister to take into account the special difficulties of small dairy farmers and to acknowledge the huge bills many of them have had to pay and which were deducted from their cheques by their co-operatives.  In many cases, the benefits accrued to larger producers, to the detriment of small producers, within the cooperative area.  This has put many small producers at severe financial risk as many of them have leased quotas and are now unable to pay for them.</P>
    <P>The House should be given an opportunity to debate S.I. 266.  This is also an opportune time to establish a milk quota management agency which would manage the current milk quota and examine future prospects so we plan for them. Such an agency should provide annual reports to show exactly what is happening in this area. Under the current arrangement there is a committee and an appeals board but we do not receive an annual report from them, as happens in the case of statutory agencies.  We are, therefore, in the dark about what is happening.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be a mechanism whereby people who are faced with severe losses can be compensated and in which latitude can be provided for farmers who must produce milk in order to survive.  Such farmers do not have any other means of increasing their incomes.  On behalf of my constituency, Clare, whose farmers are probably worst affected by the milk quota regime, I appeal to the Minister to seek a means of implementing some of the recommendations in the strategy for retaining milk suppliers in County Clare and avoid another 1,000 farmers in County Clare leaving milk production.  Urgent action must be taken to deal with this crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on this Bill.  I am concerned about the issue of milk production <i>vis-a-vis</i> the consumer. Previous legislation provided for the abolition of the Cork and Dublin milk boards and this legislation relates to that area.  It does not have a national concern.  The Minister never referred to the issue of imports and exports or to codes of control.  This is a narrowly focused Bill.  It is a temporary measure and its objective is to replace the two milk boards.  It does not tackle the main problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An opportunity has been missed to deal with an important industry.  It is related to the BSE issue in terms of public concern.  I live close to the Border and I am concerned about the import and export of milk.  People in County Donegal are reluctant to buy milk in the North for fear that it might come from an infected herd. <Col N="1036" /> However, up to ten tankers of milk come into Donegal each day from Northern Ireland as many producers there have milk quotas for co-operatives in the South.  This issue is not dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister of State should convey to the Department that there is concern not just about milk production in Dublin and Cork but about it as a whole, in terms of price, quality control and sales.</P>
    <P>The consumer is not sure about the price of milk.  It can vary from 65p to 116p for two litres. If the Department was concerned about the future of milk producers that matter would have merited attention but the price of milk was not mentioned.</P>
    <P>The new board must feature representation not from co-operatives or the Minister's nominees but from producers.  They should be aware of the quality and every other aspect of milk when it is brought to the consumer; a producer should not simply wait to have a set of regulations sent to him.  This Bill is a missed opportunity in that regard.  It is not too much to ask that every producer in the country, not just those with huge quotas, should elect representatives to the board. If that is done it will be easier to control the milk industry.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to clarify the position on the import and export of milk, as there appears be no regulations.  I know of at least five tankers of milk travelling from the North to the Republic every day but this Bill has no control over them. We should go straight to the creameries to establish control over milk being imported.  This milk comes to the South to be processed and is re-exported to the North to be retailed at 65 pence for two litres.  No one in this State can buy milk at that price.  When introducing the Bill, the Minister did not take the opportunity to state his concern about this urgent matter and since the legislation has a narrow focus it does not deal with it either.  The Bill should specify the percentage of milk to be used for purposes such as producing spread, margarine mix or oil.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the Bill but it only deals with a small aspect of the problem.  It covers the Dublin and Cork milk boards but does not seize the opportunity to deal with the production, control and retail price of milk.  To put it bluntly, it is negligent not to deal with a problem on which the public is crying out for control measures and clear statements.  Why has the Minister introduced such a narrow Bill?  He and the Department must know that this measure is not enough.  If there is a change of Government &mdash; which I hope there will be soon &mdash; I will press for a further Bill to deal effectively with the quality, price, importation and exportation of milk.  All that must be covered but apparently it will not be done by the present Administration; I hope it will happen in the future.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry I thank all <Col N="1037" /> Senators who contributed to this debate.  Their contributions reflected a deep and intimate knowledge of milk production, over-production, supply and demand.  While I was not here for the full debate I followed it on the monitor to get a flavour of the regulations.  When I was party spokesman on the food industry some years ago, discussions along these lines were taking place. The 1994 Act brought in the structures to enable this legislation to be introduced.  I will deal with some points raised by Senators, which should go some way towards addressing their concerns as experts in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's contribution dealt with some of the points raised by Senator Dardis, particularly as regards naming people on the contract and voting entitlements.  In respect of either a small or large contract, the first named person shall have one vote.  This amendment was put forward on the basis of legal advice.  If all persons named on the contract were allowed to vote, some people might include their entire family, even near neighbours or relatives, in order to increase their voting power, which would distort the legislation.  One also had to consider communities such as religious orders where up to 30 people could have voting entitlements on one contract, which would also create obvious difficulties.  One vote per contract is the fairest and most practical solution.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis also mentioned the single system of registration for milk producers.  There is already a system of registration for all producers under Regulation 92/46, Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996, for health protection reasons.  The registration under this Act is a supply regulation rather than a health protection measure but if necessary it could be built upon. In any event, the milk sector has good self-regulation and given the nature of the system, there is also excellent traceability, which has grown not only out of necessity but from the desire of both producers and consumers. Reference has also had to be made to the increased importance of meeting the desires and concerns of consumers in relation to anything pertaining to the food industry.</P>
      <P>The future of milk quotas was also raised.  The commission will put forward proposals next year. The Minister has set up a review group to identify the best options.  A range of issues arise including enlargement, trends under the next trade round, competitiveness and what is in the best interests of the industry.  The best interests of the industry are served by many factors, such as allaying consumer concerns, ensuring the industry operates within the guidelines and regulations and that it is efficient.  It is important that we fully analyse the situation and it is intended to have a full debate with wide consultation.  This is important to ensure that the concerns of those involved, directly and indirectly, be addressed at that stage rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator D'Arcy referred to milk quotas.  They have always been a very controversial issue.  We <Col N="1038" /> have all heard, seen and read what happens when one person has an insufficient milk quota and others have an over-supply and we realise the difficulties this has created.  The quota system may not be ideal, but it is the best at this stage. From personal dealings with producers in my constituency, I have found that if a difficulty arises in one year, there is a tendency for the producer and the processor to address that in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>By and large the system has worked reasonably well.  Producers have taken extreme care, especially in 1995, and the prices have been very good during 1995 and 1996 which is an indication that the system has not worked all that badly. These prices would not have been achieved without the quota system and it is important to remember that.</P>
    <P>The EU has a surplus of milk which must be disposed of through internal subsidised mechanisms.  Greece and Italy received extra quotas.  These were technical adjustments to their existing quotas which related to a deficit situation.  There were statistical problems in allocating their quotas from the start.  These extra quotas were given after full analysis and debate, not readily or without consultation.  Italy paid a very high price for not implementing this system originally, and now Ireland has increased its production at world market prices of 40p to 50p per gallon.</P>
    <P>Countries within the European Union have to operate within certain guidelines and are doing their utmost to do so, on occasion in quite trying circumstances.  While there may be down sides to the circumstances arising from the operation of the quotas, they are immeasurably better than what would arise if that system was not in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the elections in 1997 and whether they would take place.  I can assure him that the agency has every confidence that it will be able to conduct the elections in 1997, notwithstanding the reference he made to the previous expectations which did not materialise.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the composition of the National Milk Agency: five farmer representatives, four processors in the pasteurising dairy area, one distributor, one retailer and one consumer &mdash; soon to be increased to two.  I emphasise the importance of taking on board the concerns of the consumer. This increase from one to two is on the basis of an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely also referred to the constituencies for producer representatives.  The exact division has not yet been decided upon, but it will probably be on the basis of two constituencies, with the country being divided roughly north and west or south and east.  The number of constituencies will be at the discretion of the Minister and may be altered to reflect changes in the distribution of the electorate.  This is to ensure an equitable system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> Senator Daly also referred to milk quotas. Under the national milk quota schemes, priority has been given to small scale milk production.  No member state has done as much as has been done here.  The Minister has brought in regulations ring-fencing milk quotas in disadvantaged areas, including County Clare.  This initiative was welcomed by the producers in this region.  The management of milk quotas is governed by EU legislation which is specific and which we must implement.  It is not possible to unilaterally make changes which do not come within the guidelines laid down by the European Union.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan referred to milk imports. EU trade in milk and dairy products is governed by EU Directive 92/46 from the starting point of public health protection, a point that should be emphasised.  It is not covered in this Bill but in Statutory Instrument No. 9 of 1996.  There is no way the EU would allow us to put artificial controls on imports; that refers to free trade, marketing, availability of supply, meeting demand, etc.  Any suggestion of change in the EU structures would have to be discussed within the EU and fully analysed and agreed to by all member states.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan also mentioned the price of milk.  The price control of milk was abolished several years ago.  All such controls are contrary to EU competition policy.  If there is any allegation of unfair trading, it is a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I emphasise again that the important constituent bodies in relation to any food or food product are the producers and their needs and requirements which have to be met as far as possible to ensure they are in a position to trade.  The processors' interests have to be met to some extent but the consumers' interests are understandably achieving greater importance as time goes by.  The consumer has taken on a major role in the commercial equation and is much more fundamental than was previously the case.  Processors and producers must recognise that everybody, including the producers themselves, are consumers.  Everybody is a consumer of one kind or another and everything must be geared towards that in future. If this is done it will be of considerable benefit to all concerned, especially to the national economy.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, I thank Senators who made a contribution to the debate. Contributions were worthwhile and knowledgeable and the points and concerns will be borne in mind by the Minister.  I hope the answers I have given will go some way towards assuaging their fears.</P>

      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly the matters I raised are the responsibility of the EU.  Does that mean that they are matters of shared responsibility?  If I have a problem or a concern about any aspect of the import of milk, do I take it up with the European Community rather than taking it up with the Minister for Agriculture?  I understand from the response that the Minister has nothing to do with it.  The controls for the import, export and price of milk are a matter for the European Union regulations.

      <P>Yes, in general.  In different regions within the European Union there may arise, from time to time, concerns such as those expressed by the Senator which may have a particular impact in a specific region.  It is the right of those who feel they have a grievance to take that up with the European authorities, the exporting agency or with the member state where it is felt that something is proceeding which is unfair or to the disadvantage of those involved. <Col N="1041" /> It is a person's prerogative to take such a matter up with the European Union, with the exporting country and agents.</P>

      <P>The Act states that the Minister shall, in the year 1997 and every third year thereafter, prescribe by regulation an election day to be an election day for producers and members. As I mentioned in my contribution, last year I said that the election would not be held in 1996. According to the legislation the elections will be held in 1997 and the Minister has given a guarantee to this effect.  There is much homework to be done before the election, however, such as the setting up of constituencies and so on.  Would that cause such delay that the elections might not be held in 1997?</P>
      <P>The Minister said the constituencies will be made by order.  Will we have an opportunity to discuss them here?  There will be five producers and the Minister said there will be two constituencies.  Two will probably be elected from one and three from another.  Will we have an opportunity of discussing how these constituencies will be established?</P>
      <P>I mentioned adequate compensation.  When this Bill was initiated some processors were unhappy because they thought the prices they paid to producers would, in the future, be dictated to them by the agency.  Different processors pay different prices.  Is there a hope that the milk agency could establish a uniform price as heretofore so that all liquid milk suppliers would get the same prices?</P>

      <P>No.  My first short answer to that question is still correct relating to the powers of the agency with regard to the spreading of an equal price over the entire region.

The efficient co-operatives pay the highest price and we are looking for efficiency and high quality.  To a degree there is a contract between the farmers and the co-operatives concerning prices.

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The most beneficial aspects of the Bill are the measures aimed at improving the use of Garda time by having more efficient methods of dealing with its court duties.  By providing that prosecuting gardaí may give evidence by way of certificate relating to certain procedural aspects, the Bill allows gardaí to spend more time on the beat rather than sitting on court benches for days.  The provisions reducing the need for escorting persons on remand to court are also important in that they are a sensible measure by which time can be saved.  It is critically important at a time when there is so <Col N="1044" /> much crime, that we see an increased Garda presence on the street.  That is where gardaí are needed most so that they can be accessible, keep an eye on things and be seen by potential wrongdoers.  This will help curb and prevent trouble.  Any measures which relieve gardaí of administrative and court duties are welcome.  The Minister for Justice has, during her term in office, provided extra civilian workers in the Garda Síochána.  However, more are needed to carry out administrative duties thus allowing the Garda to focus on crime prevention and detection.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sensible amendment of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, confirming that detention should be strictly related to its being necessary for the purpose of investigation of crime.  Although the courts have generally interpreted this to be the case, the fact that the 1984 Act required a person to be charged where there was enough evidence to prefer such a charge meant that persons were sometimes charged before the matter was fully investigated and that evidence obtained after the arrest could be deemed inadmissible.  Section 2 of the Bill clarifies the position in a workable fashion.</P>
      <P>I am concerned this Bill will require radical reform if it is to deal properly with the provisions relating to the governance of prisons.  This area warrants serious consideration to ensure that the best possible division of works and responsibilities within the administration of justice and the prisons can be achieved.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's proposals on this.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for many practical amendments to the administration of justice allowing for more sensible use of time.  The increase in the use of search warrants is also welcome as are many of the other practical provisions.</P>
      <P>This Administration has introduced so much criminal justice legislation that some assessment is required before we introduce further legislation which might need to be re-examined and possibly amended.  It is better that be done now and that we focus on what is missing from the provisions in our crime prevention and crime fighting legislation.  Be that as it may, I welcome the legislation in so far as it contains practical measures and I await more information on what is proposed for the governance of prisons.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation.  I am glad it was taken on board and has been put before us.  I do not want to delay it because it is reasonable.  I had reservations about it in the beginning which I voiced on numerous occasions. However, as it has come this far and some of the protections within it seem adequate for the protection of the person, I welcome it although it will not substantially affect the crime rate.</P>

I welcome <Col N="1045" /> the increased Garda presence which will be on the streets from now on.  I also hope the cities have extra gardaí during summer but not to the detriment of rural areas.  It is important that all areas are policed.  This Bill signals a sensible use of time which will help the justice process generally.  I compliment the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.</P>
      <P>On the evidence of the legislation which the current Administration has introduced, we can look forward to good times in future when this Administration is returned to power early in the New Year for a prolonged period of time, something to which I am sure we all subscribe and look forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reply to what has been a lively and wholly constructive Seanad debate on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996.  It is fair to say that the House has acknowledged that the Bill contains necessary and, in some cases, significant reforms, especially in the area of criminal procedure, and these have received a general welcome.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with specific provisions mentioned by Senators, I must first clarify any misconception about the status of the Bill <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Government's recently announced plans for the future structure, management and administration of the courts and prisons.  Senator Mulcahy and Senator O'Kennedy expressed the view at the opening of this debate on 21 November that the House should not discuss the Bill because it was inconsistent with recent Government decisions affecting those areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the prison service, the Government has established a small group of persons to work out all aspects of a new board or agency to run prisons.  That group has been requested to report its findings to Government by the end of January.  When the report on the proposed prisons board is received, it will be considered.  If it emerges that it is necessary to change the rules for the regulation of prisons, that can be done.  Whatever legislation may be required as a result of this group's considerations, the outcome of whose work I cannot anticipate, will be brought before this House which will have every opportunity to consider and examine it.  In the meantime, we cannot afford to stand still.  We must deal with the situation as it exists.  There will be plenty of opportunities to discuss the role and functions of the proposed prisons board when the group has reported its findings.</P>
      <P>The proposed new rules under section 18 replace the current rules which date back to 1947. New rules are needed to reflect the practical problems of running a modern prison system and to allow the system meet modern conditions.  It is important for all involved with the prison system, including the staff and the offenders, that these rules are made as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> The Government has decided to proceed directly towards the establishment of a courts service on a statutory basis.  I want to reassure Senators O'Kennedy and Mulcahy that the provisions in this Bill stand on their own merits. Even when a new courts service is established it will be this House and the other House which will have to legislate to change statutory procedures in the courts.  The Minister for Justice will continue to have responsibility for bringing in reforming legislative proposals relating to criminal law and procedure.  It is, therefore, wrong to suggest that the Bill should not be enacted because the Minister would have no power in relation to the courts.  The Minister for Justice will continue to have an important role in this area and Senator O'Kennedy knows that as well as I.</P>
    <P>The reforms contained in the Bill are procedural but of great importance.  Without prejudice to the recent decisions relating to the future structure of the courts and prison service, the reforms contained in the Bill, which are mainly to do with providing a greater flexibility for the Garda Siochána and the courts, will always be necessary.  They are important practical and procedural reforms needed to enable the Garda and the courts to operate with greater efficiency and they are necessary regardless of the establishment of a courts service.  It would be unfortunate if Senators opposed the introduction of these measures.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy has welcomed the changes proposed in sections 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11.  This House should support measures which will free Garda resources and speed up court procedures.  The measures in this Bill are in ease of the courts and the Garda.  For example, they give a wider discretion to the courts in relation to certain remand periods and the venues for remand hearings.  The Bill also gives the Garda a new and much needed power to search for evidence in cases of murder, rape and other serious sexual offences.  Restructuring the system of courts and prisons management and administration will not in the same way do away with the need for these and similar reforms in the future.  For these reasons I cannot agree that this debate is wasting the time of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy was concerned about section 6 which provides for the giving of certificates of evidence of arrest, charge and caution.  As Senator Neville pointed out, gardaí spend a lot of time waiting to give evidence in court.  It has been estimated that up to 60.000 Garda hours are spent in the Dublin Metropolitan Area giving evidence at the first appearance of accused persons in court.  This is a considerable waste of Garda time. I appreciate what Senator Mulcahy has said about the process of arrest being &ldquo;at the heart&rdquo; of each criminal case.  The section provides that the court can direct that oral evidence on the matter stated in the certificate can be given by the Garda where the interests of justice so require.  I am satisfied <Col N="1047" /> that this is an adequate safeguard to meet the concern Senator Mulcahy expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher asked about the possible effects of certain provisions in the Bill on the District Court.  Section 5, which provides for alternative remand courts, will have no significant effect on court business in the District Court situated near the remand prisons, for example, in the Dublin metropolitan district, as Mountjoy Jail is the main remand centre.  I have considered this mattered carefully.  Remand hearings are usually of very short duration relative to other court proceedings and I am satisfied that this proposal will have no significant implications for the case list in the Dublin metropolitan district.  My main priority is to address the substantial cost of transporting and escorting remand prisoners, in particular from Mountjoy Jail, to the District Court jurisdiction which may be a considerable distance away.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher also asked for clarification of section 14.  This section amends the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  That Act made special provision for the giving of evidence in trials in sexual offences or offences involving violence, for example, by video link.  The definition of sexual offence in that Act was not updated to take account of the repeal and replacing of some of these offences provided for by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993.  Section 14 makes the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville asked for clarification of the position regarding air support units for the Garda.  The Government decided in April 1996 to approve the establishment of a dedicated Garda air support unit and to purchase the necessary aircraft.  This decision was based on the report prepared by an interdepartmental working group on air support established by the Minister for Justice in May 1995.  That report emphasised the priority attached to providing the Garda Siochána with an effective 24 hour support capability.  This was critical to the Garda strategies in combating all forms of crime, including organised crime gangs, drug trafficking, paramilitary activity and serious mobile crime.  It recommended the Garda air support unit be equipped with one patrol observation helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft.  These aircraft will be operated by the Air Corps under the operational control of the Garda Siochána and will provide the gardaí with a 24 hour air support capability. Tenders were invited for the aircraft earlier this year.  These have been evaluated and a suitable helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft selected. Contracts are expected to be signed shortly and the necessary funding has been provided by the Government.  It is expected that the introductory training for the gardaí will begin early next year with the full support capability operational by July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly commend this Bill to the House.  The House will be aware that this is an Opposition Bill.  Fianna Fáil has introduced many Bills during this session in the Dáil, some of which were accepted by the Government.  One of the principal Bills accepted was the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996, although the Government was railroaded by a sense of panic into its acceptance. However, it was accepted in good faith for which I am thankful.</P>
      <P>This Bill is primarily designed to combat the growing problem of child sex tourism.  It is a sad indictment of our society that we have to introduce such a Bill and that people would engage in any form of sexual activity with underage persons either in this or any other jurisdiction.  Our society has been traumatised in recent years by revelations of sexual activity with underage persons, particularly children.  There was a feeling that this type of activity did not take place here but unfortunately we have found otherwise and it is a matter of great sadness and regret to everybody.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is not being moralistic in proposing this Bill, but it wants to send out a clear message to those who engage in child sex tourism or who promote and benefit from it that this behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.  It is appalling to witness television reports of young children in Indonesia, the Philippines, South America and other poor parts of the world who are exploited by people with a particular perversion who have the money to escape from a society where these matters are more controlled to a jurisdiction where young children are more vulnerable.  I congratulate Deputies E. Ryan and O'Donoghue for their initiative in this regard and I hope the Government will accede to this Bill.  The Minister of State could not give us an assurance today that Irish people are not involved in travelling to these countries for the purpose of child sex tourism or to exploit the vulnerable, the defenceless and the weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> This Bill effectively seeks to extend the jurisdiction of Irish courts to activities that take place in a foreign country.  This is a unique concept and one that my colleague will speak on at greater length.  I do not know of any other Act of the Oireachtas which seeks to impose a penalty on an illegal activity in a foreign country.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes that it will be an offence to commit certain acts if those acts are illegal in the foreign country and also in this jurisdiction. There is a dual test for the operation of this Bill. The relevant Acts are listed in the Schedule &mdash; section 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935; section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, etc.  If the Government felt that list should be extended, Fianna Fáil would approach it with an open mind.  The bottom line is that there must be a law whereby people who engage in this hideous illegal activity are stopped.  That does not only involve those who engage in this activity.</P>
    <P>I am delighted there is a section in the Bill which includes tour operators who promote and benefit from such activity.  Is it acceptable for a tour operator to knowingly transport a person to a foreign jurisdiction for the purposes of committing an act which is not an offence in that jurisdiction but is an offence here?  The dual test will also apply for a travel agent.  It must be an offence in Ireland and in the foreign jurisdiction and I hope no one will cloud this point during the debate.  Anybody who engages in this activity or who promotes, organises or benefits in a commercial sense from this activity is to be sanctioned under this proposed Bill.  I strongly hope this House will support it.</P>
    <P>Child prostitution generally takes place in the poorest countries of the world.  Poverty is greater than ever, although global income has risen.  In 1992 global income was $23 trillion, up from $4 trillion in 1952, yet the share of this to the poorest 20 per cent of the world's population fell from 2.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent over the same period.  It is in the poorest parts of the world that people seek to ply their evil trade &mdash; Peru, Brazil, Guatemala, some African countries, Indonesia although wealth is rising rapidly there, Malaysia, the Philippines etc.</P>
    <P>International tourist arrivals totalled 567 million in 1995.  This represents a seven fold increase since 1960.  One presumes and hopes that an infinitesimally small percentage is involved in child sex tourism.  However, any percentage is too much.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on Ireland, pursuant to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to enact this type of protective legislation.  The Minister of State will be aware that several countries have already done this, including Finland, Norway and Sweden, who since the 1960s have extended their jurisdictions for these cases.  They have been joined by Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, the USA and Taiwan.  A growing list of countries have given themselves extra territorial <Col N="1050" /> jurisdiction to deal with this problem.  I hope the Government will support this concept.</P>
    <P>The Bill is relatively short and contains 11 sections.  Section 2 deals with sexual offences committed outside the State and establishes the dual test provision whereby the act must constitute an offence under the law of the place where it occurs and must also, if done within the State, constitute an offence under an enactment referred to in the Schedule to the Bill.  If this happens, the person involved would be guilty of an offence and the penalty to which the person would be liable would be the penalty applicable to it in Ireland.  If, for example, the penalty in Ireland for a breach of section 1 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, is one year's imprisonment and an Irish court finds that a person had breached that offence in, say, the Philippines, the penalty proposed under the Bill would also be one year's imprisonment.  We are not seeking the penalty imposed by a foreign jurisdiction; the penalty should be that imposed by an Irish court.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) states:</P>
    <P>A person who, in the State, makes an arrangement to transport a person to a place in or outside the State or who authorises the making of such an arrangement for or on behalf of another person, knowingly for the purpose of enabling that person or any other person to commit an offence, which is an offence by virtue of section 2 (1) of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The section deals with travel agents or those who organise the travel of Irish people to foreign countries for the purposes of committing an offence.  There is nothing wrong with travelling to Malaysia, the Philippines, Brazil, Peru, etc., in the normal course of business, tourism or whatever, provided one does not travel knowingly to commit a child sex offence or an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bill.  Similarly, travel agents are guilty of an offence if they know their clients are travelling for the purposes of committing such offences.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the advocacy of the committing of an offence and is a standard clause in many Bills while section 5 relates to offences by bodies corporate.  Section 6 relates to penalties, which can include on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or 12 months' imprisonment, or on conviction on indictment, which means conviction by a criminal jury, a fine not exceeding £10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which relates to double jeopardy, is important.  It states:</P>
    <P>Where a person has been acquitted or convicted, in a place other than the State, of an offence, that person shall not be proceeded against for an offence under this Act or an offence which is an offence by virtue of this Act...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> If somebody has been tried and either convicted or acquitted of a specific act in a foreign jurisdiction it will not be open to the Irish courts to bring a similar criminal charge for that act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one.  It is to the point and it is necessary.  I pay tribute to the incredible work undertaken by members of religious orders in some of these countries and who have been especially active in the fight against child prostitution.  I mention Fr. Shay Cullen in this context.  Deputy Eoin Ryan met Fr. Cullen and discussed child sex tourism with him.  Fr. Cullen and others like him should be honoured and listened to.  I would favour him addressing a special sitting of this House to bring us up to date with the realities and with the way people, especially children, are being exploited in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The message must go to child sex abusers that there is no sanctuary for them in this country. There should be no sanction for them in any other country.  It is unacceptable behaviour by any civilised rule.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Eoin Ryan for their imagination and perseverance in bringing this Bill through the Dáil.  I hope that the Bill can be accepted unanimously in a positive spirit.  We will be doing the deprived, weak and vulnerable sections of the poorest parts of the Third World a great deal of assistance if we pass the Bill.</P>
    <P>Child sex tourism must stop quickly.  I hope all sides of the House will assist in giving the Bill a speedy passage.  If and when it becomes law I also hope the Government will make available the necessary resources to ensure that anybody in breach of the law, whether it be a tourist or travel agent, will be prosecuted quickly.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with particular responsibility for children I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am happy to support the Bill; indeed I am keen to see its important protective measures brought into operation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to put on record my appreciation of Senator Henry's valuable contribution to updating the law in this area.  The essence of her Child Sex Tours Bill is incorporated in this Bill and has added an important dimension to the child protection provisions concerned.  Indeed provisions in Senator Henry's Bill form the basis for a number of sections in the Bill and I will give details of the sections in her Bill later which correspond to those in the one before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed that Senator Mulcahy did not take the opportunity to pay tribute to his colleague for the part she played in the preparation of this Bill.  I would also like to acknowledge at this point the contribution by Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Eoin Ryan, <Col N="1052" /> who introduced the Bill in the other House and to whom I expressed my appreciation at that time.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing concern in recent years about the international dimension to the need to protect children.  Particular concern has been raised by reports of large numbers of children being sexually abused and exploited in many parts of the world.  The indications are that the problem is on the increase and that without concerted action it will continue to grow.  A United Nations working group reported that child prostitution may involve millions of children.  UNICEF estimated in 1994 that at least one million children were involved in child prostitution in Asia alone.  Those statistics disclose child prostitution on an alarming scale and a large proportion of it involves what is referred to as child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>It seems that many factors contribute to the problem of child sex tourism.  Many commentators maintain that poverty is one of the primary causes of child prostitution because it results in desperate need and limited employment opportunities and, therefore, vulnerability to exploitation.  Thus, for instance, parents can be easy prey to procurement agents who in some parts of the world scour villages in search of young children.</P>
    <P>The greater ease with which people can span the globe these days is certainly an important factor in facilitating child sex tourism.  The problem may be added to by poor laws and inadequate law enforcement in the receiving countries, that is, the haunts of child sex tourists. This means that the law is not acting as an effective deterrent in those countries.</P>
    <P>The fear of contracting AIDS could well be an important factor in fuelling the recent increase in the demand for children.  Child sex tourists often believe, mistakenly in many cases, that children are less likely to have AIDS and are, therefore, safer sex partners.</P>
    <P>Child sex tourism is an abhorrent and gross violation of children's human rights and has the most serious consequences for its victims.  Deep concern has been expressed about the psychological and emotional trauma sustained by children who are the victims of that scourge.  The children concerned are not only treated as sexual objects resulting in the complete loss of their dignity, self-esteem and confidence, but they are often subjected to inhumane treatment, including beatings, torture and enslavement.  Such children are also at high risk of becoming adult prostitutes, drug addicts and delinquents.  Rehabilitation programmes are often unsuccessful.  Of course, one of the most frightening consequences of child sex tourism is the children's exposure to the AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>That child sex tourism is often commercially motivated makes the abuse particularly sickening. It is the unfortunate reality in many parts of the world that child sex tourism has become a lucrative industry for many ruthless people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> Any lingering doubts that may have existed in some quarters about the need for action in the area of child sexual exploitation and abuse were swept away by events last August.  Those events gave a massive impetus to progress in this area and ensured that the problem of child sexual abuse found its rightful place at the top of political agendas.</P>
    <P>The first of those events was the detection of a paedophile ring in Belgium.  That case shocked not just Belgium but all of Europe and beyond. It heralded a sea change, a major shift, in general attitudes.  Before that case, while there was concern about child sexual abuse, for many that concern manifested itself in an abstract way. There may also have been a naivete in many quarters about the nature and extent of such abuse.  The Belgian case changed all that.  It opened our eyes to the vileness of paedophile rings.  It showed us how organised paedophiles are.  It shocked us with its chilling accounts of the prolonged suffering and, ultimately, in some cases, the tragic deaths of the victims.  We owe it to those victims to do all that is humanly possible to eradicate that plague.</P>
    <P>The second event in August to highlight the child sexual abuse problem was the Stockholm World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.  As a participant in the congress, which was also attended by some Members of the Oireachtas, including Senator Henry, I felt it made a valuable contribution.  Not only did it draw attention to the extent of child sexual exploitation, it set out an agenda for action.  That agenda amounts to a practical plan for progress in this area and it will be followed up in the near future when the UN circulates it to all UN member states.  That welcome initiative represents an important first step in putting into practice the commitments which Governments entered into in Stockholm.</P>
    <P>When it comes to tackling the child sex tourism problem, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child sets out a clear international standard for us to follow.  Article 34 of that convention urges states to take action to protect children from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation.  The Stockholm world congress elaborates on that standard and, in relation to sex tourism in particular, calls on states to develop or strengthen and implement laws to criminalise the acts of the nationals of sending countries when committed against children in receiving countries.  Measures at various levels, national, regional and international, are called for.</P>
    <P>At the European level there certainly has been effective action in relation to the problem during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  For the benefit of Senators who may not be fully aware of those developments I will give a brief outline of the action taken.</P>
    <P>The Justice and Home Affairs Council held in Brussels on 28 and 29 November gave political approval to a number of important measures to deal with the problem of trafficking in human <Col N="1054" /> beings and the sexual exploitation of children. The first measure was an Irish Presidency proposal to extend the mandate of the European Drugs Unit to trafficking in human beings.  This will cover the activities of paedophiles and those who supply children to them, as well as the trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  In effect, it will confer on the EDU the responsibilities in relation to this form of activity which will ultimately be held by the EDU's successor, Europol, when the convention establishing that organisation is ratified by all EU member states.  The extension of the EDU's remit will facilitate co-operation and the exchange of information between police forces and allow the EDU to provide any assistance it can in relation to these activities.</P>
    <P>The second measure agreed was a Belgian proposal to establish a programme for the exchange and training of persons responsible for dealing with sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.  The third measure was a joint Belgian and Irish Presidency proposal concerning the creation of a directory of competences and specialisations in the fight against particular crimes of this nature.  Those proposals will significantly assist international co-operation between operational police forces.</P>
    <P>The fourth measure approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council is probably the most relevant in the context of the Bill before us.  The Council approved an instrument which obliges all member states to undertake a major review of their laws on the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.  This will mean that all member states will make trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children criminal offences and will punish those offences accordingly.  Of particular importance is the commitment by member states to punish these offences no matter where they occur.  This will ensure a uniform approach to child sex tourism.  Member states also undertake to enhance co-operation and to give appropriate support to the victims of these crimes.</P>
    <P>Following that brief summary of developments in Europe, I wish to focus on the anti-child sex tourism measures needed at national level, both in countries which receive the sex tourists and the countries from which they come, the sending countries.  A number of the receiving countries often associated with child sex tourism, such as Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, have in recent years tightened their child protection laws. It is heartening to read articles in the newspapers, such as the report about an individual who, last October, was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment by a Filipino court for organising child sex tourism.  In some receiving countries, however, the adequate enforcement of anti-child sex tourism laws may be a problem, a point to which I adverted earlier.</P>
    <P>As far as the sending countries are concerned, in 1988 the Council of Europe highlighted the problem of child prostitution and trafficking of <Col N="1055" /> children and recommended that European countries consider establishing extra-territorial jurisdiction in such cases.  The EU measures to which I referred earlier give a new and strong impetus to EU member states to strengthen their laws in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of European countries already have anti-child sex tourism laws; Sweden and Norway have long had potential to prosecute nationals for offences committed extra-territorially.  Other European countries have, in recent times, taken steps to strengthen their laws.  For example, in 1993 the German Parliament extended the application of its criminal code to sexual offences against children committed extra-territorially by German nationals.</P>
    <P>We are now engaged in a similar legislative process and this brings me to the Bill before the House.  It might be of assistance if I explained some of the thinking behind the sections as practically all of them reflect extensive amendments which I moved in the other House. However, I wish to make a few points about the unusual history of the legislation before the House and a number of general points about it. Arising from increased awareness of the problem of child sex tourism in recent years, together with concern about the rapid spread of the problem, two Private Members' Bills were tabled last year. This Bill was introduced in the other House and as most, if not all, the Members are aware, the Child Sex Tours Bill, 1995, was presented by Senator Henry in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to give its backing to both Bills, subject to amendments, and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security subsequently agreed to Government amendments to the Bill before the House.  The amendments not only incorporated into that Bill the essence of this House's Bill but strengthened the provisions of both Bills.  The Bill before us has two main focuses; it targets the child sex tourist by providing that Irish citizens or persons ordinarily resident here who engage in unlawful sex with children abroad can be dealt with by our courts.  It also targets organisers by making it an offence to arrange transport for, or to transport, child sex tourists or to publish information on child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>A key idea which guides the Bill's provisions is the importance of maintaining consistency with the existing law applicable to sexual offences committed against children here.  It would be most inappropriate to have a situation in which the proposed protections for children abroad were greater than those for children here.</P>

      <P>Section 1 defines the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; to mean someone under 17 years.  I am aware that Senator Henry's Bill referred to an age of 16, but 17 is more appropriate because it is the age of consent to sexual relations in this jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> Section 2 is one of the Bill's most important sections and its key provision is subsection (1) which extends our criminal jurisdiction to enable prosecutions to be taken against Irish citizens, or persons ordinarily resident here, who commit sexual offences against children abroad.  The way in which the subsection makes a wrongful act committed abroad an offence here is important. By proposing the extension of our criminal jurisdiction, all related criminal law provisions will automatically apply.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides for four preconditions to an offence.  First, the perpetrator of the wrongful act concerned must be a citizen of the State, or be ordinarily resident in the State. Second, the victim must be a child, as defined. Third, a requirement of dual criminality needs to be included.  This means that the wrongful act must constitute an offence under the law of the foreign state where the act occurs.  Fourth, the act must be one which, if it took place here, would constitute a sexual offence here under an enactment specified in the Schedule to the Bill. The offences concerned are: unlawful carnal knowledge of any girl under 15 years or any girl who is over 15 years and under 17 years; rape; sexual assault; aggravated sexual assault; rape under section 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; buggery with a person under 17 years; gross indecency with a male person under 17 years and sexual intercourse, buggery or gross indecency with a mentally impaired person.</P>
    <P>Section 2(3) and (4) deal with aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence which is an offence by virtue of subsection (1) of the section.  Subsections (5) and (6) deal with a person who conspires with or incites another to commit, either inside or outside the State, an offence which is an offence by virtue of subsection (1).  Subsection (7) defines a person who is ordinarily resident in the State as someone who has had his or her principal residence here for 12 months immediately before the commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 is to deter and, where necessary, penalise any person who arranges to transport or who transports a person for the purpose of child sex tourism.  In so doing the intention is to incorporate in the Bill the essence of two new offences proposed by Senator Henry in her Child Sex Tours Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1) makes it an offence for a person to arrange to transport another person to a place inside or outside the State in the knowledge that that person is travelling for the purpose of committing a sexual offence against a child abroad.  The subsection extends to a person who authorises the making of such an arrangement so that, for example, a manager behind the scenes cannot escape liability.  Subsection (2) makes it an offence for a person to transport another person from anywhere in the State to a place inside or outside the State for the purpose of enabling the other person to commit a sexual offence against a child abroad.  An offence under this provision <Col N="1057" /> could entail transporting a person between two places in Ireland as part of a journey to a foreign destination.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes it an offence to publish information which is intended or likely to promote, advocate or incite the commission of a sexual offence against a child abroad.  Again, the intention is to incorporate the essence of a provision in Senator Henry's Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 5 is to ensure that officers of companies may be held personally responsible for offences under the Bill committed by their firms.  It provides that where an offence under sections 3 and 4 is committed by a body corporate, with the consent or connivance or neglect of an officer of that body, the officer concerned may be prosecuted.  That section follows closely the text of a provision in Senator Henry's Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the penalty <i>maxima</i> for offences created by sections 3 and 4.  For a summary conviction the proposed penalty maximum is a £1,500 fine or 12 months' imprisonment or both.  In the case of a conviction on indictment a fine of up to £10,000 or five years' imprisonment or both may be imposed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains an important provision.  Its purpose is to confer jurisdiction on Irish courts in respect of offences committed abroad to which this Bill will apply.  The section provides that proceedings for the offences concerned may be taken in any place in the State, and the offence may be treated as having been committed in that place.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is also important because it will enable the courts to have regard to a person's physical appearance or attributes for the purposes of determining whether that person is under the age of 17 at the time of the court hearing or was under that age at the time of the alleged commission of an offence under sections 2 or 3.  We should, I believe, do all we can to ensure that no undue obstacles are placed in the way of our prosecuting authorities, and that the Bill, when enacted, will be as effective and foolproof as possible.  That is why that section, which is modelled on a provision in the Australian child sex tourism legislation, is included.</P>
    <P>The rule against double jeopardy is dealt with under section 9.  Senators will know that rule is intended to ensure that a person does not face repeated prosecution for the same offence.  Again, the wording of that section is modelled on a corresponding provision in the Australian child sex tourism legislation.  Section 10 proposes to give the Garda power to search premises as part of an investigation into the offences under the Bill.  The seizure of documentary evidence may, in some cases, be an important means of assembling evidence of offences under the Bill.  A travel agent's records might, for example, be relevant to a charge of organising child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>I hope the outline I have given of the Bill's provisions will be of assistance in helping this <Col N="1058" /> House understand the provisions as well as the thinking behind them.  By way of general comment, it is fair to say that the Bill's progress has been marked by a spirit of co-operation which reflects the cross-party consensus on the Bill's central objective, that is, protecting children abroad from various forms of sexual abuse by predatory paedophiles.  I have no doubt there will be a similar level of co-operation in this House. All of us in this House are appalled by the suffering of children at the hands of sex tourists and we must do all we can to stamp out that appalling scourge.  This Bill represents important progress towards ensuring that there is no safe haven for the child sex tourist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say how much I welcome the Minister bringing this Bill before the House and I compliment him on the work he and his officials have done to ensure it was introduced before the end of the Irish Presidency of the EU. This Bill is important not only to us &mdash; it is an example to other European countries which must also introduce such legislation.  We are at centre stage because of our Presidency of the EU and it is splendid that the Minister has managed to prepare this legislation so rapidly.</P>
      <P>The Bill had an unusual beginning and I thank the Minister for his nice accolades.  When I first raised this topic, a package holidays Bill was going through the House.  I decided it might be suitable to include a section in that Bill banning child sex tourism, although the Minister concerned was not sure if it was relevant. However, the Government was very co-operative when I introduced my Private Members' Bill to the House.  Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Eoin Ryan are extremely grateful for the co-operation they received from the Government when bringing this Bill, which incorporates Government amendments, to the House.</P>
      <P>I am sure many Members realise this is an appropriate day to bring the Bill to the House because it is 50th anniversary of the founding of UNICEF.  As the Minister said, we attended a conference in Stockholm organised by UNICEF, ECPAT and the Swedish Government on child sex tourism.  There was such dismay that this problem was so prevalent and that so little was being done about it that it was felt necessary to organise a conference.  Indeed, when it was decided to hold the conference the dreadful events in Belgium this summer had not yet unfolded, which gave even more poignancy to the terrible lectures and seminars we had to sit through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than repeat what I said before about the problem of child sex tourism, I would like to refer to a section of the report launched today by UNICEF on the state of the world's children in terms of the commercial sexual expliotation of children.  The report states that village loan sharks often act as procurers for city brothels, lending money to families that their daughters' work repays.  The underground nature of the multi-billion dollar illegal industry in the commercial <Col N="1059" /> sexual expliotation of children makes it difficult to gather reliable data but NGOs in the field estimate that, each year, at least one million girls worldwide are lured or forced into this form of hazardous labour which can verge on slavery. Boys are also often exploited.  When scandals about child prostitution in developing countries break in the international media, it is usually a story about the phenomenon called sex tourism in which holiday makers from the rich world, mainly although not exclusively men, travel to locations such as Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and elsewhere in search of sex with children.</P>
    <P>The report also says we should not lose sight of the fact that many thousands of young girls in numerous countries serve the sexual appetites of local men from all social and economic backgrounds.  We must take that point very seriously.  That is why I am glad our children are covered by this Bill.  We have been too ready to understand the problems abroad, but we take no interest in what is happening up the road.  I assure Members that child prostitution takes place in this city.  I said on television one night that a 14 year old had benefited from the Probation Act when she was caught for soliciting in this city.  I thought someone might have said to me that was appalling, but I got no reaction to it.  If one goes around the city and looks at the girls and boys on the street, it is obvious that children are involved in prostitution.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say that in the US alone at least 100,000 are involved.  Direct links between the commercial sexual exploitation of children and other forms of exploitive labour are numerous.  Notorious in their own right for appalling working conditions, Nepalese carpet factories, where 50 per cent of the workers are estimated to be children, are common sites of sexual exploitation by employers as well as recruitment centres for Indian brothels.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, launched the report this morning she asked us to consider when buying products, especially toys at Christmas, whether child labour has been used in their production.  What pleasure we may consider giving to our children may have had an appalling affect on the lives of other children making such toys.  The International Labour Organisation said that frequently child labour and child sexual expliotation coexist.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say children are especially powerless to reject abuse by employers, either as perpetrators or intermediaries.  Village loan sharks often act as procurers for city brothels lending money to the family that the daughter's work must pay off.  I am sure the Minister will remember that we were told about the green harvest in Stockholm.  In Thailand, for example, farmers were lent money which would be repaid to the loan shark when the harvest was reaped in the autumn, but very often they repay the debt <Col N="1060" /> with one of their children.  This is one of the main forms of expliotation in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The report says that almost all such children are betrayed by those they trust and may end up travelling long distances across borders, which is a very serious problem.  I visited eastern Europe recently and the people there are becoming increasingly alarmed by the fact that some of their children go missing; they fear they have gone to western Europe.  The child is usually unable to speak the language of another country and that is a terrible problem.  In a recent case an airline hostess reckoned something odd was taking place when she saw a child being taken by a man from one jurisdiction to another.  There appeared to be a peculiar relationship between them so she alerted the authorities at the airplane's destination.  I compliment that airline hostess.  We must examine what type of protection we can give people who alert authorities to such trafficking.  It is a serious problem between the Indian subcontinent and the Gulf area.  There is little protection for children when they are taken by an adult to another country in an airplane.  It happens very easily and, although it is not covered by this Bill, it is an area that must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Rescue and rehabilitation are complicated for such children.  Senator Mulcahy referred to Fr. Shay Cullen.  I cannot compliment Fr. Cullen enough on his work.  He has talked extensively about the difficulties with rehabilitation of these children and it is important that we continue to support the work of UNICEF, which is involved in such rehabilitation.  It was good to hear this morning that Ireland is the sixteenth highest contributor to UNICEF.  Last year we contributed our highest amount ever.</P>
    <P>The children often end up being prosecuted by the legal system which should be protecting them. Even if they manage to get home, perhaps after being deported as illegal immigrants, they may face stigma and rejection by their families and communities.  Shunned, ignored and invisible they often have little choice but to return to the brothel or the streets.  The physical and psychosocial damage inflicted by commercial sexual exploitation makes it one of the most hazardous forms of child labour.  No matter how high the wages or how few the hours the children involved must confront serious health risks every day, including respiratory diseases, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, drug addiction and unwanted pregnancies.  How many of these girls die from illegal abortions?  They are also plunged into a distorted reality in which violence and distrust, shame and rejection are the norm.  &ldquo;We have the same place as bums in society&rdquo;, said a 15 year old Senegalese girl, exploited through prostitution.  &ldquo;Nobody wants to know us or be seen with us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the international public should understand the layers of complicity that envelop the area of child exploitation.  Was that ever better shown than by the case in Belgium? <Col N="1061" /> Although it is always easier and more comfortable to blame the exploiting pimps or perverts or even the victims themselves, no social sector can escape responsibility for the commercial exploitation of children.  That is why I am delighted this Bill is so wide ranging.  Families entrusted with the care, nurture and development of children may be complicit in allowing the child's sexual exploitation.  Research has consistently indicated that child abuse and incest are common precursors of the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the people who buy sex, there are the traffickers, agents and intermediaries who profit from the sale of children; airlines, hotel groups and travel agencies also benefit.  There are the professional criminals and syndicates who run brothels and the entrepreneurs who organise sex tours or produce tourist brochures encouraging the notion that young boys or girls are sexually available; there are all the people, including corrupt or apathetic officials, who look the other way.  Beyond these actors are the more elusive and impersonal influences that contribute to the child sex trade, such as a deeply rooted gender discrimination that blunts the perception of violence committed against girls.  Global market forces have also contributed to the problem by widening the gap between rich and poor, encouraging migration, destabilising families and destroying support systems and safety nets. Conflicts and wars, dozens of which occur around the world, also create conditions in which children are sexually exploited.</P>
    <P>The problem is out in the open after decades of what has amounted to a cross-cultural conspiracy of silence.  The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, held in Sweden in August 1996, put the issue on the world's agenda for the first time.  The agenda for action agreed by participants will guide governments in developing programmes to address the problem.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on being to the forefront in taking action in this regard.  A few legislative developments that are due to take place in the future should be borne in mind.  I am delighted the Child Pornography Bill is being brought forward.  It is important and will be complementary to this Bill.  I am pleased with the inclusion of the section which provides that a birth certificate need not be produced.  The registration of births in some countries is not what it should be.  Perhaps we could encourage our aid workers to promote the registration of births.  We have many workers with Concern, APSO and so forth and it should be pointed out to them that it would be useful if they would bring this topic to people's attention.</P>
    <P>The internet was discussed in Stockholm.  It is a serious international problem and will be difficult to deal with.  It is reckoned that some form of self-regulation will have to take place.  It is hoped this will be achieved rapidly because international regulation of the internet will be <Col N="1062" /> difficult but not impossible.  Will the Minister of State do his best to promote the regulation of the internet with regard to the sexual exploitation of children?  The issue falls within the spirit although not the letter of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad this issue is being dealt with in the course of the European Presidency.  A friend of mine, who is a member of the House of Commons and is trying to promote similar legislation, told me it will be a great help to be able to say &ldquo;even the Irish are doing something about it&rdquo;.  I hope the remaining countries in the European Union will follow the example of the Minister of State by promoting their legislation in this regard with speed and energy.  I compliment the Minister of State on the Bill and thank him for bringing it before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the product of co-operation by all sides of the House.  I compliment Senator Henry, Deputy Eoin Ryan, Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister of State and his Department on their work The combination of forces has produced a substantial Bill to deal with a serious international problem.</P>
      <P>The Bill confers on the Irish authorities the power to prosecute in our courts Irish nationals who commit sexual offences abroad.  It is an important power.  In the debate, many speakers have suggested that this problem is a result of poverty and deprivation, particularly in Third World countries.  That is true, but it is also a result of poverty of mind and spirit on the part of people who exploit the innocence of children, male and female.  It is also the product of affluence.  If people did not have plenty of money they would be unable to travel to other countries and spend it in this vile and ruthless manner.  I am delighted this legislation is before the House and I hope it will reduce the incidence of these offences.</P>
      <P>However, will it be possible to rid the world of this huge sex tourism industry?  It is a multimillion pound business and it is well established. Most of the countries concerned are not members of the EU and are not even democracies, so one wonders how effective legislation can be, particularly with regard to countries where there are non-democratic systems of government.  The UN and UNICEF have an important part to play and they intervene constantly.  There are international laws of the sea and aviation; is it not possible to have a more affirmative international law on the exploitation of children?  At least it is now hoped to have common legislation across the EU and the Bill is a step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Bill applies to children within our jurisdiction.  Judging from some contributions one would think child sexual exploitation and prostitution existed only in Third World countries but it occurs in this city and in every medium to large sized town in Ireland.  We all encounter evidence of that during our political careers.  In many cases the gardaí have been unable to take the necessary action to <Col N="1063" /> stop such exploitation&mdash;for instance, if it took place on private property the gardaí may have been refused entry because they did not have a warrant.  The Bill gives the gardaí the legal power to take on those who exploit young boys and girls for prostitution purposes, so that when it is implemented, it will effectively address the problem.  We are good at talking about what is happening abroad but we should also deal with what is happening at home.  I am delighted that this Bill addresses the problem in our country.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not specifically mention travel agents but it applies to those who provide facilities, advise people where to go and arrange the necessary transportation to areas where sex tourism occurs.  Not only the employee who provides the advice but the company and its directors should also be liable for prosecution under section 3.  World travel is becoming available with increasing ease.  The Internet should also be closely watched, given the quick availability of information through it.  Those individuals and companies who provide information of this nature through the Internet must also be liable under the Bill.  I hope the Minister refers to this matter either in response to Second Stage or when discussing the various sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Irish Presidency must be complimented on the action they have taken to tackle the abuse of children.  The record of this Presidency is particularly good; it has ensured that the mandate of the European Drugs Unit has been extended to include trafficking in human beings.  I hope the unit will have sufficient support and personnel to pursue this line.  There is often a relationship between the people involved in drugs and in human trafficking activities.  Europol should get the necessary financial and personnel support to be effective in its work.  Also under this Presidency, agreement has been reached on a Belgian proposal to exchange personnel and combine training of persons responsible for dealing with the sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings.  As no one country has all the necessary skills and knowledge so such co-operation between countries is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>The third measure is the joint proposal by Belgium and the Irish Presidency concerning the creation of a directory of competencies and specialisations in the fight against particular crimes of this nature.  Perhaps the Minister could explain this in more detail.  Has he considered putting together a directory of offenders across the EU?  One may argue that a person's constitutional rights may be affected by the type of information circulated but if someone has been proven to be a paedophile and has committed sexual offences against children, he should be put on an Interpol or Europol list which would be accessible to all countries concerned.  That person's movements should be monitored so that <Col N="1064" /> no child in any country would be vulnerable to abuse.</P>
    <P>The full rigours of the law must be brought to bear on any adult who would sexually abuse a child in an organised manner, such as through sex tourism.  From that viewpoint, the penalties in this Bill are far too mild.  Given the amount of money which are accrues through sex tourism, the heaviest possible financial penalties and terms of imprisonment should be imposed.  The abuse of a child and the destruction of his or her innocence and wholesomeness is one of the gravest offences that can be committed.  A person who is evil, vile and depraved enough to commit such an offence should receive a similar penalty to that for murder.  That may appear strong but I hold that belief.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy for an adult who would commit an offence against a child.  As adults we have responsibility to preserve the innocence of all children.  Every child deserves to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given every opportunity to become as full a person as he or she can become.  Anyone who impinges on the child's future deserves the full rigour of the law to be brought to bear on him or her.  Before Committee Stage and Report Stage I ask the Minister seriously to reconsider the level of penalties suggested in section 6.</P>
    <P>The proposal which obliges EU member states to undertake a major review of their laws on the sexual exploitation of children and the trafficking in human beings is commendable and I hope all states do so urgently.  As has been stated previously in the House, the paedophile ring which was unearthed in early August shocked everyone.  We associated sex tourism and child prostitution with underdeveloped countries yet in the centre of the EU was one of the most sinister paedophile rings in the world.  The shock of that discovery was felt everywhere and it changed the focus of the attack on child trafficking and child prostitution.  There is a need for greater urgency and awareness.</P>
    <P>In the past we have all heard of children going missing.  In rural Ireland in the 1960s a number of children went missing, never to be seen again. Usually there was a car seen along a road and the child was seen close by but never heard of again. One wonders where many of these misfortunate children went.  We have every responsibility to educate our children, the public, our adults, and to protect our children as far as possible.  This Bill goes a long way towards doing that and I commend all the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about how effective this can be as far as application across the world is concerned.  This is an attempt to protect children. Hopefully, it will protect them here and in the EU where there is trafficking between member states.  My concern is for countries in the Third World which have not a democratic system and which do not aspire to or have signed United Nations conventions on the rights of children.  I hope that in our role as members of the EU we <Col N="1065" /> can explore further how this problem can be addressed at international level because it is an international issue and one that must be followed and promoted at international level, particularly within the United Nations.  Ireland in its Presidency has made a major contribution and hopefully will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy Eoin Ryan and Deputy O'Donoghue brought this Bill forward.  It is very important but I have questions about it which maybe I should have asked before but which I just began to notice as we proceeded.</P>
      <P>Some sections of the Bill should be strengthened.  The Minister might answer a question on section 2 (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>(a)  constitutes an offence under the law of the place, and</P>
      <P>(b)  if done within the State, would constitute an offence...</P>
      <P>Should that be &ldquo;or&rdquo;?  What that means is that if there is a child prostitute in Thailand who is 16 years of age &mdash; and it is legal there &mdash; then no offence is committed although an offence would be committed here.  I genuinely believe that should read &ldquo;or&rdquo;, not &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  If we allow it go through as it is, the logic behind it would be to say that one could murder somebody in another country where it was legal but it would not be legal here so you could not prosecute them. Because child abuse is so terrible &mdash; it is a shocking crime &mdash; we should look at this.  I do not know whether I will be putting down an amendment to that effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;The Bill also targets organisers by making it an offence to arrange transport for or to actually transport child sex tourists, or to publish information on child sex tourism&rdquo;.  We should add &ldquo;and pornography&rdquo;.  As a psychologist I have dealt with many cases of child sexual abuse and child prostitution and they are probably no different here than in any other country.  I could give details of some cases &mdash; of course I could not do that because of confidentiality &mdash; which are so shocking and depraved that I can think of nowhere they could come from except from pornography.</P>
      <P>The proliferation of pornography in this country in recent times has to be seen to be believed.  I have seen hard core pornography on sale in the newsagents in Blackrock and Stillorgan shopping centres.  Most of this pornography &mdash; 99 per cent &mdash; is aimed at women.  I believe implicitly &mdash; and I said it last night at a meeting &mdash; that if you go into one of these newsagents and buy a loaf of bread, a packet of cigarettes or a newspaper, and ignore or do not complain about what is on the top shelf you are ultimately damaging somebody's wife, sister, aunt, niece, daughter or eventually somebody's child.  This has happened in every other country and we are doing it here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> A lot of legislation in recent years is reactive rather than proactive.  I am not arguing about the Bill which is good, but there are some sections that should be strengthened.  The effect of pornography should be included.  The abuse of a child, the most innocent of creatures, small, frightened, terrified, is the worst end of abuse.  It is a frightening development that some of these children who are so inured to it now almost accept being abused as normal and unfortunately many of them grow up to be abusers.  It is no good saying it has always been in society.  That does not mean we should not try to do something about it; but I do not believe it has been as depraved.  I believe a lot of depravity comes from the increased pornography that is pervading every aspect of society &mdash; newsagents, videos, television, etc.  We have come to accept things which a few years ago we would have said were frightening.</P>
    <P>We need education programmes also.  Some flights to these countries, Condor flights from Germany to Sri Lanka, for example, show a half hour video to educate tourists about child prostitution.  Some guide books like Fodor's and Lonely Planet, have started introducing material explaining the horrors of child prostitution.  Trade organisations, when they hold national tourist exhibitions, have included information about child prostitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned fines.  Maybe I should not be saying this about a Bill produced by two Members of my own party with an input from the Government and Deputy Harney, but to fine some fellow £1,500 or 12 months in prison or in the case of conviction or indictment a fine of £10,000 is derisory.  Do you know what you are doing to a child when they are abused?  I would love to tell you some of the things I know but I cannot because not only are they confidential but I am afraid the newspapers would print them and you would not believe them.  Satanic is the only word for them.  These people should be fined much, much more than £1,500 on a summary conviction or £10,000 on a conviction.  This is crazy when you think of the money being made out of it.  It is like the drugs industry. Pornography, tourism, drugs and arms, the four big industries of the world, are the ones that should really be clamped down on.  I ask the Minister to look at that again.</P>
    <P>There are paedophile rings in this country as well as in Belgium and the Garda have knowledge of them.  They pass information on youngsters from one to the other and the information is not just about getting sexual pleasure.  It is about physical abuse of the worst kind, inflicting pain and suffering on young people and on children; it is using people in the most savage way possible.  I am in favour of tagging paedophiles, electronically if necessary, because I can think of no cure for them.  This may sound harsh but if you saw a child who was abused, or if your own child was abused, you would change your mind on the spot.  Every day <Col N="1067" /> we read about cases in the papers and we must do everything we can to clamp down on this crime.</P>
    <P>There are men who go abroad to abuse children; they abuse the most vulnerable people, those who are poor, who are not educated, who are frightened etc.  In some countries these children are prosecuted.  This is an added cruelty. Children in brothels are often arrested and taken into custody, not the men who abuse them.  This is frightening.  It is presumed that most abusers are men, but recently I have seen more and more cases of women abusing as well, which is very sad and frightening.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands is all right.  I ask the Minister if the last word of section 2 (1) (a) should be changed from &ldquo;and&rdquo; to &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  Perhaps there is some technical or legal reason for this provision which I do not understand.  One of the people who brought forward this Bill is a lawyer and knows more about it than I.  However, it is wrong that the act has to be a crime in the place where the incident occurs to be an offence under the legislation.  Suppose, for example, the age of consent is lowered in Britain?  The age of consent in Holland is very low.  We have a different age of consent and should not condone a situation where people could travel from here to, say Holland to abuse children.  That is why the last word on that line should be &ldquo;or&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  It should be sufficient that the act be a crime in this country for the State to prosecute no matter where the crime is committed.  There may be some technical reason why this cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes the publication of information which is likely to promote, advocate, or incite the commission of an offence under the legislation an offence in itself.  We should look at that as covering not just advertising but the promotion in any way of child pornography.  It is possible to lock into pornography on the Internet now.  It is available everywhere; it is now openly used in advertising in Dublin.  We must examine this aspect as well.</P>

The fine should be much higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has been very productive and thought provoking and the Minister's contribution, highighting the areas being tackled under the Irish Presidency and at international level, has been very informative. This legislation is needed.  The need for it has <Col N="1068" /> been highlighted by Fr. Shay Cullen in the past and we thank him for doing that.  I thank all those who participated in putting this Bill together, including the Government, Deputy Ryan, Deputy O'Donoghue and Senator Henry.  All who showed an interest in highlighting this matter should be complimented.  It is timely that we bring this Bill before the House today, on the 50th anniversary of the setting up of UNICEF.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Lydon in relation to section 2.  This legislation purports to make an action an offence where it would have been an offence within this State and an offence in the receiving country.  I question whether that is necessary.  I do not suggest that we put ourselves on a pedestal or that we have very progressive legislation but in many third world countries where basic human rights and women's rights are very badly provided for, children's rights are at the bottom of the pile.  How many of those countries have strong provisions outlawing the types of sexual offence we are talking about? Is it necessary that section 2 requires an action to be an offence in the receiving country as well as here?  If so, the effect of this legislation will be severely limited.</P>
      <P>The other definitions are very broad and well phrased and I have no difficulty with them.  They cover everything from attempted offences to those aiding and abetting the commission of the offences abroad.  However, I do not see how we can prove an offence has been committed in the receiving country, particularly in the case of those who travel abroad privately, as would normally be the case.  Many people do not advertise the reason they travel to a particular country.  How effective will this legislation be in bringing to justice people in this country who go abroad for that purpose?</P>
      <P>Under section 3 it is hoped to prosecute those who are involved in the business of making these commercial travel arrangements in these situations.  Section 3 will be severely prohibitive for those in the travel agency business who facilitate this type of hideous crime.  How effective can this legislation be in bringing to justice those who go abroad for the purpose of committing child sexual abuse?  I understand we cannot say that because of difficulties of proof but we will do our utmost to stamp out these crimes. This legislation, regardless of how difficult it might be to enforce, makes a statement that the State does not condone the sexual abuse of children, whether in this country or abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we do not forget that, for too long, we swept the issue of child sexual abuse under the carpet.  For too long we put ourselves on a pedestal and said that did not happen here. We were prepared to point the finger at other countries where such horrors went on but we forgot to examine our own hearts and prosecute those within our own country who, we <Col N="1069" /> subsequently realised very publicly through the Fr. Brendan Smith case, are no different from anywhere else.</P>
    <P>We must recognise and deal with the fact that we have paedophiles and that they are organised. That is why I particularly welcome that this legislation protects children within the State.  It is very easy to say that other countries permit and facilitate this practice and that Irish men and women go abroad for that purpose but we must also recognise that it takes place under our very noses.  For too long people were afraid to speak out about it or turned a blind eye to it, but out of evil comes good.  The fact that the issue of paedophilia was raised in this country over the last number of years has allowed people who had suffered in silence for many years to speak at last knowing that they had a sympathetic ear at official level.  For too long we said that could not be.  It is fitting that this legislation should aim to protect children in this country as well as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a penalty on those who commit offences under the legislation elsewhere. Has any study been carried out as to how effective this type of legislation is in countries where it has been in force for a number of years? Scandinavian countries have been very progressive in this area of legislation.  Are there any statistics on how effective such legislation has been in obtaining prosecutions, which is what we are after in the long run?</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that an action must be an offence in both the sending and the receiving countries to be an offence under the legislation. That is a very onerous requirement and I do not agree with it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 states that proceedings may be taken in any place in this State.  How workable is that? I have no difficulty with the aim of the legislation but I have difficulty with its practicality.  The legislation says that a prosecution may be taken anywhere in the country without reference to who is being accused or the jurisdiction that might go with it.  I seek more clarification on that as it may pose difficulties in future and this legislation should be as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The legislation is comprehensive in terms of the balance providing in section 9 against double jeopardy.  In the interests of justice and in accordance with public international law, it is important that someone not be open to prosecution in a number of countries when the case has already been dealt with, at least to an extent, in one of the countries involved.</P>
    <P>Senators Taylor-Quinn and Lydon raised the issue of the level of punishment.  I agree with them because this is an issue that incites much concern in the country and in this House, where the need for this type of legislation has been debated.  Given the fact that so much of this type of crime goes undetected and that it is difficult to <Col N="1070" /> bring someone to court on offences such as this, it is not good enough that, when they are brought to court, they can walk away with a minor fine.  It should be stated that there is no tolerance for child sexual abuse here and the best way to do that is to impose severe penalties.  The departmental officials may say that penalties must be in line with punishments meted out for other sexual crimes but two wrongs do not make a right.  The answer to that is that the penalties for all sexual abuse crimes must be increased.  This provision is not good enough, particularly when it comes to the punishment of those who have committed an offence related to the publishing of information and those who have facilitated and organised transport and child sexual trafficking. In the long run, that will be the section that will be used most because it is the crime that is most easily detectable.  Yet, after a summary conviction, the maximum fine is £1,500.  That is peanuts to anyone in this business and will not be a deterrent.  This must be strengthened.</P>
    <P>During the debate the Minister of State referred to the Pornography Bill which he is soon to introduce.  That is to be welcomed because much of the recent child sexual abuse has arisen, and been exacerbated, by the level of pornography in society.  That cannot be tackled soon enough, and I welcome the Minister of State's efforts in that area.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves that human nature does not change and we are no different from any other country.  In Third World countries the level of protection for children is extremely low and in those countries poverty makes it almost a requirement for certain families to allow their children enter this trade.  We should not find that excusable or acceptable in Ireland or elsewhere and there is a duty on us as legislators to ensure that what can be done is done to protect children here and abroad.  In that sense I welcome the legislation.</P>
    <P>How effective will this legislation be in detection?  What will the Garda's role be in ascertaining the information necessary to bring a prosecution?  That is vague in the legislation. There is also the huge harm that child sexual abuse has caused and continues to cause throughout the world.  It is not enough to clap ourselves on the back and say that we have introduced all the legislation possible.  Many children have suffered psychological and physical abuse from which they can never recover.  That abuse goes from generation to generation affecting their relationships in subsequent years. Funding is required for proper counselling for those who suffer such abuse both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>I recently visited to Calcutta to see the work of GOAL with street children there.  GOAL brings them in for a break from their child prostitution activities and, in reality, it is the only way those <Col N="1071" /> children can survive.  An effort was being made to rehabilitate them and help them out of that vicious circle with education.  That work is invaluable and must be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the legislation.  He mentions the spirit of co-operation that has brought the Bill before us today.  I pay tribute to Deputies Eoin Ryan and John O'Donoghue and to Senator Henry who put so much effort into the Bills which were taken on board by the Government to arrive at a workable form.</P>
      <P>If all our political deliberations had what was best for children as their cornerstone, we would have far better legislation and more of the type of Bill we have before us.  Taking party political considerations into account, there would be common ground in any legislative debate if that was the starting point.  That starting point is self-serving because protecting our children and allowing them to reach their potential is the only hope society has.  Ignoring the rights of children and refusing them their rights is to risk social anarchy.</P>
      <P>Prostitution is a form of slavery but child prostitution must be the worst form of slavery. Nobody in either House could support anything which would allow children to be exploited in the manner outlined by other speakers.  The Minister of State mentioned that the reason this has not come to the top of the political agenda before is the naivete about the problem.  He is right.  For those of us considered normal, it is unbelievable and unconscionable to hear and read the stories and case histories brought before the Oireachtas on this subject.  There is an attitude that it is better not to think of this but for those of us who are parents it is very difficult to consider those who would want to destroy young children by engaging in sexual activities with young boys and girls.  That does not make sense for those of us considered normal.  This is an area one would tend to shy away from even thinking about unless, as Senator Lydon said, it visits one's own doorstep.  In that case one could easily imagine wanting to see the perpetrator of such a crime face the ultimate penalty.  Senator Lydon mentioned tagging these criminals.  There would be plenty of people, and I might be one, who would consider a far greater penalty for anyone who destroyed and defiled a young person in the way paedophiles and child sex abusers do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, the cause of the problem is multifaceted.  Poverty is one of the primary causes, although the Minister outlined others.  However, I part company with him there. Demand is the cause of the problem.  Many of the Asian countries mentioned by the Minister and others are very poor and children are exploited in sweat shops.  We have child sex abuse because <Col N="1072" /> of demand.  I agree with Senator Lydon, possibly for the first time, that this legislation is good as far as it goes.  Pornography is exploitative and sends out the message that to behave in a certain way is acceptable.  To take that to its illogical conclusion, people in this Chamber could argue that child sex abuse has its place in sexuality.  The Minister mentioned that there is other legislation which will address the issues raised by Senator Lydon.  However, demand is the issue. Programmes tackling drug abuse also state that there is a supply and demand problem.  We must examine all areas to see how demand may be reduced.</P>
    <P>I am delighted these issues are a focal point of Ireland's EU Presidency.  The events of the summer put this issue in its rightful place at the top of the political agenda.  This is something I welcome.  We wonder, when we deal with legislation such as this, why we did not think of it ten or 20 years ago.  Maybe, as the Minister stated, it is because of the naivete in many quarters about the nature and extent of such abuse.  I was naive about the extent of it.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>A United Nations working group reported that child prostitution may involve millions of children.  UNICEF estimated in 1994 that at least one million children were involved in child prostitution in Asia alone.</P>
    <P>That figure is absolutely frightening.  I wonder if it will make the headlines on tonight's <i>Evening Herald.</i>  We tend to highlight the paedophile rings in Belgium and other countries.  However, the level of child abuse mentioned in the Minister's speech is not related to paedophile rings.  I attended a conference on child sex abuse during the summer and that point was repeatedly made by contributors.  They stated that high profile cases with identified paedophile rings or groups gain huge media attention.  However, ongoing child sex abuse by members of a family or by those who take sex holidays to Asian countries does not get the same coverage but accounts for 90 per cent of all child sex abuse.  That must be made known and repeatedly stated.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that this and other legislation deals with known groups of deviant people with a different sexual orientation.  It must be repeatedly stated that 90 per cent of child sex abuse is committed by individuals travelling on sex tours to countries mentioned in the legislation.  The figure of one million highlights this.  It is good that the legislation targets the organisers of such sex tours or holidays as well as Irish citizens or residents who engage in unlawful sex.  As Senator Lydon said, there have been cases where child prostitutes were arrested and jailed and the perpetrators got on a plane and went home.  This legislation is good in that it addresses both sides: those who commit the crime and those who organise it.  It will no longer be an excuse to pretend one was unaware of what was happening.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lydon that it may be <Col N="1073" /> necessary to change &ldquo;and&rdquo; to &ldquo;or&rdquo; in the definition because there is a loophole in it in so far as it requires the act to be an offence in Ireland and in the country where it is committed. Perhaps this was this discussed on Committee Stage in the other House?</P>
    <P>Subsections 2(3) and 2(4) make it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure &ldquo;the commission of an offence, which is an offence by virtue of subsection (1)&rdquo;.  I welcome that.  As with prostitution in Ireland, some people are not punished for this behaviour.  We must tighten our laws in this regard.  Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Lydon referred to the penalty and I support their remarks.  If the cost of a child's innocence is the £1,500 penalty imposed, both Houses do the child a great disservice.</P>
    <P>I ask for the Minister's advice on section 8.  He says it is important because it enables the court to have regard to a person's physical appearance or attributes for the purposes of determining whether that person is under the age of 17 at the time of the court hearing or was under that age at the time of the alleged commission of an offence under section 2.  The Minister cited the Australian legislation.  Could this section also be used to avoid conviction?  Could the person being charged suggest that the 14 year old looked anything but 14 and was viewed by him or her to have been older at the time?  Could this section be a legal loophole?  That is not intended but I am concerned that the legislation would be weakened if it were used in the opposite way to which it is intended.</P>
    <P>The legislation is welcome.  Senator Gallagher made a point about NGOs working in the countries where child prostitution is common.  I read in a magazine about a similar programme where young girls of 13 or 14 are being taken out of their villages before they are sold into prostitution.  They then learn skills and take part in training and personal development education programmes.  They are shown at a certain stage what happens to their female relations who are taken to the cities supposedly to earn easy money as barmaids, etc.  The point was made in the article that, whereas these programmes are successful, they cost money.  In tandem with passing this legislation, we should also put our money where our mouth is and give as much support as possible to NGOs which are providing practical support to ensure that children do not end up in the situations which have been graphically described in this debate.  I congratulate Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue and Senator Henry.  This is important legislation and perhaps we can strengthen it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill which I believe every Senator will support.  For the first time this Bill makes an effort to tackle child sex abuse outside Ireland.  It is important that we try and control this well organised business.  Organised rings of paedophiles are <Col N="1074" /> engaging in this horrific crime.  We must renew our determination to introduce all necessary legislation to ensure that practice ceases.</P>
      <P>Organised paedophilia has been exposed by many television programmes over the years. These programmes have shown how children as young as ten years old are introduced to prostitution.  Poverty is given as one reason many of these children are forced into prostitution by their parents.  We have a duty to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are tried, convicted and face long prison sentences.</P>
      <P>These children suffer terrible degradation and so it is essential that we redouble our efforts to investigate and highlight these crimes.  However, in the past we were complacent in the view that most child prostitution took place in Asia and Africa.  Events in Belgium in August 1996 brought home to us that this problem is more widespread.  Those events were among the most serious crimes I have ever come across.  The tragedy was not only confined to the children involved.  It was also a tragedy for their parents because they could not trust the police, the politicians or the judiciary.  Every institution in which people normally have faith and trust breached that faith; that is why the Belgian paedophile ring was able to exist for so long. There was a cover up at police, political and judicial levels.  It is sad that we, as members of the EU, should find ourselves with a fellow member involved in crimes against humanity.  No sentence imposed on the perpetrators of those crimes could adequately convey the depth of public anger.</P>
      <P>Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the EU and we must ensure that we take whatever measures are necessary to tighten the laws so that such crimes can never occur again.  Regrettably crimes of this nature will occur here and there but we must make an effort to counteract the activities of those involved.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Belgium is the only European country in which such crimes are being committed.  It is likely that there are pockets of these well organised rings throughout Europe. We have a duty to ensure that such groups are subjected to thorough police investigations and convicted by the courts.</P>
      <P>Over 1 million children are involved in child prostitution in Asia and Africa.  The tragedy and human degradation which these young children suffer demands that those involved should pay the maximum penalty we can impose by law.  I am pleased that we are making an effort to ensure that the perpetrators of such crimes are charged and convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have problems in Ireland.  There are families in which children are being molested; there are problems in some of our homes and institutions which, hopefully, we have curtailed and we have children and young adults being attacked and raped.  While people are anxious there should be the greatest latitude on the circulation of information we, in Europe, have to <Col N="1075" /> take a serious look at the tolerance displayed with regard to these videos and their sale.  Many of the videos are of a very doubtful nature and may cause young men to commit sexual crimes.  Many impressionable people who watch snuff videos do not cause problems but in some cases such videos lead to people to commit crimes.  To safeguard society, stricter efforts must be made to control the circulation and stop the production and sale of these videos.  If they are circulated by devious means, a special effort to has to be made to counteract their sale.  Similarly a special effort is required to control the sale of magazines which outline and display serious pornography.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on television production managers and chief executives across Europe to examine the content of the programmes they air. I refer mainly to sexual matters that are beyond normal standards of behaviour.  That should not be tolerated.  We should introduce safeguards to prevent the circulation of such films on television and in cinemas.  Overall we share a responsibility in this.  The ordinary person who watches these films does not cause problems but there are many impressionable people who do.  To go a stage further, an effort should be made to see how we can control violent crime on television where people are seriously injured, kicked, knifed, etc. It creates a bad impression for many young people and is responsible for many gang fights and for many individuals being attacked and mugged.</P>
    <P>I am pleased this Bill has the Minister of State's support.  It is worthy of the support of this House and I support it.  I congratulate the people who introduced it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The unanimity we have seen today is a mark of the condemnation which every Member of the Oireachtas shows for this activity.  It is not a surprise that Ireland did not have this legislation as this is an extra jurisdictional, extra territorial, concept which is being introduced into our law.  I note that the Minister of State did not contradict this in his speech.  This is first time the Oireachtas will be enacting legislation which, in effect, makes it a crime to commit a listed offence in a foreign jurisdiction if it is also an offence here.  Another example might be treason.  I imagine treason against the state in any part of the world would be a crime under Irish law but in general terms this is the first time the Oireachtas is giving extra jurisdictional authority.  As was pointed out, Ireland is not the first country to do this.  Several countries, particularly in this area have done so already.  The concept of extra territorial jurisdiction has been enshrined in law in the United States for many years, particularly as far <Col N="1076" /> as kidnapping and racketeering are concerned. There is precedent for enshrining in law the concept of a crime being committed in a foreign land.</P>

The Minister of State correctly pointed out that I omitted to mention the valuable work done by Senator Henry; it was not intentional.  It is excellent that the Government agreed to essentially fuse both Bills through the committee framework.  It makes sense.  In the courts where two cases pertain to the same issue it is frequently the case that both will be heard together; I do not see why two Bills which deal with the same issue should not be taken together.

      <P>&mdash;expresses its concern about the resourcing of Irish primary education and particularly noting the lack of an adequate remedial service, the number of substandard school buildings, the poor provision for pupils with special needs and the low level of grants for the running and maintenance of schools;</P>
      <P>&mdash;regrets the slow progress being made in replacing and renovating substandard school buildings, despite the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>;</P>
      <P>&mdash;demands that all schools in the recently published INTO list be dealt with as a priority;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and further demands that, in the light of the embarrassing OECD document, <i>Education at a Glance</i>, published yesterday, Tuesday, 10 December, in Paris, showing in international terms the atrociously low level of resources given to Irish primary education, the Government set it as a priority objective that Irish primary school class sizes and spending per pupil be brought into line with European Union averages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for taking this motion tonight as I know she has a busy schedule.  The motion is very strongly worded, for which I make no apology.  Having said that, this is a continuing issue and I ask the Government benches, in particular, to note that while it is strongly worded it is not especially directed at this Minister.  This issue has been a problem for many years and progress must be made on it.  The Ministers with whom I have dealt over the past five or six years <Col N="1078" /> of all parties have all made an effort on this issue but it will never be enough until our funding compares with that in Europe.</P>
    <P>The OECD report showed, among other things, that Irish primary teachers are very well paid in a world context.  That is worth mentioning because it is a fact that our teachers are valued. Teachers value their pupils and the service they provide.  It is important that they are listened to in regard to these areas.</P>
    <P>There are always huge levels of frustration in dealing with an issue such as this.  As a representative of teachers, I will say it is never enough and the Minister will say how much she has done.  I understand this motion will be accepted by the Government and I ask the Minister to use it as a lever to get the Government and the Department of Finance to improve conditions in primary schools.  She will have the full support of all parties for that.</P>
    <P>There is very worrying information about primary school funding in the OECD report.  We need further information.  The Minister and her Department have examined the impact of school funding in various different ways.  The INTO have initiated a new survey of all primary schools to determine the precise problems caused by the lack of funding.</P>
    <P>It is easy to make a mantra of the various issues &mdash; the shortage of ancillary staff, the lack of a nationwide psychological service, the small number of general purpose rooms and the inadequate resources for special and remedial education &mdash; which daily bite into the operation of schools and will be reflected in any survey results.  The Minister is quite entitled to say she has made progress on each of these issues, as would any Minister of the day.  While the progress made in these areas must be recognised, it should also be recognised that it is not sufficient.  We all need to be happy with the service, including that provided by teachers in the classroom.  Every aspect of education must give value to the taxpayer who is entitled to demand the best quality service.</P>
    <P>It is now official that Irish primary teachers have the largest and most overcrowded classes in the European Union and, according to the OECD, in the world with the exception of Turkey. Irish kindergarten classes are even larger than those in Turkey.  A great deal needs to be done.</P>
    <P>There are under 500,000 pupils in primary schools and, although that is unlikely, that figure might go as low as 400,000 in ten years' time. Assuming, it does and that we retain the current number of teachers in the system, which is just over 20,000, that would give a ratio of 20 pupils per teacher.  The European average pupil to teacher ratio is 16 to one.</P>
    <P>The Minister continually refers to the fact that there are 18,000 fewer primary school pupils this year.  However, we still need to retain the current <Col N="1079" /> number of teachers &mdash; in fact, we need to increase it.  While the number of pupils is reducing we can deal with many problems through the demographic dividend, but the number will cease to reduce in five or six years time.  That might not be the Minister's problem or mine but it will be a problem for someone and we must plan for it. We need more resources if we are to reach the European level.</P>
    <P>Having the largest class size in the European Union means that discipline problems are increasingly difficult to deal with, there is less time to deal with individual learning problems and the identification of a pupil with particular or special needs is much delayed.  As a teacher, the Minister will be well aware of that.</P>
    <P>In the OECD report Irish primary teachers emerge as the most productive in Europe.  In crude measurement terms such as class size, hours worked and so on, an Irish primary teacher does on average 1.5 times the work of other European teachers.  The fact that salary levels are above average is poor compensation for the physical wear and tear and near impossible professional challenges facing teachers.  A balance must be found.  The Minister has always defended the need for a well paid teaching service.</P>
    <P>The OECD report confirms once again that Irish primary education has the lowest per pupil investment and the worst pupil teacher ratio in the European Union, which includes the element of teachers' salaries &mdash; halving teachers' salaries and doubling the number of teachers would not change the investment per pupil.  The Minister will argue that the percentage of GDP spent on primary education is high in OECD terms, which is true, but the investment per pupil is very low.</P>
    <P>When we consider that primary school teachers and pupils operate in overcrowded classes and substandard accommodation for long hours, it is galling to see the low value placed by the State on them compared to that placed on second and third level students.  I do not suggest second and third levels are overfunded &mdash; the opposite is the case &mdash; but, in crude terms, the State invests three and a half times more in each third level student than in each primary pupil.  There are good arguments why it should be significantly more, but I am not sure it should be over three times more.  In financial terms the boards of management of primary schools receive £45 for each pupil per year to run their schools.  The Minister has increased that amount significantly by 50 per cent since she took office.  However, after the pupils leave, they go to post-primary schools where the boards of management receive £177 for each pupil per year to run the schools.  I do not understand why primary school pupils are so undervalued.</P>
    <P>Overall, the State invests 50 per cent more on second level students than on primary school <Col N="1080" /> pupils.  In recent times it has been repeatedly shown that second level education is not overfunded and that parents and teachers are worried about it.  This demonstrates the poor position at primary level.  The gap between primary and post-primary and third levels is wider in Ireland than any other European country.  This underfunding is a callous response to the constitutional imperative which requires the State to provide free primary education; not only it is not free but it is more poorly funded than other levels of education.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Government signed a UN document relating to the rights of children and the commitment to free primary education.  This is stated in the Constitution and the Minister for Education is entitled to call the shots on this matter at the Cabinet table.  She is being asked to carry the can for the lack of funding for primary education.  The Constitution entitles the Minister to demand this money and she would have the full support of the people on this issue.  The scale of the problems created by underfunding must be identified &mdash; for example, school debts.  As the Minister is aware, this is a huge problem.  I was infuriated some years ago when the rules relating to primary education were changed to allow boards of management to incur overdrafts.  I preferred it when they were not allowed to do so. Almost all schools are now, of necessity, engaged in fundraising.  Ancillary supports, such as caretaking, secretarial services and classroom assistance, are also important.  Issues such as the condition of buildings, the lack of equipment and the lack of information technology are constantly debated.</P>
    <P>We are talking about modernisation and the possible establishment in the future of a Department to deal with technology.  Immediate savings would be made if every school was hooked up to the Internet.  They could buy a full encyclopaedia on CD-ROM for £80 rather than spending £1,500 on <i>Encyclopaedia Britannia.</i>  For this amount, schools could have modems, printers and CD-ROM computers and be connected to the Internet.  This aspect should be considered.  I have raised this in the current negotiations between the social partners and the Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister shares my views on this matter.  It is difficult to provide a service given the widespread retail distribution network in primary education where, because of plantations and famines, there are houses up hills and down dales.  This is not the case in other European countries but information technology would make the service more cost effective.  It would also help in service education of teachers and the development of new ideas.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I have taken part in discussions on the funding of schools with management authorities and parent groups.  The impact on schools of inadequate funding has <Col N="1081" /> always been a problem and the current situation is leading to unmanageable problems which must be addressed because pupils deserve better.</P>
    <P>The motion is not critical of the Minister or her Department.  All sides of the House agree there is a problem.  I place the issue in the context of other aspects of education, none of which is overfunded, and Europe.  In terms of developing forward, immediate investment in primary education is needed, whether it is in information technology, school buildings, ancillary services or specialist teachers.  I ask the Minister to give her full support to the demands in the motion and to give full flight to her views on many of the issues I have heard her explain repeatedly in other places.  It is time she came out as a teacher, expressed her views and demanded that the Government give her the support to which she is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reiterate some of the principles Senator O'Toole eloquently and effectively enunciated.  The motion is not an attack on the Minister.  She has made a significant contribution in a number of the areas about which we are most concerned and she wants to continue doing so.  However, she must find that progress, although faster than under previous Administrations, is disappointingly slow given the amount of work which remains to be done.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members agree that the substandard schools mentioned in the recently published INTO priority list must be addressed and that these school buildings must be urgently replaced and renovated.  I wish to concentrate on two aspects of the motion.  The first relates to the provision of an adequate remedial service, a matter which is close to the Minister's heart.  The House debated it on 30 June 1993 when the Minister made 200 additional places available.  I urge her to continue even more emphatically in that direction given the way society is going and the problems which are piling up in terms of disadvantaged areas and attacks on the totality of poverty there, which is reflected in schools but which also reflects the home environment. Schools are an integral part of dealing with the difficulties but they cannot be a substitute for a full policy of attempting to crack the problems of structural unemployment and poverty which have become a culture in those areas.  This point has been made repeatedly and the great backlog which still exists in this area must be cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister deserves praise for her contribution towards the provision of more remedial teachers through courses at third level and through in service training.  I understand these are working satisfactorily in my college but there is still a great deal more to be done.  A challenge confronts us, much of which depends on EU funding.  Where do we go when problems arise or questions must be posed in the near <Col N="1082" /> future regarding the continuation of this funding for such a desirable purpose?  If the funding is not included in the Government's budgetary processes and is made contingent on continuing support at current levels from Europe, huge questions marks are placed over the sustainability of what has already been achieved and, even more so, on continuing it at an improved level.</P>
    <P>It is not a reflection on the Minister but the nature of the position in which we find ourselves that the issue of adequate provision for remedial teaching will force itself even further to the surface of the problems confronting education.  I agree with Senator O'Toole's point about the idea that, because numbers in primary education are falling, more resources are not required.  This is an extraordinarily mechanical way of considering the matter and it informs much of bureaucracy's approach to resourcing education. The idea is that if we wait long enough, the numbers will come down, not because of anything that is being done, but because of the working through the system of decisions made by innumerable people in the full pinnacle of their wisdom in earlier years.  Given the depths from which we began in terms of pupil-teacher ratios, that is an unacceptable approach to a much more urgent matter.  I support Senator O'Toole's argument and reasoning in that direction.</P>
    <P>The OECD report shows the lack of provision of non-salary resources in primary education in a comparative context in a glaring and disappointing way.  That investment in primary education, including pre-school education, is much needed.  I only saw the OECD figures today and Members are aware that one can make almost anything one wants of figures.  One of the more serious messages coming through is the great gap within the same grade of performance in the lower and top quartile.  There are huge differences in the achievement levels of pupils of the same age and often in the same grade and class.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers have a significant role to play in trying to cope with deprivation and in motivating pupils in the weaker strata.  In some cases it is a question of affinity for the subject or intelligence in a particular area, while in others it is question of motivation, background and innocence being pointed in the wrong direction from an early age.  Remedial teachers, in particular, coupled with falling pupil-teacher ratios &mdash; falling even faster than the slow trudge of the demographic consequences to the education system &mdash; are required at this stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague on the importance of improving technology about which we spoke this morning on the Order of Business.  Given what the Houses have done in terms of technology, it may seem importunity on our parts to tell others how they should conduct their affairs.  The sooner primary schools, indeed all schools, have access to <Col N="1083" /> information technology the better for everybody from the viewpoint of resources and educating children from an early age about the type of world in which they will grow up.</P>
    <P>Some people grudge teachers their comfortable salaries and positions.  Given the role of teachers in our society, we should grant them recognition for their fundamental contribution.  I suspect that if all teachers went on strike tomorrow morning parents would be running to second the role they play.  We are piling more and more responsibility on them.  They are now increasingly proxy parents and we are asking them to be surrogate social workers.  We are piling on them a cluster of problems which were dealt with in the home or elsewhere in earlier generations.  I do not believe we take adequate cognisance of the responsibility we expect teachers to discharge not only in the school towards their pupils but towards society as a whole.  I do not grudge them anything which may result from this motion which I strongly support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred if the motion had referred to the considerable amount of work the Minister has done in education since taking office.  It is a little bald from that viewpoint and it suggests that many things are wrong about which nothing is being done.  When one examines what has happened in education over the past number of years, one would have to acknowledge, as Senator Lee did, that a considerable number of things have been done. The context of education has changed.  Regional boards will be put in place which will free up the policy side and will make it more efficient and effective.</P>
      <P>At school level, there has been a large number of innovations aimed particularly at the disadvantaged.  The amount of money being spent in schools is enormous compared to a few years ago.  I would have preferred if that had been acknowledged in the motion.  However, the proposer and seconder admitted many good things were happening in education.  The motion give us the opportunity to do an audit and to look at things which are not 100 per cent.  The Minister will have no problem defending her position in each of the areas mentioned in the motion.  We cannot achieve everything in a day or a year. However, we must continuously try to reduce inequalities in the system, which is what is happening.  I am happy with the approach the Minister has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary education in Ireland is different to that in most other countries because we have a voluntary system.  The Department makes grants available and the owners of the school make up the difference.  That is how the system devolved. In recent years everybody has been looking for more resources from the Minister but nobody has <Col N="1084" /> suggested that the owners of schools make a greater input.  In fact, their input has been decreasing.  We tend to lose sight of the fact that this is a voluntary system.  I do not want to dwell on that because it is a hornet's nest which should remain untouched for the moment.  Although schools are privately owned, the Department is being asked to pay the full cost of running and maintaining them which, under the definition of a voluntary system, was never intended.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the remedial service which today is unrecognisable from the service which existed a few years ago.  There has been a considerable number of appointments to the remedial service.  A huge number of schools have a service which they did not have three or four years ago.  The number of substandard buildings has decreased.  Of the 47 schools on the INTOs list, 17 are at an advanced stage in the planning process.  The west coast has been transformed over the past number of years.  We must refer to the positive aspects.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to the poor provision for pupils with special needs.  A few years ago no provisions were made for such pupils and little attention was paid to their needs.  This Minister and Government have invested substantial resources in this area and they intend to continue to do so.  Within a few years those who remain disadvantaged will be looked after.</P>
    <P>As regards the low level of grants for the running and maintenance of schools, I already referred to the voluntary nature of schools, which has certain implications.  The capitation grants which the Minister is making available to national schools represent a colossal 60 per cent increase in the past few years.  Local contributions have not increased by 60 per cent; they have decreased. It has been suggested that we get rid of the local contribution but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>The motion also says that we should regret the slow progress being made in replacing and renovating substandard school buildings.  A huge amount of work has been done in this area.  We could all point to new schools which have been opened.  I can think of three or four schools in my area which the Minister opened in the past few years.  The motion demands that all schools in the recently published INTO list be dealt with as a priority.  That matter is receiving priority but the Minister does not have the resources to attack all 47 at once and no sensible person would expect her to do so.  Some 17 schools will be looked after quickly and the list will be reduced substantially over time.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to what some people say is the embarrassing OECD document.  I do not believe the document is embarrassing.  <i>Per capita</i> expenditure can be examined from various viewpoints.  However, we can stand over and be relatively proud of our position as regards expenditure on education.  The evolution of the <Col N="1085" /> system allowed the Government in the early days to make choices which it would not have made if it had been a complete State system.  Those choices have a distorting effect on the system today.</P>
    <P>We support this motion because, in effect, it supports what the Minister is doing.  The Minister will be able to show that the problems mentioned in the motion have been eroded in the last few years.  She will also be able to say that the erosion will continue apace for as long as the Government has control of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  It refers to the lack of resources being allocated to primary education and its knock-on effect.  The motion specifically refers to lack of remedial services and substandard schools.  I made a number of inquiries from colleagues &mdash; some of them members of the Minister's party &mdash; and many of them mentioned schools which are substandard.  However, there will always be a few substandard schools and I do not intend to base my comments on that issue this evening.  I will talk about the area I know best, the remedial services.</P>
      <P>The quality of access to remedial education concerns me.  In some cases the access consists of a remedial teacher who is available to a school once a week.  That teacher might teach reading skills one week and numerical skills the following week.  What happens to the student who is dyslexic?  There is no provision to deal with such a problem.  Often the parents must provide adequate facilities for such difficulties themselves.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in the allocation of resources should be on primary schools.  There is much talk nowadays about the impact of unemployment on families and the impact of dysfunctional families on children.  Many students are in need of remedial teaching only because there are no support systems in the home or in the school.  It is important that there be equality of access to remedial teachers in schools.  That is not the case at present.  There is a cluster system.  Perhaps it is the next best thing but I would prefer if money were redirected to primary level.  If a student of 12 years of age has not had access to proper remedial education his or her learning difficulties in reading and numerical assessment will not be discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are better facilities at second level.  They include career guidance teachers, remedial teachers and full access to educational psychologists.  What happens at primary level? There is one psychologist for every 40 schools.  I am aware of schools where the remedial teachers have tested students and brought their problems to the attention of the educational psychologist and they are still awaiting the psychologist's reports.  That is not good enough.  We should <Col N="1086" /> ensure that all professional supports are available to provide an integrated approach.  They should include the primary teacher, the remedial teacher, the home school link, the educational psychologist and access to social supports in the area.  That is the way forward.  That is what happens at second level, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  If the approach at primary level is right it will make my job and that of others in second level education easier.</P>
    <P>Many students are lost when they enter second level because they have low self esteem and cannot cope with their inability to read and write. They have to be re-tested by the educational psychologist and put on special programmes. They are immediately marked out.  On the other hand, if they were discovered at the age of four years, they could be helped through the primary education cycle and re-integrated into the system in fifth class, after which they would be ready to take on normal stream education by 12 or 13 years of age.  We would be well advised to invest our money at that level.  I constantly say as much because I am aware of the knock-on effect of not doing so.  An integrated approach must be adopted because the cluster policy does not work.</P>
    <P>There is a better system in the cities than in rural areas where a remedial teacher might be in one school on one day and in another school the following day.  In such cases the teacher has to familiarise him or herself with what happened in the school during the previous week and find a room in the school, which could be substandard, in which to teach the student before moving on to the next school.  There is too much mobility. The student only sees the remedial teacher coming to the school for an hour or two before he or she leaves again.  There is no continuity.  To that extent there is discrimination between urban and rural schools.</P>
    <P>I advocate the provision of one remedial teacher per school.  At least 20 per cent of students in every class are remedial and even the best class will contain four or five students who require remedial teaching for whatever reason. Such students require teaching on a one-to-one basis to give them proper support.  If remedial services were provided in every school from first class &mdash; parents should also be involved as far as possible &mdash; it would be more beneficial to the students than providing such access at 12 and 13 years of age when it is too late.  Regular support from an educational psychologist is also necessary but at present that is not available.  There is such a service on paper.  However, if I were to seek an educational psychologist in the morning I would have great difficulty in getting him or her to come to the school to test the child and furnish me with a prompt report so a decision could be made about the best class and remedial programme for the student.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> I do not dispute that there is access to remedial services and that the access has improved.  In addition, there is better access in disadvantaged areas in cities.  However, we need quality of access and that can only be provided if there is one remedial teacher per school.  It is particularly necessary now in view of the impact of unemployment and dysfunctional backgrounds on children.  If there was quality of access the knock-on benefit for the child would be huge. The Minister might not have enough money to provide it but I advise her to prioritise her expenditure.  The money should be directed at primary level.  Second level is doing fine at present and has plenty of supports.  However, there are not enough supports at primary level and that is the problem.  Our thinking should focus on that level.</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have come to the Seanad since Senator Cosgrave, a colleague in my constituency, was elected Cathaoirleach in rather sad circumstances.  I mourn the sudden loss of the previous Cathaoirleach, Senator Naughten. Senator Cosgrave is the third Cathaoirleach with whom I have dealt during my period of office. Ministers have been welcomed to the Chamber by each Cathaoirleach with great courtesy.  It is sad to see the loss of so many good men from so many different persuasions.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address the House and to comment on the findings of the OECD report and I will be as positive as possible. It was with this in mind that I did not seek to try to influence the wording of Senator O'Toole's motion but accepted it in the spirit in which he assured us it was tabled.  It can still, as Senator Cotter said, make rather grim reading but I noted the points made.</P>
      <P>The education system is a success.  Several OECD reports confirm this.  By international standards we have a high retention rate of pupils in education, second only to Norway.  The outcome is very good, reflecting on the teaching profession and the investment we make in our teachers.  It is an extraordinary statement about the success of the education system here.</P>
      <P>We have a high output of mathematics and science graduates.  Let us celebrate this good news.  We have high mathematics and science attainment at junior cycle level.  We have a very high participation of teachers at primary and second level in in-career development programmes, a deliberate investment in our teaching profession.</P>
      <P>All these achievements are built on the foundations laid in our primary schools.  The teachers in our primary schools, without doubt, achieve internationally high standards.  They should be recognised and valued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> I have put aside £40 million for teacher in-career development in the national plan negotiated for 1993-99.  This year we will spend £4 million on in-career development, the training and retraining of teachers.  A meagre sum of less than £700,000 was spent in 1992, the year before I took office.  This illustrates the legacy of under funding which I inherited and I hope Senator Ormonde is listening to these comments.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the OECD report is not commenting on my term in office.  Some of it relates to 1994 and 1993 and it is incumbent on us to note the record of previous Administrations which led to the under-funding of primary education and the steps I have taken since 1993 to correct this.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister, the education budget has increased by one third.  The effect of this improved funding is felt in every primary school. On my appointment, I adopted two priorities for our primary schools.  First, I wanted to improve pupil teacher ratios, capitation grants and general support for all schools in our primary system.  We had to make up for years of neglect.  Second, I wanted to target support specifically at those children with special needs arising from disadvantage, learning difficulties and physical disabilities.  Sometimes, as I apportion the massive funding increase which I have secured, it has led to friction.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that I have succeeded in keeping 1,000 teachers in the primary system who would have been lost because of falling pupil numbers.  Maybe it is just as well that numbers are falling.  However, the jobs could equally have been lost but that did not happen because of the partnership between the teacher unions, the Government and the Minister.  One thousand teachers have been targeted for general improvements in primary schools and for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The pupil teacher ratio which stood at 25.2 four years ago has been reduced to 22.5 in the current school year, a decrease of 2.7.  Maximum class size has fallen from 39 to 35 over the last four years, a decrease of four pupils per class.</P>
    <P>In disadvantaged schools maximum class sizes have fallen from 39 to 29 over the last four years, a decrease of ten pupils per class in schools that are within the general disadvantaged scheme of the Department.  In schools which experience particular difficulties and which are included in the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative we have specifically targeted class size.  I taught a class of 63 children from the Oliver Bond flats area which is now enjoying classes no bigger than 15 for the first four years &mdash; I will not talk about the quality of teaching to which Senator Ormonde referred.</P>
    <P>In the context of student performance and class sizes, our teachers are performing well.  From research available we know that if we decrease class sizes to 15, the quality of life for teachers <Col N="1089" /> will improve as will the performance from pupils. In schools in the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative, the size of junior infants, senior infants, first and second classes is no bigger than 15.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the OECD report, an end of term report on previous Administrations, shows class size in primary schools in such a bad light?  I thank the Senator for acknowledging that improvements have been made which have been both general and specific in character.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Report of the Special Education Review Committee in 1993 there has been a significant increase in the number of special classes attached to ordinary national schools.  All these classes operate on the basis of a reduced pupil teacher ratio.  As Minister, I introduced a one unit improvement in the pupil teacher ratio across the entire range of special schools and classes.  This contrasts dramatically with the absence of change in the preceding four years.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with learning difficulties.  Since my appointment, I have allocated an additional 241 ex-quota remedial teaching posts to primary schools.  This contrasts with the preceding four years.  The record stands for itself: in 1989 not a single extra remedial teacher was appointed.  In 1990 there seemed to be a prospect of improvement when 80 were appointed but in 1991 and 1992 no remedial teacher was appointed.  No wonder Senator Ormonde is meeting problems at secondary level. The facts speak for themselves.  However, I will continue to search for further improvement.  I share the expectations of the remedial teacher service about which Senator Ormonde spoke.</P>
    <P>We also have resource teachers who cater for pupils with more serious learning difficulties and disabilities.  Forty-six resource teachers provide this specialised service.  This is not enough but is an increase on the extraordinarily low number of seven resource teachers which we had four years ago.  Where children with special needs are involved, it is necessary to supplement the teaching staff with back-up support from care staff.  When I became Minister, there were 82 child care posts in the special education system. There has been an increase from 82 to 232 in four years.  There is no doubt that more needs to be done to undo the legacy of previous Administrations, but I put it to the House that employing almost three times as many child care assistants in four years is a major advance.</P>
    <P>The home/school/community liaisón scheme is a further initiative to combat disadvantage in the primary school system.  The scheme is targeted at pupils in particular areas of disadvantage.  We now have a national co-ordinator to make sure this is operating nation-wide.  There were 30 coordinators at primary level when I took office.  In <Col N="1090" /> four years, this number has grown to 105, serving 178 schools and 51,000 pupils and their parents.  I am proud to have encouraged and facilitated the expansion of this scheme because we did not have this type of communication during my teaching days.  There was no link between home and school.  Teachers thought they knew it all.  I have learned that this is not so and I am glad to be in a position to encourage the growth of that scheme.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Education, the capitation grant stood at £28 per pupil.  During the previous four years it had changed very little. In 1989, it was £26.50, in 1990, £28.00, in 1991, £28.00 and in 1992, £28.00, an increase of only £1.50 in four years.  I have succeeded in securing substantial increases in the level of this grant to £33 in 1993, £38 in 1994 and £40 in 1995.  A further increase this year has brought the standard grant to £45 per pupil, which represents an increase of £17 per pupil, or more than 60 per cent, over a four year period.</P>
    <P>The increase in capitation grants for schools designated disadvantaged has been even greater. There has been an increase of £30, from £45 to £75, in the last four years.  I have also introduced special capitation rates for pupils attending special classes and special schools.  When I took office, the grant per child with mild mental handicap was a mere £76.20 per student.  Today it is £195 for students under 12 and £316 for students of 12 years or over.  When I took office, the grant per child with a severe or profound mental handicap was a mere £92.70.  Today it is £383 per child.  When I took office, the grant per child with a visual impairment was £132.  Today it is £307 per child under 12 years of age and £372 for children over 12.  I could multiply these examples and I will continue to seek more and more funding, but my record is clear.  I am delighted Senator O'Toole has given me the opportunity to state this.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the issue of the capital funding of primary schools.  The House is well aware that during the period 1988-1992 there were severe cutbacks in the capital funding of primary schools.  This year we will spend almost £30 million on primary school buildings.  We are completing nearly two buildings per week. Senator Cotter asked Senators to think about what schools in their areas have celebrated the completion of new buildings or repairs.  Spending in this area amounted to £13 million in 1991.  I have spent £30 million in this year.  This was truly a legacy of neglect.  When I came into office the INTO presented me with a list of 170 seriously substandard buildings and I took it as a sad testimony to the indifference we witnessed in the past.</P>
    <P>Since I got that list, over £89 million has been allocated for capital works at primary schools. Major projects have been undertaken at over 120 schools.  Improvement grants have paid for over <Col N="1091" /> 7,000 minor works &mdash; closing mouse holes and so on &mdash; carried out in schools.  It is worth noting that we have 3,300 primary school buildings. Major projects are coming to an end at over 60 schools around the country, while work is in progress at a further 24 schools.  I recently approved major projects in Cork, Kildare and Mayo.  Improvement grants have been paid in respect of 1,600 applications by schools for assistance this year and I am delighted the Government agreed to the allocation of an additional £8 million to capital projects.</P>
    <P>More work needs to be done.  I need to hear Senators' voices raised in support of that work and I take this debate in that spirit.  The backlog of projects built up as a result of cuts imposed between 1988-1992 is unbelievable.  I am committed, with the INTO, this Government and the support of my colleagues, to eliminating the substandard buildings list.</P>
    <P>The INTO recently published a further list of 47 schools which need attention.  Of these, one project has gone to tender, a second will go to tender within ten days, improvement grants have been sanctioned this year in four cases, 18 schools are advancing through the various stages of the planning process, detailed reports have been sought in respect of ten schools, a further 11 schools will be considered for inclusion in a future capital programme and the Department has no record of an application from two of the schools. I am sure Senator O'Toole and I can speak about that matter later.  I assure the House that, as with the earlier list of 170 schools, I will constantly review this list and prioritise the buildings on it. I am glad that Senator Cotter was able to think of so many projects that were neglected for years and have now been completed.</P>
    <P>I have responsibility for all pupils and for the resources that I receive.  I must use them wisely and well.  The OECD report leaves no room for complacency but the measures I have taken demonstrate my commitment to ensuring that the shortfall in resources identified in the OECD report is and will be addressed.  I stand over my record in improving capitation grants, increasing teacher numbers and tackling the backlog of major capital projects.</P>
    <P>We are examining the whole area of technology.  This section of the curriculum needs investment from in-career development because teachers need that kind of support in order to introduce the exciting possibilities of technology to their pupils.  I smiled when Senator Lee referred to the difficulties we have in accessing technology.  If more people in this House can access and use technology in all its forms it will be easier for me to secure support for that investment.  I will support those teachers who take this area, for which they were not trained, into their curriculum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> I thank Senators for allowing me to speak and to acknowledge the work done, as has been said already.  As Minister for Education seeking more funding, a debate such as this from all sides of the House is extremely helpful.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The first two sections of this motion identified four ongoing problem areas in Irish primary education.  These are the lack of an adequate remedial service; poor provision for pupils with special needs; low level of grants for the running and maintenance of schools and, last but not least, the number of substandard schools which are still in use and the slow progress in relation to the replacement and renovation of these buildings.  All these problems have their roots in the inadequate resourcing of primary education over the years.  They will be solved only by the provision of substantially increased funding for Irish primary education.</P>
      <P>The OECD report, <i>Education at a Glance</i>, to which the final section of the motion refers and which was published yesterday in Paris, confirms once again that Irish primary school pupils are still being taught in the largest classes of any country in the EU.  Of all the countries surveyed, only Mexico and Turkey have a higher pupil teacher ratio at primary level than Ireland.  The lack of an adequate remedial service in the primary sector has been highlighted in almost every education debate in which I have participated.  Some progress has been made over the years but there is still a long way to go.  In this regard it would be most unfair not to acknowledge the present Minister's special interest in this area and the further progress which has been made under her stewardship in this and other areas to which the motion refers, but she can only do as much as the resources which are available to her allow.</P>
      <P>This problem will be solved satisfactorily only when every primary school, irrespective of size, has access to an adequate remedial service.  At present I understand that more than 900 schools still have to manage without the services of a remedial teacher.  The problem is particularly acute in small rural schools where the children with learning disabilities are at a distinct disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> their counterparts in schools which have access to a remedial service. The provision of remedial education at primary school level makes good economic sense.  It is more cost effective than intervention at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural areas where remedial services are provided on a shared basis, there is a need to ensure the provision is based on the children's educational needs rather than overall enrolment. Action also needs to be taken to ensure that suitable accommodation is available for all teachers of remedial classes.  Remedial grants are <Col N="1093" /> also grossly inadequate and need to be increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The provisions for pupils with special needs also leaves much to be desired.  Many such pupils are being educated in totally unsuitable buildings.  There is also a need for suitably qualified classroom assistants and proper support services.  The policy of integrating children with special needs into ordinary classes in national schools needs to be supported by adequate resources.  All over the country children with disabilities are enrolled in such classes and the teachers have little, if any, backup from other professionals like psychologists, physiotherapists, counsellors or speech therapists.  If the policy of integration is to succeed, it cannot be allowed to continue on this haphazard basis.  As soon as each child's individual needs are determined, the required backup facilities should be put in place.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Estimates, which were published this week, contain no good news on the funding of primary schools.  Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> reported that both capitation and building grants have been frozen at 1996 levels.  The time has come to end rather than increase the disparity in funding between the different levels of education. Adequate grants should be provided for the maintenance, heating, lighting, cleaning and insurance of primary schools.  It is ridiculous that so much of the time and energy of members of boards of management and parents' committees have to be expended trying to raise the necessary finance to ensure the day-to-day running costs can be met.  The need to supplement the totally inadequate funding provided by the Department of Education places an unacceptable burden on many families and results in serious financial hardship for parents in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The time has come for every school to have an adequate budget for the provision of essential educational materials, facilities and equipment in addition to meeting the costs of employing necessary ancillary staff, such as caretakers, secretaries and classroom assistants.  In the Estimates, the provision for primary school building also remains the same as it was in 1996, despite the fact that in many parts of the country children are being educated in school buildings which are seriously substandard.</P>
    <P>The INTO recently published a list of primary schools which are in a deplorable condition and which are totally unfit for use as educational establishments.  Recently, on the Adjournment, Senator Finneran and I raised the case of one such school, Cloontuskert national school in County Roscommon.  We were told by the Minister for Health, who was replying on behalf of the Minister for Education, that the Department's architectural staff are in the process of preparing tender documentation for this school.  I appeal to the Minister to expedite that provision as soon as she can.</P>
    <P>Investment in primary education makes very sound economic sense.  We are told that primary <Col N="1094" /> education is the foundation on which all further education is built.  The stronger and more solid the foundation, the better the superstructure.  The under-resourcing of primary education is, as the old saying goes, penny wise and pound foolish.  It is time we pledged ourselves to abandon that policy in the interests of this and future generations of Irish children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not identify the person but he has identified himself.  An indication of the good work the Minister is doing is that Fr. Seán Healy of CORI has acknowledged her particular interest in the area of disadvantage and she has diverted resources to the disadvantaged when pressure was exerted for her to spread the cake evenly across all sectors.  The Minister took the wiser decision and &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; will be one of the best things ever done in Irish education.  Schools that are particularly disadvantaged have been picked out for special attention.  The effects of that may not be seen for ten years but they will be seen.  It is a fantastic approach and one on which the Minister should be complimented.</P>
      <P>It has not necessarily met with approval everywhere.  I have met parents and teachers who have said: &ldquo;Why should extra money be spent on them?  They do not bother coming to school and they have no interest in education.  Why is my child not getting the same?&rdquo;  In many cases their child comes from a middle class home and the parent can supply every facility going.  The State owes it to those who are disadvantaged to make up the differences in their lives by giving them better resources.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach said that intervention at primary level is very cost effective and the Minister has acknowledged that it pays off in the long-term.  Listening to the proposals from the Opposition, nobody seems to have sat down to cost the proposals.  Someone recently described this Government's actions as the economics of the lunatic asylum.  If his own party members costed their proposals and gave him the result, who would he regard as the lunatics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a quick calculation of the cost of putting a computer in every school in Ireland would cost approximately £6 million.  When one adds everything up, one is asking a great deal of the Minister.  The Minister has acknowledged that <Col N="1095" /> she could do with double her budget.  She would spend it very wisely.  She should be encouraged to keep demanding more and more money but, at the end of the day, it must come from somewhere; it must come from taxes.  The public has a great reluctance to pay those taxes.  Some day the general public will have to wake up to the fact that we cannot have good schools, teachers and facilities unless someone pays for it.  If the pupil does not pay, the general public will pay through taxes.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is often accused of being the tax and spend party.  That is not an insult; it is to our credit because we spend money on areas and on people who need it most.  I am not sorry that nickname has been given to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the improvements made.  However, anyone with common sense would know that, if windows are not painted every two to three years, they will have to be replaced.  The regular maintenance of schools was badly neglected.  Minor repairs were ignored.  Roofs were left without slates and rain got through.  What could have been solved five or six years ago by a pennyworth of paint now needs major reconstruction.  We are now paying for five, six and seven years' neglect.  People should realise that and should ask the parties which were in Government five or six years ago why the money was not spent then.</P>
      <P>One area I would like the Minister to examine is that of school assistants and bus escorts for the mentally handicapped because they are the most disadvantaged of all.  The Minister met a delegation from a school which services part of my constituency.  It outlined in detail the problems it faces.  The school bus escorts scheme must be put on a firmer footing; it cannot be based solely on the casual FÁS employee.  It is an area fraught with danger unless the bus driver has an escort.  It would be my wish to Santa Claus that this area be regularised.  The Minister might be wearing a red blouse but I do not think she is Santa Claus.  However, it is something we must examine to see if funding can be found for it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister.  She has done magnificent work and long may she remain in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has come into the House to outline what she has been doing because she has concentrated enormous effort on the neglected area of primary schools and has made huge advances.  I support the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative because it is those in disadvantaged areas who need to be given the most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly reject the notion that parents in those areas do not care about their children's education.  This is not so.  They care very much <Col N="1096" /> because they realise substandard education led them to their present position.  I work in a hospital near a disadvantaged area and I heard about a father who was so thrilled with his daughter's progress that he took her around pubs in the evening to show off how much she had improved.  Maybe he got this dash of enthusiasm coming up to Christmas.  Nonetheless, I gather the scheme has resulted in great advances.  I also applaud the Minister's efforts in the extraordinarily important pre-school area.</P>
    <P>The one aspect which depresses me is how we are to get the essential advantages of this approach through to the general public and to the Minister's colleagues in Government.  I listened to the enthusiasm of the general public and some Members of the Oireachtas for building more prisons and creating further prison spaces.  If the profiles of those in our penal institutions are examined, it will be seen that they mainly come from disadvantaged areas and that a large number of them left school at an early age.  Some prisoners told me that when they went to school they at least learned to read and write.  Why then are other prisoners only learning to read and write in prison?  If they had been taught in primary school, they would not cost the taxpayer £1,000 per week to keep them in a penal institution.  The Minister has increased the capitation grants but they are still pathetic.  There is an annual capitation grant of £75 for each pupil in a disadvantaged area.  An afternoon for a child in a special residential home would cost that much.  However, we still are not able to bring to the public mind the correlation between the two problems.  I do not know how it can be done but, if I could do anything to help, I would.</P>
    <P>One sees very few grey heads in penal institutions.  The vast majority are young people, usually young men, coming from disadvantaged areas where many of them have had substandard schooling.  The Minister spoke about teaching 63 pupils in a disadvantaged area of Dublin.  When I read medicine in Trinity College, I was obliged to do an arts degree as well so that I could become a supply teacher in September.  People had to suffer under me and I with no training for teaching.</P>

      <P>While I had no more than 50 pupils, it was impossible to deal with those numbers. Those in the first few rows learned something but the vast majority learned nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly applaud all the Minister's efforts.  I do not know how we are to get it through to the general public and to Members of the Oireachtas that, unless we put finance into this area of education and take it seriously, children will not properly benefit from second level education nor will they reach third level.  We waste much money on the incarceration of people who would be properly employed in the community had they received proper primary education.  I do not know how the public and Members of the <Col N="1097" /> Oireachtas can be made to see this and to stop the tremendous enthusiasm for locking up more of the population, be they adults or children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who had to face the world with a good primary education, I realise its importance and the improvements which have been made.  However, desired improvements and those being implemented must be emphasised.</P>
      <P>Children need remedial education for a wide variety of reasons.  They may have specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia, their education may be interrupted by ill-health or other circumstances or they may have emotional problems preventing them reaching their full potential.  Whatever the reason, it is best addressed at the earliest stage possible.</P>
      <P>The need for remedial teaching is at its greatest in the primary sector.  For many children, primary school is not simply an education but a foundation.  For those who leave school early, it is the only education they will ever receive and we must ensure it is of the highest quality.  We continue to plough money into third level education while sometimes ignoring the needs of primary school children.  I am confident that proposals in the White Paper on Education will help reverse that.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative initiated by the Minister which targets resources at areas of greatest disadvantage and which, hopefully, will be expanded.  It has been estimated that, approximately, 15 per cent of pupils are in need of remedial services.  Despite enormous progress we fall far short of adequately addressing those children's needs.  In 1992 there were 947 remedial teachers, in 1995-96 the figure is 1,188.  That is a substantial increase and there is also the provision of resource teachers. Nationally about 87 per cent of all primary school pupils have some form of access to a remedial teacher.  However, the objective must be to have a remedial teacher available to all pupils.</P>
      <P>A lot more will need to be done to remedy the lack of attention which was paid to this area in the past, where children with difficulties were fobbed of with vague and unfulfilled promises to expand the remedial services.  I accept that the Minister has fleshed out these promises and I welcome the establishment of the task force to implement the findings of the Special Education Review Committee.  The White Paper provides that each school will be responsible for drawing up a policy on student assessment and that the school psychological service will be expanded to support teachers in this task.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to establish a national data base which would register each child with a special disability giving each education board the responsibility for these students in co-operation with health boards.  I fear that its implementation may come too late for many children who do not have access to remedial teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances one always has to be a little parochial and I make a special plea for a <Col N="1098" /> remedial teacher for Scoil Gubnatán in Mallow which is under severe pressure due to an increase in pupil numbers.  The Minister made a good decision to upgrade that school but there is a danger that pupils who do not receive appropriate remedial teaching will fall through the gap in the education system.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with paragraph 3 of the motion. I read in <i>The Corkman</i> last week that a school manager was reported as saying that his school is sound.  He told the parents and his teachers that the INTO did not make a proper assessment in that case.  I wondered what were the criteria set down in this respect and I got a copy of Circular 24/82.  I compared this circular with gaelscoil Thomaís Dáibhís in Mallow.  This school was founded in 1984, has 180 students, no indoor toilet and is housed in leaking prefabricated buildings which were second hand when acquired 13 years ago.  It is not good enough that students are being taught in such conditions.  If the school further west is not included, then perhaps gaelscoil Thomáis Dáibhís would be included in the Minister's programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the great uplift that is given to students, teachers and parents when a school is refurbished.  A crash programme is needed to upgrade all schools.  We will always encourage the provision of such funds in the Estimates.  I hope we will have improvements both in the buildings and the provision of remedial teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support this motion.  All sides of the House acknowledge what the Minister has done since taking office.  I accept that she has made great strides but education, particularly resources for primary schools, is an issue that most Senators face in their constituencies every day.  Ireland has a great regard for education.  Parents are always concerned about the resources and facilities available to their children and many of them are concerned that their children should not face the disadvantages they faced in their schooldays.</P>
      <P>Remedial teaching concerns many people. Twenty years after remedial teachers were first appointed we still have schools without any such teacher.  None of us can be proud of that.  In County Laois last summer I raised the issue of eight schools which are still without a remedial teacher.  Many of these are small rural schools. These areas already suffer disadvantage because of their remoteness and they are not given equality of treatment with schools in larger towns. This causes great distress to the parents and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a parent, the more one sees of the work of teachers and the problems they have to address the greater respect one has for what they are doing.  Teachers are facing more difficult times today.  People expect them to address many of the problems of society.  It is important that primary teaching is seen as the most important area of our education system.  Over the last 25 years we have <Col N="1099" /> seen huge areas of disadvantage develop in our larger towns and cities but also in rural Ireland. Primary teaching must be targeted as a response to this problem.</P>
    <P>Most primary teachers feel that they can deal adequately with the middle stratum of children. Teachers do not have the time to deal with children who start to fall behind and this exacerbates the problem.  Teacher numbers are reducing because of the fall in the birth rate but we cannot afford to wait another 20 years before we get the numbers right.  If we are to address the disadvantage which has developed and the resultant crime and unrest, we have to deal with this.  Disadvantage is not peculiar to towns and cities.  Mr. John Higgins has spoken about the disadvantage the west faces in relation to job creation.  One school in Barrowhouse, County Laois, was listed as seriously substandard by the INTO.  I support the motion and it is important that it is being debated in the House.  The Minister wants funding to bring all schools up to standard and we are expressing concern and the support for the Minister to introduce the measures proposed in this motion.  Most of us regret that no extra remedial teachers were appointed this year except in areas designated as disadvantaged.  The Minister provided extra resources.  The Minister supported 119 or 120 schools but in rural areas almost 700 applied for consideration under the disadvantaged scheme.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations, as I am sure the Minister has from a school in High Street, Belmont, County Offaly, where over half of the pupils attending the school come from families which hold medical cards.  Those involved were surprised that the school was not included under the scheme.  There are many areas in rural Ireland that are as disadvantaged as some of the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>We accept the Minister's efforts but there are huge benefits to be gained from expenditure on primary education.  It will help to prevent children from leaving school early and give them hope of gaining employment when they leave school.  Primary education will provide the greatest return on investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  The Minister should take note of the reason for this motion.  I hold the view, as do many people in rural Ireland, that the Minister provides two levels of support and small rural primary schools are second best.  A recent survey indicated that there are at least four of them in County Donegal.  The Minister has not seen fit to take seriously the updating of facilities for primary schools and there is no statement of policy that will gloss over what is evident on the ground. There is total neglect in some areas.  I am not talking about the rat infested school highlighted on television; perhaps that is the worst case but in County Donegal there are similar cases of schools needing repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> School managers have given up trying to get funding to update schools.  Being a school manager in rural Ireland is not an enviable task. This is borne out by the fact that most people who looked for improvements in primary school transport in rural areas have given up.  The answer is always the same; there is no funding. There is a standard letter that I could read.  I gave up writing to the Minister long ago even when people came to me in dire need.</P>

      <P>Before the last by-election in County Donegal the Minister quietly visited Milford to make an announcement but she did not stop in a few places where she would have heard the truth.  When she became Minister for Education, I said that she might deliver some improvement in Dublin areas but she was never <Col N="1101" /> too concerned about delivering anything in rural Ireland.  I am convinced she has failed miserably. The legacy exists and those who are directly involved in education found it necessary to put down this motion.  The Minister is not able to oppose the motion.  She would lose if she did so and that is why she has accepted it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and urge the Minister to press ahead with the investment so urgently and badly needed in primary education. I am convinced that within the Department there is a feeling that the falling numbers in primary education will solve the problem over the next couple of years.  That will not happen and the Minister is well aware that even with falling numbers there would still continue to be a necessity for investment in primary education and in areas which are not being attended to presently or were not attended to by previous Governments.</P>
      <P>It is almost time for the modernisation of the system of planning for primary education buildings and facilities.  The archaic system which has been in use by the Department of Education, the Commissioners of Public Works and local boards of management is not adequate to deal urgently and quickly with some of the problems. When the Government found a few years ago that the accommodation for Government staff was not adequate to meet their needs it embarked upon a modest plan of getting private investment to build offices and then lease them.  This is how accommodation was provided for civil servants in Limerick, Ennis and many other towns.  This system cannot be used by the Department, not only for primary level but also for second level, because of the lack of availability of funding, especially in the rural areas I represent.  There is no shortage of people in the building construction industry who would be prepared to enter an investment buy-back arrangement with the Department, but it has resisted this.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In Kilmurry, of which the Minister is aware, where children walk along the side of the road to classes in the local parish hall, only a few days ago a local builder undertook to build and fund the school provided the Department arranged the financing but we continue to be unable to get any movement from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be advantageous for Senators to provide a litany of the schools in their constituencies which have not been dealt with. However, in the case of Tulla, money was <Col N="1102" /> provided for a new school in 1994, yet work has not commenced.  Similarly, money was provided in the 1994 Estimates for a primary school in Kilkee, one of the country's premier resorts where school accommodation is badly run down, but work has not started.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the system used by the Department with the Office of Public Works and local boards of management which entail elaborate procedures, even before planning permission can be sought, involving design, sketch plans, drawings, further sketches and detailed planning.  These procedures impede the undertaking of necessary and urgent work.  They could be avoided if modern methods of financing and lease back facilities were put in place.</P>
    <P>I compliment the boards of management in the many schools who, with teachers, do trojan work. Primary school teachers in my constituency work beyond the call of duty and put hours into many other activities related to the school for which they get little credit.</P>
    <P>Recreational and sporting facilities in national schools are in an appalling state; indeed, they do not exist in many schools.  While the Minister's priority may be to put decent accommodation in place, recreational and sporting facilities go hand in hand with a primary school education.  It is vitally important that they be provided, yet no sporting facilities of significance are being provided for the national schools which have fought for years, without success, for general purposes and recreation rooms.  This is a huge area of investment but it is not adequately provided for in the Estimates.  The Government must give a firm commitment to increase funding to undertake the substantial amount of work that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on the points made by other speakers on the need for remedial teachers and proper access by teachers to the remedial area. There is a necessity to deal urgently with this.  I compliment the Department in the few instances where it has provided a remedial teacher by amalgamating three to five schools for this purpose.  It has been successful in the area I represent and could be expanded with a small effort.  However, unfortunately, no new remedial teachers were appointed in the past year, certainly not in County Clare, despite the willingness of schools to amalgamate for this purpose.  Their applications are before the Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the unseemly delay in the payment of small grants for work undertaken by boards of management which have been approved and sanctioned for a long time.  Such a situation arose in Kilmurry.  It was bad enough to have bad facilities, yet when the parents got together to provide a facility it took them months of representations and letter writing to obtain a miserly grant of £800.  Thankfully the Department paid it last week, two or three years after it was due.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> It is unacceptable that when boards of management undertake to provide small facilities, at considerable expense to themselves, to make life more tolerable for the parents, teachers and pupils, the Department drags its feet for a year or two in the payment of a few miserly pounds.  There is no justification or necessity for this.  It will not bankrupt the Department.  A small grants scheme should be established and administered by the Minister to enable these minor jobs, which perhaps do not need plans, specifications or planning permission, to be undertaken speedily and effectively.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to accelerate the elimination of the bad facilities in many primary schools.  I plead with the Minister to expedite work on the schools in Kilmurry, Tulla and Kilkee so that there is a prospect that the required facilities will be in place for the start of the next term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate.  It vindicates people's interest in education.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined her successes in primary education.  I am the first to criticise her when she gets things wrong, indeed I would be her greatest critic.  She is, therefore, entitled to flaunt her successes.  She has outlined selectively what she has done.  Any Minister is entitled to do this.  It goes with the territory.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer to one issue, the &ldquo;Early Start Programme&rdquo;, for which she, more than any other, is entitled to take credit.  With every Minister with whom I have dealt I have identified areas where they left their mark.  Two areas initiated by the Minister, the &ldquo;Early Start Programme&rdquo; and in service education, represent a significant advance.  Many of the Minister's predecessors had different battles to fight but this battle continues.  We will never tell the Minister that she has done enough because when this happens there will no longer be a need for her.</P>
      <P>Senator Cotter supported the Minister by outlining the substantial resources she has obtained.  This is important.  He also indicated that she has much more to do.  Senator Ormonde made an impassioned appeal for an extended remedial teaching service, as did speaker after speaker.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted the motion but considered that it made grim reading and suggested that it might have been couched in more acceptable terms.  However, the situation is unacceptable.  There is all party support for the motion, which is important.  It strengthens the Minister's hand in Cabinet and elsewhere.  It does not take from her contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the teacher-pupil ratio, we should aim for the European average.  If we get it below 20:1 we should ask whether it is necessary to continue reducing it or whether more should be given to target areas.  I do not know the answer and I am open to suggestions.  However, we will <Col N="1104" /> not have done enough until we reach that figure, which is a long way from the European average.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not respond to the point raised about the difference between post-primary and primary capitations.  While I accept the post-primary sector has needs which the primary sector does not have, in terms of subject supply and so on, and that a strong case can be made for a differential, the existing differential of £45 and £177 is unacceptable.  I think the Minister would agree with that in her heart of hearts.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly gave credit to the Minister for the progress she has made.  He also outlined the need for support for teachers at ground level, as did many other speakers.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kelly &mdash; this is the third time this year I have agreed with her which worries me &mdash; that tax and spend is the way to do business.  The way to make progress is to get a balance between tax and spend; it is the only way we can redeploy resources to help the weak in society.  I also ask the Minister to listen to the points made by Senators Sherlock and Honan about the need for remedial education which is, as Senator Honan said, a beneficial investment in the future and in the next generation of leaders.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan raised, in his colourful and inimical manner, the crucial need to remember small primary schools.  The Minister addressed a conference for teachers in one teacher schools, which are the smallest schools.  She gave them a commitment and some movement has been made in that direction; that needs to be done in a very controlled way.  I will be putting the view to the Minister over the next number of months that any school with 15 or more pupils should have a second teacher.  We should also look at other supports for smaller schools, such as classroom assistants or teacher aides.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the building programme.  We are often approached about paying builders on time.  Sometimes the mistake is made at local level but too often it is a delay at official level.  I know of school authorities which cannot get a local builder to take on jobs in their schools.  Senator Daly was also the only speaker to make the telling point about investment in sporting facilities.  He also underlined the need for a general purposes room in schools.</P>
    <P>Tonight's debate has been a victory for education in many ways.  However uncomfortable the Minister might feel about the wording of the motion, speakers have recognised her contribution and she must recognise they have put a very strong case for primary education, which is the fundamental building block.  If pupils fail at primary level they will not succeed at post-primary level; if they do not succeed at post-primary level they will never become qualified. The connection between education, qualification and employment is established in every European country.  We must begin at the beginning.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Henry about prisons is crucial.  If we do not invest in pupils at an early age we will have to build walls around <Col N="1105" /> them later &mdash; and we will still be trying to teach them to read.  Senator Lee stressed that this is an investment in the future.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the motion. She will recognise that speakers made their points in a spirited debate.  It is significant that the same points were made on both sides of the House, although perhaps with different emphases. Investment in primary education is the way forward and can create the structure for a better future generation.  I acknowledge the Minister's acceptance of the motion and I wish her well in screwing extra resources out of the Cabinet, which is how we will really judge her.</P>

      <P>He is a Minister for mistakes.  The beef slaughter scheme was introduced by the EU to ensure employment in beef factories, especially in the off season.  Last year, however, the prices which obtained in October and November were not maintained and those who held on to their cattle for winter fattening did not get the price they expected.  Beef prices should be maintained or improved.  Last year cattle made over £1.06 per pound but in January winter fatteners realised only 80p per pound, a dreadful loss.  We are all concerned about prices but it has reached the point where the Minister has almost accepted that the number of cattle for slaughter will be reduced.  It will involve beef cattle and this matter is of serious concern to farmers who are fattening cattle.</P>
      <P>The competition authority said it appears incredible that the prices paid to beef producers were static at 80p a pound for many months but suddenly, in the space of ten days, processors were able to pay 96p a pound.  The prices were suddenly increased, but nobody realises that they were still below those which obtained in October/November 1995.  It was also stated that the beef prices would recover.  However, I am concerned that the cartel could ensure that beef prices are reduced for winter fattener cattle from 1 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> The <i>Farmers' Journal</i> carried an article about the legal threat to the beef slaughter premium.  I am also concerned about this matter which involves livestock breeders and live exporters.  It is not right and it is a pity that live exporters are threatening the small amount of money farmers receive from Europe.  Any money we receive from Europe should be welcomed because slaughter premia help to increase employment.  The beef premium has a spin off in terms of the millions of pounds that are spent on supplying feed to ensure cattle are fattened.  We must ensure that the employment provided by the beef premium is protected.</P>
    <P>The <i>Farmers' Journal</i> also stated that the slaughter premium is in line to begin on 1 January next year involving 7p or 8p a pound, but the factories predict that in January beef bullock prices will be less than they are today.  Why should that be so?  This problem occurred last year.  The slaughter premium should be maintained.  We must ensure that farmers who must go to the expense of fattening cattle are adequately compensated.  However, the Minister is inclined to state that farmers will receive lower prices in January than they receive today.  This is not fair to winter fatteners and the matter must be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Kiely for raising this matter.  It is an important issue and I appreciate the Senator's concern about beef prices.  I compliment him on the obvious amount of research he carried out on this issue.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out the current situation in the beef market and the continuing efforts to ensure that the incomes of beef producers and winter fatteners in particular will be underpinned in the new year. Following one of the most difficult periods for beef producers in recent times, I am glad that a degree of normality is returning to the industry. Over the last number of weeks, there has been a good improvement in the prices of all categories of cattle and it is my earnest hope that this will continue into the new year.</P>
      <P>Since 20 March the Government has spared no effort in dealing with the matter.  The full services of my Department, the diplomatic services, An Bord Bia and other Departments and Government agencies have combined to protect our most important industry.  The net effect of this offensive is that most of our markets, which were closed in the aftermath of the crisis, were reopened soon afterwards.  A number of important markets, notably Iran and Libya, still remain to be resolved but I hope that these will come on stream again soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effective market support measures were also put in place almost immediately and these helped to maintain order and stability in the sector at production and processing levels.  The Minister succeeded in putting in place a flexible <Col N="1107" /> intervention system whereby weight limits were relaxed and extra categories included.  The processors' margin was also increased.  Since the beginning of the crisis, the EU has taken over 50,000 tonnes of Irish beef into intervention from an EU total of 430,000 tonnes.  This helped to underpin prices by removing surplus production from the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Export refunds have also played a key role in stabilising the market.  The increase granted by the Commission on 1 May has been a major factor in giving processors a competitive edge on third country markets.  Despite the difficulties in export markets, Irish traders have maintained a significant presence there.  Overall, cattle slaughterings are up by almost 10 per cent this year and steer slaughterings are up by 28 per cent. By any standard, this is a credible performance.</P>
    <P>Due to the importance of market support measures in maintaining reasonable returns to producers, I will continue to seek to have the most effective arrangements in place for the new year.  At the beef management committee meeting on 29 November, the Commission reduced the carcase weight limits for intervention purchasing by a further 10 kilograms per month for January, February and March 1997.  This means that carcases must be under 380 kilograms for January, 370 kilograms for February and 360 kilograms for March to be acceptable for intervention.  In addition, the Commission decided to exclude 04 grade steers for intervention, thereby reverting to the categories which were permitted before the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>With regard to the weight limits, the Minister has succeeded, in the face of major opposition from most member states, in maintaining the higher weight limits since the crisis.  However, it is now clear that the Commission wishes to move towards the 340 kilogram limit which applied before the crisis.  I have continuously warned producers that intervention weights would be reduced and there was a need, therefore, for all producers to bring their production systems into line with a situation where there was a major surplus of beef on the market.  However, the Minister will do his utmost to prevent further reductions in carcase weights in order to provide producers with adequate time to adjust to the new environment brought about by the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>While the reduction in weight limits is a cause of concern, I am disappointed by the exclusion of the 04 steer category from intervention.  Due to the high proportion of our steers in this category, their exclusion could severely restrict the number of animals which would be eligible for intervention over the next three months.  The Minister has, therefore, asked Commissioner Fischler to reverse this decision and I am hopeful of a successful outcome.  This would ensure that intervention would continue to play a key role in underpinning market prices over this key disposal period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> The live trade also offers a very important outlet for Irish cattle by providing competition with the factories in the marketplace.  The Minister will keep the situation under review and should developments in the marketplace in the new year warrant an increase in the live refunds to maintain cattle prices at reasonable levels, then he will not hesitate in seeking such an increase from the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The deseasonalisation slaughter premium is also a vital income support measure for winter fatteners.  I am glad to inform the Senator, that as a result of the Minister's efforts at the June Agriculture Council, he succeeded in having this premium continue for 1997 and beyond.  This premium, which is worth some £16 million and which was agreed as part of an £86 million compensation package arising from the crisis, will be of particular importance to winter finishers who sell their cattle in the early part of next year.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the House that the Minister also succeeded in negotiating a further compensation package worth over £30 million for Irish beef producers in the context of the beef reform measures at the October Council. Following the adoption of the regulatory provisions for this package at next week's Council of Ministers meeting the Minister intends to draw up a scheme, following consultation with the various organisations, to ensure that producers most affected by the crisis will be compensated. Winter finishers who benefit tremendously from the premium payments will also be recipients of this additional compensation in one form or another.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while no guarantees can be given on the maintenance or improvement of current beef prices, the Minister will seek to ensure that the market support measures will be operated effectively to maintain reasonable prices for producers.  In addition, the premium payments in conjunction with the compensatory measures will ensure that the income of winter fatteners will be adequately supported in 1997.  I, and I am sure Senator Kiely, hope 1997 will be a good year for beef producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of a library and an administrative facility at Sligo regional technical college is one of the most serious and important projects in the north-west region. Having been contacted by students attending the college and the governing body concerning the <Col N="1109" /> recent reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Bree indicating that necessary funding may not be provided for the construction of a library and an administrative facility in 1997, I took the opportunity to visit Sligo regional technical college on Monday.  I was shocked by the appalling standard of library facilities at the college.  I understand the college has worked closely with the Department of Education over the past 18 months with a view that the project would be ready to go to tender by the end of this year or in early 1997.  The apparent shortfall in funding suggests that this is not now the case.</P>
      <P>Given that this country prides itself on its superior educational standards, it is not good enough that the existing inadequate library facilities designed to accommodate a student population of 1,000 is expected to serve 2,500 at present and 3,000 in the near future.  The recommended guidelines suggest one library space for every four students.  In Sligo regional technical college there is one space for every 13 students &mdash; a damning statistic.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of students using the library can be deduced from the following statistics: 910 students in September 1995-96; 940 students in September 1996-97; 2,380 in October 1995-96 and 2,456 students in October 1996-97. The library security gate counter keeps a record of the number entering the book stack area through the security gate at the library information desk.  The figure regularly exceeds 4,000 per week and this year it has already exceeded 4,500.  Numbers regularly exceed 1,000 per day on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday &mdash; the busiest days.  On Tuesday, 5 November 1996, the number entering the book stack area was 1,129 and on Wednesday, 6 November, this number increased to 1,260.  This is the equivalent of 21 60 student classes in an 11 hour period in an area the size of an average classroom which is already packed with library materials and where space is very limited.  The counter system does not record reading room usage where space is at a premium and where students are under constant pressure simply to find a seat.  In many instances those unable to do so resort to nearby classrooms which are inappropriate for library study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the library's problems are health and safety, quality of air and space for manual handling and storage.  The larger library office in Sligo regional technical college is roughly 24 meters square.  The guidelines on health and safety for office workers recommend 4.65 metres square as the absolute minimum personal space for a worker.  The guidelines say work stations should be comfortable, with safe and suitable chairs and sufficient space.  This would exclude space taken up by fixtures such as presses and filing cabinets.  These guidelines would meet the absolute minimum space requirement for the regional technical college library if it were not <Col N="1110" /> also used as the library work room and storage area with several cabinets and bays of shelving. There is also a large volume of material throughout plus a wide range of manual and computerised processes are carried out here.</P>
    <P>Apart from office working conditions, the library has run out of options for storing back issues of journals and newly added book stock. Overflows are currently located in the front corridor, presses, converted back racks in the reading room and stacked in cardboard boxes along the library walls.  A large portion of library stock is not on open access.  The cardboard boxes have used up the remaining space which can safely be made available within the book stock area.  The library will be forced to begin to throw out valuable material if extra shelving is not made available immediately.  I compliment the teaching staff and students, who must endure these terrible conditions, on the excellent results they have achieved to date despite the lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>I refer to the editorial in last week's <i>Sligo Champion</i> which was not written in a threatening manner but which conveyed the views of the people in the region.  It said the areas Government representatives have not alone been made to look feeble and inept when it comes to fighting their own corner as regards funding for the regional technical college in Sligo, but they have also been abandoned to face the growing wrath of the public at the next general election when no amount of hand wringing will be accepted as an excuse for their failure thus far to deliver.  Politicians take that view extremely seriously.  The <i>Sligo Champion</i> is putting forward a view that is held by the vast majority of the electorate in the north-west.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to alleviate fears in the college and the region and give a commitment that the financial funding necessary for the provision of library and administrative facilities in Sligo regional technical college will be provided from the 1997 Estimates.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the provision of a library and administration building at the regional technical college, Sligo.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years I have made available in excess of £5 million for investment in the college by way of a rolling capital investment programme.  This programme included the upgrading of the science laboratories, extensive new infrastructure, the provision of a new multipurpose centre and technology buildings, the upgrading of equipment, the purchase of land and the adaptation of existing buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, I gave approval to the college authorities for the acquisition of additional land and buildings at a cost in excess of £500,000.  The property, which almost directly adjoins the <Col N="1111" /> college, comprises approximately ten acres of land and two buildings with a floor area of approximately 2,000 square metres.  The acquisition will allow the college to consolidate on one campus courses which are currently housed in rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific matter of £2.6 million for the provision of a library and administration building, I am pleased to confirm that out of a total of £3.7 million allocated to the college under the European Regional Development Fund programme for capital developments, a sum of £2.2 million has been set aside and remains available for this project.  I am aware, however, that the cost of the development proposed by the college, which also includes lecture theatres, is in excess of this amount.</P>
    <P>Decisions in respect of any funding additional to the £2.2 million are being considered in the <Col N="1112" /> context of other priorities nationally and overall resource constraints.  The Senator will appreciate that such demands have to be examined in relation to all third level institutions and in particular the other ten regional technical colleges.  The provision of the £2.2 million will, however, ensure that the rolling capital development programme for the college can continue in 1997.</P>
    <P>I have directed the planning and building unit of my Department to ensure that all necessary steps are effected with a view to achieving, in conjunction with the college authorities, an early start to the project.  I will convey any update on this matter to Senator Reynolds and to my party colleague, Deputy Bree, who also represents the area.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 December 1996.</P>
