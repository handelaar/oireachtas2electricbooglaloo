      <P>I have notice from Senator Ormonde that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to reassure residents in the Rathfarnham/Knocklyon areas that appropriate policing resources, especially foot patrols, are deployed to stamp out the current wave of robberies and burglaries in the area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to take measures to bring insurance costs in Ireland in line with our European partners.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will complete all Stages.  It will be followed by item 2, <Col N="138" /> Second Stage only, until 6 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken from 6 p.m. until 7 p.m.; it will not conclude at 7 p.m.  I am proposing ten minutes per speaker on item 3 and if item 2, Second Stage, has not been completed by 6 p.m., it will resume at 7 p.m.  In the Whips' notice that went out from my office last week, the Health Bill was wrongly described.  It is as in item 4 on today's Order Paper; it is the Bill dealing with governance of the new Tallaght Hospital, which will be taken tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Before commenting on the Order of Business, I wish to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Seanad office for organising today's Mass and service for two much loved former colleagues, Seán Fallon and Gordon Wilson. The thought put into remembering them is much appreciated.</P>
      <P>We often hear criticism of our semi-State bodies in this House but today I welcome the announcement of 750 jobs for Blanchardstown, which is a major employment blackspot.  It is a great boost to the area itself and for the north Dublin/Fingal area generally.  I commend all those involved in IDA Ireland which faces worldwide competition trying to attract foreign companies.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, rightly speak about the reasons such companies locate here.  The fact that major companies are coming here is a great vote of confidence in our education system which produces capable young people for the workforce.  It is a most welcome announcement.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind words but they would be more appropriately addressed to the staff than to myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright in welcoming the announcement of 750 new jobs for Blanchardstown.  I am glad IDA Ireland has revised upwards its forecast of the number of <Col N="139" /> jobs it hopes to attract during the coming year.</P>
      <P>I do not know if it will be possible to provide time because of a very crowded programme this week and next but, on a less positive note, I wish to raise the matter of what is going on in Bord na Móna.  The board is going in one direction while the chief executive is going in another.  It is not helpful from the point of view of the future of the company and this matter needs to be resolved quickly.  Under the Act, the Minister is responsible so he should take that responsibility on board and carry out his functions.</P>
      <P>As regards job creation, in Bord na Móna's rationalisation over the past ten years, 2,400 jobs have been lost, many of them in a part of west Kildare which is not well off.  That puts it into context. It is essential to resolve the matter and I ask the Leader to do what he can to achieve this.  While I would welcome an opportunity to make statements on the matter, I am prepared to accept that, given the difficulties with scheduling Seanad business over the next fortnight, it might be impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader provide information on a report that I understand is being lodged in the pigeon holes of Deputies and Senators at 4 o'clock today?  It is a report by Price Water-house into the recent confusion concerning examination results and procedures. I am anxious to know whether putting this report in the mail boxes of Members of the Oireachtas can be construed, in any sense, as constituting publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in calling for ministerial intervention in the sad debacle at Bord na Móna.  It behoves us as Members of the Oireachtas to see that this does not continue.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication's to clean up Bord na Móna's act.  When they heard what was happening, the Bord na Móna workers in the midlands and the <Col N="140" /> west were up in arms.  In County Roscommon and a neighbouring county 25 jobs were lost in 1996 because of a rationalisation programme.  The workers are not happy that this saga has dragged out, that public funds have been squandered on meetings in the last month and we got no reasonable explanation of what is happening.  Obviously, there is a major battle of wills going on behind the scenes and it is up to the Minister to straighten things out.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader convey to the Minister for the Environment the concern felt by the communities and the people using the River Shannon? Recently there were near tragedies, and there was another yesterday.  But for the intervention of a local boatman and farmer, several lives might have been lost.  The reason I make this call is that it appears nobody is fully in charge.  The fire brigade seem to be the people who respond, but they do not have the equipment.  The Minister for the Environment should provide the local authorities and the fire brigades based along the Shannon with the necessary equipment, otherwise lives will be lost because the amount of leisurecraft traffic on the river has increased dramatically.  Many Senators know what I am talking about as they have boats on the Shannon or use the river.  To avert a major tragedy in the future I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment. Local authorities have already been informed but I think the Minister will have to sort out the matter.  If it is not his responsibility or the local authorities, there will be a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with Senator Norris's statement regarding the Price Waterhouse report into last year's craft examination papers which were lost, I understand this report will be issued at 4 o'clock but, it will be restricted to TDs and Senators; neither the public nor the <Col N="141" /> officials in the Department of Education will have access to it.  This seems to be in breach of what the Minister for Education said in the Dáil some time ago.  The people most affected &mdash; the parents and students &mdash; will not see the report.  Would the Leader clarify the Minister's standing in relation to this report?  Will it be circulated?  It is a public document and the public should know about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call by Senator Finneran and others for an end to the extraordinary saga in Bord na Móna.  Everybody would accept it is very damaging to a company which has struggled through a difficult time.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to approach the British authorities in the matter of Annie Maguire?  Last week Annie Maguire touched the heart of the nation when she discussed, at some length, the impact which false imprisonment had on her and her family.  It is extraordinary that, over a decade since her release, the issue of compensation still has not been resolved by the British authorities.  This is an indication of how little they care about the concept of justice.  I have no doubt all Members will share my affront at this particular matter.  I, and other Members of the House, would be grateful if the Leader would find some way of debating this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader anticipate having a debate on industrial strategy in this House, if not prior to the recess, then soon after we resume?  I too welcome the new jobs in Dublin. However, it is likely that most of those jobs will be filled by people from Roscommon, Clare, Galway and Donegal. Despite increases in the number of jobs, <Col N="142" /> the unemployment situation in Dublin has not been dented.  There seems to be an unofficial policy within the IDA to attract employment to the &ldquo;eastern economic corridor&rdquo; to the detriment of the west of the country.  In that context, will the Minister inform the House whether he intends to pursue a regionally based industrial strategy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  However, I am merely making a suggestion in line with what Senator O'Toole is attempting to achieve in the education sector.  The town in which I live has lost 13 young people and one teacher during the past 12 months.  This is only one of the symptoms of living in rural Ireland.  Unless employment in the regions increases, I do not believe viable communities in the west will survive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that an unofficial policy has been adopted by the current Administration and its predecessors directing the IDA to attract industry to this country and site it in Dublin.  I would not mind if such industry created jobs in economic blackspots such as Tallaght and elsewhere, but they do not seem to have any effect on the unemployment situation in these areas. As I stated earlier, there is a good chance that the people employed by IBM will be university graduates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I become angry when I see jobs being allocated to Dublin rather than to other parts of the country which need them.  I request that there be a debate on industrial strategy as it relates to the regions, perhaps in the context of one of the NESC or National Economic and Social Forum reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran's statement relating to safety on the River Shannon.  There has been tremendous expansion in water based leisure activities in recent years and it is an area of huge potential.  It must be pointed out that while there are approximately 800 boats on the River Shannon, there are 8,000 in Holland &mdash; a country the size of Munster.  This area has greater potential for growth than any other in the tourism industry.  I am not sure whether the Department of the Marine or the Department of the Environment is responsible but this subject is worthy of debate, whether in the form of a motion on the Adjournment of the House or during Government time provided for statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In his discussions with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, will the Leader of the House request some indication of the impact of the EU decision relating to competition and the ESB?  This decision, which was handed down last week, will have a serious impact on employment in the ESB, particularly in the area of electricity generation.  Will the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication indicate the likely impact of that decision and whether jobs will be lost in generating stations, such as Moneypoint, as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on power generation in Ireland, particularly as it relates to the importation of energy produced by nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom.  There has been much discussion in this country about the closure of Sellafield and other nuclear facilities.  If there is an opening up of the European electricity grid, Irish consumers could be using electricity generated by nuclear stations in Britain that are polluting the Irish Sea.  This matter is worthy of contemplation and debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mooney's request for a general debate on industrial policy.  It is time this House <Col N="144" /> considered the combined policies of Forbairt, Forfás and IDA Ireland. These bodies are clapping themselves on the back regarding the creation of new jobs but they have not delivered employment to the constituency of Cavan/Monaghan.  If Senator Mooney includes that area in the category to which he referred, it would warrant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On a serious note, this issue must be addressed in terms of the creation of long-term employment.  Not all the jobs should be in the east coast area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Wright for being characteristically generous in welcoming the creation of 750 jobs in Blanchardstown, especially his comments about the extraordinarily good work the IDA has done in the face of fierce competition.  Everyone should be grateful for this; it is just one example of its great success in recent times.  The IDA has done well in bringing these high quality jobs to an unemployment black spot.  They will be taken by people from all parts of the country and all the universities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sure his party leader would like to comment on that. Cheap points should not be made; the tone of this debate was set by the Leader of the Opposition, who was generous in what he said.  We all welcome it as a success and the IDA and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, should be commended.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the Bord na Móna issue.  In response to Senator Dardis, although there is great public concern about what is happening, I do not think a debate in the House would be helpful at this stage.  There are legal procedures to be followed and I hope everything is being done according to due process.  I do not know the full facts but it is important that we will know them when it is appropriate.  It would be wrong for the Minister to intervene before proper procedures have been exhausted at board level.  We all wish the procedures could be speeded up so the matter could be resolved and Bord na Móna can return to the work we think appropriate to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and others mentioned the report to be published at 4 p.m.  I have a straightforward view on this; if it is being given to 226 Members of the Oireachtas it is a public report.  I know what happens at meetings of other parliamentary parties and I am sure Members of other parties know what happens at our meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it is being placed in the pigeon holes leads me to believe it is a public document intended for publication &mdash; I can put no other <Col N="146" /> interpretation on it.  I do not think the media will be waiting too long for a copy.  It is a serious matter; the Minister is to be commended for having a full investigation.  If it is thought appropriate after we see the report, I will have no difficulty making time available for a discussion.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran and others mentioned the Shannon.  There is a tourism debate this evening and it could be raised briefly at that time but I will pass on his remarks to the Minister for the Environment.  It is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Roche that what has happened to Mrs. Annie Maguire is disgraceful.  There is no excuse for the delay; it is a gratuitously offensive prolonging of something which should never have happened and, in the current climate, it is unhelpful.  I could arrange for statements on the subject for 30 minutes during the week after next, so that Members' feelings could be put on the record.  I concur with everything the Senator said and would put it even more strongly.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked for a debate on industrial strategy.  I would be happy to sit an extra day at the end of this session if there is sufficient demand for such a debate &mdash; that would be Friday three weeks.  Otherwise I will arrange such a debate early in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly and Senator Kelleher raised the EU decision affecting the ESB.  It would be helpful to have clarification as soon as possible on how that affects the board and the overall position here.</P>

      <P>I hope I will be permitted to make a few general comments.  I was <Col N="147" /> not present for Second Stage because I had been invited by An Bord Bia to speak at the Horizons conference.  I support the objectives of the Bill.  The attempt to bring customer interests on to the board is worthy.  My only criticism is that it is a pity this did not happen sooner.  I urge the Department to remain more customer than producer driven, as evidenced by the Horizons conference organised by An Bord Bia.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered tabling an amendment to this section because the board will now consist of a chairman and 14 ordinary members.  When the 1994 Act was presented it provided for a membership of nine and one of the primary objectives of the 1995 Act was to increase the membership to 11.  This Bill provides for a further increase.  I welcome the provision for a consumer representative on the board but it could be catered for without having to increase the numbers on the board.  The nominee of the Minister for the Marine was also included.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Act indicates that the ordinary members shall be appointed by the Minister and specifies that one shall be an officer of the Minister, one shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Tourism and Trade and that the chairman and persons appointed should have a knowledge or experience of the food industry and consumer requirements.  At the time we argued that &ldquo;consumer requirements&rdquo; was not strong enough and my party tabled an amendment to the effect that a representative of the consumer associations should be included.  We also tabled an amendment to the 1994 Bill to do with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Given my outstanding record in having amendments accepted eventually, I thought that if I tabled an amendment the fears I expressed last week about there being another amendment Bill next year would come to fruition.  To spare the House having to deal with another Bill next year I resisted the temptation to table an amendment. However, the board is getting to the stage where, with a membership of 14, it becomes unwieldy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The 14 members of the Bill will represent a wide spectrum of interests.  There should not be a reduction in the membership.  The majority of county councils, for example, have at least 21 members.  A membership of 14 is reasonable.  I welcome the inclusion of a consumer representative.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (4) (b) one ordinary member shall be appointed on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of consumers.  Can the Minister of State give an indication of the organisations the Minister has in mind?  It is a wide field and there are many organisations representing consumers.  The Minister has a difficult job and picking one organisation will make it even more difficult.  Without pinning it down to the last organisation, I would like the Minister to give us some indication of the organisations about which he is thinking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify who and what organisations he deems fit to represent the consumers' interests.  Will we be back again next year to broaden the board further because certain consumers were not represented?  I ask him to clarify what organisations he believes are fit to represent consumers on this board.</P>

      <P>In answer to Senator Dardis, the board is now more representative <Col N="149" /> and inclusive.  Its composition and the expertise on the board will enhance the food industry and I am confident that it will be most effective.</P>
      <P>We all acknowledge that the consumer is the person of whom we must take most account and we must examine consumer tastes and market our products to suit consumers here and abroad. It is important therefore that there be a specific and identifiable consumer representative on the board, nominated by an organisation which the Minister deems to be a recognised consumer organisation.</P>
      <P>I cannot say who may be nominated. The Minister will be nominating that person, but it has not been decided yet. The person will be identifiable as a consumer representative; that is as far as I can go at this stage.</P>
      <P>On Senator Kelleher's point, the Bill is all inclusive and I cannot see the need for further additions in the future.  All the members of the board are consumers. I emphasised that point to Senator Dardis last year.  We went further this year and we have now an identifiable place on the board for a consumer, which is very important.

      <P>We are talking about meat and livestock; the Minister is aware that my own hobby horse is the fish industry.  However, it is all food and An Bord Bia looks after food.  Could the Minister name the person who represents fish processors on the board?  I believe they have been left out and I am making my case for the fishing industry. They should be properly represented on the board.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be repetitive, but there is a reasonable possibility that the board is becoming too big and unwieldy.  This could lead to a less effective board.  I agree to some extent with what Senator Dardis said about keeping the numbers small.  Nevertheless, within that small board there should be a position for consumer interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> I agree with Senator Kelleher's point; the Minister has not indicated how that person will be identified and selected.  I presume a number of consumer organisations will make representations to the Minister and, after some examination, he will, in his wisdom, decide who should be on the board.  I am not certain that is the best approach.  If you put representatives of various organisations on boards, it would be better to write that into legislation and refer to them specifically rather than having a loose arrangement where, for instance, somebody who might have no contact with any consumer organisation could be the Minister's appointee.</P>
    <P>Do I take it that any number of organisations can make representations to the Minister to be appointed to represent the consumer but that the Minister can nominate somebody totally unconnected with consumer information? Is the Minister of State saying that many of his constituents from north Kerry would be eminently suitable to be on this particular board although their only qualification might be their political affiliation rather than any knowledge or expertise in the consumer industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Daly.  It is desirable to specify the organisations.  The Consumers Association of Ireland would be a body that springs to mind immediately and I am sure it is the intention of the Minister and the Department to have somebody from such a body represented on the board.  This is something I would welcome but I believe it would be useful to specify the organisations.  I would hate to see an <i>ad hoc</i> organisation presenting itself as the body that should be considered for nomination.  The practice in the past where the membership of the board was extended to producers was specifically designed to include representatives of the IFA and the ICMSA. The Irish Cattle and Stockowners <Col N="151" /> Association might also have claims to a position.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has referred to the size of the board.  There is nothing inconsistent between my argument that the board should be small and his that it should be widely representative.  There would be scope with a board of 11 or 13 to have that representation.  What is at issue here is the number of people the Minister can nominate directly thereby having an in-built majority on the board, not the quality or the broadness of the representation.  That can be accommodated within a smaller board. From a business point of view it is more desirable to have a board that is cohesive, small and easily managed than one that is large and diverse.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Fitzgerald, the Minister for the Marine is confident that Sarah White of the Department of the Marine represents the fishing industry and the fish processing industry.  He is happy with the present arrangement.</P>
      <P>On Senator Daly's point, the purpose of this Bill is to nominate a consumer to An Bord Bia.  That consumer will be nominated by a recognised consumer body nominated by the Minister.  This was the approach adopted for the Meat and Livestock Board.  This Bill is very narrow in its focus which is to appoint a consumer to the board nominated by a body that is recognised as one that looks after consumer interests.  I am convinced that this is the right way to do it.  If it could have been done previously, it should have been done.  We are strengthening this board and making it more representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his straightforward and honest answer.  I am not against the Bill; I totally support it and I have no intention of holding it up.  However, I must voice my opinion and protest.  The Minister is probably the only person involved in the fishing industry who is satisfied with the person on the board representing the <Col N="152" /> fish processors.  I have no objection to that person one way or another but will the Minister, for argument's sake, pick a civil servant to represent the consumers? Will he pick a civil servant from the Department of Agriculture. Food and Forestry to represent the livestock people?  To the best of my knowledge, never once in the history of this State has the Department of the Marine nominated a fish processor or fisherman to any of its committees.  I am not blaming the Minister; I am just voicing an opinion on behalf of those who have lobbied me.</P>
      <P>In all fairness, it is time that a person from the fishing industry and the fish processors, nominated by the Minister of State or the Minister, was appointed to the board.  If what happened in the case of the fish processors happened in other organisations, there would be a board of 12 or 13 civil servants and that would defeat the purpose of the board.</P>
      <P>Enough said; I do not need an answer.  There will be an uprising by fishermen and fish processors and I ask the Minister to make sure that a person from the fishing industry and the fish processors will be nominated to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having worked in the fish industry, I know that An Bord Bia is important.  Bord Íascaigh Mhara has its own marketing set-up.  While I would never agree with civil servants on boards, nevertheless they represent the fishermen, the processors and the industry in general on this particular board. That is what is important at this stage.</P>
      <P>Down the years, irrespective of the board, many interested outside parties believed they should be the one to represent an interest.  I worked alone as Minister of State for Fisheries for three and a half years and I had great difficulties. I assembled a board, acted as chairman and involved all the industry. It was impossible to satisfy them because there was always a section who felt it should represent the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> If you appointed a processor to An Bord Bia, the fishermen would not be satisfied; if you appointed a fisherman, the processors and the industry in general would not be satisfied.  That has always been the approach.  To a degree, picking one person to represent the fishing industry on An Bord Bia was an afterthought; it was because of the debates in both Houses.  It is impossible to have every area of the fishing industry represented; there would be as many as 20 board members.</P>
    <P>If Senator Fitzgerald analyses the matter, he will see the Minister has made a good decision with regard to the fisheries end of it and I welcome it.  He has nominated a civil servant, who works in a fishing industry marketing board, to represent all sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument about the size of the board applies here also.  I am not going to repeat what I said on section 2, but the original Bill provided for five persons who shall represent producers of livestock, four persons who shall represent the meat export trade, one person who shall represent meat traders who sell meat by wholesale or retail for consumption and one person who shall represent the livestock export trade on the subsidiary board.  One consumer against that number is a small lobby.  I am not saying additional consumers should be involved but it would have been generous if some of those organisations had forfeited one of their seats on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a political realist and I am prepared to accept that when people are given seats on boards they are reluctant to relinquish them.  However, the weight of interest from the industry compared to the single voice of the consumer on this board is disproportionate.  It would have been better to keep the board at <Col N="154" /> its original 11 and to ask somebody to forfeit a seat rather than creating an additional seat for the consumer.  I recognise the political difficulties the Minister would confront in trying to achieve that objective, although I suspect that, had he tried to achieve it, he would have gained considerable support in this House.</P>

Many factories are only operating on a one day week.</P>

      <P>They had but I presume they will realise even more the importance of the consumer to the producer and the processor.  I do not agree with Senator Dardis about reducing the number on the board because they represent a wide area.  Every member of the board realises the importance of the consumer to the market because, if we cannot satisfy the consumer that a product is safe, they will not buy it.  Nominating a person to the board who represents consumers can only be good</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator D'Arcy.  The existing members of the board will ignore the consumer at their peril.  Because of the BSE crisis and because the consumer is more discerning about food, anybody involved in An Bord Bia will look at changing consumer tastes before their own vested <Col N="155" /> interests.  It is in their interests that the consumer is confident and happy with whatever products An Bord Bia promotes. Adding a consumer representative to the board will focus people's attention on consumer demands and needs and it will strengthen the subsidiary board.  A consumer representative should have been included before now. This Bill will ensure the board is properly balanced.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator O'Brien's point, we are discussing An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, 1996, not the BSE crisis.  However, in light of the experience with BSE, it is very important to have a consumer representative on An Bord Bia and the subsidiary boards. Unless we are conscious of and satisfy consumer needs, we will lose the battle with beef.  We have to focus totally on consumer tastes and needs.  An Bord Bia has been in operation for only a year and a half and it has been successful to date.  From my dealings with it, I have confidence in its expertise to ensure that our food industry will grow to the extent we wish over the next four years and that we will be able to realise the targets set in the food programme. This debate will strengthen the focus of An Bord Bia.</P>

I urge the Minister of State not to exclude from consideration the almost suicidal step of removing the whole of An Bord Bia from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry at some point and putting it under the aegis of another Department.  While this is a step in the right direction, the ideal situation is to have An Bord Bia so customer driven that it is not even part of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment, or almost any other Department, would be better in the long term to prove the case.  I am not suggesting that will happen at this <Col N="156" /> stage but I urge the Minister to keep it in mind for a future occasion.</P>

      <P>When the original Bill was being debated in 1994, Deputy O'Malley argued the board should be under the aegis of the then Department of Trade and Commerce, which would support the point made by Senator Quinn.  There is an argument that it is to the board's advantage in terms of overseas marketing to have it disconnected from perceived producer interests.  However, I accept that as matters stand it is within the ambit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, where it is likely to stay for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Studying the Official Report is always an interesting experience.  We can all quote what people said and I am sure I have said things that could be quoted back at me &mdash; and probably will be at some future date.  Senator D'Arcy's observations on 5 July 1994, when we were discussing the subsidiary board, are interesting.  He tabled an amendment which stated that &ldquo;a subsidiary board established under section 13(2) shall consist of a chairman and not fewer than five or more than eleven ordinary members&rdquo;.  Perhaps I am being a little mischievous in reminding the Senator of that.  He also said that &ldquo;when appointing subsidiary boards, sectoral interests immediately come into play&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="157" /> It is also worth recording the fact that the present Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, was apoplectic in her opposition to the original legislation when it was being debated.  She stated on 11 May 1994 in the other House that &ldquo;the Bill falls so short of what is required and what Culliton and the reports of expert groups detailed as necessary that it is merely a window dressing exercise and does not deserve support&rdquo;.

      <P>It would be a grave mistake to take An Bord Bia from under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture.  We are trying to create a link between producer and consumer.  If one takes it out of the Department of Agriculture, one removes a very important part of the link.  I see how thinking within my Department is considerably influenced by the philosophy of the board.  The farm representatives on the board preach to the farming organisations the philosophy of traceability, quality and the need to be consumer driven.  If that link was not there between my Department and the board, the board would be less effective in its focus.</P>
      <P>I understand where the Senator is coming from, but the main strength of An Bord Bia is that it is inclusive, from producer to processor to consumer.  We will be seeing the effects of the board very soon.  It is a focused and effective board, as it ably demonstrated two weeks ago with the input it had into the Horizons food fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident this is the right way to go.  I cannot see An Bord Bia being taken from under the aegis of my Department because to do so would be a grave mistake.  The philosophy which the board is trying to expound, and which it will expound in the future, <Col N="158" /> needs to be related down to farm gate level because that is where the product is obtained and where the quality is derived.</P>

He is working on it at present with Teagasc, An Bord Bia and other agencies.  The traceability system must be totally credible.  There is no point having it in name only; it must be foolproof.

I am sure there is no difficulty with the measure; it is not complex.  Its purpose is to ensure that the last two appointments, involving representatives of the two farming organisations, which were made by order following the 1995 Act could not be challenged in any way.

It may be an error, but I am confused because section 13 of the 1994 Act deals with subsidiary boards.  I am not questioning the principle of the measure; I am concerned about the detail.

The reference to section 14 was in the context of the mechanism which enabled the Minister to make those appointments.  I am assured the provision in the Bill will ensure nobody can question the legality of the previous appointments.  That could easily happen nowadays and it is not an attempt to get something in through the back door.  It was included on the advice of the Attorney General to ensure no difficulties arise in the years ahead.  I am confident the measure will not pose any difficulties. The Senator may have some reservations about it, but they are unfounded.  There is no hidden agenda. The purpose of the measure is to ensure that mistakes will not be made.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance that nothing underhand is involved.  However, there is an inconsistency as to whether the measure relates to section 13 or 14.  The Bill states section 13, but in his reply the Minister referred to section 14.  It is almost a technical point.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions recently I have endeavoured to raise with the Leader of the House the issue of the disposal of milk.  An Bord Bia has a central role to play, given its involvement <Col N="163" /> in marketing.  Other Members referred to the beef industry, but I object to the fact that the Minister has not availed of the opportunity to expand this section to make special provision to deal with the severe crisis in the dairy sector industry at present, particularly in my constituency.  I do not wish to bring a local issue into national legislation, but there is a major crisis in the beef and dairy sectors at present.  There is a responsibility on the Minister to take some initiatives in that regard and I expected him to expand the section. The explanatory memorandum states the section has no financial implications other than the usual implications.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="167" />
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to promote information and consultation of employees in large scale multinational enterprises.  The Bill's provisions introduce for the first time in Ireland employees' rights to dialogue with management on business development information and give rights for the first time in statutory form to workers in private sector companies.</P>
      <P>In today's globalised and increasingly competitive markets greater participation by employees is of paramount importance so that companies will be able to successfully manage ongoing change.  Effective and efficient information and consultation of employees is a prerequisite to the achieving of greater employee involvement in the development of companies.</P>
      <P>The transnational information and consultation arrangements in multinational companies which will develop as a result of this Bill will enable employees to contribute to the ongoing success of the trans-European companies in which they work.  From an employee's rights perspective, it is of course proper that employees should be informed and consulted about developments in their companies which are likely to impact on their jobs and on the nature and organisation of their work. Employees are important stakeholders in companies.  As much as and even more than management, they are concerned about the future health and prosperity of the company.  The ability of companies to manage change is crucially dependent on how they can mobilise their workforces and work in partnership together rather than in confrontation. Both sides, by working together, by pooling information and commitment, will be able to manage the process of change which faces each and every company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular Bill will transpose into Irish law the provisions of the European Union Directive (94/45) on informing and consulting employees.  Often called the European Works Council Directive, <Col N="168" /> the directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 22 September 1994 on the basis of the Social Protocol or Social Chapter of the Maastricht Agreement. The directive must be transposed into our law by 22 September this year. It applies to 17 countries &mdash; the member states of the European Union, excluding the United Kingdom, and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</P>
    <P>A unique feature of this directive is that large scale multinational companies which fall within its application must comply with the transposition law of the member state in which the central management is located and also, in certain aspects, with the transposition laws of each of the member states in which they have employees.</P>
    <P>Under the Maastricht Agreement, one of the objectives of the Community is to promote dialogue between both sides of industry, between management and labour, in order that companies and economic development can prosper. The expressed purpose of the directive is to improve the right to information and consultation of employees in Community scale undertakings and Community scale groups of businesses.  In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the directive allows some degree of competence to member states to reflect their own employment relations and employment concerns in their transposition legislation.</P>
    <P>The European model of social partnership, which underpins the directive, recognises that employees, as stakeholders in their companies, should have a right to be informed and consulted about important business developments that will affect their futures.  In drawing up this legislation I consulted widely with representatives of the business community and with worker representatives through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As part of this process we published a consultation paper last July.  My approach to the Bill has been to facilitate a co-operative and positive approach by individual companies and their employees in meeting the objectives of the directive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> The legislation will implement the directive.  It will not bring about information and consultation in every Irish company.  This legislation is about implementing the directive and does not go beyond that to extend more widely to other companies.  I hope that will, however, be on the agenda and will be discussed by the social partners in the run up to the next <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>The legislation reflects our own industrial relations traditions in how we have adapted the EU directive.  It is important that companies and their employees should have some degree of flexibility in adopting information and consultation arrangements which best suit their own circumstances.</P>
    <P>This will apply to companies which employ at least 150 in each of two member states and at least 1,000 overall in the Community.  Such companies whose central management is located in Ireland will be required to comply with the provisions of the Bill as a whole. There are also provisions in the Bill which apply only to Irish employees of those European scale companies covered by the directive, whether or not their central management is located here.  In all, it is estimated that the Bill will impact on some 200 multinational companies with operations in Ireland, including some of our own native multinational companies like Bord na Móna and Smurfit.</P>
    <P>The objective of the directive, and thus the Bill, in terms of information and consultation arrangements can be met in three ways.  First, pre-directive or pre-Bill-agreements, which must be adopted by companies and their workers before the 22 September 1996, provide for transnational information and consultation arrangements which cover the entire workforce.  Here, the Bill goes beyond the text of the directive by providing for legal protection for valid agreements and by making the validity of agreements entered into before 22 September contingent on their being accepted by the majority of the workforce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> That is the quality test to ensure that any pre-directive agreements which take account of the flexibility offered by this approach are not shoddy agreements which undersell the workers.  A majority of the workforce will have to agree if a pre-directive agreement is negotiated.  Where such agreements are adopted the provisions of the Bill will not apply, other than those provisions which provide for pre-Bill agreements.</P>
    <P>The second form of agreements are those under the Bill which are to be agreed between a representative body of employees &mdash; the Special Negotiating Body or SNB &mdash; and central management. As stipulated by the directive, the Bill provides a framework for such agreements which may invoke an information and consultation body &mdash; a European Employees' Forum &mdash; or alternatively may establish an information and consultation procedure. Under the directive companies and workers can set up a Special Negotiating Body to negotiate what particular type of information and consultation arrangements they will have.  The Bill adds to the provisions of the directive by requiring that such agreements include arrangements for informing and consulting Irish based employees on the matters relevant to the transnational or European information and consultation arrangements.  So, there is a feedback mechanism for Irish workers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, where there is disagreement, we provide that the parties to such agreements &mdash; central management and employees' representatives &mdash; agree an arbitrator for determining disputes that arise about the interpretation of agreements entered into under the Bill.  Where the parties do not agree an arbitrator, the Bill enables the Labour Court to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators, when requested to so do by either party.  Amendments were made to the Bill in the Dáil which will facilitate a less formal approach to arbitration. Where agreement on transnational information and consultation arrangements is not reached after a period set down in the Bill, the provisions <Col N="171" /> of the annex to the agreement come into play.  In other words, if workers and management do not conclude an agreement themselves before 22 September, having set up a Special Negotiating Body or in the absence of such a body, the default provisions come into play. Under these requirements, companies will be legally obliged to establish a European works council or EWC as prescribed in the Bill.  The details will be spelled out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes two provisions in respect of the prescribed EWC which go beyond what is in the directive.  Management will be obliged to consult with representatives on the arrangements for holding meetings of the EWC.  Also, minutes of EWC meetings will have to be agreed between management and the EWC.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions in the Bill reflect Irish employment relations, traditions and concerns.  Overall, I stress that the Bill reflects the Irish industrial relations tradition of allowing management and employees to determine the nature of their relationship.  At the same time, however, the Bill provides legal rights for employees and their representatives. In drawing up the Bill we sought to strike a balanced approach to reflect as far as possible the concerns on both sides expressed to us during the consultation process.</P>
    <P>At the suggestion of Ireland, following the adoption of the directive by the Council of Ministers, an expert working group of representatives from each member state was established.  The objective of the group was to encourage, as far as was practical, a smooth and even transposition of the directive into national laws, bearing in mind the differing industrial relations traditions in different member states.  The conclusions of this working group are not binding on member states, but I am happy to acknowledge the contribution of the deliberations of the group to the formulation of draft transposition legislation across the member states, including Ireland.  We want to ensure as much <Col N="172" /> uniformity as possible where it makes sense.</P>
    <P>I now want to outline the broad purposes of the sections of the Bill, which I hope all sides of the House can find it possible to support.  Section 1, the short title &mdash; Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees' Bill &mdash; reflects the objective of the information and consultation directive itself.</P>
    <P>Section 3 defines terms used in the Bill, drawing on the text of the directive itself as well as interpreting some terms which are not defined in the directive, including the meaning of employees and employees' representatives for the purposes of the Bill.  The section does not discriminate between full-time and regular part-time workers.  Each has its rights to representation and to be included as workers for the purposes of the Bill's threshold requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is an important one that details the workforce threshold requirements, which determine whether an undertaking or group of undertakings come under the Bill or not.  As I have already said, if a company has a workforce made up of full-time and part-time workers, the part-time workers are counted as a single unit for the purposes of these thresholds.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the manner in which it may be determined if an undertaking is covered by the Bill by virtue of being part of a group.  Together with section 4, this section provides the legal basis for the scope of the application of the Bill in terms of the large-scale companies to which it will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with pre-directive agreements which have been accepted by a majority of the workforce and adopted prior to 22 September 1996.  It is expected that up to 200 companies across the Community, or about 10 per cent of those covered by the directive, will have adopted such agreements prior to 22 September this year.  This section provides greater flexibility for the parties in agreeing the nature and scope of transnational information and consultation arrangements than the provisions in the other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Section 7 enables the making of such regulations as may be necessary to give full effect to the Bill, in particular regulations about expenses to be borne by central management and the appointment of arbitrators.  An amendment agreed in the Dáil enables the making of regulations on arbitration procedures.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 specify the general obligations and responsibilities of central management with regard to the establishment of information and consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 10 specifies the circumstances where central management is obliged to establish a representative body of employees &mdash; the Special Negotiating Body or SNB &mdash; for the purposes of negotiating agreed information and consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 11 specifies that the function of the Special Negotiating Body shall be to negotiate with central management for an agreement on the establishment of arrangements for the information and consultation of employees; that the body may be assisted by experts of its choice; that central management shall convene a meeting with the Special Negotiating Body with a view to the conclusion of an agreement; and that central management shall bear all reasonable expenses for these purposes, including the equivalent cost of one expert.</P>
    <P>Section 12 imposes on the central management and the Special Negotiating Body an obligation to negotiate in a spirit of co-operation. An agreement for the information and consultation of employees may invoke the establishment of a European Employees' Forum. The parties may also agree to establish one or more information and consultation procedures instead of a forum. The section also sets out a framework for agreements, while leaving the details to be agreed by the parties in negotiation, and provides for the dissolution of the Special Negotiating Body when it ceases to have the function of negotiating an agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> Section 13 sets out the circumstances in which the subsidiary requirements of the Second Schedule shall apply.  The requirements shall apply if the Special Negotiating Body and central management so agree; where the central management refuses to commence negotiations within six months of a request referred to in section 10 or if, after the expiration of three years from the date of such request, the parties are unable to conclude an agreement.  This section is fundamental to the objective of the Bill as it ensures that employees can exercise the information and consultation rights provided for in the Bill, if they so wish, in the absence of agreement with central management.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the manner in which employees' representatives to the Special Negotiating Body, the ongoing information and consultation arrangements or a European Works Council are to be selected.</P>
    <P>Section 15 prohibits members of the Special Negotiating Body, European Employees' Forum or European Works Council or employees' representatives to an information and consultation procedure from disclosing information given to them in confidence.  The section also provides for the circumstances in which central management may withhold information which it claims is commercially sensitive.</P>
    <P>Section 16 obliges central management and employees' representatives to work in a spirit of co-operation with regard to their reciprocal rights and obligations.  Section 17 sets out the protection and the facilities to be provided to employees' representatives.</P>
    <P>Section 18 defines offences under the Bill and is necessary in order to ensure the effective application of the Bill.  The offences are refusal by central management to disclose data on workforce levels &mdash; which obviously triggers a works council, non-establishment of a prescribed European Works Council where such is required and disclosure by employees' representatives of confidential information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Section 19 sets out the penalties which may be imposed for breaches of the Bill and these penalties reflect the gravity of the prescribed offences. Section 20 provides for referral of disputes between central management and employees, regarding withholding of commercially sensitive information to an arbitrator to be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 21 stipulates that the parties agree an arbitrator to determine disputes arising from the interpretation of agreements under the Bill.  Where the parties cannot agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, either may apply to the Labour Court, which shall refer the dispute to the arbitration of one or more persons as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>Section 22 states that the Bill shall apply without prejudice to the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, as amended, and to the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980 (S.l. No. 306 of 1980).</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that the Arbitration Acts, 1954 and 1980, will not apply to arbitrations under the Bill.  The intention here is that the arbitration procedure will not be overly complex in the provision of regulations to deal with the precise details of the procedure.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule provides requirements for the nomination and election of employees' representatives.  The Second Schedule prescribes the nature and form of the European Works Councils to be established where there is no agreement between management and employees on the establishment of information and consultation arrangements.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to estimate accurately the costs that will arise under the Bill.  However, the EU Commission has estimated an ongoing annual cost of about £8 per employee.  It is a modest cost for setting up statutory provisions for workers to be consulted as of right and to negotiate forms in which they will be informed about what their company is doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> In conclusion, I wish to stress some important points.  This Bill is a landmark because it is the first time we have statutory rules for consulting and informing workers about what companies in the private sector are doing and what are their plans.  That kind of partnership approach between workers and management is the key to our economic and competitive success and our ability to manage the process of change.  If our industrial relations are characterised by confrontation, mistrust and a failure to share information, we are denying workers their basic right to know about their jobs and livelihood.  We also make it difficult for companies to win the trust of workers when they are trying to adapt to changing market conditions and to changing products and processes. This is necessary for all companies because we know that change is the one certainty that faces every company. That change is best managed where there is genuine trust and sharing of information, genuine listening on the part of management to what workers have to say and genuine involvement of the contribution workers have to make. In giving statutory rights to workers in the private sector for the first time, this is a landmark Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a first step.  It does not deal with companies beyond those covered in the directive but in laying down markers, it is an important first step.  I hope it will be possible for workers and management throughout Irish industry and companies to conclude agreements.  This legislation will be one of the centrepieces of any negotiations in a future <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  I know this is of concern to both sides who signed a joint declaration.  ICTU, IBEC and the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; having issued thoughtful papers on the subject of partnership in business &mdash; will see that this legislation is very much a first step and there will be further moves towards development of partnership in Irish business.</P>
    <P>It is important we meet the directive transposition date of 22 September 1996 <Col N="177" /> as there will be difficulties for both management and employees should member states not meet the deadline.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks, as it must, to fully transpose the EU Directive on Information and Consultation of Employees &mdash; commonly called the Works Council Directive &mdash; into domestic law.  It is a solid Bill; it is a technical Bill but, on the ground, it will make a real difference in Irish companies.  Having framed a balanced Bill, I hope many companies, where they have the option, will choose Ireland as their base for setting up works councils.  In Britain, the one European country which has opted out of this legislation, many of the multinationals are setting up information and consultation procedures and negotiating European Works Councils arrangements with their employees, although they are not legally required to do so by European law.  Many companies recognise that this kind of consulation makes good business sense.</P>
    <P>I look forward to debating the Bill and I hope there will be a speedy passage so that we meet our deadline of 22 September.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  We seem to be meeting a lot recently in and out of the Chamber.  I welcome the thrust of this Bill.  It is a new era of employee participation in Ireland and marks an important development in Irish industrial relations.  As the Minister said, this Bill is about participation, information and consultation arrangements in the private sector, to strengthen the consensus approach to industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arises from the European Works Council Directive which is a product of the European social partnership. It means that employees should have a right to be informed and consulted about important business development which will affect their future.  This directive applies to the large companies &mdash; those which have over 1,000 employees or at least 150 employees in two of the member states. This legislation provides for electing <Col N="178" /> representatives to sit at works councils or employees' fora, which will inform and consult employees on transnational company matters.</P>
    <P>May I refer to research started in the department of psychology in UCD 30 years ago?  An American psychologist introduced two theories &mdash; theory X and theory Y.  Theory X discussed the old approach, the disciplinarian and confrontational approach of the Church, the Army and big firms &mdash; do as I say not as I do.  This was the old concept of the management/employee relationship. Decisions were made at the top and there was no consultation.  Alternative strategies were not considered once a decision was made.  That theory was in place 30 years ago.  Theory Y, or the McGregor theory, changed that process. It introduced new thinking in relation to consultation processes and the motivation of workers.  As I stated earlier, this theory was introduced to the Department of Psychology in UCD in the 1960s.</P>
    <P>There are two forms of participation. The first involves direct participation, which begins at the level of the job itself.  All employees should be consulted about their line of work and their motivational requirements.  Another kind of participation in which companies engaged in the past was quality group work.  This involved assessment of quality, the improvement of quality and worker participation in relation to particular companies.  The second main form of participation is indirect in nature and is currently being brought on stream.  This was advocated by psychologists and researchers during the past 30 years, but we are only now putting it into practice.  The basis for this discussion emerged because we must involve employees in consultation and consider their work and way of life.  We must look at how the position and welfare of workers within a firm might be enhanced.  Ensuring employee satisfaction is one way to promote motivational factors within particular firms. This is a welcome concept and we must <Col N="179" /> work together to see that it is developed.</P>
    <P>Social partnership should first identify employees as people and then recognise the work they do.  People should be considered in terms of their strengths, not their weakenesses. Exploitation, which coloured our thinking in the past, should not be part of the new agenda.  If we do not bring about development on the part of workers and do not encourage their involvement in the making of decisions, there will be no communication, leadership or commitment from the members of any given organisation.  The Bill is very worthwhile in that context.  I congratulate Padraig Flynn for the important part he played in bring about agreement on the directive in question.  I also congratulate the Minister of the day, Deputy O'Rourke, who played a major role at the Council of Ministers in bringing this agreement to fruition.</P>
    <P>My thinking about the Bill comes unstuck in relation to the works council. I understand that this council, involving representation from each company, will meet once a year to discuss issues of employment, investment trends, cutbacks, changes in their organisations, etc.  This will be the substance of future communication.</P>
    <P>I regret that this legislation was not introduced during the crisis involving Packard's development, which represented a golden opportunity for consultation. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, was involved in that crisis, but discussions broke down because there was not consultation.  It would have been useful to apply this legislation had it been in place, even though the jobs in question would still have been lost.  The employees at Packard would have appreciated being consulted regarding the barriers to and breakdown of communication.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation because it will prevent future crises of this kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> There are a number of areas of the Bill about which I am concerned.  What will be the effect of this new approach in the case of part-time employees and will they be represented on the council? The provision of costs for bringing together representatives of Irish companies and their partnership companies in other states seems clumsy.  The Minister of State's presentation did not refer to this issue, but perhaps it could be teased out in relation to the various sections?  I do not have an understanding as to how the new directive will work in this regard.  The council or forum will involve the participation of representatives from each member state who will reflect the problems experienced in their respective countries before they assume major significance. How will this work?  It appears satisfactory in theory, but will Irish workers be bothered by events in Europe?  Good working conditions, job security and welfare prospects are all that we want for employees.  I do not believe they desire anything more.  The question then arises as to whether this legislation is required?  In this context, we are stating that we need to motivate our workers.  How should we proceed to do this?  Is this Bill needed?  Will we become hung up on legislation?</P>
    <P>I accept the concept of the legislation. Last week we discussed the protection of young people in employment and introduced legislation relating to the time at which they should finish work. This will affect young people employed in trades which do not operate normal nine to five jobs.  The Bill before the House is aimed at enhancing the social partnership.  It involves identifying and considering communications between managers and employees and linking the participation of individual workers to a sense of team spirit.  I am concerned because many managers do not have good communication skills.  We must consider how this type of legislation might be best implemented.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are excluded from the provisions of the European Union directive <Col N="181" /> governing this Bill.  There has been much discussion of the peace process and the removal of trade barriers relating to the movement of goods and services between North and South, but the Bill before us forms such an obstacle. Has there been any consideration with regard to overcoming this problem in the future?  Perhaps it will form part of the overall picture.  I do not know. However, the major question in this context relates to whether it will benefit Irish workers or save jobs?  Ireland has a thriving economy and low inflation, but there are in excess of 250,000 people unemployed.  Will this legislation do anything to enhance or motivate the creation of employment and the generation of profits?  If a profit is made, it can be invested in the economy to create further jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation, which represents the grand finale of research carried out in the past 30 years.  I contributed to this area through many of my research papers and I have no difficulty with the broad thrust of the legislation. I am concerned about the effectiveness of its implementation.  This is a good Bill, but I would like to know more about the cost of its implementation and whether it will work in Ireland.  The legislation involves personalities &mdash; those of managers and workers &mdash; and reaching out in terms of consultation and negotiation.  If we get it right in our own area it is easy to transfer that into transnational consultation.  I have difficulty with that thinking because it is concerned with the relationship between a boss and his worker.  My position is that if we get that right, we do not need legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House again; she comes here almost every week.  This Bill reminds me of my time on the Council of Europe and of the committees which prepared legislation to create greater equality across the Union.  The Bill derives from a directive which has been filtered through the system and undoubtedly it <Col N="182" /> has taken many months and years to bring it to this point.</P>
      <P>The legislation gathers the collective thinking about multinationals to ensure that the events which happened in Packard, for instance, would be avoided in the future.  When one notes what happened in that case and the way it happened, it is valuable to bring forward legislation to prevent multinationals acting without consultation with their workers, as they did in the past.  The Bill is also topical because a multinational company announced today that it is to increase its employment in Ireland by 750, which is a welcome development. The company has been in business for 40 years and is already in Ireland, but this European legislation will not discourage it or other multinationals from setting up here.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides a forum for the company and its employees jointly to discuss the opportunities and problems confronting them.  That should always have been the case, but it is only in the last five to ten years that companies built up those relationships &mdash; when difficulties arose, no one knew anything about them.  We have the opportunity to visit companies at various times and many of them now have large conference rooms.  An important part of joint development is the involvement of employees as well as management in achieving the company's goals and aims and those partnerships should continue and grow.  What we are doing today is directing those companies which are not or have not been inclined to have such partnerships to become involved in them.</P>
      <P>Things have changed dramatically even in the last few years.  Managers are far younger and have different ideas. Recently, the youngest ever member of a State board was appointed chief executive of An Bord Tráchtála.  All the media reports of the appointment said he would bring major changes in thinking, because he will not have a chip on his shoulder about any particular area but will seek to bring out the best in employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> I am also glad that the Council of Ministers adopted the Irish suggestion to establish an expert working group of representatives from each member state whose objective will be to encourage as far as practicable a smooth and even transposition of the directive into national law.  This means we are not simply passing legislation and hoping everyone will implement it, because things do not happen like that.  The working group will be in place to help companies in implementing the provisions and by informing them if further clarifications have to be made.  There is no point introducing and passing legislation and expecting that everyone will follow it from the day it is written into law &mdash; we like to think that will be the case but it does not always happen that way.  This proposal came from the Irish Ministers and it will make possible the implementation of the legislation across the EU, as Ministers will be able to discuss the results and progress made by the working groups.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers are also being introduced to these schemes, which is welcome.  In the past those workers only had jobs for the period of their contract and management could do things without letting them know, but that is no longer the case.  This legislation ensures that management must deal with part-time workers in the same way they deal with full-time workers, which is a welcome step.</P>
    <P>This legislation also coincides with the developments of major national and international companies which are moving around the world and into Ireland as a base to supply Europe.  When the Bill is implemented it is only right that it should take account of this.  It has also been ensured by the Irish suggestion which was approved by the other member states.  I hope the Minister informs us in about two years of how successful the legislation has been and how helpful it has been to the companies and employees concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the cost of the legislation would not be huge, but she suggested <Col N="184" /> in her contribution to the Dáil that the companies should pay part of it.  Although the system may only cost £8 per person, that amounts to a lot of money for a company which employs a huge number of people.  What is the exact intention in this regard?  Will it be the employee who pays or will employers and employees pay jointly? Is the amount of money mentioned necessary for the implementation of the scheme?  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and support the main thrust of the Bill.  In the seventies and early eighties we had full employment; but since then we have introduced various EU Directives and Regulations, the result of which is that 300,000 people are unemployed.  It is the same all over Europe.</P>
      <P>The laws and directives brought in to create a better climate for workers seem to have created a bad climate for many. While the thrust of the Bill is good I wonder if it will solve the problem. Many people gave up to 20 year's service to Packard Electric and took a cut in wages 18 months ago because they were dedicated to the firm.  However, they found out on the evening news that they would lose their jobs.  That is not good enough.  Will this measure offer any security of employment?  Can firms wind up overnight and throw a dedicated workforce out as happens at present?  While the rules and directives apply to EU firms, many firms are leaving to go to Third World countries to find cheaper labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no longer security of employment in the public service.  People who started work 25 years ago knew they could get a mortgage and get married because they had a job for life as long as they did their work.  However, that no longer applies.  If one takes out a mortgage nowadays one cannot know if one will be able to pay it.  Security of employment has disappeared over the last 20 years, ever since we started to implement one EU directive after <Col N="185" /> another.  While we may attempt to achieve equality we end up creating more inequality than ever.</P>
    <P>We may have adopted too dogmatic an approach in the past, as Senator Ormonde said, but at least we had security.  Nowadays, a team of experts can be brought in to assess the competitiveness of organisations and, although they get paid for the task, many people may end up on the dole.  Is that good for a country?  It may be good economics for the organisation that rationalises but it is awful for the morale of the country.</P>
    <P>I worry that the directives take us away from the humane approach and that is bad for morale.  In the past when people worked diligently they knew they would be paid and promoted. However, that is no longer the case; one may be the hardest worker in a firm yet be replaced for being too old or too set in one's ways.  Where has humanity gone?  We may consider the EU Directives to be in favour of people but they are not.</P>
    <P>A local authority may evict a person from a house because they cannot pay the rent.  However, the health board or another State agency has to house them. Similarly, when a person is thrown out of a job they have to go on the dole and the State has to pay one way or another. Society is demoralised because people do not know if they will keep their jobs. In years past one built up a relationship of trust with one's bank manager. However, nowadays, bank accounts are managed by computers.  The human touch is gone.</P>
    <P>The negotiating body will be comprised of people from all over Europe. They will be in touch with one another but what happens the workers from Tallaght or Grange, County Sligo?  Who will talk to them?  I appreciate the Minister of State's task is not easy and that she and her staff are doing their best. However, the approach over the last 20 years has been wrong.  We have to return to a climate of job security so that people know they can afford to pay their mortgage and educate their children. As it is people do not know when <Col N="186" /> they will be out of work.  None of the EU Directives gives job security, although we are told they will.</P>
    <P>The EU Directives implemented do not seem to be in the best interests of the workforce.  However, I would like to see directives that might reduce taxation or equalise the price cars in the EU, for example.  Why is everything not equal for the member states?  We are great Europeans but we are getting all the stick and none of the carrot, so to speak. We are told we cannot afford the measures that are good for us but we can afford the other measures.</P>
    <P>I felt sorry for the workers of Packard Electric who heard on the news that they would be on the dole.  Even in the public service people are no longer assured of their jobs.  There seems to be increasing insecurity and disloyalty because it seems the human element is no longer considered.  The Minister should convey the message to Europe that workers are not consulted and that there is no security of employment. Society will be disrupted because if people are not happy at work they will be happy at nothing.  The days of happiness at work are gone because of job insecurity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, ordinary workers in Tallaght or Sligo are not being consulted.  Productivity and efficiency studies may be carried out yet ultimately they result in people losing their jobs.  That is why there are nearly 300,000 people unemployed in Ireland and why there is unemployment all over the EU.  We cannot keep cutting jobs and putting people on the dole because the few left working will not be able to pay the bill.  If we do not get a strong grip on it fairly fast, we will end up with more problems because there will no jobs and no money in the kitty to pay those who are not working.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill, but I am worried that we are not coming to grips with unemployment and that we are making more people insecure.  I would like to know if any of the EU directives we have implemented over the years has provided security.  Can the Minister <Col N="187" /> stand up with her hand on her heart and say that the Bill means there will never be a case like Packard again, a factory will never close overnight and people will never be thrown out of their jobs without warning?  People should at least get time to put their houses in order rather than being thrown into a crisis.  I do not think this Bill will do that; I would love if it would.</P>
    <P>We seem to be putting too much value on this great Special Negotiating Body with whiz kids from all over Europe.  Will they have the answers, or will they just tell us that in the interests of economics and competitiveness, the only way is more computerisation and less humanisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. The Minister can be thankful that she has more time available for this Bill than we had for the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill last week.  The Bill implements an EU directive and is part of the Social Charter and the Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty. Unfortunately, the UK is not covered by the Social Charter.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Farrell's concern about people being replaced by machines, but in directing his concern at this legislation he is directing it at the wrong place.  This directive and legislation have nothing to do with the problems which Senator Farrell mentioned. They are embedded in the market driven economics which treats people as commodities which can be dispensed with at the whim of a company.  The protective legislation which the EU is trying to introduce, particularly under the Social Charter, protects against much of the activity which treats people as things with which companies can dispense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Farrell's concern, but there are many other reasons why people are being replaced.  New technology is the major factor.  This legislation tries to establish a co-operative or partnership approach between companies and the people who work in them. <Col N="188" /> Research in firms and multinationals has shown that where the people working in a company have a stakehold and know why they are being asked to work hard and do certain things, they are more inclined to give their loyalty to the company and work harder.  They are inclined to be flexible in their working arrangements if they understand the reasons why flexibility is being demanded of them.</P>
    <P>This partnership approach can often be as motivating as the wages people are paid.  Some companies are voluntarily adopting this approach.  The Japanese model indicates that the consultative and &ldquo;we are all in this together&rdquo; approach is effective.  It is interesting to note that a number of UK companies are adopting this approach to dealing with their work force, even though they are not obliged to do so because the UK is not party to the Social Charter.  It indicates that it is an effective strategy for achieving good morale in a company and a good relationship between management and employees.</P>
    <P>This approach does not just benefit the workers.  It is also in the long-term interests of the profitability and development of the company itself.  In that regard it should not be seen as legislation which is only in the interests of employees.  It should also be seen as being in the interest of the general development of the company.</P>
    <P>It is directed at large companies which have over 1,000 employees, with 150 in each of two member states.  We are not talking about small firms, but companies which work on a large scale. We are dealing with a disparate group of workers and it is appropriate that there should be a common approach to how their rights are maintained and how they are given information about what is happening in the company.</P>
    <P>I have some questions about the exclusion of the UK in light of the Border between the UK and ourselves. How does it affect our relationship with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK?  A company may have employees <Col N="189" /> in this country and also north of the Border or in other parts of the UK. How will the implementation of the Bill be affected by the fact that the UK is not covered under the Social Charter?</P>
    <P>The consensus partnership approach is clearly the thrust of this legislation, not just in what it sets out to achieve but also in its detail and the structures provided for under the legislation.  A European works council is only needed if agreement has not already been reached under a number of different headings, whether pre-directive agreement &mdash; that is, if agreement has already been reached before the implementation of the directive &mdash; or through other intermediary steps.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of translation. When something applies across EC countries it is important that there is a translation facility so people in one country will have a clear understanding of the information being given in relation to another country.</P>
    <P>If this legislation had been in place it would have been of great benefit to Packard workers in so far as they would have known what was going on. However, at the end of the day there is not much that this legislation or any of us could have done to save those jobs. The jobs were not lost because the workers did not know what was happening, but because they were competing with people who were willing to work for much less.  We do not want a low wage economy which forces people to work for slave wages.  We must balance the rights of workers and the rights of companies to carry out their business.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the recent report of the IDA which discusses the difficulties in attracting large companies to this country.  They have been relatively successful, particularly in light of the announcement, referred to on the Order of Business, of a sizeable number of jobs for the Dublin area.  It was interesting to note that they did not identify the protection of workers and regulations under EC directives as a major impediment to attracting companies. The major problem was competition <Col N="190" /> from other countries offering large incentives.  There is constant competition between us and other countries who are trying to attract multinational companies.  It is a question of deciding how high one can go in offering incentives.</P>
    <P>The criticism of this legislation, which came, for example, from the Progressive Democrats in the Dáil, to the effect that this kind of regulation was impeding multinationals from setting up in Ireland is unfair.  There is no evidence that legislation that allows for information and consultation of employees would in any way discourage a multinational company from coming into this country.  We have been successful in attracting multinational companies. They come here for a variety of reasons, such as the incentives that are offered by the IDA, the fact that we have an excellent well trained workforce, that Ireland is an excellent place to live and is a good point of entry into the big European market.  These are the factors that influence multinational companies in coming into this country.  I reject the allegation that legislation such as this would be likely to stop a multinational from deciding to come here.  Companies realise it is profitable for them to consult with their employees and to keep them informed rather than have the approach that &ldquo;We will not tell you anything about what we are doing.&rdquo;  That is less likely to encourage people to work hard and to feel that they have a stake in the company they are working for.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that anybody who goes on these works councils is protected from dismissal or unfair treatment. This is important because sometimes there is a perception that if you are involved in these matters you get a bad name with management as being a bit of a troublemaker.  I reject that approach totally and I am glad to see that it is dealt with in the Bill.  I assume that other aspects of workers' rights are protected by other legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> I was confused by the reference to the Labour Court in section 21.  Because these companies are multinational, I assume it would be equivalent of the Labour Court within the country in which the people are employed that would be involved.  There is a reference to where the multinational is centrally based and I assume that you go to the equivalent of the Labour Court in that country if you have a problem.</P>
    <P>There is a reference to confidentiality, and that is always a difficult issue.  It says that if information is expressly provided in confidence, it should not be disclosed.  I assume again that means that the people in the negotiations would know what information was provided in confidence and, therefore, could not disclose it.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the definition of an &ldquo;expert&rdquo;.  That was brought up under another piece of legislation here a few weeks ago.  The definition of an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in section 3 is &ldquo;a natural person, and may be the holder from time to time of a named office or position in a body corporate or other body or organisation&rdquo;.  I find that a strange definition of an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; and I wonder where it comes from.</P>

      <P>It is a strange definition and it could probably apply to almost anybody, but that is a minor problem in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Overall, I welcome the approach of the Bill, which is basically about people working in a company being treated as members of the team, as part of the company and who have a right to know certain pieces of information about their employment.  It fits in well with our approach to partnership on a national level which has worked well through various agreements.  It will be to the benefit of companies rather than being an impediment.  I welcome the legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for a constructive and positive debate. Senator Ormonde underlined the cross-party origins of this legislation.  Commissioner Flynn revived a directive that had been around for 25 years.  You could go back 30 years in looking at the origins of workplace psychology, but this is 25 years on the go and Commissioner Flynn did breathe life into it. It was adopted two years ago by my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke.  We have transposed it now into legislation.  There is cross-party agreement on what this is trying to achieve and that constructive attitude was reflected in the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked about part-time workers.  Regular part-time workers, for example, as protected by our employment protection legislation are counted as full-time units under the Bill and are entitled to stand for election or to vote for the SNB.  Who pays the cost?  Senator Farrelly raised the same point.  Management pays the cost. It pays, for example, for sending workers to a works council in relation to training for people because there may be language training or some training in what is involved.  There are developments in that under DG5 and they will be coming forward with finance towards training people to fulfil their role properly in this regard.  The cost of an expert attached to the Special Negotiating Body will also be paid for by the company.  We are talking about big companies.  The costs involved will be modest.  If you have 1,000 employees at an average of £8 a head, that is £8,000. That is small money for a company of that scale out of its payroll.  It would be peanuts.  It will pay off in terms of what was emphasised on all sides &mdash; the importance of having consultative mechanisms involving people in what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who spoke in the debate, bar myself, mentioned Packard.  It has been a salutary lesson for us because everybody, on a human level, was shocked at how individuals who had <Col N="193" /> given ten to 15 years to a company heard on the news that their company was gone.  I have to ask myself a question. Would that company have gone that early had there been a consultative mechanism in place between head office and the Irish based workforce where the Irish based workforce knew what the decisions were to have been taken at head office, were able to have their say, were given the full information through a structured arrangement such as a works council and would have been able to put positive suggestions on the table about how best to run the Tallaght plant?  When it came to difficult decisions should there have been better trust between both sides so that difficult decisions, if they had to be taken, could have been taken earlier and the plant could have been rescued and vital orders saved?  Had we this kind of structure in place earlier on would multinationals like Packard have been able to anticipate trouble earlier let alone when it came to making an announcement?  It would not have happened over the airwaves because there would have been a proper consultative process in place.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of the human touch.  Again, this Bill is about making sure the people who work for an organisation are as involved as the shareholders, who may be people who buy in today and sell tomorrow, and that the human aspect is heard at central management and at central management in Europe where vital decisions are taken about what happens in a company.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked if people would be interested in what is going in Europe.  Are they only interested in what happens in their own firm in terms of their own pay and conditions?  When we are talking about multinational companies, what happens in head office and other plants has a vital bearing on what happens at home, because decisions may be taken by head office management to expand the French operation and absorb the Irish operation or sometimes <i>vice versa.</i>  I heard last week about <Col N="194" /> a multinational in Cork which has absorbed plants all over Europe and has expanded its employment.</P>
    <P>If there is a structured system for listening to what workers have to say, can workers suggest new product lines if they are going to lose their old product lines?  Can they say &ldquo;We have skills that can be combined to produce a different product for which we know there is a market&rdquo;?  The health of an enterprise will be greatly enhanced by the involvement of people and their representatives through formal consultation structures. Today's workforce understand the economic situation and that if their business is losing money, their jobs are at risk.  They want to know if they are going to lose orders to the competition or if a particular component or product line will be sourced with a different company in the group or sourced with them.  They are interested in these issues.  This process will give them the information which they need, for example, to change a particular way of doing business so that they can secure an order against their internal competition, which is important.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised the UK exclusion.  I hope we will see a future Government in Britain opt into the Social Charter and the Social Chapter because having one situation in Dundalk and another in Newry, for example, causes anomalies.  In this instance I do not believe we are at a competitive disadvantage because, to have in place this kind of structured consultation and to build trust, is to our competitive advantage. Indeed, the go-ahead British companies realise that and, although they are not legally obliged to, they are going ahead with works council arrangements even though their Government has opted out of this directive in what I believe is a short-sighted move.  This directive applies not only to the 14 member states; it also applies in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  This means that countries outside the European Union are putting these mechanisms in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> Senator Farrell asked what good was coming from Europe with all these directives, etc.  I would remind the Senator that Ireland is getting about £1,000 million from Europe this year. As good European citizens, we play our part in taking on board European social legislation, implementing the Social Charter of fundamental rights for workers as well as being happy to take the few bob from the German taxpayer and our partners in Europe.  I know, because I attend the Council of Ministers meetings, that there is a great deal of concern among my fellow Ministers for Labour Affairs about the possibility of social dumping.  They are anxious to ensure that common labour standards apply right across Europe, including this particular area.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell asked whether there was job security.  We all know that gone are the days when a person started work at 18 and retired at 65 with a gold watch. The name of the game is change, and the security of any job depends on the ability of the company to manage that change.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised the question of people being replaced by machines and the importance, to which all Senators referred, of the human touch.  This is about putting people first and ensuring that human values and consultation, as well as punching numbers into computers and taking the printout at the other end, are matters which all companies of this scale must take on board.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about the definition of an expert.  I must admit the definition reads a little tortuously.  First, it allows workers to nominate a trade union person as their expert, whether that person is a worker, so they can be assisted by somebody who represents the industry.  Paul O'Sullivan, for example, could be the nominated expert for Aer Lingus workers.  Second, it allows that the expert works for a consultancy. If somebody takes SIPTU as their expert and the job is shared by two officials, a research consultancy or a <Col N="196" /> consultancy specialising in this particular Bill, &mdash; such specialists exist &mdash; they pay the expenses of a one person equivalent even if it is a two person consultancy.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about the Labour Court.  Where the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, our Labour Court will appoint one for companies which register their agreements and operate in Ireland.  Regarding elements of their Irish consultation, it is our Labour Court which will be involved. Obviously, we do not lay down the arbitration procedures for processes and steps in other member states but, with regard to business transacted in Ireland, our Labour Court will appoint an arbitrator where both sides cannot agree. We hope both sides will be able to agree on a suitable arbitrator, be it a legal person for a legal point or somebody versed in industrial relations processes for what is essentially a collective bargaining point.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to confidential information, the Bill makes it a criminal offence to leak information given in confidence which would be commercially sensitive.  Where companies try to hide information which should be shared with their workforce as information given in confidence, we provide for special arbitration.  It would be my intention that there would have a similar system as that proposed under the proposed Freedom of Information Bill, which also deals with the arbitration on commercially sensitive information so that there are not two systems operating separately, one for the semi-State companies and one for the private sector. When the Bill is in place we will designate their particular information arbitration function.</P>
    <P>It is important that commercially sensitive information which companies share with their workers is not given to the competition.  Where such sharing takes place &mdash; for example, in Waterford Glass, which has structured consultation arrangements &mdash; those confidences have been respected.  Workers <Col N="197" /> recognise that the security of their jobs depends on the health of the company.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain the use of the word &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo;? In section 4 (1) the words &ldquo;an undertaking is a Community-scale undertaking or undertakings are a Community-scale group of undertakings&rdquo; are used and they are clumsy.  Is there any way around that?  We are trying to simplify the matter for the public.  I had to read that phrase several times and I still have not got it right.  I am not suggesting an amendment, but I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, we must decide what is the company entity.  There can be situations where a group of companies form a company.  We must decide whether we take the aggregate of these associated companies or a number of individual companies each composed of 100 employees, which would be under the threshold.  That would be the grouping facility.  The Bill specifies in what circumstances we group subsidiaries to say it is effectively one company because there is one controlling body and it cannot be artificially divided in order to escape the provisions of the <Col N="198" /> Bill.  That is what that tortuous wording means.</P>
      <P>This section deals with how we count the number of workers involved in a company.  There is a legal obligation on the management to answer the workers' questions with regard to how many people are on the books.  It also defines &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, and that includes regular part-time employees.  The latter count in terms of there being 1,000 employees overall and at least 150 in each of two member states.  For instance, do we define Smurfit (Ireland) Limited, Smurfit (England) Limited and Smurfit (France) Limited as the Smurfit Group? That is what we are trying to establish.</P>

We have made it clear they do not override these provisions and we have taken out the Arbitration Acts.  If we need to decide how arbitration will work, we will do that.</P>
      <P>As regards expenses, it is the same as it was in the Lower House.  The Minister may make such regulations in relation to &ldquo;expenses to be borne by central managements in relation to undertakings and groups of undertakings&rdquo;.  We want to ensure that under the terms of directives, central management bears the expenses.  However, we need to provide that those expenses are reasonable and that people do not include their Christmas presents.  It gives the Minister power to make regulations about what are valid expenses.  If the works council is meeting in Frankfurt, for example, the travel expenses to Frankfurt and the hotel bill there would be reasonable, but it would not be reasonable for people to include Christmas presents for their wives and husbands.</P>

      <P>I said on Second Stage that any new ideas must have the support of management and workers and that communication is important before negotiations can start.  This section states that there is an obligation to negotiate in &ldquo;a spirit of co-operation&rdquo;. It is important to lay the foundation for any working relationship.  Anyone involved in negotiations <Col N="200" /> understands financial and business matters. Many workers do not understand how to negotiate and they do not know how companies work.

      <P>It is interesting that the phrase &ldquo;a spirit of co-operation&rdquo; is included in the legislation.  There is a lot of flexibility in this section as regards the different ways agreement may be reached between employees and the company.  If we had an obligation to act in a spirit of co-operation, not confrontation, in many other areas of life, including Northern Ireland, we would be better off.  There must be a spirit of co-operation in any negotiations which take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a wonderful spirit of co-operation in the Seanad today.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that when a negotiating procedure is set up under the directive it works so that people do not refuse to talk or to make any reasonable effort to reach agreement.  If either side behaved in that way, they would be in breach of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde asked what happens if people do nothing.  In this case the provisions of the annex to the directive swing into position.  The format of the works council is laid down in the Second Schedule to the Bill where, if they do business, both sides can agree a form of information and consultation which best suits their needs, without being dictated to from outside.  If they do not do business through negotiation, the prescribed forum will descend on them after three years.</P>

      <Col N="201" /> Senator Farrelly asked about the review of the expert group.  The directive provides for a review.  There must be a commission review on the operation of the directive reporting back to the council; this will take place in 1999.</P>

Information must not be withheld from workers for no reason or because the company does not want to tell them.

      <P>We have included a procedure so that if there is a dispute between the parties as to whether it is commercially sensitive information, it can be referred to a special arbitrator who will make a decision.  That should be a binding ruling.  We are making it a criminal offence to reveal information given in confidence, which is different from commercially sensitive information. If information is made available by somebody who was told it was given in confidence because it would destroy their business if it got into the hands of the competition, they will be subject to severe financial penalties.</P>

      <P>There is not a penalty but the information is made available. That is what happens if it is spuriously withheld.  We envisage that when the Freedom of Information Bill, which provides for the office of information commissioner, is enacted the information commissioner will have functions in relation to determining which commercially sensitive information public and semi-State bodies may withhold. We do not want a two tier-system to apply where, for example, Aer Lingus has to give certain information under one heading but not under another.  We envisage this being added to the list of duties of the information commissioner. In the interim before the legislation comes into force we will nominate someone to take over those functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kitt proposed in the debate in the Dáil to lower the penalties.  The three offences are: first, non-compliance by a company, <Col N="203" /> that is, refusing to disclose how many people are employed in the company to frustrate workers who are trying to put in place the machinery provided for under the Bill for setting up a works council, information consultation procedure or Special Negotiating Body; second, where the company refuses to set up a Special Negotiating Body; and third, where workers disclose information which was given in confidence.</P>
      <P>The first and second offences concern companies with a minimum of 1,000 employees.  Deputy Kitt agreed with me in the Dáil that to dilute the penalties would send the wrong signals.  The third category of offence, where a worker discloses information given in confidence, could have very serious commercial repercussions for the company and for fellow workers who may lose their jobs if the company goes down the tubes.  It would also send the wrong signal if the penalty for this offence was diluted. That was accepted by all sides of the House in the Dáil.  We have agreed to let the penalties stand.</P>

That could have unintended consequences because they were set up for a different purpose.  We <Col N="204" /> will make regulations in relation to exactly what the steps will be because a procedure which was designed for arbitration about a CPO on land, for example, would not be appropriate.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade (Mr. T. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their interesting contributions to debates on tourism.  To date, we have had a useful and wide ranging debate on Irish national tourism policy, performance and prospects for the future.</P>
      <P>Irish tourism is going through a period of unprecedented and sustained growth.  The optimum support structures have been put in place in order to promote further development and the prospects for the future have never looked better.  It might be useful at this point in the debate to recap on some of the key points that illustrate this success.</P>
      <P>While the targets the Government has set for tourism are ambitious, we are well on course towards achieving them. Ireland was the top performing tourism destination in Europe in 1995, with revenue growth of 12 per cent over 1994, compared with a European average of 2.3 per cent.  Revenue from British tourists was up by 13 per cent.  North American tourism revenue was up by 30 per cent and revenue from mainland Europe increased by approximately 12 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> Job creation targets are also being met and the sector is now estimated by Bord Fáilte to sustain 102,000 jobs &mdash; an increase of 50 per cent since 1988. Indeed, tourism will soon outstrip agriculture as a provider of jobs in our economy.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the variations in the growth of tourism among the regions.  Contrary to some opinions that have been expressed on the subject, all of the regions are benefiting from the growth, a point which I have already illustrated in my earlier statement.  Not only that, but the past and future strategy development of tourism development takes full account of the need for regional development and provides a platform for each region to realise its potential.  Indeed, some of the programmes and measures which assist tourism projects, such as the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas, the International Fund for Ireland, INTERREG, the Leader Programme and the agritourism scheme could, by their nature, be said to be weighted in favour of regional development.</P>
    <P>The value of domestic tourism to the economy generally and specifically to the regions has not always been fully appreciated in the past.  I am sure the House will agree that the domestic tourism marketing initiative which I recently announced in this regard will prove very useful.  For the first time the Government has made a contribution of £500,000 dealing specifically with the domestic market.  Ireland is targeting an overall growth of 10 per cent in inbound tourism in 1996.  With the active promotion by the industry in all regions and sectors, all the regions can participate in this growth.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of Bord Fáilte is well on course.  Its home marketing activities are being extensively supplemented by a total projected marketing spend of £125 million in the Operational Programme for Tourism which will support marketing campaigns focusing on improving seasonality, access, <Col N="208" /> developing new markets, attracting high yield business and co-operative marketing on a product or geographical basis. The Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, OTMI, which represents a unique partnership of Bord Fáilte, the Northern Ireland Tourism Board and the tourism industry, North and South, is proving especially successful.</P>
    <P>New and improved arrangements have been put in place to ensure the optimum co-ordination between Government Departments and agencies involved in tourism and greater emphasis is being put on manpower policy. Together with the other policies outlined in the debate, the framework has been put in place to ensure planned development of a sustainable tourism industry into the next millennium. There is no room for complacency and the perceived problems of the regional imbalances must be addressed.  Nevertheless, it is clear that we can not only realise our national tourism targets but the conditions are there for each of the regions to realise its own potential.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister of State for the tone he set in this debate.  None of us has a monopoly on wisdom in this regard, however one can only but enthusiastically endorse the comments of the Minister of State with regard to the phenomenal growth in tourism numbers this country has experienced over the last number of years.  I am sure the Minister of State and tourism interests will agree that this growth also brings problems and challenges for the future.  I wish to dwell on both and also on the regional structure of what might be referred to as the marketing arm of tourism in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the growth be sustained?  All the projections over the past number of years appear to indicate that tourism and the leisure market will be the biggest single growth industry into the next millennium.  If this is to be the case, are we to be content with the sporadic nature of the deluge coming upon us in this country that started some years ago with the First Operational Programme <Col N="209" /> for Tourism in 1989?  We are now continuing into the second operational programme and I hope there will be third operational programme, despite the prophets of doom who say we will have our funds taken away from us at the end of the millennium.  To somebody living in County Leitrim &mdash; I should refer to it as lovely Leitrim from now on, given that we are discussing tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To somebody living in County Leitrim, Kerry and the southwest were traditionally the key areas for inward and home based tourism, but it now appears Dublin and the east coast have taken on that mantle.  The growth of tourism numbers in the Dublin area is phenomenal and the number of bed nights continues to increase.  At last count it was estimated that 20 new hotels are being built and that they will be up and running before the end of the decade.  However, concerns are being expressed about this level of projected or actual growth, particularly with regard to the type of visitor to the capital city.</P>
      <P>It was recently suggested that while we are all basking in the reflected glory of the Eurovision and the various other benefits which have come our way in terms of highlighting Dublin, the city is now seen as a swinging place for people who come to the country for a couple of days and then leave.  This is a particular niche in the tourism market which should be welcomed, but I hope Ireland will not end up as a stop over venue for weekenders.  This would not be of benefit to the wider national economy and questions are being raised in that regard in terms of whether the attributes of the city should be expanded or reoriented in a different marketing strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> People complained about backpackers in the past, but today they are complaining about weekenders.  This aspects poses challenges and problems as the capital city expands, but all Members will agree the face of Dublin has changed to an extraordinary degree in our life time.  I am showing my age &mdash; although I do not go back as far as the trams &mdash; but I remember the destruction of Georgian Dublin in the 1960s and the social revolution of that time when it appeared there was no appreciation of our cultural and architectural heritage. The position is a complete reversal today and the Georgian and architecturally historical aspects of Dublin are now being trumpeted.  This is right and proper, but have yesterday's revolutionaries turned into today's ecologists and environmentalists, or did they chase the mighty dollar and are long gone?</P>
    <P>I hope those involved in tourism, in addition to the Government and State agencies, are examining these issues and preparing strategic plans for the future. For example, cultural tourism in the continental market is a growth area and this should be exploited more than at present.  We should not be so defensive about our historical or cultural attractions but rather celebrate them.  I make these remarks in the context of the apparent begrudgery which surrounded the winning of the Eurovision song contest recently.  Ireland had a world wide television captured audience and not only did it project all that was good about the country but the winning song was not part of what might be referred to as the international pop criteria.  It sprang from our culture; it was distinctive and different and Irish in its content and delivery.  It showed we have something separate to offer and more emphasis should be placed on the cultural side of our tourism rather than the glitzy side.</P>
    <P>I come from a Border county and I might be accused by my colleagues from other areas of taking a blinkered or prejudiced approach because it is possible the problems the Border counties are facing in terms of tourism may not <Col N="211" /> be experienced by other parts of the country.  The current regional structure is not working.  The Border counties, due to the history of how they became Border counties, have been artificially gelled together in the North-West Regional Tourism Organisation.  Marketing personnel, based in an office in Sligo, are responsible for marketing the diversity of a geographical area which stretches from Malin Head in the north-west to Carlingford Lough in the far north-east.</P>
    <P>Each component of the region has something separate and distinctive to offer and it has been a cause of concern to my friends in Cavan and Monaghan in particular that the type of tourism image they wish to project conflicts greatly with the image Donegal and Sligo wish to project.  Leitrim also comes within the ambit of what might generally be termed the lakeland region.  If we are serious about marketing Ireland North and South &mdash; everybody welcomes the joint marketing between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte &mdash; perhaps it is time to consider rejigging the areas.  For example, Fermanagh, Cavan, Leitrim and parts of north Roscommon would fit into what might be termed a lakeland region. Northern parts of Senator Belton's county, Longford, could also be included in a lakeland fishing area.</P>
    <P>The area has particular water based strengths, including, as Senator Magner will testify, Shannon boat activities and fishing, and does not share the same type of attractions, physical or otherwise, with Donegal or Louth.  I am not sure this is true of other parts of the country.  Some dissatisfaction is inevitable when counties are grouped together in a regional structure. However, the dissatisfaction being expressed in the north-west region in particular can no longer be ignored.  I do not have a solution, but perhaps part of the answer lies in closer liaison and integration of the region as a single tourism product, North or South, rather than sticking rigidly, legally and constitutionally <Col N="212" /> to the idea of the southern Border counties as one group.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the various tax relief schemes for coastal resorts, the IFI, INTERREG, Leader and agri tourism.  The 1994-99 Operational Programme for Tourism contained a number of welcome innovations in relation to grant aid &mdash; up to 75 per cent in some cases &mdash; for the provision of bed nights. However, there are few top class hotels in my region and those that are top class meet that standard, including the Slieve Russell Hotel in Ballyconnell and various hotels in Bundoran, such as the recently opened Allingham Arms. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of top class hotels in the region which is hoping to gain more from tourism than any other activity in economic terms because there are not many industries.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty in the area is the lack of seed capital.  Sufficient investment capital is not available to build the type of tourism facilities with which the Minister is familiar in Cork and Kerry. More money for investment exists in those areas and there is probably more confidence there in terms of projected growth than in the Border counties because of the perceived volatility of the political situation.  All these factors must be taken into account regarding the reason the region is not doing as well as it might, given its natural assets.  The grant aid being made available should be examined in the mid-term review. The thresholds are too high for those who wish to get involved.  For example, one must build an 18 bedroom hotel of a particular size and make a particular financial investment.  The money is not there.  It is not that people do not want to do it.  There are a lot of people who want to get into the tourism market.  I suggest that there should be some scheme, even if it is European-funded, that would allow private individuals to access the market at the bed and breakfast level and get involved in tourism but at a lower level than the current operational programme.  If I were to make no other point but that one &mdash; and I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach, who <Col N="213" /> has allowed me some indulgence in this regard &mdash; then that point, access into tourism at a lower level under the operational programme mid-term review, would go a long way to involving more of us in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome. I am delighted that we have the opportunity to speak on such a constructive motion.  It is an area we at long last recognise as our second biggest industry. Tourism is important to Ireland and I am delighted that we are looking at figures of 12 per cent growth in 1995 and, most importantly, that our British tourism is up 13 per cent on the year before.  That is an enormous figure. North American tourism is up by 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about the Minister of State's area &mdash; domestic tourism &mdash; where, even though the Government has committed itself to a certain amount of money for 1995, not enough is being done.  I know he wishes to improve the promotion of domestic tourism.  In the Minister's speech and in our debates on tourism over the last few years, we talk about quality.  We can be proud that in the last ten years quality in tourism in Ireland has prevailed.  We see that in communities and organisations.  The Minister has again emphasised the Government's commitment to making sure that everybody involved in tourism contributes to Government policy.  That is an excellent idea.  It was long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we looking to mainland Europe? Previous speakers made the point about our culture and European culture.  More people are now visiting because of our culture.  We are doing well, but are we doing enough?  We are not putting enough into our own traditions.  I would like to see the quality of our traditions <Col N="214" /> emphasised more.  It is an important area.</P>
    <P>With respect to domestic tourism, is enough being done by business people to promote domestic tourism because there are golden opportunities there? People are getting a lot of revenue directly from the Exchequer from a tax point of view &mdash; in the BES schemes, for instance &mdash; but they look at this from a business point of view and not a tourism one.  That said, there is one enterprise in Baltimore which deserves great credit and which has upgraded and improved the town in no small way.  I would like to see that in many areas and there is no reason it should not be in Leitrim and other counties as well as in West Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>Let us look at people in tourist areas who see the opportunities and options open to them.  We should give great credit to the people of Killarney.  They have seen what tourism means to them. We have seen at long last what tourism means to people in other areas.  For instance, the town of Dingle is doing exceptionally well now because they can see what tourism means to them.  It is not just the months of July, August and September.</P>
    <P>We can see opportunities open to us in domestic tourism now that we are now going to places we have not gone to before.  Look at what it has created. Look at the number of jobs and, most importantly, the type of job it is creating.  Unfortunately, we are in a situation where there is a strong impression that if you are not involved in high technology in Ireland, you are not involved at all.  The tourism opportunities are massive.  People from CERT are well-regarded and they are not involved in high technology, they are involved in tourism.  Young people involved in the tourism trade are now doing exceptionally well.  Are they doing well enough?  Are there enough of them doing well enough?  Should we be doing more for them?  The tourism opportunities that can be created for our young people who are not involved in high technology are golden.  We <Col N="215" /> should avail of them.  It is important and that is why I come back to the Minister's area.  I welcome the fact that he, personally, made sure that more money will go into domestic tourism this year.  That is why I say that it is not just June, July and August.  These young people have so much to give and I see this in many areas.</P>
    <P>Kinsale is a town we can congratulate for getting an international award yesterday. You must look at the way Kinsale and its people work and the initiative shown by the business people and by everybody involved, including the work-force. They are committed.  There is no difference in Kinsale between Friday, Saturday or Sunday or between a Monday or a Thursday.  When they are working, they are working and they are about it.  The people of Kinsale deserve great credit.  They have learned from Killarney. Dingle has also learned from Killarney. There are other areas that can learn that are not getting the opportunity and that is why we must explore the avenues to create more opportunities for people to get involved in domestic tourism.  I ask the Minister, even though he is committed in the budget to providing more money for it, to create these opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his efforts.  I have first hand knowledge through the county tourism committees of his efforts.  He has been enthusiastic in developing that structure.  While I appreciate there has to be much effort from the interested parties in tourism within a county, it is no harm that they should be encouraged.  I feel that the county tourism committees should get financial recognition in the overall tourism promotion strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will concentrate briefly on the Shannon and the towns along it.  This Government has supported traditional tourism areas on the coast.  That was through tax reliefs and so on and was highly welcome.  I would like to put to the Minister that the same case can be <Col N="216" /> made for towns along the Shannon.  We all know that the Shannon is one of the major inland tourism attractions.  I know everything cannot be done overnight.  It is like filling the potholes on the road: if you are on one road, why are you not on mine?  If you are in one area of the country, why are you not in mine? However, it is a policy that should be adopted.</P>
    <P>We have had a debate in the past few years about the regions, that one region is getting more than the other, etc.  One of the reasons this is so apparent is that our tourism industry has improved and boomed so much in the past few years, especially last year and, hopefully, again this year.  It is now obvious that there is a great move towards Ireland.  Perhaps one of the reasons is that people are getting away from sun holidays.  That is not to say we will not have the sun we had last year, but the general opinion in many countries is that, instead of going for a sun holiday, people are looking elsewhere and our mixed climate is suitable for that.  It is also important that we have other backup attractions for tourism.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that fishing and boating holidays are major attractions upon which inland counties, especially in the midlands, depend for tourism.  I thank the Minister for his efforts and his consideration.  I am happy that our tourism industry has made such major strides in the past year.  Jobs came on stream last year from industries serving tourism and hopefully that will happen again this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also recognise the Minister's efforts in the domestic market. Although I know his brief looks more at the involvement of Irish people on holidays, we are talking about the broader picture.  Research, development and training are not being sufficiently linked together in the tourism industry. The best test of a grade A hotel in this country is to ask for a sandwich and a cup of coffee at 3.30 p.m.  It is a major problem in the service area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need to examine the lack of <Col N="217" /> training.  It should not take someone four trips to serve three people in a hotel dining room just because they can only hold two plates at a time.  Also, if you ask them about something on the menu they have to go back to the kitchen to check.  Small points like that should be brought to the attention of people providing a service, because those who meet the tourists are the ones who create the overall impression.  Such people should be confident, competent and able to do the job, but we are losing out on small things.</P>
    <P>Many hotels are great at running big dinner functions, yet they cannot provide a sandwich in the afternoon.  I have yet to find a grade A hotel in this country which will offer customers three different kinds of sandwich.  Usually, they will only give you a ham sandwich with white bread.  There is a view that freshly cut sandwiches means that while they were made the day before yesterday, they were only cut today.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to small towns along the Shannon.  Senator Magner and I attended a reception earlier in the year to launch a report on the Royal Canal.  Detailed market research was done for that report on the inflow of tourists to boat hire companies on the river and on the canal.  A glance at one page of the report gives you all the information you need about the number of tourists, where they come from, the peak times of year they come, and cheap periods for visits.  That was useful information for anyone planning to provide a service along the Royal Canal.  I had never seen information like that before, but generally the idea of using long-term research and development in the tourist industry is being missed out on.  It should be looked at.</P>
    <P>About three weeks ago I was in a restaurant in a midlands town on a Friday night.  There were 60 people present and every table was full, yet my wife and I were the only two Irish people there. The developments that are taking place are extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The recognition and protection of our strengths is crucial.  Not so long ago <Col N="218" /> somebody thought it would be a great idea to concrete over the canals and turn them into motorways.  That kind of thing happened all the time.  In the 1950s somebody else wanted to flatten the bridge in Banagher but the Inland Waterways Association stopped it from happening.</P>
    <P>Positive things have happened also. The opening up of the Shannon-Erne waterway has been a huge development. A sum of £8 million would reopen the Sligo-Galway train line and that money would be recovered through tourism.  It would be a great investment and would have obvious commercial spin-off effects.  That whole area needs to be opened up to tourism, but it does not have a public transport infrastructure. Such a railway line would provide it. Local groups in Mayo are looking at the idea and the Minister should examine the proposal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in Waterford and Wexford local authorities are beginning to become centrally involved in tourism, as are more and more local authorities. In Senator Belton's own county of Longford, Barley harbour is servicing the town of Newtown Cashel, which is two miles from the lake.  Hire boats, however, are not allowed into that area, so the tourism business is losing out for the sake of somebody putting a few marker buoys from the harbour to the main navigation channel.  It is the kind of issue that local people should be moving on.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the seven bridges across the Royal Canal in counties Westmeath and Longford are now being taken out.  That will open up a new inland waterway for tourism to be developed.  It is crucial to do such things.</P>
    <P>We have the sea, the mountains and the climate, which people look upon as a tourist attraction.  This country is beautiful in the autumn, winter and springtime.  People may have their doubts about the summer weather, but no one can have any doubt about the autumn or winter weather here.  There is nothing as beautiful as walking along <Col N="219" /> Coumeenole beach in the middle of a winter storm.  We do not need to have the sun beating down on top of us, because the beauty is there.  The development of hill walking and other walks throughout the country is opening up huge areas for tourism.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that if we look after the backpackers, they will come back driving their Mercedes.  That issue should be kept in mind.  Dingle and Kinsale are towns that made a go of tourism because they found a place to suit every visitor.  There is a £5 a night hostel and a grade A hotel.  There is a pizza takeaway and a top class Egon Ronay restaurant. Down in the harbour fishing boats are moored beside million pound yachts.  That is the magic combination that makes this country so special.  We do not need to change people or try to manipulate a certain type of tourist.  The type of thinking which sets out only to attract people with huge amounts of money is short term because such people go elsewhere on holidays also.</P>
    <P>The other issue that has singled out Kinsale and Dingle from many other places is that they used a common marketing approach.  In other words, get the tourists on to the main street and may the best service win.  The idea of individual hotels or tourism projects trying to do battle with someone else in small towns like Kinsale or Dingle does not work.  What worked was when Kinsale invited people along for the food festival, and similar events occured in Dingle. Other towns are doing that now so that people can participate in everything that is available.  That is what creates the buzz and people can deal with the local competition.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws have created a problem for the tourist industry.  They really are unnecessary and if ever there was a need for deregulation it is in this area.  They are unhelpful and unnecessary and we should have a good look at them.  They are becoming more flexible. The regulations which allow restaurants, particularly new ones, to have drinks licences, which allow the pub industry to <Col N="220" /> move into catering, have opened up the area.  It is a final step and the nettle needs to be grasped.  It has nothing to do with a liberal agenda or anything else.  It is purely a practical approach to a business which is the second largest industry in the world.</P>
    <P>It is important that people in this industry are seen to be in full-time employment.  I know I am pushing an open door with the Minister on this issue.  There will always be temporary work and by its nature there will be peaks and troughs, nonetheless, it is crucial for the long-term future of this industry that people see it as a full-time job for life.</P>
    <P>There is one great art being lost in this country today and that is the art of waiting tables.  It is seen as a subservient part of the industry.  At one time, the person waiting a table was the face of the industry.  Somebody to talk to the customer and let them know they are in a special place makes the correct impression and is more important than the facade or the language in which the menu is written.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his officials on their work.  I wish the Minister well and hope he will take some of my suggestions on board, in particular the railway between Sligo and Galway.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House; this is my first time in the House with him.  I congratulate him and the Minister for Tourism and Trade on their efforts and the great work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been some time since this debate was initiated in the House and I welcome the opportunity, however belated, to make my contribution.  Since the last debate, the good news about the Irish economy has continued with some forecasters estimating that the growth last year was higher than 10 per cent. <Col N="221" /> There have also been developments which will impact greatly on the tourism industry and its potential growth.</P>
    <P>The precarious position of the peace process in Northern Ireland is a worrying development.  The murder of a member of the garda, the bombing in Manchester and the discovery of an arms cache in County Laois present a negative image of Ireland.  I have heard that some events planned for the country have been cancelled in light of the speculation that the IRA will not resume its ceasefire.  I repeat the calls of all the major political parties in this State to Sinn Féin and the IRA that, without a ceasefire, we all have a lot to lose.  I read with interest newspaper reports earlier this week that the recovery of the Northern Ireland economy has not been affected too badly by the resumption of the IRA arms campaign. I am sure that, on the whole, the same applies to the tourism industry here, but we cannot survive any escalation of violence.</P>
    <P>There have also been good developments in the implementation of Government policy in this area since we last debated the issue when the Minister announced the establishment of a tourism council.  He has done this and the council has met on two occasions.  This is a welcome development and I congratulate the Minister for bringing it into being so soon after the debate in the Seanad.  The idea behind the council is to allow representatives of all sectors of the tourism industry to play a part in formulating Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Since April there have also been developments in the promotion of domestic holidays.  There is a tendency in this country to over-concentrate on attracting foreign visitors to our shores. This neglects the fact that money spent in Ireland by the Irish people, or foreigners, is to the ultimate advantage of the Irish economy.  Each family which decides to holiday here as opposed to abroad spends money in our economy <Col N="222" /> that might have gone elsewhere.  In recent years, there has been a proliferation of the domestic break which benefits the tourism sector, particularly in the off-season period.  This is indicative of society's growth in affluence and the success of Government policy, for which my party can take considerable credit.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to difficulties in securing adequate manpower for the tourism industry.  This is a legitimate concern, despite the huge numbers being trained by CERT for work in the tourism sector.  The Malone report stated that the tourism sector could soon face competition from other sectors. This does not surprise me. However, I am not sure that the proposal to establish a national co-ordinating manpower development plan is a solution.  Unemployment is reducing. Given the high levels of employment projects for this economy up to the end of the century, labour shortages, particularly in some of the low paid and low skilled sectors of the economy, are bound to emerge.  To a great extent the fate of the tourism industry rests with itself.  Whether it is an accurate perception, work in the tourism sector is perceived to be largely low skilled, low paid and often entails anti-social working hours.  If the tourism sector is to fulfil its potential, this will have to change.  It is up to the industry, as well as the Government, to make this happen.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of debate as to what will happen when the current tranche of Structural Funds runs out.  I support efforts to have Ireland treated as a separate number of regions, as is done in other countries.  This would ensure a continuation of a level of support. Perhaps this can be used as a way of directing tourism resources to the regions.  Whatever happens, we are guaranteed continued financial support from the EU through the operational programme up to and including 1999, which is over three years away.  Three years is sufficient time to plan for the <Col N="223" /> future of the tourism industry.  Too often in Ireland, we wait until it is too late before we act.  Let that not be the case in this instance.  I know the Minister and the Minister of State are aware of what to do.  We have made a good start and have shown determination in tackling the real issues.  I can assure them of my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cashin for sharing his time.  I congratulate the Minister of State on presiding over the buoyant domestic tourism sector of the economy.</P>
      <P>Domestic tourism is, in some ways, more important than foreign tourism. Once we nurture it, it grows.  Provided the product is good, most people will choose their own country.  As long as somebody of the calibre of the Minister of State is in charge of that area, we can be sure of an honest product.  This is important.  We can also take into account the strictures laid upon us by Senator O'Toole &mdash; that people should be paid adequately for an important job. I know the Minister of State is committed to this.</P>
      <P>There is also tremendous potential for the under-exploited area of North/South relations.  If I could persuade my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to divert substantial funds into that area, there would be enormous potential in terms of money generated by people from Northern Ireland visiting the South and <i>vice versa.</i>  This could create good relationships between people from both parts of the island and would represent a &ldquo;good neighbour&rdquo; policy.  I have discussed this matter at length with the Minister of State.  When the political dust settles, attractive tourist packages must be introduced on both sides of the Border in order that people can get to know each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On today's Order of Business, Senator Finneran raised the issue of the lack of an emergency response system <Col N="224" /> for cruisers that experience difficulties on the River Shannon.  I have used that river for leisure purposes for many years and I am glad that I never needed to call on anyone for assistance.  There is a sub-aqua group based in Athlone and another in Carrick, but these are private operations.  Senator Finneran has proposed, to no avail so far, that the fire brigades based in Carrick, Athlone and Lanesboro be given access to semi-inflatable craft to effect such rescues.  If there is, as the Senator stated, a complete lack of cover, the situation is potentially serious.  One accident could destroy the entire industry.  I understand that a potentially serious incident took place yesterday.  Thank God that it did not turn out that way.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to discuss this matter with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to see if cover can be provided through the local fire brigade services or if a Shannon rescue service can be established.  This problem impacts on the Minister of State's area of responsibility.  I am aware of his interest in sailing and he will know that, in the main, boat hire companies deal with foreign tourists. Very few Irish tourists hire boats, which is due in part to the expense involved and also the fact that they are unfamiliar with the product.  It would be possible to substantially extend the season for hire craft if more indigenous tourists could be attracted onto the River Shannon. To do so, we must ensure that it is a safe area for recreation.  If a gap exists, I urge the Minister of State and his colleagues to close it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his Department have done a terrific job in ensuring the growth of domestic tourism.  As Senator Cashin stated, the Minister of State is doing the Revenue Commissioners' job when money is spent in County Donegal and not the Costa del Sol.</P>

      <P>We could discuss this area at great length because the potential for tourism in Ireland is an unknown quantity at present.  When I was younger I travelled around Europe on a backpacking holiday and I discovered that young Europeans have a limited knowledge of Ireland.  People like to believe that Ireland is well known throughout the world, but the reality is that we are a small island nation off the coast of Europe.  The average European has very little knowledge of Ireland, which is a very beautiful country.  However, not many people are aware of its existence. This problem must be tackled.  I am aware that money was spent on marketing and research, but Ireland is of little significance to most people.</P>
      <P>We should exploit the fact that there are many Irish people living in countries across the globe.  In the early part of this century, many Irish emigrants were successful in business in the lands to which they travelled.  People of Irish extraction live in countries such as Argentina and we should tap into these markets.  Great potential exists to exploit the vast number of people with an interest in Ireland who do not know much about the country. These people lack the knowledge which would encourage them to visit Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that Ireland is the Aran Islands of Europe.  The 6,000 miles of water on the western seaboard provide certain drawbacks; but, regardless of this fact, the Americans seem to retain an interest in this country.  While many people visit Ireland, we are not attracting high-spending tourists. Senator O'Toole referred to licensing laws and casinos, issues which must be discussed at some stage.  We must be prepared to debate the establishment of casinos and liberalising the licensing laws.  It is embarrassing that tourists are unable to enter a premises on Cork's main thoroughfare and order a sandwich <Col N="226" /> at 2.30 p.m. on a Sunday.  We are not providing a service to those we hope will return to Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>The issue of casinos must be discussed and accepted as a possibility.  I was very disappointed at the recent closed debate on the establishment of a casino in Dublin. I understand the political reasons for this, but we should have an open discussion on this matter.  Tourism bodies, trade unions, etc., should be consulted to discover if casinos are viable or of interest.  Are they necessary to increase the country's tourism potential?  In my opinion, casinos, if organised properly, would attract the type of high-spending tourists who do not visit Ireland at present.  These people fly into a town, spend substantial sums of money and leave.  We need these type of people also.  It is fine to see two backpackers walking around County Roscommon, but such tourists do not spend enormous amounts of money.  While such people may return as &ldquo;high rollers&rdquo; in the future, we do not have the potential to extract that sort of money from them because we are not supplying the type of service they require in the first instance.  The Minister of State should encourage everyone interested in tourism to engage in an open and frank debate about the issue of casinos.</P>
    <P>I was glad to discover recently that Ireland has more golf holes <i>per capita</i> than any other country in the world. This fact amazed me at the time. However, I recently took a commuter flight from Cork to Dublin and discovered that the country seems to be one big golf course.  We must market the area of golfing holidays, which are a major industry in other countries. Japanese people fly to Australia for a weekend to play golf because the green fees in their own country are so expensive. We must attempt to tap into these niche markets.  Many British people travel to Ireland to play golf, but we have not exploited the markets in the Netherlands, northern France or northern Germany. <Col N="227" /> Large numbers of people from these areas could fly into Cork Airport or other regional airports at weekends to play golf and return home on Sunday evenings.  Efforts to promote such holidays must be increased.  A number of years ago, before the Minister of State assumed office, a tour operator in the Cork area tried to establish golf package holidays.  However, he was unable to obtain support and there was not enough information available for him to take the chance of investing in such a venture.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues which we must consider seriously.  We must attempt to exploit the great resource of Irish communities in countries throughout the world.  Many boasts are made about the numbers of people who claim Irish descent, but to a great extent we have not tapped into this market.  There is an international lack of knowledge about Ireland, even within the European Union.  If asked about Ireland, young people in Rome, Lisbon or Barcelona could provide little information. I know the Minister is interested in this area and I wish him well.  I ask him to take my points on board.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I have been holding an ongoing dialogue in the House over the last few weeks.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to discuss this matter and I thank the Minister for coming here to listen and, I hope, respond positively to my points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I want to know the Minister for Justice's proposals to reassure residents in the Rathfarnham-Knocklyon area that appropriate policing resources, especially foot patrols, will be deployed to stamp out the current wave of robberies and burglaries.  I also want her to direct the Commissioner to ensure sufficient manpower is assigned to Rathfarnham Garda station and that its immediate hinterland is given an appropriate level of priority.</P>
    <P>I have put down this motion because the perception of people living in those areas is that crime levels are at an all-time high.  Robberies and burglaries are occurring day and night and there has been a huge increase in house break-ins over the last few months.  However, the Garda response is totally inadequate. Many people have been burgled not once but several times.  The perpetrators of crime are so cheeky that they have worked out which houses it is possible and worthwhile to rob.  Householders, retired people and senior citizens are all under threat.  Even young people are apprehensive when they go out at night about how and where they can meet their friends.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year people in my area have raised with me no issue more frequently than crime and policing.  A patrol car passing through occasionally does not give a sense of security and is not a deterrent to the perpetrators of crime.  There is not enough manpower to patrol the area. Foot patrols are a far greater deterrent and are much more reassuring for the residents.  They give the police a high visibility in the area, allow them to get to know and to gain the confidence of those living there and help them identify the individuals who are most vulnerable and at risk.  The perpetrators of these crimes feel they have a free hand but the introduction of foot patrols would change that.</P>
    <P>Rathfarnham Garda station is understaffed. The perception is that all <Col N="229" /> resources are directed towards Tallaght to the detriment of the Rathfarnham area.  I ask the Minister to assess the position at Rathfarnham and ensure sufficient manpower is assigned to it to challenge the new spate of crime.  The people of Rathfarnham and Knocklyon work hard, pay their taxes and contribute to the State in every way.  They feel the State has let them down and should now take responsibility.</P>
    <P>The problem is serious, as the Minister knows &mdash; she represents the same area and can agree with everything I have said.  If the reply is not what I am looking for, I ask her to make representations to the Minister for Justice, because the people of these areas are crying out for help.  I hope the reply will be positive.</P>

      <P>As Senator Ormonde said, I too represent the Rathfarnham-Knocklyon area and I am pleased to say that two more gardaí have been deployed in Rathfarnham station than was the case this time last year.</P>

      <P>I am here on behalf of the Minister for Justice as this is not my functional area of responsibility.  In any case, the deployment of Garda personnel is a matter for the Garda authorities, not for the Minister &mdash; she does not assign gardaí to individual areas.</P>
      <P>Rathfarnham Garda station, which covers Rathfarnham and Knocklyon, is part of the district which has its headquarters at Tallaght and is under the divisional headquarters at Crumlin.  The Garda authorities have informed the Minister for Justice that the current Garda strength at Rathfarnham is 64 members and the corresponding figure for 1995 was 62 members.  I am glad there has been an increase of approximately 3 per cent in Garda numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> The Minister has also been informed that two gardaí from the neighbourhood policing unit at Rathfarnham Garda station have been allocated to policing the Rathfarnham/Knocklyon area and they regularly patrol the area on foot. The foot patrols are supported by uniform and detective mobile patrols. Where necessary, crime task force personnel attached to Crumlin Garda station are available to assist the local gardaí.  A neighbourhood watch scheme operates in Knocklyon and this scheme has been successful in reducing crime in other areas.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have indicated to the Minister that the pattern of crime so far this year does not differ substantially from that of last year.  They have informed her that recent burglaries and robberies in the Rathfarnham and Knocklyon areas are being investigated by the detective unit at Rathfarnham. Four people were arrested yesterday in the Knocklyon area and they were interviewed in relation to larcenies from cars and burglaries in the Knocklyon area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been assured by the Garda authorities that the neighbourhood gardaí assigned to Knocklyon and Rathfarnham will continue to work closely with the local community in their combined efforts to prevent crime.  Furthermore, these neighbourhood gardaí will continue to deal with any concerns from members of the community in this regard.  Local residents may also be assured that resources at district and divisional level will be made available as required in the area so far as is necessary for operational reasons.</P>
    <P>The Blackrock area is also in my constituency and in the first five months of this year there has been a 44 per cent decrease in crime on the first five months of last year.  This is due to the success of the Garda in apprehending a number of key ringleaders and having them put behind bars.  Hopefully, we will have similar success in Knocklyon and Rathfarnham with good policing.</P>

      <P>The leading editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today is titled &ldquo;The &lsquo;compo&rsquo; mentality&rdquo;.  It states:&ldquo;... we are looking at a scandal which is almost aided and abetted by the want of strong law on the subject.&rdquo;  The news analysis section of the newspaper has a special article on the compensation culture, which is titled &ldquo;Legal loopholes make it a swindler's paradise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At present Dublin Corporation has payments of compensation of £20 million outstanding.  In 1994 the Office of Public Works paid in excess of £281,000 and Telecom Éireann paid £7 million in the last five years.  Ireland is one of the most litigious countries in Europe.  The compensation culture is a cancer eating into society.  It costs the State in excess of £600 million per year and thousands of jobs.</P>
      <P>The system acts against the best interests of the genuine claimant, who may have to wait many years for the resolution of his or her claim with consequent distress, uncertainty about the level of compensation appropriate, and to an extent this discourages rehabilitation and the return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance costs are creating complications for employers, businesses, motorists, public authorities and voluntary and sporting organisations.  No area has been spared the paralysis that has accompanied the escalation in litigation. Teachers can no longer send their students to the local shop for a box of <Col N="232" /> matches.  Public houses, supermarkets, clubs, hotels and local authorities are in open season for claims.  The claims epidemic is destroying the ordinary person's enjoyment of society.  The playgrounds where for decades young people enjoyed themselves on swings and slides are becoming an entertainment of the past.  It is almost impossible to get insurance for these facilities.</P>
    <P>Motor insurance premia in Ireland are 98 per cent higher than the EU average. A male aged 17 to 21 years with a full driving licence must pay an average of £1,790 to insure a Ford Fiesta.  One cannot justify such prohibitive costs and the situation must change.  The enactment of the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1994, is an indication of what can be done.  It represents a fundamental and radical change in this area of law.</P>
    <P>Personal injury compensation represents 67 per cent of the claims payout in motor insurance and almost all claims paid out for employers' and public liability insurance.  Ireland, to its competitive disadvantage, has the highest personal injury awards of the EU member states.  Irish claim frequencies and award levels are more than twice those of the UK.  Part of the problem resides with the legal system and the courts appear to take a lenient attitude to claims, often holding employers responsible no matter what the circumstances. Only one in nine claims which go to court is dismissed.  It appears as if the defendant in such cases is guilty until proven innocent.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies settle many cases out of court.  The average cost of public liability claims settled out of court is £6,989 and awarded by the court is £15,058.  The practice of settling out of court encouraged the escalation of claims.  The trauma for the claimant of giving evidence, whatever its content, is not a deterrent and opportunistic claims are encouraged.  The uncertainty as to the level of award appropriate to a particular claim is also a factor.  There is an <Col N="233" /> urgent need for a schedule of awards to give guidance on appropriate levels.  In one case an employee suffering from a blistered hand received £1,200.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission should bring forward proposals to bring the Irish frequency and quantity of awards and, consequently, insurance premia levels, in line with our EU competitors. The New Zealand system of self-insurance should be considered.  IBEC has identified key elements in the approach to these issues.  First, the establishment of statutory guidelines on awards for more frequent injuries &mdash; this would have the effect of reducing and limiting awards and making them more predictable.  Second, measures to tackle the problem of fraudulent and unnecessarily inflated claims.  Third, reform of the duty of care so that, among other things, the concept of contributory negligence is taken into account and so that a breach of a statutory duty is not a case of action on its own account.  Fourth, measures to simplify court procedures and, in particular, to provide for the sharing of a disclosure of information on medical matters, pay, social welfare and financial loss and, fifth, measures to restrict legal costs.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has responsibility for insurance, has provided a lengthy briefing for Senators.  My responsibilities include health and safety at work.  I agree that the compensation mentality is very destructive.  People who make false or spurious claims are picking the pockets of society.  It is a form of theft and we should recognise it as such. Senator Neville referred to the insurance difficulties and the claims experience of public authorities.  They inhibit the provision at reasonable cost of basic public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for high costs is an unacceptable accident rate and an <Col N="234" /> unacceptable level of dangerous practice. Senator Neville referred to motor insurance.  My 21 year old daughter has just got her driving licence and we are paying a large amount for her motor insurance.  The claims experience for young drivers is very bad.  A consultancy report commissioned by the Department indicates that the average cost of an insurance claim for a 17 to 24 year old driver is over twice that for 36 to 40 year old driver.  Given that the younger age group is liable to have more, as well more expensive, claims, it is responsible for over three times the claims cost applicable to the 36 to 40 years age group.</P>
    <P>To some extent the cost of motor insurance for young drivers reflects an unacceptable level of claims and the cost of those claims.  We must examine why there are too many accidents, if there is drink driving involved and if there are excessive speeds involved.  We must reduce the number of accidents as well as reducing the incidence of claims arising from the compensation mentality.</P>
    <P>In my own area of health and safety at work, the cost to employers last year of public liability and employer liability claims and the corresponding premia totalled £200 million.  If we could reduce the unacceptable toll of accidents and injuries at work, through improved action in safety and risk management and prevention, by an achievable target of 20 per cent we would save Irish employers £40 million.  That would be sufficient to generate an extra 4,000 jobs in this economy.  If we reduced employers' PRSI by £40 million, that is the effect we would have on jobs.</P>
    <P>There are areas of business which have come together on insurance.  For example, the quarry owners and concrete manufacturers have come together and put in place a safety programme. They have been able to reduce the level of accidents and claims and their own insurance costs.  They are in a position <Col N="235" /> to expand their employment as a result of better business experience.  That is the message which must go out.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has commissioned a study on the issues raised by Senator Neville I agree with most of what the Senator said.  A firm of consultants is undertaking an evaluation of non-life insurance cost, which is basically accident insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Their terms of reference are very broad and take on board all the issues raised by Senator Neville.  The preliminary results are coming through and I hope it will inform policy in the future.  I will bring the points made by Senator Neville to the attention of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.23 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 June 1996.</P>
