      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to establish an independent living fund to provide self-determination, responsibility and control for Irish people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide adequate accommodation for 180 pupils and eight teachers at Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis in Mallow, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to expedite the provision of a new primary school for Kilkee, County Clare, in view of the fact that the convent school has been condemned: and the reason for the delay in proceeding with the project.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to make a statement on the student summer jobs scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators O'Kennedy's and Sherlock's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Daly <Col N="3" /> and McGowan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I am sure Members will join with me in expressing total condemnation of the bomb attack in Manchester last Saturday.  While it is probably no consolation to the people of Manchester or to Irish people living there who may find themselves subject to attack and abuse as result of what happened, it is important word goes out that all parties in this Parliament are united in their condemnation of that appalling and cowardly act which will doing nothing for peace, reconciliation or the cause of democracy.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1, the Pensions Bill, 1995, and item 18, motion 34.  The proposal is that item 1 be taken until 6 p.m. and after 8 p.m. to complete Second Stage and that Private Members' business be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party, I would like to express our condemnation of the violent act in Manchester last Saturday. But for the grace of God, there was no loss of life.  I am sure I speak for thousands of parents who have had the good fortune to bring their children to Manchester to visit Maine Road or Old Trafford where we are well looked after.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader about the business of the House over the next couple of weeks.  When is it intended to bring the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) (No. 2) Bill, 1996, to the House?  Is it the Leader's intention to deal with the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, before the summer recess?  Given the amount of legislation on the order book at present, how often will the House sit and how does the Leader intend to complete some very necessary legislation?</P>

      <P>We all condemn the bombing which had a devastating effect on the centre of Manchester and which could have serious repercussions for those of Irish origin who must work in the area.  When members of the Government involved in the talks in Northern Ireland are asking for restraint and no violence on either side, they should also ask anyone who has influence over those in the Orange Order to ensure marches are conducted in as dignified a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of what took place in Manchester at the weekend.  It was an appalling incident by any standard.  As Senator Wright said, but for the grace of God, nobody was killed.  We extend our sympathy to those who were injured and their families.  I was sickened to hear Mr. Adams being interviewed on British television on Saturday afternoon.  He could not find it in his heart to condemn what had taken place; he expressed his regret which, I am afraid, is not enough. It must be stronger than that.</P>
      <P>I asked on last week's Order of Business for time to have statements on Northern Ireland.  While important sensitivities are involved and we do not wish to upset matters, as a result of what happened it would be appropriate to make time available either tomorrow or early next week to make statements on Northern Ireland and the peace process in general.  There is one simple solution to this.  Mr. Adams and his friends should call a permanent ceasefire.  What we ask of the Orange Order and others can fall into line later but everything begins and ends from there.  I am fed up with Sinn Féin getting concessions on the basis first of a ceasefire and then Canary Wharf.  I hope it will not get any more concessions on the basis of what happened in Manchester.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been calls for a debate on tourism.  We should note the fishkills in County Cork.  That matter could be tied into that debate or by way of separate statements on agriculture.  It is regrettable that the control of farmyard pollution <Col N="5" /> scheme, which was successful in encouraging farmers to invest in pollution control measures, seems to have been suspended.  Whatever funds are available should he directed towards assisting people who are prepared and want to implement pollution control measures.</P>
    <P>On a lighter note, on the basis that an isosceles triangle has now acquired four extra degrees to what it had through recorded history, does the Government intend to reframe Einstein's special theory of relativity?  Does it intend to use a truck from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry carrying examination papers to verify that theory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I join with other Members in condemning the appalling bombing in Manchester.  As Members said, it is only through good fortune that nobody was killed.  However, there are major implications for those people who were seriously injured.  They and their families must live with these appalling injuries; one woman needed 300 stitches in her face.  While it was fortuitous that nobody was killed, we must remember the effects on those who were severely injured by the blast.  I join with others in calling on the IRA to put in place a permanent ceasefire and on anybody with any influence to use it to achieve that goal.  Every time we hear of an atrocity we hope it will be the last.  We must redouble our efforts to ensure that this will be the case.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Wright in hoping that the divorce legislation will be introduced in the Dáil and Seanad as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I join in the condemnation of the Manchester bombing.  It is surprising that a small number of people, who have incurred the wrath of the Irish and other peoples, can continue along this road.  One would hope that those responsible for perpetrating such a crime will be apprehended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis' call for a debate on the recent fishkills in County Cork.  I totally condemn them out of hand.  They seem to go on regardless of the laws we introduce. We should call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to reinstate the control of pollution grants to their previous level.  They are still available but they have been rescheduled. This means that people who were passed for grants in 1995 will not get them until 1997.  That is delaying pollution control in farms.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade or some body should put an advertisement on television and radio warning farmers of the damage they can do.  One of the rivers in Cork will not recover from the damage that was done.  It is a pity to see a great fishing river destroyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in condemning the bombing in Manchester and I do so in the knowledge that half the population of county Donegal live there.  It was a dastardly act, one the House must unite to condemn. I sincerely hope that the peace initiative and the peace talks in the North succeed.  There is no other hope. My county and the Border counties have suffered very serious deprivation in 25 years and the bombing in Manchester is the last act we can tolerate.  We must send a united message that, regardless of our political views, we are 110 per cent united in condemning the act that was perpetrated against the people of Manchester.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Leader bring the Minister of Education into the House and arrange a debate on the school transport problem?  It is about time we called a stop to getting children out of bed at 6.30 each morning to attend school three hours later.  That is not what we want.  I am sure the Leader recognises there is a problem in rural Ireland that is not being tackled and that every time the issue comes up all we get is a cosmetic response.  There is no positive approach adopted, no decision taken. Will the Leader bring the Minister for <Col N="7" /> Education here to tell us if she has the money and if she has any intention of implementing a proper transport policy for primary schools?  In my county there are pockets of Protestant population &mdash; 18 and 20 children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that for a debate so that we can tell those affected that we are going to provide a school transport system or that we are going to fail.  We should tell them the truth.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Education the current situation regarding the proposed regional education boards?  There is a lot of confusion, concern and interest about this at this time. Are they to come on stream?  Clarification from the Minister for Education would be much appreciated by the many sectors involved in the education process. It would be appreciated by people involved in the world of education if the Minister for Education could outline at this stage what is the situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to reiterate the call I made last week to the Leader of the House concerning the need for the Minister for Tourism and Trade. Deputy Kenny, to come in here to have a debate on tourism.  I am a little afraid that Dublin is getting almost too much of its share of tourism.  We need more clarification on the national convention centre.  There are various venues being suggested.  We need a debate on tourism as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I unreservedly condemn the savagery and stupidity of the Manchester bombing, but I also want to support Senator Henry's observation concerning Orange marches.  I see no reason a request that there be some dignity and restraint exercised there needs to be seen as a concession to the Manchester bombing in light of last year's events.  That should be a matter of course.  When is the proposed university legislation likely to be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Education come into this House to clarify the Department's statement this morning that there will be fewer teachers in over 100 named schools, particularly in rural areas?  The number of pupils will have risen in many of these schools by next September but the number of teachers will have dropped. Not alone is there a need for a debate. on that matter, but there is a need for a general debate on education before the summer recess and before decisions are made for the autumn school term.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked about the convention of the House with regard to the use of speeches.  Inadvertently, I might have insulted members of the Press Gallery but that was never my intention.  I was raising a point about a convention which I thought was a rule and if that convention was reintroduced, there would have better debates in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Mulcahy's request for a debate on tourism: this is an important and opportune time for such a discussion.  The Leader will be aware that a recent study indicated not the same development in the number of tourists visiting the west coast as those visiting the east coast and that there is a need to correct that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn outright the fish kills which have devastated the start of the salmon and trout fishing season.  Their impact on people visiting Ireland is enormous and, apart from the damage to the fisheries, there has been damage to one of Ireland's major tourist attractions. <Col N="9" /> Will the Leader impress upon the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the desirability of expediting the control of farm pollution scheme?  A number of applications are awaiting approval and farmers are willing to undertake the serious work that needs to be done.  Incidentally, people other than farmers are responsible for some of the pollution incidents.  A week ago the Minister of State made an appeal with regard to the damage to fisheries arising from pollution and it seems it is going unheard.  Will the Leader impress on the Minister the need to get his officials to make a special effort to identify the source of the problem?  Something serious should be done about this because if these conditions continue, more fish kills are likely and they will have a devastating effect on fisheries and tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader inquire from the Department of Finance whether Mr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien accepts his ministerial pension for his time in Dáil Éireann, as he is now a United Kingdom Unionist?  If so, is it the only thing Irish that he accepts?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The question may not arise but it is an intriguing one which has all of us wondering.  Will the Leader organise a debate on the development of sport?  Like the Leader, I am not one of the great sportsmen of the House but it strikes me that there is a need to dedicate some time to the development of sport, and particularly investment in sport.  Three issues require attention at present in this regard.  The first relates to the funding of swimming pools. There is destructive debate in my constituency on this issue and insufficient funds are being diverted into this area from the national lottery.  The second issue is the relationship between sports development and tourism, and I will mention just two events: one is the equestrian championships at Punchestown, <Col N="10" /> which have been on, off and back on again, and I welcome the fact that it seems to be back on; another is the possibility of the <i>Tour de France</i> starting in Ireland in 1998 to commemorate 200 years of true republicanism, a matter to which I want to alert the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I support other Senators in their concern about the higher mathematics paper in last week's leaving certificate examination.  Many young people were wondering about the fact that there were 184 degrees in an isosceles triangle. The children who attempted to do that question should be compensated. The testing of examination questions needs to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for being my warm up man. Senator Wright asked a number of specific and general questions.  Second Stage of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) (No. 2) Bill, 1996, will be taken in this House on 2 July and I hope Committee Stage will be taken after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fitzgerald knows, the Houses work independently of each other.  We would not dream of telling it how to run its business, <Col N="11" /> although it could probably learn something from this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright asked about the divorce Bill.  I understand it will be published shortly and that Second Stage will be taken in the Dáil before it rises.  It will be discussed during the summer by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and it will come before this House early in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright also asked about the schedule of business we hope to complete between now and the end of the session.  An Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill, 1996, will be completed next week. The Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Bill, 1996, will be introduced next week; it is currently in the Dáil.  Second Stage of the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, has been completed here.  Because of the great interest shown by a number of Members in the Adelaide Hospital Bill, the Government has agreed to introduce it in this House on Friday, 28 June. The tourism motion will also be taken. The Metrology Bill, 1996, is currently in the Dáil but it will come here after that. The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, will also be taken here.  The Financial Services (Borrowing Powers of Certain Bodies) Bill will be taken here.</P>

      <P>The Civil Liability Bill is a Seanad Bill and will be introduced here.  I hope the House will rise not later than 12 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned restraint at Orange parades, which would be helpful in the coming months.  I am sure that message will be sent to everyone. Senator Dardis asked if we should have statements on Northern Ireland.  We probably should have a debate because important things need to be said and certain questions must be answered. Most people here doubt Sinn Féin's credibility in terms of what it says and its bona fides.  There is also a desire to <Col N="12" /> rise above the difficulties and to continue the peace process.  I will try to organise a debate in the near future.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the farmyard pollution scheme.  That matter could be raised on the Adjournment. However, if Senators want a longer debate, we could arrange to discuss it with the fish kills, which were raised by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>School transport is a specific issue and it would be more appropriate to raise it on the Adjournment, at least in the first instance, given the level of work we have to do between now and the end of the session.  If Senator McDonagh repeats his question tomorrow morning I will have information for him on the regional education boards legislation.  I said there will be a debate on tourism as well between now and the end of the session.</P>
    <P>As regards the question raised by Senator Ormonde and others and the 184 degrees isosceles triangle, I can only speculate that it was a warm day; the triangle probably expanded with the heat. The Minister gave a very full reply last night on the Adjournment in the other House and in light of further information it would be useful to pursue it in that way in this House.  Perhaps there could be an Adjournment debate on that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee raised the question of university legislation.  My understanding is that the legislation will be published either at the end of this month or early next month and will be taken early next session.  I am endeavouring to have it published as Seanad legislation but I do not have a guarantee on that yet. Senator Farrell was on very dangerous ground.  Is he saying that because a person is a unionist he is less than fully Irish or that he should be penalised in some way?  His intervention was not particularly helpful.  It also raises issues which it might not be wise in the current climate to discuss too deeply.  His comments were very far from the Wolfe Tone concept of Irishmen embracing all political views.  Senator Roche raised <Col N="13" /> the question of a debate on sports and I am open to that.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995, amends certain provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and introduces a number of new provisions.  The Bill incorporates a number of mainly technical amendments proposed by the Pensions Board on foot of practical problems that arose in the application of the provisions of the Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995, was published last December and the plan was to leave the Bill in the public domain for a reasonable time so that full consideration and consultation could take place.  The debate and consideration of the Bill was a comprehensive one and a number of amendments were made as the Bill progressed through the Dáil, which I believe further strengthen the provisions in the Pensions Act.  I see this Bill, when enacted, as being the completion of a cycle that began in 1990 when the Pensions Act was originally introduced in the Dáil.  At the time of introducing the 1990 Pensions Bill the then Minister said that the Bill was the most important legislation concerning occupational pensions to come before the Houses since the foundation of the State.  Events in other jurisdictions since <Col N="14" /> that time confirm very much the wisdom and foresight in bringing in the Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Pensions Act, 1990, is to regulate occupational pension schemes, ensure that they are properly administered and that, above all, the pension rights of members and their dependants are and continue to be adequately safeguarded.  Both the Pensions Act and the amendments now being proposed have this objective in mind.  The protections for members are achieved by setting down minimum standards in key areas and by creating a framework for the regulation and supervision of schemes.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for minimum preserved benefits for members who leave a pension scheme, for example, on changing employment, the introduction of a minimum funding standard for certain funded schemes, the mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members along with requirements for periodic actuarial valuations, annual reports and audited accounts, equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes and the establishment of a statutory body called An Bord Pinsean, the Pensions Board, to monitor and supervise the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>At present, the board is comprised of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members. This Bill will extend the ordinary membership from 12 to 14 and I will explain the reasons for this when I outline the specific provisions contained in the Bill. The board includes representatives of trade unions, employers, Government and the various professional groups involved with occupational pensions. The board has a chief executive and other staff to manage its affairs.  The administrative expenses of the board are financed by fees payable annually by pension schemes.</P>
    <P>All pension schemes must register with the Pensions Board.  At the end of April 1996 over 60,000 occupational pension schemes were registered with the board, covering almost hall a million people.  The board can act on behalf of <Col N="15" /> any member of an occupational pension scheme who is concerned about the failure of those responsible for administering a scheme to adequately protect his or her pension rights.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board has the power to carry out investigations into the operation of pension schemes.  It also has the power to prosecute people responsible for contraventions of the rules set out in the Pensions Act or for false or misleading statements in any document required by the Act.  The board may, if it considers it necessary, request the High Court to remove the trustees of a scheme.  The powers of the board are being expanded and again I will detail these changes when I deal with the specific provisions contained in the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board has proved its effectiveness over the first five years of its existence and I have no doubt that it will play a continuing and important role in ensuring that the occupational pensions of individual members are safeguarded.  As Members will be aware, the first board completed its term of office the week after this Bill was published last December.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the board's first chairperson, Mary Broughan, as well as the members and staff of the board for their hard work over the past five years, which has helped to ensure that the provisions of the Act have been successful, and also for assisting the Minister for Social Welfare in formulating the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, were in line with best international practice and, indeed, ahead of the practice in many other countries. That Act placed Ireland to the forefront internationally in relation to the regulation of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The pensions industry is of major importance to the economy.  The total asset value of pension funds is estimated to be in the region of £16 billion, equivalent to almost 50 per cent of GNP. When you consider the magnitude of <Col N="16" /> this figure you realise the economic and social significance of these funds, the importance of them being fully safeguarded and the contribution to investment that they make.</P>
    <P>In recent months my colleague the Minister for Finance has had discussions on this subject with the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Irish Association of Investment Managers. Arising from these discussions the three parties have agreed that a new study should be undertaken on the scope for increasing pension fund investment in the economy.  The aim of the study is to identify commercially viable investment opportunities in the domestic economy and the potential for increasing the participation of Irish pension funds in financing such opportunities.</P>
    <P>The study is also examining whether there are gaps in capital markets in terms of meeting economic needs for long-term finance and, if so, what mechanisms or instruments can be developed to iron out such imbalances.  In carrying out the study the consultants, of course, have full regard to the commercial and fiduciary responsibilities of pension fund trustees.  This study is, I understand, at an advanced stage.  The final report of the National Pension Board. &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;, among other things reported on the aging of the Irish population and the problems that will present.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in the recent past the Minister for Social Welfare has drawn attention to demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time, the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall.  This would result, in the absence of any policy change, in the increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and raise serious questions about the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this issue at present. One aspect which needs to be examined further in this regard is the effect of real long-term growth in the economy.  If this is maintained, it should increase the resources available to pay for pensions in the future, although there will be many competing claims for any resources freed up as a result of this growth.  The Minister hopes to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the NPB report in next year's budget.  The question, for example, of the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions falls to be considered in the context of this report and, of course, taking account of the overall future funding of pensions.</P>
    <P>A major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board and a report will be available later this year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up to date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated frequently in recent times that demands to abolish or significantly reduce contributions to the social insurance fund are short-sighted, given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the years ahead.  In this regard we must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the social insurance system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the aging of the population.  It should be stressed that there is no danger to anyone's current pension entitlement.  However, as I pointed out earlier, demographic and <Col N="18" /> labour market changes are issues which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided that over the next few years we face up to the needs which we know will arise because of these changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>
    <P>A subcommittee of the Pensions Board was set up and undertook a major review of the Pensions Act with a view to recommending the necessary changes to complete the cycle that began with the introduction of the Pensions Act in 1990.  Both the Department and the Pensions Board were well aware that teething problems were likely to arise with the Act.  However, after a period of five years it is now considered desirable, if not essential, that a period of certainty should ensue.  Accordingly, this Bill results from a comprehensive review of the legislation with a view to making the necessary amendments so that no further amendments will be necessary in the short term.  As was indicated in the Dáil, this may not be entirely possible in the area of equal treatment where clarification of a number of European Court cases and directives on equal treatment as regards pensions are being considered and may necessitate further changes in our pensions legislation.  These matters will be considered in conjunction with the Pensions Board in due course and, if necessary, amendments will be made through a future Pensions (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>Overall this Bill reinforces the safeguards already in place in relation to occupational pensions and it is my hope and belief that it will strengthen the certainty that when individual members of schemes come to retirement age their pension will be waiting safely for them to ensure their continued prosperity in retirement.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly go through the provisions in each section of the Bill. Section 1 simply defines the Pensions Act, 1990, as being the Principal Act. Section 2 provides for certain definitions to be amended or inserted.  Section 3 corrects an anomaly that exists by expanding the grounds for the defence <Col N="19" /> of a person being prosecuted for an offence under the Pensions Act or its regulations.  This will particularly benefit trustees of schemes provided, of course, they act in an honest and honourable fashion.  This section also extends to two years, from the date of an offence, the time within which a summary prosecution can be brought.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a new section inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil.  This provides for the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, to make regulations specifying guidelines for the purposes of section 12 of the Family Law Act, 1995, which deals with pension adjustment orders in cases of judicial separation.  It sets out in some detail the matters the Minister must take into account in making these regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the power of the Pensions Board to enable it to provide guidelines or guidance notes on the operation of the Pensions Act generally as, at present, its powers only allow them to issue guidelines on the duties and responsibilities of trustees.  An amendment made on Committee Stage in the Dáil also gives the board power to issue guidelines or guidance notes on the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995, relating to pension schemes as defined in that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 strengthens the powers of the Pensions Board in carrying out investigations.  It particularly authorises that a person other than an employee of the board can carry out such an investigation. This person would, of course, have to be authorised by the board to act on its behalf.</P>
    <P>Section 7 extends confidentiality and prohibition on disclosing information to those persons serving on committees of the Pensions Board; they had been inadvertently omitted from these provisions. Section 8 clarifies procedures in relation to the determination of disputes by the Pensions Board.  Oral hearing regulations will be brought forward when this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> Sections 9 and 10 are technical amendments.  Section 9 clarifies the situation in relation to calculating preserved benefits in specific instances. Section 10 deals with an anomaly in relation to a situation that could arise, where a person could receive a refund of his or her contributions without terminating his or her employment and then qualify for a preserved benefit as well if they subsequently left employment.</P>
    <P>Section 11 was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil and provides added clarity in relation to revaluation of a preserved benefit in the light of the amendments being proposed to the Second Schedule &mdash; section 41 refers.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a technical amendment which clarifies the position of a death benefit in the calculation of a transfer payment where a preserved benefit is involved.  It also clarifies certain matters in relation to the transfer of preserved benefits.</P>
    <P>Section 13 allows that forfeiture of a preserved benefit may occur, at the discretion of the trustees, where a member assigns or charges his preserved benefit and where in the circumstances it would be to the benefit and advantage of the member to have this forfeiture of his preserved benefit take place.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is a technical amendment which allows regulations to specify how a preserved benefit should be calculated where, within a particular scheme, a member's benefits are calculated partially on a defined benefit basis and partially on a defined contribution basis.</P>
    <P>Section 15 allows for the payment of a preserved benefit later than normal pensionable age, but only where the member requests it to happen.  Section 16 gives the Pensions Board an option, in certain circumstances, to modify the provisions in relation to the production and submission of an actuarial funding certificate.  This would be where it would be in the best interests of the members of the scheme to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 17 clarifies the priorities in relation to the winding up of a scheme. Section 18 defines the employer for the purposes of submitting a funding protown <Col N="21" /> posal under section 49 of the Act, including circumstances where a number of employers may be involved.  In addition, it provides that such a funding certificate should also be signed by the trustees of the scheme as they may have a direct responsibility over some matters contained in the funding proposal. At present they are not obliged to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that where the Pensions Board, under section 50, directs trustees to reduce the benefits in a scheme, where the trustees have failed to submit an actuarial funding certificate or a funding proposal, the trustees must take the necessary measures to carry out the direction.  It also provides that such a direction made by the board shall override any other provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the trustees of a scheme must disclose information on that scheme to the Pensions Board. At present, the board is not listed among the parties to which the trustees must disclose information.  This provision was slightly amended in the Dáil to provide that such information need only be sent to the board where the board requests it in writing.  Otherwise there would be a danger that the board would be deluged with annual reports and information.  This will allow the board to be selective in asking for information, both in specific schemes and on a random basis, to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows that an annual report of a scheme can be prepared for a period of up to 23 months.  However, this may only be done in certain clearly defined circumstances and then only with the approval of the Pensions Board.  Section 22 clarifies some matters in relation to audited accounts and actuarial valuations.</P>
    <P>Section 23 allows trustees to meet the costs of appropriate trustee training from the resources of the scheme.  This was discussed in some detail in the Dáil and, in response to the genuine concerns of some Deputies, the original section was amended by the addition of <Col N="22" /> the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;costs and expenses&rdquo;, which would deal with the possibility that a trustee might think that it was suitable that trustee training take place in Barbados or such other exotic location.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is a new section inserted at Committee Stage in the Dáil and is a technical amendment in relation to certain schemes which are registered as perpetual funds.  Section 61 of the Pensions Act provides that certain provisions of the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933, shall not apply to pension schemes.  However, some schemes have provisions in their rules which have the same effect as those contained in the 1933 Act &mdash; particularly section 7, which deals with retrospective amendments.  This insertion into section 61 of the 1990 Act seeks to put the validity of any amendments to the rules of such schemes beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the rule against perpetuities which requires that trusts cannot continue beyond the lives in being on the commencement of the trust plus a further period of 21 years.  It is considered reasonable that this should not apply to trusts that govern pension schemes.  The employer and the trustees will often intend that the pension scheme should continue indefinitely or, at least, while the employer remains in business.  This section will allow this to happen.  Again, a further technical change was made in the Dáil to this section which was simply a clarification without changing the intent or meaning of the original provision.</P>
    <P>Section 26 clarifies the conditions under which the board may seek, from the High Court, the removal and replacement of trustees.  Section 27 allows the board to apply to the High Court for an order suspending a trustee or trustees.  It sets out what the order may contain, including the appointment of a replacement trustee and the transferring of the assets into the names of the new trustees.  It also sets out penalties for a person who might continue to act as a trustee while he or she is suspended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> Section 28 streamlines the procedures for the board to appoint trustees where there are none or the existing trustees cannot be located.  Section 29 makes minor amendments in definitions dealing with equal treatment.  This limits jurisdiction to employment &ldquo;within the State&rdquo; as otherwise it could be implied that the Pensions Act has powers outside the State which is not the case. Section 30 was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil and inserts the word &ldquo;objectively&rdquo; before &ldquo;justifiable&rdquo; to bring the wording into line with European Court judgments in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 31 clarifies the provisions which deal with differences in pension rules prior to the date of the European Court of Justice judgment of 17 May 1990 in the Barber case.  This was again amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to deal with a possible anomaly that could arise in relation to schemes which changed their rules to provide for equality between 17 May 1990 &mdash; the date of the Barber judgment &mdash; and the 1 January 1993, when Part VII of the Pensions Act which deals with equal treatment was brought into effect.</P>
    <P>Sections 32 to 36 provide for equal treatment to apply to collective agreements, regulation orders, registered employment agreements and contracts of employment.  They also provide for some consequential amendments.  Some of the sections in question were amended in the Dáil to deal with the possible anomaly outlined in relation to section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides that an employee who liaises with the Pensions Board is protected against unfair dismissal provided that he or she acted in good faith. Section 38 makes it mandatory for certain persons to make a written report to the Pensions Board of any material misappropriation or fraudulent conversion of the resources of a scheme where they have reasonable cause to believe that this is happening.  The persons covered by the section are the auditor, actuary or trustee of the scheme, any insurance intermediary or investment business <Col N="24" /> firm which has advised on the scheme or has received any payment in relation to any investment on behalf of the scheme, a person who has prepared an annual report of the scheme under section 55 of the Pensions Act and a person who carries out any of the duties of the trustees of the scheme under section 59.  This section provides protection to persons who make such reports. It covers not only mandatory reports but also voluntary reports made in good faith to the Pensions Board.  It also makes it an offence for a person knowingly to make a false report to the board.  There is also provision that any report published in relation to this section will be privileged.</P>
    <P>The wording in the Bill as published caused certain concern, particularly the use of the term &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo;. After considerable discussion and consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the Pensions Board and the pensions industry, the section was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to replace the words &ldquo;is being contemplated&rdquo; with &ldquo;is to be attempted&rdquo;.  Other amendments to clarify definitions and to clarify the matter of privilege in relation to such reporting were introduced.  I am now satisfied this section will provide another step forward in protecting the pensions of the individual members of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 39 deals with applications to the High Court by the Pensions Board to seek orders to have an employer pay arrears of contributions and for the restoration of resources of the scheme where they had been wrongfully paid or transferred to any person and such payment or transfer is likely to jeopardise the rights and interests of the members. The court may also make an order directing trustees to dispose of an investment where it is satisfied that the retention of the asset could again jeopardise the rights and interests of the members.  The section deals with injunctions where a person could be prohibited from any misuse or misappropriation of any of the resources of the <Col N="25" /> scheme and also provides that, following an application by the board, the court may grant an injunction prohibiting an investment or freezing the scheme assets pending the outcome of an investigation by the board.</P>
    <P>Section 40 clarifies the situation in the event of the chairperson of the board having to be replaced, for example, if he or she died or resigned.  This section also provides for the expansion of the membership of the board to include two new ordinary members.  This will increase the membership from 12 to 14 ordinary members.  One of the new members will be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and one by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and each has to be a trustee of a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Trustees are the main custodians of pension schemes.  This new provision will ensure trustee representation on the board, which is considered to be desirable. Up to the present, there has been no one specifically representing the concerns of trustees.  This provision will add a further dimension to the board and will give it a wider representation.  This is especially important since the advent of statutory member trusteeship.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Bill in the Dáil the Opposition spokesperson put forward an amendment to provide for three new members of the board &mdash; one from the investment management industry, one a pensioner trustee and one from the Consumer's Association of Ireland.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, indicated during that debate, it is considered that the composition of the present board, particularly when the two new trustee members are added after the enactment of this Bill, will ensure that the interests of all areas of the member and the industry are adequately represented by the composition of the present board.</P>
    <P>Section 41 is a technical amendment which provides for the elimination of anomalies in relation to the calculation and revaluation of preserved benefits under the Second Schedule to the Pensions <Col N="26" /> Act.  On Report Stage in the Dáil this was extended to deal with an anomaly that came to light in relation to the revaluation of preserved benefit.  The principle underlying section 33(2) of the Pensions Act, which deals with this area, is that there should be revaluation of preserved benefit where there is a period of at least one year between the date of leaving service and the date of commencement of pension.  The anomaly, which this amendment seeks to correct, is that because revaluation is calculated by reference to complete calendar years, it is possible that a period of more than 12 months may elapse between the date of leaving service and the date of commencement of pension but the member may not qualify for revaluation because the period does not include a calendar year.  We now seek to ensure that the maximum period is now included for revaluation purposes by amending the calculation formula.</P>
    <P>Section 42 deals with practical difficulties in relation to actuarial funding certificates under the Third Schedule to the Pensions Act.  Section 43 increases summary fines from £1,000 to £1,500. Section 44 provides for fines where a person has been convicted of an offence and continues to contravene the provision concerned.  Sections 45 and 46 deal with the saving of instruments and give the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues where the possibility of future legislation may arise for consideration.  In this regard a few issues that spring to mind include the possibility of a compensation fund; the need for a pensions ombudsman; the extension of preservation to pre-1991 service; the accrued rights of people who remain in the scheme as opposed to those who leave the scheme; the encouragement of the extension of pension coverage to part-time and atypical workers and the treatment of surpluses.  In the Dáil Deputy Joe Walsh raised the issue of surpluses and the Pensions Board will be asked to report to the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the many issues that face the new Pensions Board <Col N="27" /> and which it will consider in detail over the next five years.  The Minister looks forward to their deliberations, reports and recommendations during that period. This Bill seeks to update the legislative provisions in place and to introduce some new provisions to ensure the continued safeguarding of individuals' entitlements in relation to their occupational pension schemes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in employment practices over the last 15 years has made it necessary to have proper legislation in place to guarantee the rights of people who have paid into pensions and to make the arrangements more flexible for those who change employment frequently. Up until ten or 15 years ago people had jobs for life; they paid into pension funds and at the end of their employment a pension was available to them.  However, with changing work practices, people retiring earlier and people taking more than one employment during their working life, it is important to have legislation to safeguard people who have paid into pensions.</P>
      <P>The number of people who will be dependent on State and occupational pensions in the future is alarming.  A recent statement from the Minister highlighted this issue which is of concern to many.  Old people do not demand much &mdash; they want to live out their final years in decency and dignity. It is imperative that we ensure legislation is in place and the resources are available to ensure pensions will be provided.</P>
      <P>Demographic changes will have to be taken into account.  It must be realised that in years to come a huge burden will be placed on the State.  Statistics from the Central Statistics Office indicate that by the year 2035 the number of people dependent on State pensions will have increased by 100 per cent.  We have to plan for that eventuality and to encourage people to take out occupational pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> There seems to be a lack of urgency among young people to get involved with occupational pensions.  They see the age of 65 as being very far away and they are not inclined to avail of pension schemes.  The message should go out that occupational pensions are important and people should take them up at an early age.  There are tax incentives but the philosophy of youth does not encourage long-term planning. Social and employment pressures incline young people to &ldquo;short termism&rdquo;. An advertising campaign might be run to encourage young people, and perhaps it should be made more tax friendly, to become involved in occupational pensions at an early age.</P>
    <P>The demographic changes in the future will make it difficult for the State to cater for everybody.  In the next century almost a quarter of the population will be over 60 years of age and there will be a reduction in the ratio of active young people to old people from 5:1 to 3:1.  This puts a great burden on those generating the revenue to pay for pensions. What provisions are there to ensure that pensions are not in jeopardy? What will happen in 30 years? This issue should be discussed in a calm manner because when it is pointed out that there will be great pressure on revenue to provide pensions it can send out panic signals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that the Pensions Board would be setting up a committee to report on the investment of pension funds in the State.  It is an investment opportunity that has not been harnessed.  There are about £16 billion in pension fund assets which could be used to provide capital and equity for investment and job creation. I understand the opportunities for guaranteed investments are limited given the size of the population and the economy.  However, this matter should be researched and encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Dáil amendments with regard to the membership of the board were made with a view to encouraging the investment of pension fund assets in this country to create jobs or purchase <Col N="29" /> stakes in semi-State bodies which may be sold.  Irish pensions funds have been invested in other countries.  Investment by Irish pensions funds in the Irish economy must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>What changes or advances will this Bill make for women and their pension arrangements?  Where the breadwinner in a family is a man and he is paying into a pension, what will be the position of the woman in the event of a divorce? There may be anomalies which will leave women vulnerable.  Women do not always have pensions and if they become separated they may find themselves dependent on a State pension with a delay before they can avail of it.</P>
    <P>There exist specific problems with regard to social welfare pensions for the self-employed, particularly those who have made less than ten years' PRSI contributions; they may not qualify for contributory old age pensions.  This anomaly has not been addressed satisfactorily. Self-employed people have been encouraged to pay PRSI contributions and it now appears that many of them will not qualify for a pension because they have paid less than ten years' contributions. This difficulty sends out the wrong signal that those who pay for pensions do not necessarily receive the benefits.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address this matter in the near future.  We have raised it on many occasions.  We understand how the problem arose but it must be resolved.  I ask the Minister to respond to the lack of understanding on the part of the Department for self-employed people who paid their contributions and wish to receive a contributory pension.  That matter should be resolved immediately.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board and this legislation have important parts to play.  The Pensions Act, 1990, was probably revolutionary legislation in its time.  It consolidated the pensions area and provisions for old age.  However, many people did not even realise it was discussed in the Dáil and the Seanad in 1990.  Today we are again discussing legislation which will affect a large number <Col N="30" /> of people, but for young people particularly pensions seem to be in the distance.</P>
    <P>We should ensure &mdash; be it through financial incentives or advertising campaigns &mdash; that young people realise that at some stage in the future they will be dependent on a pension.  The State pensions are not adequate and we need other pensions to ensure we can live with dignity and security in our later days.  This is an issue of which I am conscious, probably because of my age and the fact that I speak to many working people who are not looking to the long term or using the disposable income available to them to invest in pensions. They are probably availing of more social activities and not looking at concrete long-term planning.  This issue should be discussed and highlighted. The Central Statistics Office and the Pensions Board are probably aware that in time these are the people who will be dependent on State pensions.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that this is basically a technical Bill.  It gives the Pensions Board more powers to investigate pension trust funds and that must be welcome.  We need only look across the water at the Maxwell case which highlights the underlying fears that pensions may be evaporated or the funding diverted to some other activity so that when a person retires, their pension is not available.  This legislation ensures that the board has the power to investigate any wrongdoing or misappropriation of funds and in that regard it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends important legislation which was passed in 1990 and it can only be for the better.  However, the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare will have to send out the right vibes to people on old age pensions because they fear about a lack of funding to guarantee State pensions.  It is important that we get the message across that their pensions are safe and that people further down the age profile should avail of occupational pensions to avoid putting pressure on the State in years to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I will table amendments on Committee Stage for the reasons outlined by my colleague in the Dáil and by myself today.  The legislation is timely and welcome. The powers available to the board will ensure that pensions and the pension funds will be there for people when they require them in their later years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure. The Minister covered the various aspects of this legislation in his comprehensive introduction.  He also summarised the main provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990.  It is a useful indication of how legislation and the Oireachtas work that, having passed the Pensions Act in 1990 and reviewed its operation &mdash; it was substantial and relatively new legislation at the time &mdash; we are back here today dealing with an amending Bill which sets out to rectify shortcomings which emerged in the operation of the 1990 legislation.  That is a welcome development.  It is an indication that the Minister, his Department and the Oireachtas are keeping a close eye on how legislation affects the livelihood, welfare and future of our citizens; that of course is our primary obligation.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister and Senator Kelleher indicated this is a technical Bill and it is more suited to Committee Stage debate.  I understand Senator Kelleher will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  More than three-quarters of the 46 sections are amendments to the Principal Act and less than one-quarter represent a new input.  We are improving what is already there.  I have no difficulty with the legislation as presented and I am happy to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that if amendments are tabled and discussed in detail, verification and information will be required but we can deal with that when we come to it.  I compliment the Minister and his Department on the time allowed to the public and ourselves to assess the contents of the legislation.  It is almost six months since this first emerged and that <Col N="32" /> is a reasonable period to provide the public and the legislators with the opportunity to consider its implications. Despite the fact that the 1990 Act required this measure to put it right, that Act and events which flowed from it have shown quite clearly that it was valuable legislation which safeguarded the regulation and supervision of pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The Pensions Board includes representatives of various interests, including the unions, the employers, the Government and the professional bodies. The Minister is extending the number on the board from 12 to 14 and the nominees for these two additional places are to come from ICTU and IBEC.  I have no problem with that; it is a welcome development.  The Minister said that many of the amendments in this legislation were advanced and recommended by the Pensions Board itself.  There is no doubt it was done in the light of its experience as it operated the original legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendments were accepted by the Dáil.  I wish to repeat something I said here two weeks ago.  I welcome what I perceive as a new openness on the part of Ministers to accept changes and amendments to legislation.  I recall times when Ministers produced legislation as if it was cast in tablets of stone.  There was no inclination, willingness or desire to accept amendments, however well argued or however sound the reasoning behind them.  I am glad that day has passed and that Ministers are objective, open minded and fair enough in their approach to accept a constructive and reasoned argument when it is made.  I compliment the Minister and his colleagues. If amendments are tabled or if difficulties are found with any aspect of the legislation.  I am sure the Minister will be willing to consider reasonable, rational and objective arguments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there are about 60,000 occupational pension schemes registered with the Pensions Board and that they cover over 500,00 million people.  This is an enormous operation which, given its size, needs to be properly <Col N="33" /> supervised, regulated and controlled. The powers this legislation will give to the board are necessary and desirable.  The Minister mentioned the size of an industry &mdash; I use that word in the broadest sense &mdash; which is valued at £16 billion, equivalent to 50 per cent of the gross national product, and its value to the economy.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Kelleher's comment about moneys tied up in pension funds and their value if invested in the economy.  We should ensure the greatest share of these funds finds a home in our economy.  The value of that investment in terms of the creation of jobs and prosperity would be enormous.  I share Senator Kelleher's sentiments that a sufficient proportion of pension funds have not been invested in our economy to date.  I support his call to increase that level using whatever methods are available.</P>
    <P>Another point alluded to by the Minister and Senator Kelleher was the age structure of our population and the problems and effects likely to arise from that in the early part of the next century. This is a matter which has been receiving attention recently.  It is important to plan to avoid difficulties in the future. The Minister spoke about future issues and he was again looking into the vista before us and recognising the need to seriously address the situation.  The Bill ensures the security of those already in pension schemes.  There is no greater fear for a person approaching retirement age than to doubt that their full or their planned pension may not be available.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this is a technical Committee Stage Bill and I do not want to go into detail on the sections. However, some sections are welcome and deserve to be highlighted.  I particularly welcome section 20 which relates to the obligation to disclose information. Under the legislation trustees will have to disclose information to the Pensions Board; this is an essential obligation which was omitted until now. Sections 26, 27 and 28 strengthen the <Col N="34" /> control of the Pensions Board in relation to trustees in terms of their activities, their control and their removal and replacement.</P>
    <P>The only other section to which I want to refer is section 38 which deals with the mandatory reporting of activities of trustees or pension funds which could damage the investors who depend on these funds to provide them with security in their old age.  Section 38 identifies the person or persons on whom obligations and a legal requirement will be placed to report activities which could damage the operation of the funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to future issues which must be addressed.  I welcome this Bill and I know the Minister will be willing to look at aspects of it if a rational argument is made.  By and large, I am satisfied with this legislation as a measure which will improve on an Act that has proved satisfactory and which will provide a safeguard to those involved in occupational pension schemes.  I support the Bill which I hope will have a rapid passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, I welcome the Bill which is a follow on from the Pensions Act, 1990.  It contains many sections which are mainly technical and will meet the requirements considered necessary at this time.  I would like to highlight the value of the Pensions Act, 1990, which was forward looking.  It brought together many aspects of pension funds and their regulation.  This legislation is brings matters up to date, which is appropriate and necessary.  I have no doubt another Bill will be introduced in the future.  Due to EU regulations and directives, the situation as regards pensions keeps changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pension business is a major financial cog in the economy.  The Minister mentioned the figure of £16 billion, which is a massive amount of money, and it is important Governments ensure we use it to the benefit of the economy. I compliment the Minister on the initiative taken at a recent meeting where the <Col N="35" /> overall picture as regards pension funds was discussed.  Opportunities to tap into that massive resource were discussed and how it could be used to the benefit of the nation and the people.  The Minister will have everyone's support because we have a sound economy and it is important to avail of opportunities to get pension funds to invest here as this will have a knock on effect.</P>
    <P>This Bill will further regulate pension funds.  Apart from the economic aspect &mdash; this has been mentioned already &mdash; we must also look at our responsibilities as a nation to our ageing population in the next few decades.  Now is the time for us to identify ways of dealing with that matter and to put in place the necessary structures and investment so we can meet that obligation when it arises.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider having further representation from other bodies on the Pension Board.  The Minister has agreed to extend the membership of the board from ten to 12 people by adding a representative from IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A number of other bodies should also be considered for a position on the board. The Consumers Association of Ireland and the pensioners should be represented. Would it not also be appropriate to have a representative from the self-employed groups?  This would cover groups like the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Law Society, the farming organisations, etc.  Their points of view should be put forward and that representative could have a say on this matter. While technical backup is always important, we should have the views of these groups on the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill should also have considered making a provision in law for a pensions ombudsman.  We have ombudsmen who deal with different issues, disputes and evaluations in other areas and it would be appropriate and timely to appoint a pensions ombudsman.  I ask the Minister to consider my points.  A pensions ombudsman would give great balance <Col N="36" /> and public confidence to deal with situations as they arose.  Ombudsmen have proved successful in other areas and providing for one in this Bill would be a good move.</P>
    <P>Two pension schemes recently brought on stream were bum deals for some of our people.  One was the inclusion of the self-employed to the PRSI scheme in 1988.  Some 30,000 people who paid into that fund since 1988 will not qualify for a contributory State pension and they will only get 53 per cent of their contributions back.  The State will hold onto the other 47 per cent in lieu of the provision it made for a survivors' pension, to which these people are entitled after paying three years' PRSI.  All these self-employed people have paid PRSI contributions since 1 April 1988 but any one of them over 56 years of age on or after that date will not qualify for a contributory State pension.  Surely this is not justice and fair play.  I ask the Minister to convey back to the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare the grave concern and annoyance among the public on this matter.</P>
    <P>Little change would be necessary to make these people qualify for the scheme.  One way would be to allow them to continue making their contributions to reach the ten year requirement &mdash; we are only talking about 30,000 people and it would not arise again &mdash; and they would then qualify for a contributory State pension.  We could also allow them to make up the ten years at 66 years of age.  These are two simple solutions to the problem.  Surely we could make that small accommodation to a person who has paid PRSI contributions towards his pension since 1988.  If we cannot do this, then they have been sold a bum deal.</P>
    <P>I also referred to people who were offered the farm retirement package &mdash; this is also a bum deal.  Under its terms, a farmer would qualify for a ten year pension if he handed his farm over to his son or daughter.  However, what was not explained was that if the spouse of that person reached pension age, they <Col N="37" /> would have to apply for the non-contributory old age pension and their EU pension would be discarded.  No other such situation applies in this country.  A person or his spouse could be getting £800 per month from the farm retirement scheme but that would be totally excluded when they are evaluated for a non-contributory old age pension.  Of course, they would be granted a full pension for themselves, their spouse and maybe a dependent child.  However, the next step would be to take this payment out of the farm retirement scheme.  This was not explained to the public when it came through the back door but it was implemented by the EU through the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Under the farm retirement scheme, the payments would continue if the farmer or his spouse died.  However, what happens if the person receiving the old age pension dies and there is no record of them getting the EU payment? The only explanation I received from the Department of Social Welfare was that the young person who got the farm must apply himself for the farm retirement scheme package.  That seems to be an extraordinary development following a EU scheme that was explained, promoted and sold with the full backing of the State in every little hall and community centre around the country.  Now we have a mass of bureaucracy to interfere with the scheme.  Who ever heard of somebody excluding a payment of £800 per month when you were compelled to apply for a non-contributory old age pension?  They did not want to apply.  Surely, that is another bum deal as far as the Irish people are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for what has happened on this because he is not responsible; perhaps, there is no Minister responsible.  The bureaucracy of Europe and our Department of Social Welfare has allowed those situations to develop.  The proper and thorough investigations that should take place when EU directives and EU funded schemes are brought in do not take place.  I have no doubt that we will <Col N="38" /> back here again in a couple of years with the same type of legislation to try to meet new and developing situations. The last two schemes have not been in the best interest of the Irish people. They are shown not to be what they were played up to be and what they were told they would be at that time.  I would ask the Minister of State to comment on what I have said.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is necessary and I am glad the Minister has brought it forward.  By and large, it is amending legislation of a technical nature to update, regularise and give more authority to pension boards.  There are a couple of good provisions, particularly the one where the board can hire outside assistance to come in and investigate matters.  It is important that they have that authority and that they can bring the best technical advice and assistance to deal with any matter they consider necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to further debate on Committee and Report Stages.  Perhaps accommodation can be made for some of the points that I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's preparation of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  This is a technical Bill and unlikely to be of great interest to the ordinary person in the street or to many Members of the Oireachtas. However, we as legislators have a particular responsibility when we are dealing with specialised legislation.  We cannot allow the content of these Bills to be in the exclusive control of specialists. The Members of the House must make the final decisions on all aspects of these Bills and must therefore attend to business, especially when the topics are relatively unfamiliar and specialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of pension regulation and the control and administration of pension systems is important.  We only have to see what happened in Britain with the unfortunate Maxwell pensioners. This matter is still <i>sub judice</i> in England and one should not say much about it. Those people who were persuaded to <Col N="39" /> change from public to private pensions allow us to see some of the abuses to which pension schemes are subject. Those who talk of the virtues of free unregulated markets should thread warily when they are dealing with pension schemes.  A lot of people could potentially be affected by what we do with this legislation.  A survey conducted in Ireland ten years ago found that two-thirds of all employees were members of an occupational pension scheme at their workplace and relied in many cases on such pensions to top up their State entitlements when they retired.  About one-third of self-employed have made private pension provision, thus we are dealing with a large and growing market here.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office predicts that the proportion of people aged 65 and over will only increase by a small percentage, between 1 and 2 per cent, in the next 15 years, but in the following 15 years the numbers over 65 will increase significantly, by between 5 and 6 per cent per year.  Thus, it is essential that our pension regulation system be proven and as clean as a whistle with the growth of the older population.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there will be an increasing trend towards early retirement, and some provisions in the Bill deal with specific problems in this area.  Appropriate pension regulation is also important in dealing with this.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in this Bill.  It may seem rather quaint in 1996 that equal treatment is not required in the application of all such legislation, but that is a commentary on how slow we have been in addressing such requirements despite our international obligations in this area.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with compulsory and voluntary reporting to the Pensions Board of material misappropriation or fraudulent conversion of the resources of pension schemes.  Under the provisions of this part, designated people in the pensions industry, <Col N="40" /> referred to in the Bill as relevant persons, would be obliged under law to bring to the attention of the board in writing the particulars of the misappropriation or conversion.  This is a vital aspect of the Bill.  I have checked with people in the pensions industry about what some of them see as a whistle blower's charter in this part of the Bill, but there is an industry consensus on the desirability of these provisions and the industry is represented on the Pensions Board.  That speaks well for the sense of responsibility of this industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the publication by the board of any report made to it under this part shall be privileged.  This matter is covered by section 85 of the Bill.  I am aware of the amount of time which people in the pensions industry and in the public service have devoted to the preparation of this legislation.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for the advances made in this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for strengthening the legislation governing this important area of Irish life.  It was the late Frank Cluskey who, as Parliamentary Secretary for Social Welfare, prepared a key Green Paper in the pensions field in the 1970's.  In those days it was considered an even more specialised subject than it is now, but the vision shown by people like Frank Cluskey in addressing these issues at that time is bearing fruit a quarter of a century later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a regulation under the social welfare code which is to come into force in July whereby people who are on occupational pensions but who are within £30 of the statutory pension will be eligible to get those additional benefits which people on statutory benefits have, such as free television licences and free phones.  This is not just an important practical measure but psychologically it cannot be underestimated how valuable any small benefit like this is to people because it makes them feel that they are of considerable worth within the community. I was extremely pleased when <Col N="41" /> free travel was introduced &mdash; it is a long time ago now.  There were people exulting in the fact that they would get free travel but who never used it at all or perhaps only occasionally to go on the bus.  These are small things for the State but can be extremely important for people.  There is a considerable number of people on small occupational pensions. I was extremely glad that the Government extended these benefits to people on occupational pensions.</P>
      <P>Elderly people are not being assessed too harshly for medical cards.  I do not get nearly as many complaints as I used to get years ago about people being cut off, particularly if they are on expensive medication.  There is a general realisation, for which I compliment those working on these areas, that it may be cost effective to try to allow people to manage their own lives as much as possible. When people are able to stay outside nursing homes or hospitals and manage their lives in their own homes, with just a little help from the State, it allows them to keep their independence. It is not only humane and the right thing to do but it is extraordinarily cost effective. I welcome this attitude in the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 Act was extremely important for women because it introduced equality between men and women in occupational pension schemes, which was the 15th recommendation of the 1972 Commission on the Status of Women.  That recommendation stated that where a woman is ineligible to enter an occupational pension scheme before a certain age or before she has a certain number of years service in employment, and where such a condition does not apply to a male employee, if the woman remains in the employment to pension age, her pensionable service should include the years during which she was precluded solely by reason of her sex from joining the pension scheme.  It also stated that the compulsory retirement age for women from an insurable employment should not be lower than the age at <Col N="42" /> which the social welfare retirement pension is payable.  Finally, it stated that the amount of the lump sum which a widow may receive under a pension scheme without compulsion to purchase an annuity should be substantially increased.  It was extremely important that these suggestions were taken into account in the framing of the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>I still get complaints from women because they had to leave employment for domestic reasons.  For example, if they must spend a certain amount of time at home rearing children or they must leave employment to care for elderly relatives when they themselves are near retirement age, the situation for some appears to be invidious and I am not sure whether this Bill addresses this matter.  Perhaps we can clarify that on Committee Stage.  Older people who must leave work to care for elderly relatives are in a worse position.  At least if a person leaves the workforce to look after small children, each year the child grows older.  A number of women in particular leave the workforce in their 40s or 50s to care for an elderly relative thinking it will be for three or six months but it ends up being for three, six or nine years and then they too are practically of pensionable age.  This is an area to which we must give careful attention because I have had complaints from women who have tried to buy back into schemes and not been in a position to make up their payments.</P>
    <P>I still get complaints from women who had to leave the workforce before the removal of the marriage bar.  One nearly hesitates to admit that one remembers those days because when I talked about them to younger women they thought it was hysterical that women had to leave the workforce when they got married.  It is important to remember that was the practice only about 20 years ago, so there are still women in the 40s and 50s who had to leave the workforce and are now trying to get back into employment.  There is this huge gap through no fault of their <Col N="43" /> own where they were not in a position to buy pension contributions.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator Kelleher said about the need to ensure women are treated equally.  When divorce legislation is introduced, some of the pensions legislation will have to be examined. However, with the framing of this Bill, I am sure that will not be too difficult. I congratulate the Department on its efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me prefix my comments on the Bill with a brief reference to a point made by Senator Henry. When people find that their small pensions are assessed in full for tax purposes some of them are very angry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it builds on the achievements of the Pensions Act, 1990, which ensured that the rights of pension scheme members and their dependants are properly safeguarded, and provided for mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members.  The Pensions Act, 1990, also established the Pensions Board and this Bill results largely from a review of that Act undertaken by a subcommittee of the board.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill are largely self-explanatory and the comprehensive explanation by the Minister on each section of the Bill was worthwhile.  The provisions are geared towards protecting the interest of pension scheme members and in this regard I particularly welcome section 38 which makes it mandatory for certain people to report in writing to the Pensions Board where they have good cause to suspect misappropriation or fraud.</P>
      <P>The whole area of pensions is a complex one which baffles many people.  For this reason it is vital that pension scheme members receive clear and accurate information regarding the pension they can expect at the age of 65. Such information must be presented in a manner which is easily understood by the ordinary citizen &mdash; few of us, after all, are financial experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I heard Senator Finneran correctly, he said that a couple receiving £800 per <Col N="44" /> month from the farm retirement scheme would be forced to apply for a non-contributory pension.  That is ridiculous and I look forward to hearing the position clarified.</P>
    <P>In recent months there have been demands from certain sectors to reduce or even abolish contributions to the social insurance fund.  Given the demographic and labour market trends which are likely to occur in the future, it is vital that we preserve and consolidate the social insurance system and its concept of social solidarity.  Any attempt to water down that concept in the name of a dog-eat-dog free market must be vigorously opposed.</P>
    <P>Pensions and the pensions industry do not simply affect the individual scheme member.  It is estimated that the total assets of pension funds amounts to about £16 billion, which is almost 50 per cent of Ireland's gross national product. For this reason I welcome the study currently being undertaken to identify ways in which this enormous financial power can be harnessed to the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, only the domestic economy which can benefit from the pensions industry.  The first obligation of pension fund trustees is obviously to maintain and enhance the value of their funds, and that goes without saying. Within that there may be considerable discretionary scope in the way funds are invested.  The concept of ethical investment is one which has gained currency in recent years.  Institutional investors have, for example, started turning away from companies which manufacture or trade in arms or which exploit the developing world and I would like to see that trend continue.  In the late 20th century both investors and consumers have enormous economic power.  It is up to us to decide how it will be used.  This Bill will help in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says we have made enormous strides in this area since 1990.  All self-employed people can now contribute to the pensions scheme so that when they <Col N="45" /> retire they will be able to claim a contributory pension.  I am worried that some self-employed people have decided to stay outside the net.  They will face difficulties in the future when they try to clear up this mess.  The objective was to ensure that everyone was entitled to a contributory pension on retirement.  The regulation of the occupational pension scheme has been excellent. The Government is making every effort to ensure that when people get old and retire from their work, they will not be dependent on anyone.</P>
      <P>People with small pieces of property are concerned that when they retire they will be means tested and, as a result, they will not have an adequate amount of money on which to live. Property is evaluated differently from the way it was done in the past.  When people apply for a medical card they are shocked that the means test is more stringent than it used to be and that it is not operated in a <i>laissez faire</i> manner as was previously the case.  Department officials must apply the regulations, but everybody should be treated fairly.</P>
      <P>We are making great strides in this area.  I compliment the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.  I hope it will pass through the House quickly and that it will be as successful as other similar legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate.  This Bill reinforces the safeguards already in place in relation to occupational pensions.  It will strengthen the certainty that when individual members of schemes reach retirement age, their pensions will be waiting for them to ensure their continued prosperity. I agree with Senators about the importance of pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelleher mentioned the mobility of workers.  The preservation provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, ensure that those who move from job to job will have their benefits preserved in each job until pension age.  As regards the ageing of the population, the House <Col N="46" /> should be aware that on a number of occasions the Minister for Social Welfare has drawn attention to the demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time, the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over the age of 65 is projected to fall.  This would result in the absence of any policy change on the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and of the social insurance fund and they require us to consider the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs.  Senator Sherlock raised this point.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this aspect at present.  One aspect which needs to be examined further in this regard is the effect of long-term economic growth.  If this is maintained, it should increase the resources available to pay for pensions in the future, although, as the House will appreciate, there will be many competing demands on those resources.</P>
    <P>The final report of the Pensions Board, <i>Developing A National Pensions System</i>, raised and considered these issues.  The report is being considered in the Department at present and the Minister intends to bring forward proposals based on its recommendations in next year's budget.  In this context, a major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended by the Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by the Department of Social Welfare and the Pensions Board and a report will be available before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Kelleher's concerns about young people and pensions. I agree with him that information in this <Col N="47" /> regard is vital.  The Pensions Board has set up a committee to look at information and the targeting of young people to encourage them to look at their pension needs at a young age.  This will be included in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Henry's points about a pension provision for women, especially those who are carers.  Our approach to caring and to the needs of carers is a major priority for the Minister for Social Welfare, which he is discussing with the pensions industry.  Both Senator Kelleher and Senator Henry referred to pensions in the context of divorce.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, is bringing forward legislation on divorce.  Pensions will be addressed in that Bill, which I am sure will be fully debated in the House.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the social welfare entitlements of self-employed people, particularly those who were over 56 in 1988.  To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people. Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for an old age contributory pension. They are covered for survivors' and orphans' pensions.  However, self-employed people in that age group who have been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to the age of 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The Pensions Board in its final report, <i>Developing A National Pensions System</i>, puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime. However, it also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 to 520 contributions. The report and its recommendations are being studied in the Department of Social Welfare at present.  While in principle, a <i>pro rata</i> pension approach is favoured, there are no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran alluded to the issue of equal treatment.  As I stated in my speech, clarification of a number of European Court cases and directives on equal treatment as regards pensions are being considered and the outcome of these may necessitate further changes in our pension legislation.  These matters will be considered in conjunction with the Pensions Board in due course and, if necessary, amendments will be made through a future Pensions (Amendment) Bill.  Senator Wall also raised the issue of equal treatment.  I wish to point out that the equal treatment provisions of the Pensions Act have been in place since 1993.  Current amendments introduced in this Bill are simply a clarification of existing provisions which provide for full equal treatment between men and women in occupational pension schemes since the date of the Barber judgment on 17 May 1990.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the necessity for a pensions ombudsman by Senator Finneran and others.  Other Senators also raised the important issue of information. I indicated that the issue of an ombudsman is one of the issues facing the new Pensions Board over its term of office and it is one of the areas it will be asked to report on.  On the issue of general information, information must <Col N="49" /> be made available to pension scheme members via both the annual report of the scheme and their requests to the trustees in regard to particular schemes under the disclosure provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>There may be a lack of knowledge among individual members about where to get information and this will need to be addressed.  In this regard the Pensions Board has set up a subcommittee on information.  One of the areas it is addressing is how to disseminate information so that members will be aware of the information available to them and how to get access to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made reference to extending the membership of the Pensions Board by including a member from the consumer association, a pensioner and a self-employed person.  Presumably these people would primarily represent pensioners.  This was considered in detail as a number of representations in this regard were received before the Bill was published.  It is considered that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions representative &mdash; there will be two after the enactment of this legislation &mdash; along with the three nominees of the Minister and the official from the Department of Social Welfare on the board will more than adequately serve the interests of all members of pension schemes, including pensioners.  Some of the current board members are self-employed and I am sure they will adequately express the views of self-employed people to the board while also serving the interests of all members of pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Issues raised by Senator Finneran in relation to the farm retirement scheme are proper to consideration by the Minister for Agriculture.  The Department of Social Welfare has taken a neutral approach to this package in that it does not assess this income in relation to a social welfare recipient over 66 years of age.  As I understand it, the complicated rules regarding the assessment for receipt of the farm retirement package are laid down by the EU.</P>
    <P>The Bill was published in midDecember <Col N="50" /> with the specific intention of allowing Members of the Oireachtas, those in the pensions industry generally and all contributors to and beneficiaries of occupational pension schemes sufficient time to examine its provisions. As has been indicated, it is all the more important to allow a reasonable time scale as the Bill is quite technical.  In this regard I wish to inform the House that there has been an ongoing discussion with the Pensions Board on this Bill.  In addition, the Department met all those who have made representations on the Bill.  I agree with both Senators Howard and Cotter that it is important that this time was given to allow full consideration of what is primarily a technical Bill.  I believe this Bill will significantly help to further safeguard the pensions of individual members of pension schemes and I therefore commend it to the House.</P>

    <Title>East Timor: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann compliments the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on his repeated condemnation of the atrocities perpetrated against the East Timorese people, commends the Tánaiste's and the Irish Government's commitment to an internationally acceptable solution to the ongoing occupation and human rights abuse in East Timor and urges the Government to make this one of its priorities during the upcoming Presidency of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This important motion has two elements to it: first, to congratulate the Tánaiste and the Government on the work they have done and their stance to date on <Col N="51" /> this issue.  In a signed article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 July 1995, the Tánaiste made this very clear.  It is worth quoting from the article which succinctly outlines the Government's position.  In his article the Tánaiste said:</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently condemned Indonesia's policies in East Timor. Our policy goes beyond condemnation to include active international engagement on the issue with clear objectives.  We want Indonesia to end its illegal occupation of the territory. We want to see a political solution on the basis of international law and justice. We want to see the people of East Timor enjoy their full human and political rights.  We want to stop the supply to Indonesia of arms that could be used as instruments of oppression in East Timor.  We want to see the release of Xanana Gusmao and other political prisoners.  We want Indonesia to co-operate fully with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and with international NGOs.</P>
    <P>That makes the Government's position distinctly clear; it is unique in Europe, apart from Portugal.  We want to congratulate the Tánaiste on that but, as we assume the EU Presidency, we ask the Government and the Tánaiste to make this issue a priority in their international activities.  Ireland has a unique opportunity to promote, influence and raise the profile of this important human rights issue.</P>
    <P>Human rights abuses, including torture, have been going on for over 20 years since Indonesia occupied East Timor.  Because of our international track record and the fact that we will assume the EU Presidency on 1 July, we now have a unique opportunity.  It is unfortunate that the European Commission failed to accept an arms embargo but during our Presidency we should actively seek to have such an embargo adopted.  We should also use our influence in the United States, Australia and throughout the free world to <Col N="52" /> see that the issue is raised at international level thus putting pressure on Indonesia to cease the bloodshed in occupied East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian Government has killed, tortured and jailed its opponents at will for almost three decades under the guise of fighting communism and instability.  For most of that time the international community has remained silent.  There is a simple reason for this. From its inception, Indonesia's new order government was seen as an important friend and ally of the West.  It has been spared criticism by its Asian neighbours and member states of the non-aligned movement.  With the fourth largest population in the world, a vast store of natural resources and a huge supply of cheap labour, Indonesia has always been seen as an economic prize.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that some governments have now begun to voice concerns about the situation in East Timor. A handful have backed up their words with action.  The first major expression of outrage was over the Santa Cruz massacre and the series of UN resolutions in 1992, 1993 and 1994 which openly criticised Indonesia for its poor human rights record in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the international community's response to Indonesia's human rights violations leaves much to be desired.  Many governments which have expressed concern continue to supply Indonesia with military equipment which could be used to commit human rights violations.  In the past three years the UK has approved the sale of 40 jet fighters while Germany has sold three submarines and 39 other naval vessels, some with missile launchers; Switzerland approved the sale of ammunition and parts of anti-aircraft guns, and the Australian military conducts joint exercises and training with Indonesia's counter insurgency unit.  In addition, as I stated earlier, the European Commission has rejected proposals for an arms embargo.</P>
    <P>It is a brave thing to be a human rights activist in East Timor or in Indonesia.  It can mean putting the basic <Col N="53" /> principles of the right to life, freedom from torture, freedom from hunger and freedom of speech and association before one's life and liberty.  Thousands of people in Indonesia and East Timor have put human rights first and they need our support.  The best way of supporting them is to publicise the grave violations of human rights for which the Indonesian Government is responsible.</P>
    <P>In this respect I welcome this debate and I thank Fine Gael for giving its Private Members' time.  The international community has focused almost exclusively on the most dramatic incidents in East Timor, such as the Santa Cruz massacre which was a watershed. However, human rights violations have taken place both before and after that massacre.</P>
    <P>We tend to look only at dramatic events, but grave acts of violence committed by Indonesian forces throughout the area have gone virtually unnoticed or else have been treated as isolated incidents rather than as part of a pattern of systematic human rights violations which have unfolded over more than a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>Trade union activists have been arrested, harassed and sometimes tortured. Scores of trade unionists were arrested during the wave of strikes in early 1994 and several were charged with political crimes.  The government does not depend on force alone to suppress dissent, it also relies on a system of political control based on the state ideology of <i>pancilla</i>, the constitution and officially defined national goals such as security, order and development. Any opposition to these, however peaceful, is illegal and dealt with by &ldquo;firm measures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Each year dozens of books, plays, lectures, films, meetings and poetry readings are banned.  Prisoners of conscience are serving long sentences because they were found in possession of banned books.  Farmers who resisted the appropriation of their land, writers who challenged the state's interpretation of history, Moslem preachers, labour activists, activists for democratisation, human <Col N="54" /> rights lawyers and advocates of independence for East Timor all risk being accused of subversion by being communists, terrorists or traitors.  They can suffer imprisonment or death which are powerful deterrents to all but the most courageous who are prepared to take a stand.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Belo bravely stood up and risked his life by making statements. He is now seen as a champion of his people and he deserves to be mentioned in this or any debate on East Timor.</P>
    <P>We should call on the Indonesian Government to resolve and provide redress for human rights violations, investigate political killings and disappearances, release all prisoners of conscience, provide fair trials and release all political prisoners.  We should also call on that Government to compensate victims and their relatives, bring those responsible for abuses to justice, introduce clear policies which will provide for the cessation of the violation of human rights, abolish the death penalty, prohibit extra-judicial executions, torture and the use of evidence obtained under torture and ensure that all detainees have access to lawyers of their choice as well as doctors and relatives. The anti-subversion laws should be repealed.</P>
    <P>Our Government, in the course of its Presidency of the EU, must urge the Indonesian Government to invite the relevant UN bodies to visit Indonesia and East Timor.  There have been such visits in the past but they have been limited and ineffective.  As holders of the EU Presidency we should also urge the Indonesian Government to implement UN recommendations on the prevention of torture and extra-judicial executions.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for attending and I look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second this motion and to agree with Senator Neville's outline of the violations that have taken place in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> We have often heard it said that if the world had known about what was taking place at Dachau or Auschwitz it could have been prevented.  The genocide taking place in East Timor is similar to that which took place during the Second World War.  We know of the systematic torture and murder which the East Timorese have suffered at the hands of Indonesia.  East Timor, while relatively small and insignificant to the international community, represents one of the worst cases of violations of human rights this century.  The distinction is that we know these violations are taking place and we have known about them since the occupation of that country by Indonesia in 1975.  However, the response of the international community has been poor even though the genocide is comparable to the genocides that have taken place in other countries in this century, particularly that which took place in Germany against the Jews during the Second World War.  The violations in East Timor are on record and it is the responsibility of the international community to respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>In the 21 years since Indonesia illegally invaded and annexed East Timor an estimated 200,000 people have perished.  The population of East Timor is 700,000 so over one-third of that country's population has been lost through genocide.  One need only look at the population ratios in Ireland to assess the impact of the genocide in East Timor.  It is the equivalent of the population of Dublin being removed from the Irish Republic over a similar period of time.  The scale of the genocide means that the scale of our response should be more significant than it has been to date.</P>
    <P>This debate could be an opportunity to ask many questions why the Indonesian Government carried out such atrocities during its occupation of East Timor.  Was it because East Timor is rich in oil and gas while Indonesia is not?  Was it because the population of East Timor is overwhelmingly Roman <Col N="56" /> Catholic while the population of Indonesia is Islamic?  These are some of the questions that could be asked by an international observer who has looked with disbelief at what has taken place in East Timor over the past 20 years. However, asking questions without supplying a practical response will not help the people of East Timor overcome the difficulties they face.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has never recognised Indonesian control over East Timor.  The international community, through a variety of channels, has attempted to use its influence to stop Indonesian brutality and to restore East Timor to its people.  However, the fact that these atrocities have been allowed to continue signals a failure on the part of the international community to restore the democratic legitimacy and independence of East Timor.</P>
    <P>While the killings in East Timor have been widespread, the news of the atrocities has not.  Unlike many other international hotspots of violence, such as Rwanda, Sri Lanka and the Middle East, the press has been banned from East Timor since the invasion of 1975. Only a few journalists daring to sneak in and out of the country have been able to bring news of these atrocities to the world.  It is worth pointing out the great efforts of one of the Members of this House, Senator Norris.  He went as far as he could last year in his attempts to enter East Timor, to expose the brutality of Indonesia before being instructed to leave that country.  He would like to have been present for this debate but he is not in a position to attend.  However, his contribution in exposing this issue is noteworthy.</P>
    <P>It has been proven time and again that the way to stop genocide is through international attention.  However, this is virtually impossible in the case of East Timor as long as journalists are banned from the area.  The few journalists who have been able to enter that country and experience the reality of life for its people speak of the abominable cruelty and terror the East Timorese must suffer. Such reporting, when it has taken <Col N="57" /> place, has been clouded in a cloak and dagger atmosphere as the Indonesian secret police use a variety of methods to apprehend the reporters.</P>
    <P>It has recently come to the attention of the international community that more than 100 young people have left East Timor in recent months after taking refuge in several European embassies in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Many of these young people are the future leaders of East Timor and one commentator recently described the area as a society being bled of its youth and talent by the Indonesian occupation. Members of the House will be aware of the Roman Catholic bishop, Carlos Belo, and his tremendous work to reduce the obvious tension between the occupiers and the East Timorese and his efforts to tell the international community about what is taking place there.  He tells of innocent children being slaughtered as they lay sick in hospital.  He has been the driving force against the Indonesian Government and the international community owes him great tribute for his work in highlighting this international scandal.  In this regard I would welcome his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
    <P>As Senator Neville said, the primary focus of this debate is to draw attention to the role Ireland can play during its six month Presidency of the EU not just by concentrating on this issue but by ensuring that an EU initiative is taken to bring peace and order to East Timor. As a small country in a large world, we have a responsibilty to do whatever we can to help defend the interests of other small countries.  We can play a positive role in this regard during our EU Presidency. Sometimes we have to be totally straight and honest with our friends, even if they do not like being told the truth.  Many of our friends in the EU do not like being told the truth when it comes to trading arms with Indonesia.  I hope some initiative could be taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>We owe gratitude to the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign which, more than anyone else, has brought this <Col N="58" /> issue to the political establishment. After the end of apartheid in South Africa people there rightly pointed to the efforts of organisations in this country to highlight what took place.  When East Timor is given its liberty, this country will stand out as one who supported it throughout.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the proposer and seconder of this important motion, first, in the condemnation of the Indonesian Government and, second, in the hope that the expression of solidarity will have some effect on the situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>We are talking about murder and genocide here, not human rights violations.  It is not about somebody not getting their human rights in Ireland because they do not know their social welfare entitlements.  We are talking about major human rights violations and murder and genocide on a huge scale.  The genocide is supported by countries who are supposed to be friends of ours, specifically Australia. The Australian impact on East Timor is enormous and unfortunately they are on the wrong side.</P>
      <P>I have subscribed to <i>National Geographic</i> for many years, a magazine which I always felt was fair, generous and informative.  Earlier this year it had a two page supplement of a map of Indonesia.  There was no mention in it of East Timor, only Indonesia and Irian Jaya.  In last month's edition there was a letter asking why the East Timor situation was not mentioned.  <i>National Geographic</i> said the maps are recog-nised internationally and they take the political situation as it is and not as they would like it to be.  I was disgusted with the attitude of the editorial staff of <i>National Geographic</i>, which was absolutely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are parallels in the East Timor situation with a film called <i>Missing</i>&mdash; many might have seen it recently &mdash; about Chile and the involvement of the American Government in a coup there. When one gentleman went to find his son, he found the American Embassy <Col N="59" /> and the new Chilean dictator were colluding to kill anybody who had anything to do with opposition to the Government. It did not make any difference where that opposition came from.  The film showed what happened in Chile is happening in East Timor and other places around the world.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that we must do what we can during our EU Presidency to eliminate the genocide happening in many places in the world as a result of colonial powers leaving those areas.  If at the end of the six months there was a better understanding of what is happening in the world in terms of genocide, murder and violence, the Presidency would have been successful.</P>
    <P>It is a nonsense to suggest there is an international observer report on what has happened in East Timor since the 80s, because international observers are not allowed in.  I agree with Senator Hayes and Senator Neville in praising Senator Norris.  I do not often praise Senator Norris, but I have to say he has been eloquent on the issue of East Timor and has tried his best, at every level, to get as much information disseminated about what is happening there &mdash; even to the stage where he was not allowed into the country.</P>
    <P>East Timor has the potential to be a hugely economically viable country because of its natural resources.  Unfortunately, natural resources in most countries in the world are not controlled by the indigenous people but by outside interests.  The Indonesians have put a stranglehold on the huge potential of East Timor, with the collusion of Australia and other countries.  Recently, we have seen the influence of companies such as Shell on the Ogoni people in Nigeria.  We have seen that the oil industry in Angola is controlled from London.  We have seen Mozambique thrown to the wolves by the Portuguese. Much of what has happened in Africa is controlled by international, multinational and cross-national companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Two hundred thousand out of 700,000 people have died as a direct result of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, two out of every seven people.  This is real genocide, because the people killed were of reproductive age.  There are no young children because there are not enough parents to produce them.  There is an older age group.  We must cry out against the sin of genocide, whether in East Timor or anywhere else.  We must ensure that what has happened in East Timor is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>Reader's Digest</i> discussed the issue.  <i>Reader's Digest</i> is a populist magazine with a worldwide circulation which condenses news and tries to be popular.  If it has taken up the case of East Timor, the case must be just.  I think it is a just case.</P>
    <P>I compliment the proposer and seconder on tabling this motion.  I hope that the Government will inform the EU during the next six months that the East Timorese are important to us. Their plight is symbolic of events occurring throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate.  I commend Senator Manning and his colleagues in Fine Gael for bringing the motion before the House. The fact that this debate is taking place is a testament to the hard work of the East Timor solidarity group in recent years to bring the situation in East Timor to the attention of the public.  It is a credit to the Irish people that the State, with their full support, has been able to adopt a strong line on the illegal occupation of East Timor by the Indonesian authorities.  For historical reasons, Ireland, as perhaps the only formerly colonised state within the European Union, tends to have a better understanding of the plight of the people of East Timor than former colonial nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion draws attention to the strong role adopted by Ireland within the international community on this issue.  I welcome the support it offers to my party leader, the Tánaiste, on his <Col N="61" /> efforts to highlight one of the most brutal military regimes remaining in the world.  However, I do not want to make a political point.  The Tánaiste is also Minister for Foreign Affairs of this State and has the support of all Members and the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned from this issue, which is expressly recognised in the motion.  Ireland's voice in international affairs is all the more audible because of the country's record of participation, not only in the United Nations but also within the European Union.  We will only be successful in pursuing the goals of our foreign policy by committing ourselves fully to the international process and supporting that voice, with resources when necessary. I fully support the idea that we should use our Presidency of the European Union to highlight this issue.  I have no doubt that the Tánaiste intends to do so.</P>
    <P>The situation in East Timor is totally unacceptable.  The illegal and brutal occupation of that country by the Indonesian authorities has lasted over 20 years.  During that period, systematic violence and oppression have been directed against the people of East Timor.  The atrocity at Santa Crux in 1991, when 250 innocent East Timorese were slaughtered in full view of the media by the Indonesian military, is an indication of the lengths to which the Indonesians are prepared to go to prevent any flowering of democratic or national sentiment in East Timor.</P>
    <P>That kind of atrocity however is unique in the amount of international attention it received.  Similar atrocities against individuals and their families occur daily.  We must give credit to those in East Timor who, like Bishop Belo, work tirelessly, at grave risk to themselves, to prevent the repetition of genocide on this scale.  As an aside, I welcome also the increased support recently given to Bishop Belo from the Vatican.  It is critical that he and others are seen to be supported by powerful non-governmental international agencies such as the Church, which has an <Col N="62" /> obvious interest in the protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>People like Bishop Belo can only do so much.  Unless the international community can exert sufficient pressure on the Indonesians, the tense situation in East Timor will eventually explode. Large scale riots in Dili, the capital of East Timor, in 1995 are an indication of the extent of feeling among the East Timorese people.  This growing unrest, seen in the increased activity of resistance groupings, placed those seeking to prevent a wholesale escalation of the existing position into full hostilities into an unenviable position in which they do not deserve to be.  Irish people are aware of the results when extremes dominate the agenda.  Those caught in the middle become powerless to prevent the eventual bloody outcome.</P>
    <P>These people rely on the international community to protect them from this fate.  There must be an internationally acceptable solution to this problem and we must bring pressure to bear on the Indonesians to enter negotiations. Without that pressure, and without the participation of countries like Australia which has been ambivalent in its attitude to this problem, the Indonesians will not enter such negotiations voluntarily.  Information I received from friends in Australia indicates that the Australian authorities will not do very much to end this problem. Ireland has excellent relations with Australia, and we must do everything possible to bring about a more sustainable situation than that currently in place.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank the Fine Gael Senators for putting down this motion.  I commend the Tánaiste on his work to date, short of declaring war, to bring pressure to bear on the Indonesians.  I know he is determined to continue down this path. There is a need for more debates of this kind in the House.  For example, the situation in Burma is another we should explore and declare a position on. However, that is another day's work.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Col N="63" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my fellow union member, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea.  I am delighted by his interest in this issue.  It is an impressive and progressive step that the Government has provided time for this debate.</P>
      <P>This matter was first raised by Senator Brendan Ryan and myself a number of years ago.  At that time, with the exception of Senator Lanigan, Members were not familiar with East Timor and its problems.  I discussed this matter seven to eight years ago with Hugh O'Shaughnessy who wrote an extraordinary article about East Timor in <i>The Irish Times</i> and raised many people's consciousness of the issues involved.  In succeeding years many individuals have shown great interest in the situation in East Timor and it has captured the imagination of the Irish public.  This is attributable to the efforts of Mr. Tom Hyland, who raised the issue in the media and kept politicians informed of progress relating to it.  The work of Mr. Hyland and others like him throughout the country has been extraordinary.</P>
      <P>In 1993 I organised a petition of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas which was signed by 75 per cent of Deputies and Senators.  The motion stated that we supported the United Nations call for the right of East Timor to self-determination, had asked the Irish Government to condemn the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia and press the Indonesian Government to invite the special UN rapporteur on torture and extrajudicial execution to report on East Timor, had called on the Irish Government to seek the release of all political prisoners in East Timor and expressed the moral revulsion of the Irish people at the recent reports of further atrocities.  Earlier speakers referred to many of these atrocities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hopes that this problem can be solved.  It should be placed high on the agenda during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.  The people of East Timor have suffered appalling hardships, oppression, torture, displacement and exile in the past 20 years.  The <Col N="64" /> irresponsibility of the main western powers in refusing to address this matter is disgraceful.  During the 20th century we have come to know of many atrocities, including those perpetrated by Pol Pot and the elimination and massacre of Jews during World War II, after the event.  Such atrocities continue to occur. In the region of 25 to 33 per cent of the population of East Timor has been murdered or gone missing, but no one seems to be able to do anything.  The position of the Indonesian Government has been protected by successive governments in Great Britain and Australia.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, successive Irish Governments have a proud record of drawing European and world attention to East Timor.  The current Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, has shown extraordinary energy and commitment on this issue and has not been afraid to grasp the nettle and to stand alone.  I hope that, during our Presidency, he will be able to draw the European partners together, as he must in order to make this an issue.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses have recognised and regularly expressed support and concern at the plight of the people of East Timor.  It is now time to go a step further.  This must be made a priority issue during our Presidency and Europe must insist yet again that UN human rights officials have full and uninhibited access to East Timor and be allowed to open an office on the island; that Amnesty International be allowed access to East Timor, as it needs to be there; that all human rights infringements or accusations and allegations of such infringements be fully investigated; that sanctions be imposed on Indonesia until such time as it agrees a process for granting East Timor independence and that, in the meantime, no arms, small or large, of whatever type, should be sold to the Indonesian Government or army by western powers.  The last should be implemented immediately because that will hurt them most.</P>
    <P>We have seen how Indonesia treats people, and this will continue.  Ireland has a unique opportunity during its <Col N="65" /> Presidency to ensure East Timor receives the protection of Europe.  The global support Indonesia has bought on this issue has been astonishing.  In 1992, I raised this issue at the World Confederation of Teachers &mdash; the largest body of educationalists which meets on a two-yearly basis &mdash; in a motion put down by ourselves and the Portuguese teachers' union.  I have never seen anything like the level and quality of documentation circulated by the Indonesian teachers' union.  It was full of inaccuracies and misleading statements but it did show that every discussion on this matter is dealt with and considered.</P>
    <P>It was good to see that some Oireachtas Members took part in a candlelight vigil outside Dublin Castle on the night of the visit by the former Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Paul Keating, although it is a pity there were not more.  It was impressive to see many Irish people hold candles for the people of East Timor.  We should do it more often and we should ensure that the murder in that country is stopped.  We must find occasion to raise these problems constantly and regularly.  It is good to see the Vatican taking an interest in this at last because for many years it simply ignored it.  This shows that international pressure can work.</P>
    <P>East Timor is unlike Iran or South Africa in that it does not have oil or other resources.  It is a country without much wealth and for that reason the world seems prepared to stand back and let it meet its fate.  The UN has granted these people the right of self-determination and we must insist that this is carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that we discuss the gross wrongs committed against the people of East Timor just a day after the publication of the annual Amnesty International report, which once again highlighted the abuse of human rights in that country.  The last 20 years of Jakarta's iron fist rule in the former Portuguese colony has resulted <Col N="66" /> in the murder of one-third of the indigenous population through a state policy of carefully planned and ruthlessly executed genocide.  Not only has this barbaric policy involved the murder, rape and torture of the civilian population, the burning of their crops and the destruction of their livelihoods, it has also taken the form of a cultural genocide, a systematic and pernicious attempt by the Jakarta authorities to destroy the rich culture and traditions of the East Timorese people.  Television and radio are now broadcast in Bahasa-Indonesian and not in the East Timorese native language, Tetum.  Jakarta has also tightened its firm grip on East Timor by luring in more than 100,000 migrant workers with the inducement of free land confiscated from the indigenous population.</P>
      <P>Whatever power political motivations were behind Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975 &mdash; whether it was from an alleged concern for the security of President Suharto's authoritarian regime or in an attempt to secure rich oil and gas reserves, nothing can excuse or justify the barbarism inflicted on the East Timorese people in their struggle for self-determination.  Those people know only too well the hypocrisy of power politics in that the force employed by the state machinery brutally to suppress them came, more often than not, from those countries whose Governments are the first to condemn human rights violations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response from inside and outside East Timor to the politics of power &mdash; in terms of the politics of shame &mdash; is instructive.  There are lessons to be learned which should guide the Irish Government when it takes over the EU Presidency.  Through the work of non-governmental organisations and Senator Norris, the ruthlessness of the Indonesian regime has been exposed.  Pressure from NGOs has belatedly pushed politicians around the world into action. The US Congress has passed legislation to bar the sale of lethal crowd control equipment and small arms to Indonesia pending &ldquo;significant progress&rdquo; in <Col N="67" /> human rights conditions in East Timor. The Australian Government has also recently taken a more pro-active policy.</P>
    <P>Reacting to international outrage, the politics of shame, the Jakarta regime set up a 25 member national commission on human rights to monitor abuses.  Last year, when soldiers executed six unarmed civilians near Dili, the commission found the killings unlawful and a court martial jailed two soldiers for four and a half years.  While the terms were inadequate, one hopes they represent the emergence of accountability.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, for our policy but I wish they were here for this debate &mdash; that is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, who is present.  This is an important discussion in which Ireland has played and must continue to play a significant role. The Irish Government should support Bishop Belo's call for a referendum on East Timorese independence.  Furthermore, during our EU Presidency, it should suggest a common code of conduct for trade in arms which are used in torture.  Unfortunately, the European record on arms sales to Indonesia is disgraceful, with our next door neighbour, Britain, being the worst offender.  Our Government must raise this issue at the EU conference.</P>
    <P>I end with Bishop Belo's simple plea: &ldquo;We beg the outside world not to forget us.&rdquo;  I hope his call will not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this subject in the House on a number of occasions.  I have attended conferences on East Timor and, like other Senators, I feel passionately about it.  It could be said that talking about it in the Seanad will not change anything.  I do not agree; if we continue to debate the issue in our Parliament we can slowly but surely effect change in the attitudes of others. We may thus gradually bring about an attitudinal change in a sufficient number of nations to bring pressure to bear on Indonesia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I do not need to list the problems and atrocities.  It is sufficient to point out that 200,000 people out of a population of 700,000 are dead.  If that happened in a European nation we would be screaming from the rooftops.  We must join with nations who are opposed to the regime in Indonesia, such as Portugal, an ancient and noble nation, which was once the colonial power in East Timor. Portugal has behaved honourably; it has made a number of constructive suggestions for solutions to the problems. However, the Indonesians have not made a single proposal.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese have continually called for a constructive attitude; for debate and mediation and they have offered help.  There has been no constructive response from the Indonesians. Many say that Portugal bears some responsibility but that is not the case. The Portuguese behaved honourably when the invasion took place and there was nothing more they could do.  Since then they have requested and entreated the world community to turn its attention to the plight of the East Timorese.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville pointed out that some of our European partners and other so-called &ldquo;developed civilised&rdquo; nations sell arms to Indonesia.  He mentioned the Swiss and some of our EU partners.  As a member state of the EU, how can we not vociferously oppose these arms sales?  We must highlight these facts at every opportunity.  I call on the Government to avail of the opportunity presented by the EU Presidency over the next six months to highlight what is happening in East Timor.  The Government should make this cause one of its priorities for the duration of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>There is an old Chinese proverb which says &ldquo;Constant dripping wears the stone&rdquo;.  It is only by continued effort that we will slowly wear away injustice. The rape of East Timor is one of the worst human rights violations of this century.  The Government must call for a complete ban on arms sales to Indonesia and for the establishment of a UN office in East Timor.  It must also call on <Col N="69" /> Indonesia to allow independent observers to visit that sad occupied country so that once more the people of East Timor may live in freedom and decide their own destiny.</P>
    <P>A call from the Irish Government to Indonesia to withdraw will not make it happen.  However, it may have an effect if we complain enough to the Australians, who have a major role to play. The Indonesians and the Australians divided up the oil fields which rightfully belong to the East Timorese.  We are a small nation up against large nations, but the EU Presidency gives us an opportunity to ask our European partners to join in an EU effort.  The Portuguese are most eager to see a resolution of the rape of East Timor and the abuse of human rights there.</P>
    <P>I make an impassioned plea on this issue to the Government to which I am sure it will respond.  I commend the work of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.  I hope this effort continues.  We are a small nation which is and has been occupied and we can empathise with the people of East Timor.  We have partners in Europe who would support us.  The Government must make a special effort in this regard during the EU Presidency. Indonesia is a huge nation and it can do without East Timor.  Even if the East Timorese never get the the oil fields back, at least they might live in freedom, self-determination and peace.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will respond positively as it has done in the past.  I commend the Senators who have spoken on this issue and who keep up the fight for a small nation on the other side of the world with which we have little connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion, particularly in urging the Government to make it a priority during our Presidency of the EU to find a solution to the ongoing occupation and the infringement of human rights in East Timor.  On 14 June 1995 I moved a motion on East Timor in the House which was supported by all parties.  Ours <Col N="70" /> was the first Parliament to endorse the declaration reached at the interparliamentary meeting in Lisbon &mdash; a significant event in that more than 30 countries were represented there.  That motion stated:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann endorses the declaration made in Lisbon at the Inter-Parliamentary Conference on East Timor; and calls on the Irish Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of the declaration in order to secure freedom and the right to self-determination for the people of East Timor.</P>
      <P>It is to underestimate our influence to suggest that adopting motions of this nature is in some way irrelevant in the international community.  It is relevant, particularly at a time when we are about to take over the Presidency of the EU. Hopefully, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will use his influence to have our European partners exert pressure on the Indonesian Government. The EU has a considerable capacity to speed up the resolution of this problem.</P>
      <P>I am not as pessimistic as I was 12 months ago about the future of East Timor.  The issue has been the subject of several articles in international publications and has received coverage on television.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the courageous journalists who have gone to East Timor at considerable risk to themselves and brought back a message that could not be controverted by any Indonesian propaganda.  Six journalists laid down their lives and it is encouraging that the Australian Government is prepared to investigate the deaths of Australian journalists in East Timor.</P>
      <P>I share some of the criticisms made of the Australian administration in respect of its attitude to the problem of East Timor. However, that is changing as well and there is a greater consciousness in Australia of the degree of the problem and possibly greater determination to deal with it on a realistic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I was honoured in February 1994 to meet with the Secretary General of the United Nations, along with several other parliamentarians from various countries, to press the case of East Timor.  We were very well and sympathetically received and the Secretary General had a substantial understanding of the problem.  However, he and the United Nations are just as good as the international community's determination to effect a solution to this problem. Without that international determination to effect a solution the resolutions which were adopted by the United Nations in respect of self-determination will not be exercised or brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>There is a key point which relates to self-determination and it is something with which we as a small country should be able to identify readily.  The absolute right of a people to self-determination has been categorically denied to the people of East Timor.  I will not catalogue the deaths that have taken place as they were well catalogued earlier this evening.  When we recorded the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz I said that what we had in East Timor was the equivalent of that holocaust. That might seem to be an exaggeration but it is not.  It was well described by Senator Hayes that, proportionately, the loss of one-third of the population in a small country equates in relative terms with what took place there.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to believe that the international community can stand aside.  The major powers have stood aside for purely economic and selfish reasons, because Indonesia is a rapidly expanding economy.  It is an important market for consumer goods and that is why international determination is not as evident as it should be.</P>
    <P>I heard something quite significant on the radio last week.  It was in relation to the environment, but we could make an analogy with East Timor.  It was a statement by an American chief, Chief Seattle, who said that we had stopped <Col N="72" /> living and begun surviving.  There is an important message there in the sense that our regard for life seems to have diminished at every level and we have reached the point where it is a question of survival.</P>
    <P>It is my fervent wish that the Government would use the EU Presidency to maximum effect, both to convince our European partners of the need to solve this problem and to convince the international community of the need to progress things.  Condemnation is easy.  The question we must ask ourselves is: what are we going to do to address the problem and alleviate the suffering of the people within East Timor?</P>
    <P>I join in the tributes paid to Bishop Belo and other people who have kept the flame alight.  It is important that organisations such as Amnesty International and the UN High Commission for Refugees should be able, not just to go into the country to investigate what is happening but should be able to have a permanent presence there to verify that human rights abuses have taken place and enable them to stand over their reports.  The thanks of the House has already been expressed to Tom Hyland and his colleagues in the Irish-East Timor Solidarity Campaign.  Without them it is questionable whether we would have debated this matter so regularly in the House and whether we would have returned to it this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon made reference to a Chinese proverb and it brought to mind another saying, which is that all that is required for evil to prevail is for good men to stand idly by.  That is very appropriate when we consider East Timor.  In addition to a holocaust which has taken place there, we have now reached a Bosnian type situation of ethnic cleansing. Many people who are in fear of their lives have to go and seek refuge and asylum in other countries.  In addition we have the importation of Indonesians to colonise the country so the influence of the indigenous population is diminished.</P>
    <P>UN Resolution 37/30 of 1982 upholds the right of the East Timorese people to <Col N="73" /> self-determination.  It is a critical aspect that people have the right to decide for themselves how and by whom they will be governed.  That is at the core of what we believe in as a democracy and it must be emphasised at every level through our contacts at European and UN level and elsewhere.  That message must be brought home and made clear to the Indonesians.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see it recorded in <i>Link</i>, the magazine of the East Timor campaign in England, that the EU Foreign Ministers effected a common position committing the EU to encourage the Indonesian Government to improve the situation.  That is a step in the right direction.  It is a fairly minimalist step in terms of committing the EU to encourage the Indonesian Government, but nevertheless it is a step in the right direction and I hope to see more of them.  I renew the call for the release of Xanana Gusmao.  A condition of that release should not be that he would have to go into exile.</P>
    <P>The arms trade is not just morally indefensible, it is also illegal.  I hope the Government will bring that matter to the attention of our European partners, some of whom are responsible for that trade.  I understand that some of the navy apparatus of the old east German regime has found its way to Indonesia and British arms have also found their way out there.  That should not happen and I hope the Government will use its influence in that direction as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speaker in his compliments to Tom Hyland, David Connolly and all those associated with the East Timor campaign for keeping the matter very much to the forefront.  I support the motion and it is difficult to see how one could oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government, and the Tánaiste in particular, are wholeheartedly committed to finding a solution to the current situation in East Timor and achieving an end to the multiple human rights abuses, not only in East Timor but also in Iran and in <Col N="74" /> Indonesia itself.  The stand taken by the Tánaiste on this issue has been both principled and courageous and is in marked contrast to the stand adopted by certain other EU member states who are more interested in their arms exports than in safeguarding human rights.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Irish Presidency provides an excellent opportunity to highlight the plight of the East Timorese. I hope it will be possible to press for the following action to be taken at EU level.  The first item is the establishment of an EU human rights office in East Timor to monitor the human rights situation on the ground.  The second is an examination of the possibility of the EU establishing a sworn commission of inquiry into events in East Timor over the past two decades.  Such a commission of inquiry would for the first time enable evidence to be gathered in a quasi judicial manner and would provide the international community with a factual basis from which to operate.</P>
    <P>Concerted action on the part of the EU is especially urgent in view of some of the more recent reports of atrocities coming from East Timor.  East Timor is not the only place where human rights are being trampled underfoot, either by domestic regimes or occupying powers. Some 51 years after the establishment of the United Nations the international community seems as powerless as ever to secure the most basic civil and political rights of people living in large parts of the world.  Human rights abuses are commonplace in areas ranging from Nigeria to Chechnya, and in too many cases those abuses take place with the military or economic connivance of elements in the developed world.</P>
    <P>As well as addressing the specific concerns relating to East Timor which I outlined, I hope the EU will finally grasp the nettle in relation to arms exports.  Let us not forget that the people of East Timor may find themselves looking down the barrel of a Belgian gun, while a farmer in Angola may step on a land mine, wholly or partly, manufactured in the UK.  In <Col N="75" /> today's global economy we must be prepared to assume global responsibility. The EU could make a start by taking a close look at the European arms industry and devising stringent mechanisms to ensure European arms are not used to perpetrate rights abuses elsewhere in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and what other Senators have said.  We have a moral imperative to pursue this issue. While we hold the EU Presidency, it is essential that we bring it to the fore.  It is important to remember that we can promote the East Timorese problem in the EU and, as other Senators have said, that we have a voice in Australia. It is important to make our grave concerns known to Irish Australians about Australia's involvement in the situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>I would like the Government to pursue two things immediately.  In February President Suharto met with the Taoiseach in Bangkok during the Europe Asia meeting.  I believe President Suharto agreed to allow an Irish delegation to go to East Timor.  This should be followed through immediately.  If he said it was possible, why have we not sent such a delegation?  The delegation would not need to be large, but could comprise a few Deputies, Senators and human rights experts who have been involved in this problem.  I would like to hear what the Minster has to say about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should insist on an immediate UN mission of inquiry into the treatment of women in East Timor, where women are forced to have abortions, forced to use Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, and where the forced insertion of interuteron devices occurs.  These abuses have been reported internationally and we should at least insist on a UN mission of inquiry to discover the extent to which this is happening. According to reports from East Timor, it is hard not to believe that this is happening to some extent.  While I agree most of the deaths have been male, <Col N="76" /> there has been considerable abuse and some genocide of women.  I ask the Minister to follow this up as a matter of urgency.  The Government should ask the UN to institute a mission to investigate the abuses against women on a massive scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the issue of East Timor.  The Government has been committed to helping to find a just solution to this issue for some time. It remains deeply concerned at the continuing violations of human rights in East Timor.  Last week, Ireland, through contacts at official level in the Department of Foreign Affairs, alerted our EU partners to information we had received relating to widespread arrests and clashes between the Indonesian military and protesters in Baucau, the second city of East Timor.  Unconfirmed reports have since then been received of two protesters having been killed and ten more reported missing.</P>
      <P>Overall, the situation in East Timor remains a cause of grave concern.  The increased presence of Indonesian military forces in East Timor is still creating a general climate of fear, mistrust and intimidation and contributes to an ever-growing sense of anti-Indonesian resentment and to heightened nationalistic East Timorese feelings, especially among young people.</P>
      <P>The difficult economic and social situation in East Timor, which is characterised by high unemployment rates as well as by social tensions created by the influx of newcomers from other parts of the Indonesian archipelago, provides a sense of hopelessness about their future for the indigenous population of East Timor which is especially acute in the case of young people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains concerned at the situation of East Timorese political prisoners, in particular that of Mr. Xanana Gusmao, and of all those who have been convicted for their participation in non-violent demonstrations. Earlier this year, in April, at the 52nd <Col N="77" /> session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the commission, by way of a chairman's statement on East Timor, regretted the lack of information concerning the number of people killed and those persons still unaccounted for as a result of the Dili massacre on 12 November 1991 and called upon the Indonesian Government to honour fully its commitments on this matter which were undertaken in earlier declarations agreed by consensus at previous sessions of the commission.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the visit to East Timor by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. José Ayala-Lasso, last December and, while taking note with concern of the contents of his report, would urge the Indonesian Government to implement the report's recommendations in full without delay. In this context, the Government hopes for the early implementation of an understanding between the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Indonesian authorities.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month, on 6 June, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, held discussions with the exiled East Timorese leader and Special Representative of the East Timor National Council of Maubere Resistance, CNRM, Mr. José Ramos-Horta.  Mr. Ramos-Horta was of the view that the next two to three years would be a critical time for East Timor. Parliamentary elections will take place in Indonesia in March-April 1997, and these will be followed by presidential elections in 1998.  Mr. Xanana Gusmao has called for an effective challenge to the elections to be mounted in East Timor.  However, it has not yet been decided whether the National Council of Maubere Resistance will boycott the elections or will support the pro-democracy movement in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>Ireland has and will continue to be an advocate for the cause of East Timor. At the Europe Aisa Meeting, ASEM, held in Bangkok last March, the Taoiseach met with President Suharto and raised the question of East Timor in the <Col N="78" /> substantive and friendly discussions which took place.  The Taoiseach conveyed the concerns of the Government and the people at the situation in East Timor.  The Taoiseach also indicated that Ireland was prepared to do everything possible to help resolve the problem during our forthcoming EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised two specific questions on East Timor.  One was the possibility of a delegation visiting there, something which is being kept under review.  The question the Senator raised in relation to the abuse of women will be conveyed to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs after this debate.</P>
    <P>Last year he had an opportunity to contribute an article on East Timor to <i>The Irish Times.</i>  In that article the Government's objectives for East Timor were clearly set out.  These objectives remain equally valid today.  Ireland wants to see a political solution for East Timor based on the principles of international law and justice; Ireland wishes to see the people of East Timor enjoying their full human and political rights; Ireland calls for a halt in the supply of arms to Indonesia which could be used as instruments of oppression in East Timor and Ireland calls for the release of Mr. Xanana Gusmao and other East Timorese political prisoners</P>
    <P>Overall, we wish Indonesia to cooperate fully with the United Nations, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Commission on Human Rights and with the relevant international non-governmental organisations. These objectives have overwhelming public and political support in Ireland, where the plight of the people of East Timor has evoked a concerned and sympathetic response.</P>
    <P>I hope the meeting held between the Portuguese Prime Minister, Antonio Guterres, and President Suharto of Indonesia in Bangkok at the Europe-Asia meeting in March and the breaking of the ice at the highest level after a period of 20 years between Portugal and Indonesia will eventually lead to an <Col N="79" /> improvement of the situation in East Timor and that the proposals put forward on that occasion will eventually contribute to the fostering of the ongoing dialogue between the two countries with the aim of achieving a peaceful and just solution to the question of East Timor.</P>
    <P>The Government has supported and continues to attach importance to the ongoing talks between the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and Portugal under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations.  The next round of these talks is scheduled to take place in Geneva on 27 June 1996. This will be the eighth in the series since the resumption of the trilateral talks in 1992, the most recent of which took place in London on 16 January 1996.  In between these ministerial sessions, discussions have continued between Portugal and Indonesia at the permanent representative level, with the participation of the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Government also welcomes the convening of the intra-East Timorese dialogue, the second session of which was held from 19-22 March 1996 at Burg Schlaining in Austria.  This dialogue does not represent a parallel negotiating track to the Foreign Ministers' meetings but a forum for continuing the free and informal exchange of views to explore ideas of a practical nature and to establish a conducive atmosphere for the achievement of a solution to the question of East Timor.</P>
    <P>In discussions with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, Ramos Horta expressed the view that it was overall a very useful forum for discussion.  To further encourage the dialogue, the Minister of State indicated to Ramos Horta that Ireland is willing to contribute financial support for the next round of talks, which are expected to take place in Norway.</P>
    <P>Within the EU, Ireland has encouraged the definition of an EU common position on East Timor.  Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the European Union during our forthcoming <Col N="80" /> EU Presidency in pursuing a just and equitable solution to the issue of East Timor.  As I have already said, the Taoiseach, when he met President Suharto in Bangkok in March, indicated that Ireland would do everything possible to help resolve the situation during our forthcoming Presidency of the EU.</P>
    <P>I commend Members of this House for their continuing interest in the problem of East Timor and the plight of the indigenous population there.  I assure the House that the Government will do all in its power to assist in bringing about a fair and just solution to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the Senators who participated in the debate.  The Minister reiterated the Government's position as outlined by the Tánaiste last July and at the start of our EU Presidency and also pointed out that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have committed the Government to pursue this issue positively during the course of our forthcoming EU Presidency.  I am pleased that this commitment was given to this House by the Minister &mdash; it is important that it would be given to a House of the Oireachtas. We look forward to the role we will play when we hold the EU Presidency in making progress on this issue.</P>
      <P>This House has committed itself over a number of years through the interest of its Members, especially Senator Norris, who has a considerable interest in this area, in raising the profile of this issue.  I agree with Senator Lydon.  We have a strong role to play and we can be effective in this regard.  Several Governments have listened to us and taken our views on board.  It is not right to say we do not have an influence.  We do have an influence; we have used it to its maximum level and we are doing so again tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that last July's <i>Irish Times</i> statement in regard to this Government's policy towards the atrocities being committed by Indonesia on the East Timorese people and that the Taoiseach's commitment and statement to President Suharto of Indonesia that Ireland would do everything possible to <Col N="81" /> help resolve the problem during its forthcoming EU Presidency are on the record of this House.  The genocide in East Timor, the rape, torture and inhuman and degrading acts against the East Timorese, the issues raised by Senator Henry about the ill-treatment, abuse, torture and inhuman acts perpetrated against women and killings like the Dili massacre, where even children were summarily executed, should be stopped.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach for their approach and commitment to this issue.  I particularly congratulate the Tánaiste for his strong stand last September when he met Ali Al Alitas, the Indonesian Foreign Minister. The Tánaiste firmly told him of our Government's view on the East Timor situation.  I join with others in thanking the East Timor solidarity group and Tom Hyland and David Connolly for constantly reminding us of the importance of raising this issue, their concern about it, the influence this small country can have in ensuring the profile of the atrocities and suffering of the East Timorese people is raised throughout the international community and that concerned and good thinking people throughout the world will support and express their concern for these people's plight.  The United Nations High Commission on Human Rights should have a constant presence in East Timor; we should press for this.</P>
    <P>The country should be opened up to the international community.  The freedom of the press, which is a stalwart of any democratic country, should be reintroduced and foreign journalists should be welcomed and get the opportunity to fully report on the developing situation there.  We will not fully accept that any improvement has taken place until the media have access to East Timor.  I congratulate Mr. O'Shaughnessy, Mr. Pilger and others who have brought back information and opened the eyes of the western world to the atrocities being committed there.  They deserve a special vote of thanks for risking their lives and some, even losing their lives, in an <Col N="82" /> endeavour to report to the world what is happening to the gentle and resilient East Timorese people.  As previous Senators have said, they are entitled to the right of self-determination, a right that this country defended for 700 years and still defends.  We should condemn any country who will remove that right from any nation and condemn Indonesia for removing it from the East Timorese people.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody who contributed to the debate.  I agree with Senator Hayes that Bishop Belo should be nominated and seriously considered for the Nobel Peace Prize.  It would have an enormous effect on the situation in East Timor if he were to win it.  It would raise its profile on the international stage.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution. We have had a positive debate. We know where we are going for the next six months and we wish the Government, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs every success in putting the plight of the East Timorese at the top of its agenda.</P>

      <P>The Government hope for the early implementation of the understanding between the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Indonesian authorities with regard to the stationing on a permanent basis in the UNDP in Jakarta of a UN human rights liaison officer who will be able to visit East Timor whenever instructed to do so by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The Government has also noted the undertakings by the Indonesian authorities to issue an invitation to the special rapporteur on the question of torture and to submit a report to the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1997.</P>

      <P>I am privileged to be here as a nominee of the Irish Wheelchair Association and in that capacity I speak on behalf of the Centre for Independent Living.  I became aware of this movement because of my association with the Irish Wheelchair Association but particularly because there is a very active centre for independent living in my constituency in Thurles under the driving determination and guidance of Mr. Jim Casey.  It is one of the most positive things that has happened in Irish society in recent times.</P>
      <P>Fifty years ago people with disabilities were looked upon as different.  They were people who had to be cared for, provided for and were dependent on what we could do for them.  That may have been acceptable to earlier generations but with enlightenment, we have come to appreciate that that is not the full story.  It is not even the beginning of the story because each person with or without disability is entitled to fulfil his or her aims and priorities independent of the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lovely Irish expression &mdash; Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine. We are dependent on each other; we live in each other's shadow.  That is fine in the sense of positive dependence on each other but the significant thing about this movement is that, for the first time, people with physical disabilities are determined to make a positive contribution not just to their own development but to the development of society. I want to bring to the attention of this House the significance of this movement and the potential that is there for the betterment of these people but also the active contribution that they can <Col N="84" /> make to society.  It is no longer the case that we can tell them what is good for them and that they depend on us.  We want to promote their independence; they want to promote their independence. While our good intentions will always be appreciated, the time has come when their intentions should be considered.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1940's there was an outbreak of polio and TB.  The people who contracted those illnesses were not distant unknowns; they were the kids next door or the young adults in our households. This meant that ordinary people were affected directly and indirectly by this disability.  This led to a positive development in line with other positive developments in Irish society &mdash; the arrival of the rehabilitation era and the desire to help people so that they could be fully integrated into society.</P>
    <P>That drive was underpinned by the growth of the charity movement and many of our major disability charities were founded in the early 1950s and 1960s.  I pay tribute to them for the great work they did.  During that time, there were cures for TB and polio and I pay tribute to all who were involved.  At that time curing people was the focus, perhaps understandably, rehabilitation was all about keeping warm, well fed, giving lots of physiotherapy and some education so that integration would be that much easier when you got &ldquo;better.&rdquo; Nowadays people with disabilities have realised that they do not necessarily get &ldquo;better&rdquo; in that sense.  They get better not only when their physical problem is dealt with but when they are in charge of their lives.  Only then will they acknowledge, and they are the judges, that they have got better.  Independent living means living like anyone else.  It means realising your potential, deciding what you want to do with your life and doing it.  There is nothing magical or confusing about it.</P>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues I have been stimulated, encouraged and inspired by this magnificent movement. There is a movement of people with disability and they know what is best for <Col N="85" /> them.  It does not matter what we tell them.  It is their lives and they should allowed to decide how to run them.  In practice, they are involved in the research, development and implementation of their own programmes.  Two or three key elements have to be put in place to bring this about and the Government have made a significant contribution in supporting it.</P>
    <P>The first key element is the concept of personal assistants, someone who would provide them with physical assistance. That personal assistant would work to the agenda of the person with disability, not my agenda or that of the Minister.  Assistance in that sense means a method of working.  A personal assistant's role would be to assist the person to realise what they know to be best for themselves, not to provide care.  The personal assistant enables a person with a disability to make their own decisions, to be in control of their own life and to be seen in every sense to be equal and as fulfilled as the rest of society.</P>
    <P>With the launched of the INCARE programme in 1992, 29 people with disabilities were allowed to employ their own PAs.  For the first time they were able to live like everybody else.  They were no longer dependent on their families, although they have close ties with them.  Incidentally, I am not trying to break that close link or their important links with neighbours or institutions. They were not dependent exclusively. They had the opportunity to stop feeling as if they were a burden and I know this from their communications with me. Instead, they began to feel they had a major contribution to make and having a PA makes a huge difference to them.</P>
    <P>This INCARE programme was a massive success and the statutory funding for those 29 leaders was provided by the current Minister for Health, for which I pay tribute to him.  He recognised the importance of this and acted on the recommendation of the PA advisory group.  Due to the success of the programme, there are now between 200 and 250 people throughout Ireland who would benefit from that service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> The establishment of an independent living fund is crucial if these people are to reach the potential of their fellow citizens.  This fund must be established immediately and on a permanent basis. It would be a secure consumer controlled fund because the person with the disability would use it to employ these personal assistants.  &ldquo;Secure&rdquo; means that the fund would be permanent and put in place on that footing by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health's report on the advisory group of personal assistants for people with significant disabilities recommended that funding of £5 million should be phased in over a three year period from 1996-98 for the development of all personal assistant services for people with disabilities.  I am privileged to propose that an independent living fund be established on a permanent basis.  I am sure the Minister's response will be positive but we must continue to highlight the matter. Those who regulate and control the fund should be the people with disabilities who are uniquely equipped to determine how it should be used.  When the fund is effective, not only will people with disabilities no longer be seen as an element for which we must provide &mdash; far from it &mdash; from what I know of the dynamism and inspired commitment of these people, they will probably spend at least as much time looking after us as was ever expected of us looking after them.</P>

      <P>The establishment of an independent living fund is being proposed by some organisations representing people with disabilities as a means of financing the provision of a personal assistance service.  This service enables people with disabilities to live independently with the use of a personal assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of a personal assistant service was first made through INCARE, a two-year Horizon funded action research programme run by the Centre for Independent Living.  When <Col N="87" /> INCARE ended in December 1994, the Minister for Health agreed to fund the continuation of this service on a pilot basis to the existing participants pending an examination by an advisory group of the future provision of personal assistance services.</P>
    <P>The advisory group agreed that the independent living model can offer a higher degree of social gain to some individuals than the residential model. The group felt that PA services were primarily a matter of income support rather than the provision of a health-social service and, accordingly, recommended that funding should be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  However, it decided not to recommend the immediate introduction of a PA allowance, one of the reasons being that it wished to await the conclusions of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which is examining the issue of income support in detail.  The group also explored the option of establishing an independent living fund for full PA services which would be funded through the Departments of Social Welfare, Education and Health but considered that this would be too cumbersome to administer.</P>
    <P>In the short term, the group recommended that funding for personal assistance services be provided through the Department of Health except where personal assistants are required for third level education.  However, it considered it essential that any independent living scheme be properly structured and administered.  Accordingly, the report's recommendations on the provision of a personal assistance service include the matter of funding and the introduction of a procedure to assess the dependency and levels of service needs of each applicant as well as to determine the capacity of the applicant to manage a personal assistant.</P>
    <P>The PA service is one element of a much broader range of services required by people with disabilities.  As recommended by the advisory group, the provision of personal assistance services is <Col N="88" /> being examined by the Review Group on Services for People with a Physical or Sensory Disability as part of a review of the broader service needs of people with physical disabilities.  Its report will be published shortly.  In the meantime the existing personal assistant service will continue to be State funded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In Mallow, 180 pupils and eight teachers have spent the past decade in prefabricated buildings.  Gaelscoil Thomás Dáibhis is just one of the many primary schools whose pupils are expected to learn in appalling physical conditions.  They are accommodated in prefabricated temporary structures; and &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; is the key word here as ten years is a long time for pupils and teachers to put up with temporary accommodation.</P>
      <P>Last year Gaelscoil Thomás Dáibhis was included in the Department of Education's capital expenditure programme and was earmarked for a new building. This year, I understand the Department has been negotiating with Cork County Council for the purchase of a site at Summerhill adjacent to the vocational education committee land.  It is vital that building work commences as soon as possible on this project.  Neither pupils nor teachers can be expected to put up with the current situation for much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis is not the only example of underfunding and long fingering in the primary sector.  The greatest inequalities in our education system are not at third level &mdash; as some would have us believe &mdash; but at primary level.  In many parts of this country <Col N="89" /> approximately half of our children leave school with no qualification, let alone a degree.  That is a damning indictment of our education system.</P>
    <P>Our so called free system of primary education is anything but free.  It is estimated that a primary education can cost parents approximately £3,000.  Our primary class sizes continue to be among the highest in the EU and the ratio in our infant classes is the worst in the OECD.  At primary level, Ireland spends less than half <i>per capita</i> than Germany, Sweden, Switzerland or the United States.  However, tremendous work is being done by the parents of the pupils in Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis.  For every £1 spent on primary education, we are spending £4.41 on third level education. This is an imbalance which, in the OECD, is exceeded only by Hungary.</P>
    <P>Our primary students are expected to learn in a physical environment which ranges from the decrepit to the dangerous. It is unacceptable that in 1996 we still have primary schools without adequate indoor sanitation.  It is also unacceptable that, as we approach the 21st century, almost a quarter of primary schools lack a supply of drinking water and that 64 per cent do not have access to a typewriter let alone a computer.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left believes in a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. We believe that access to third level education will remain inequitable until all children have equal access to a solid foundation at primary level.  Phasing out these so-called temporary structures and replacing them with modern, purpose built learning environments would be a step in the right direction.  I appeal to the Minister to use all her influence to expedite the provision of adequate accommodation for the pupils and teachers of Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis.  I also pay tribute to the parents who have campaigned for a new building and who <Col N="90" /> have ensured that this issue is not allowed to slip down the agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Sherlock for raising this matter. It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to clarify the position.  Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis was established with temporary recognition in 1985 to meet a demand in the Mallow area for education through the medium of Irish.  Permanent recognition was granted to the school in May 1990. The school is located in prefabricated accommodation, which is less than satisfactory, adjacent to Mallow Vocational School.  An application from the school for minor improvement works is being examined in the Department as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Department accepts that the existing accommodation is not adequate for the school's needs and that permanent accommodation is required.  There are two options for the provision of permanent accommodation for gaelscoileanna. One is to provide a new school building on a new site, and the other is to secure existing primary school accommodation which has become surplus to requirements due to falling enrolments, as in the case of Mallow. Where there is surplus existing accommodation which is suitable and can be made available for a gaelscoil, the Department must give it serious consideration as an alternative to the cost of a new site and building.  The Senator will appreciate that the Department must make the most effective use of public moneys, particularly at a time when the demand for capital expenditure exceeds available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the urgent need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis, the Department is also examining the acquisition of a site.  A potential site, which was identified by the board of management of the gaelscoil, has been inspected by a Department <Col N="91" /> architect and is considered generally suitable.  The Department has been in contact with the owners of the site regarding its availability.  The site, however, does not have direct road access and the question of arranging such through an adjacent site is being examined at present.  The Senator can <Col N="92" /> be assured that the question of providing permanent accommodation for the school is being treated as a matter of urgency in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 June 1996.</P>
