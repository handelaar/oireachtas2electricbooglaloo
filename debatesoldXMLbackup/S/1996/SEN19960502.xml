      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 1 p.m. when there will be sos, and item 2, Second Stage only, will be taken at 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us.  With regard to the nurses' pay negotiations, it would be a shame and an injustice to nurses if they are forced to strike for decent pay.  I ask the Leader to convey our view to the Minister for Health that it would not be looked upon kindly if the Government allows a situation to develop where the nurses have to strike to get a decent wage for their vocation.  It is in everybody's interest that the funding be found to ensure the nurses can carry on working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's remarks about the nursing profession. I appeal to the Leader to do whatever can be done to resolve this matter.  Nurses do a difficult and important job and a system should be found to resolve the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon the Taoiseach will launch a document on the public service. The difficulties in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry with <Col N="242" /> regard to the operational schemes as a result of a dispute with the CPSU were discussed on the Adjournment last night, and there are difficulties with the shift workers in the ESB.  Perhaps all these matters could be incorporated in to a debate on the public service and the semi-State sector in the next couple of weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators Wright and Dardis in their remarks on the nurses' dispute.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to take action before the matter escalates and avoid chaos in hospitals.  Clashes are looming between the unions and the Government in a whole range of areas.  The dispute affecting farmers' payments has already caused chaos in the farming community and there are difficulties looming in the ESB.  We are facing serious industrial unrest and I am amazed the Labour Party has allowed this situation to develop.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Members of the House have broken their silence on the nurses pay problem. Perhaps they are not aware of the nurses vote this morning which was supposed to be a four to one rejection, but the nurses have rejected the Government's offer by about nine to one.  It is <Col N="243" /> a sensational result which is the culmination of years and years of putting nurses at the bottom of the pile and leaving them as serfs in the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not only have a debate on the nurses' claim, because that would be closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  We should have had such a debate months ago when we knew this issue would arise. However, we put our heads in the sand hoping they would accept this deal, which they have not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance should come to the House to tell us about their plans for the public service and public service pay in the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we are talking about the nurses' dispute, I ask the Leader for an overall discussion on employment.  While we spoke about Packard Electric yesterday, Senator O'Sullivan suggested that we find time to discuss the report issued by the Department of Enterprise and Employment on employment opportunities.  We have asked for a discussion on European Monetary Union on a number of <Col N="244" /> occasions.  The question of monetary union is not being discussed and, like other items relating to Europe, we often leave it until the last moment.  There is a clear link between employment and European Monetary Union.  I am not suggesting one debate, but two and I urge the Leader to find time in the near future for both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to item 11, Statements on the International Fund for Ireland, and item 24, a motion in the name of Fianna Fáil Senators relating to Border county funding. While I know we can place item 24 on the Order of Business, I would like to know when the Leader proposes to resume the debate on item 11.  The report published yesterday during a meeting of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body, which was subscribed to by the Irish as well as the British, reached a conclusion in relation to the existing ratio of funding between North and South.  For the information of Members, 75 per cent of the fund goes to the North, while 25 per cent goes to the Border counties.  I and many of my colleagues in the Border counties have, both in this House and as far away as Washington, tried to get this ratio reduced in favour of the southern Border counties which have suffered the ravages of economic neglect not only over the past 25 years but since the foundation of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, it is timely to resume those statements.  Perhaps the report of the body or a synopsis could be made available to Members to help inform them as to how southern Irish participants came to this conclusion to which I vehemently object.  It is an insult to the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement was circulated to Members by Patrick Mason, artistic director of the Abbey Theatre.  Will we have an opportunity to debate the implications of this unprecedented departure <Col N="245" /> into the public domain by the artistic director of the national theatre who expressed concern about its continued viability?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for a resolution to the nurses' dispute.  Someone said the reason the Minister cannot give in is because there would be a rash of other claims as people will want to retain their differential, which is sad.  Nursing is one of the best professions and it should lead the way.  Without nurses many people would face serious difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have a debate on the opening hours of licensed premises? We have a problem in relation to alcohol abuse for which our licensing laws are responsible.  I would like to see the same opening hours apply to all premises because the present system militates against small pubs in rural areas and in the cities.  It gives an advantage to clubs and hotels which can get extensions.  Nobody should be able to get an extension and closing for all pubs should be 12 p.m. or 1 p.m.  In the interests of fair play for pubs and the tourism industry, a debate is needed on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Senator Ross would jump into the breach with boring predictability in that if he spoke about nurses he would have to speak about teachers.  In the area of industrial relations I agree with the point made by Senator Wright and other Senators about the need to deal with issues.  I caution both sides of the House that Governments come and go and remaining problems must be dealt with.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> has been through three different Governments and existing problems may be dealt with by this or the next Government, which would have a different complexion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> There is a lot to be said for a discussion on public pay policy.  There is no doubt that nurses are underpaid &mdash; there is consensus on that.  However, the ins an outs of it should not be used for political purposes.  It is clear that the process of change will be difficult in all areas.  Irish society is in a state of flux and there is a strong case for a discussion on public pay and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to see how they fit into a Government plan and strategy.  I urge the Leader to facilitate such an agreement so that people can appreciate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view that there should be a full debate.  It should not boil down to easy answers for anybody. People will have to find a way forward and we should support nurses and other groups having difficulty coming to terms with a lot of changes in society. We must put together deals which will make that easier for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The main issue was raised by the Leader of the Opposition on nurses' pay.  Sentiments expressed on all sides will be conveyed.  The best way to discuss this matter would be to follow on from Senator O'Toole's very helpful contribution, that is, to table the document being launched by the Taoiseach today on future developments in the public service.  That document would give us a framework within which the other issues raised could be debated, particularly when looking at the future of the issues indicated by Senator O'Toole.</P>
      <P>In the course of his characteristically helpful contribution, Senator Ross said that there had not been a debate on the nurses' situation, but he did not ask for one.  Senator Ross knows that whatever he asks for, I agree to it.  If he had asked me, we could have had that debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of the report on the Abbey Theatre.  I have had no request for a debate on that matter.  Senator Farrell raised a valid point on licensing hours which many of us believe are anachronistic and discriminate against some of the enterprises he mentioned.  I would be willing to have a debate on that subject if the House believes it would be helpful.  I have not lost sight of Senator Quinn's request for a debate on European Monetary Union.  If I can arrange that after the Finance Bill, 1996, I will do so.</P>
      <P>I could provide time for Members who are on the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body to report to us on the substantial events at Adare.  I am sure the matter to which Senator Mooney referred would be raised.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Refugee Bill, 1995: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the interpretation section.  There are certain items which could have been defined but are not.  An example is the issue of public order as against public policy.  There is mention of &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; elsewhere in the Bill but it is a concept which could have been included in this section.  We are talking about refugees who arrive at the frontier.  This can mean several things to a refugee.  It could mean the beach in Dingle, the international lounge in Dublin Airport or landing on an Irish registered ship in territorial waters.  If somebody is born on an Irish registered ship in foreign waters they can validly claim Irish citizenship.  What is the frontier? As we go through the Bill we will find other parts which could more appropriately have been included in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to echo what Senator Mulcahy said, particularly <Col N="248" /> about public policy.  I would also like to refer to a matter in which I have a substantial interest &mdash; and I praise the Minister for including it in the Bill.  This is the extremely important question of sexual orientation.  I fought long and difficult battles in this House to get it included.  I met with considerable resistance, in particular from the then Minister for Justice and some of the civil servants who advised him.</P>
      <P>I will illustrate why I think this is important and why its inclusion by the Minister is a progressive measure.  I will refer to an article by Mr. Peter Tatchell, who is sometimes regarded as a fire-brand but who has done some extremely good research in this area.  I place this in the context of the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, particularly in the Middle East but also in Asia and certain communities in Europe.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with a high powered delegation from the so-called Iranian Parliament, which I do not regard as democratic.  I read into the record of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the kind of extraordinary and brutal torture and murder which is inflicted on people accused of homosexuality and lesbianism.  This can sometimes be a political accusation, as has historically been the case going back to the Middle Ages when certain Christian interests used such an accusation to justify the murder of political opponents. This is continuing in Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the committee some of the details, with which I have been made familiar, of the way people accused of this sexual orientation were treated in Iran.  This meeting of the committee sadly took place on the day the late Mr. Brian Lenihan died.  It was decided out of respect to go into closed session.  I regret this and I think Brian Lenihan would also have regretted it because he was an extremely practical man and would have said &ldquo;Let the business go ahead&rdquo;.  This was a pity because the Irish people were deprived of the spectacle of the members of the Iranian delegation sniggering when I introduced this issue and then defending the kind <Col N="249" /> of butchery about which I spoke.  They did not deny or make any apology for this.  They said these people are abnormal, this is the way they should be treated and this is the will of God.  I would like the House to know the way they are treated.</P>
    <P>In his article Peter Tatchell wrote:</P>
    <P>The method of killing lesbians and gays in Iran, as prescribed by Islamic leaders, are: beheading with a sword, stoning to death, burning alive and throwing from a mountain top or high building.  The death penalty applies not only to sodomy, but also to other sexual acts such as mutual masturbation and body rubbing on the fourth offence.  The mere act of two people of the same sex lying naked together &ldquo;without any necessity&rdquo; is a crime punishable by up to 99 lashes. One man kissing another, even &ldquo;without lust&rdquo;, merits 60 lashes.  These floggings can cause permanent injury to internal organs, severe bleeding and sometimes death.</P>
    <P>The Iranian authorities stepped up their crusade against homosexuality in 1990, with a wave of public executions.  On the first day of the new crackdown, three gay men were beheaded in a city square in Nahavand, and two women accused of lesbianism were stoned to death in Langrood. Justifying these killings, the Iranian Chief Justice, Morteza Moghtadai, declared: &ldquo;The religious punishment for the despicable act of homosexuality is death for both parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously, Ayatollah Ali Khameni denounced &ldquo;homosexuality, male and female&rdquo;.  He condemned Britain and the United States for promoting gay relationships, [Mrs. Thatcher, no doubt, would have been amused] falsely claiming the two countries had legalised marriages between persons of the same sex. Homosexuality was, he said, a symptom of the decay and corruption of western culture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> His colleague, Ayatollah Musavi-Ardebili, demanded the strict enforcement of Islamic punishments for lesbian and gay sex.  Describing procedures for the execution of homosexuals, he told students at Teheran University: &ldquo;They should seize him (or her), they should keep him standing, they should split him in two with a sword, they should either cut off his neck or they should split him from the head...  After he is dead, they bring logs, make a fire and place the corpse on the logs, set fire to it and burn it.  Or it should be taken to the top of a mountain and thrown down.  Then the parts of the corpse should be gathered together and burnt.  Or they should dig a hole, make a fire in the hole and throw him alive into the fire.</P>

      <P>Senator, you are making a Second Stage speech rather than speaking on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  I am making an extremely important point which I was deprived of the opportunity of doing at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs because it went into private session.  I wish, with your indulgence, to read one more sentence.  The article continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We do not have such punishments for other offences&rdquo;, boasted the Ayatollah. &ldquo;There cannot be the slightest degree of mercy or compassion... Praise be to God&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for this reason that I should be allowed to express the sincere thanks of gay people, not just in Ireland but throughout the world, and also of all decent, civilised and tolerant people for the significant advance in including sexual orientation in the Bill.  It is important that we realise this is not just a token gesture; it deals with a real situation which is being confronted on a global basis.  The torture and persecution of gay people is something of which the Iranians are not just unashamed but actively proud.  They <Col N="251" /> gloat and snigger when they are confronted with their misdeeds in this area. I sincerely thank the Minister for including this important phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I praise the Minister for the broad interpretation she has put in the Bill and I am glad she has stated that people sometimes have to be protected irrespective of gender.  For example, in a recent appeal in the United States a teenage girl was granted asylum because she feared genital mutilation in an African country.  I am grateful to the Minister for having put this section, and the section that Senator Norris mentioned, into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State indicate the difference between authorised officers, as defined here, and immigration officers?  I am sure they are not one and the same person, so can she indicate what each one's function is?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State also indicate the number of regulations and extended regulations that are likely to be made apart from the Bill itself?  Most Members are aware that regulations occasionally can be more extensive than a Bill itself.  I presume the intention is to make a number of specific regulations arising from this, so can the Minister of State indicate their extent, when they will be made, the areas they are likely to cover and whether we will have an opportunity to debate them here?</P>
      <P>Section 24 deals with programme refugees but that does not appear to be defined within the definitions.  Is there a reason for that?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to the point about public order raised by Senator Mulcahy.  It is crucial that the Bill should contain an interpretation of public order.  I had intended tabling an amendment to section 4 of the Bill <Col N="252" /> which is the first place in which it is mentioned.  There was a long debate on Committee Stage in the Lower House.  I did not have the opportunity to go through it, although I considered the Minister's reply to it.  I have to say, although not in a nasty way, that there was some confusion about the Minister's answer in some parts of which public order was confused with public policy.</P>
      <P>Having checked the definition of public order in a recent edition of Murdoch's <i>Dictionary of Irish Law</i> I decided not to table an amendment because the Minister was, in fact, correct.  To enforce that argument I obtained a 1988 edition of the same dictionary from the Oireachtas Library.  While I do not have the current dictionary definition of public order with me, from memory it is different to this one, which deals with &ldquo;evidence of matters which may not be given on the grounds that the disclosure would affect the security of the State or the administration of justice&rdquo;.  The current definition in the 1994 or 1995 edition of the dictionary refers to the fact that the whole issue of public policy &ldquo;would be injurious to the security of the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is one side of it, but there is also confusion among lawyers over interpretation. I recognise that it is a difficult issue.  There are reasonable people in this House and we are not raising issues in order to be mischievous, but there is a problem with this definition.  The Minister can hammer this out and argue over it for the remainder of the debate, otherwise the Government may lose the vote if it comes right down to it.  There is a genuine problem over what is meant by public order and public policy.  The &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; wording in the Geneva Convention seems to translate very closely into the area of public order as I understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in that if the Minister does not insert a definition of public policy, there is another more colloquial interpretation of it which, in effect, refers to the policy of the Administration of the time.  That is also a correct <Col N="253" /> usage of the term.  Therefore, unless the Minister puts a definition into section 1, it will be open to that misinterpretation. It will also be open to difficulty whenever it is challenged in court. If someone seeks a judicial review of a decision taken under the very sections of this legislation, this matter will definitely arise.</P>
    <P>To prove my point I will take a completely ridiculous example following Senator Norris' references to sexual orientation.  If a particular country decided that a Moslem couple had contravened public policy by refusing to accept equality for women, then &mdash;despite that country's discrimination, as we would see it &mdash; the couple would not be entitled to remain in that country. There are all sorts of interpretations of public policy regarding racist laws elsewhere and, although this legislation mainly affects Ireland, the third country debate could widen out to other areas.</P>
    <P>An argument can be made for having a definition of public order inserted in the Bill.  The final, technical and political reason for so doing is that it would defuse the argument we will have throughout this Bill's passage over what is meant by public policy and public order.  Since both terms are used in the Bill, it is crucial for the Minister to insert a definition.  If that were done, neither I nor Senator Mulcahy could claim it meant something else.  Once the Bill states what it means there cannot be any confusion, nor can it be used as an argument in a judicial review or in any interpretation of this legislation that may have to take place when it becomes law.  The Minister should return on Report Stage with a definition of public policy.  The Minister's definition will be acceptable to us because we are only seeking clarity.</P>

      <P>To take up Senator Mulcahy's point, the concept of frontiers is well established as being the ports or borders of a country.  Approximately one fifth of those seeking asylum here do so at our frontiers &mdash; in other words at our ports or Border.  The parliamentary draftsman is the expert in drawing up Bills and decides what is appropriate to be defined in the Bill.  The concept of frontier is well established in international law.  The Senator may be interested in the fact that approximately four-fifths of asylum seekers are already in the country when they apply.  In other words they are people who, sometime after arriving here, go to the Department of Justice to make an application for asylum.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his comments on the definition of particular social groups.  As the Senator is aware, this Bill had its genesis in an earlier Bill in 1994.  I read carefully the debates and contributions made by various people inside the Oireachtas and outside.  It seemed that the Geneva Convention, which was framed in 1951, did not take specific account of three groups where persecution, by virtue of membership of a particular social group, could lead someone to have a valid case for asylum. The first group related to people involved in a trade union, the second related to people of a particular sexual orientation and the third involved the issue of gender.  Since I took office as Minister of State at the Department of Justice I have examined applications from time to time and it seems that there is an absolute need to broaden the definition of the words &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and &ldquo;social group&rdquo; to include these groups.</P>
      <P>The Senator spoke eloquently about the persecution of people of a particular sexual orientation because of that orientation. That matter is now well documented internationally.  In that context, I hope the Bill, when passed into law, will act as a trigger for this issue to be taken into account in other states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Henry pointed out that there are well documented cases where women in certain countries can face persecution, or processes which amount to persecution, just because they were girls or women.  The same point arises in the case of members of trade unions.</P>
      <P>In terms of the Geneva Convention, it must be understood that, as we move toward more broadly based concepts of human rights, religious and cultural traditions do not excuse persecution.  This is a matter for ongoing debate among international fora and it is here that we should strike our mark.  There should be accepted norms in relation to human rights, and cultural and religious tradition are no excuse for violation of those norms.</P>

      <P>In relation to the points made by Senator Daly, an authorised officer is, in the context of the Bill, an officer of the commissioner involved in the application process and the hearing of the application.

    <P>I appreciate Senator O'Toole's concerns in relation to public order or the translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; and the question of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.  This matter will be dealt with in some detail by amendments Nos. 2, 25, 30 and 36. Therefore, I will not enter into a debate on the subject at this time.  The question of translating &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; in the Geneva Convention was raised by the relevant Dáil committee and I sought the advice of the Attorney General as a result.  I am satisfied, having carefully examined the matter and taken into account where &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is used <Col N="256" /> as a translation for &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; that &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is the correct translation. However, I take the Senator's point that in popular parlance &mdash; in some cases, not all, but in the European Treaties, for example &mdash; the translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There was a lengthy debate on this on Committee Stage and a number of the members of the committee who are members of the legal profession were quite satisfied that &ldquo;public order&rdquo; has a much narrower meaning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the <i>ad lib</i> comments made by some colleagues. However, I appreciate that the Minister of State is acting on advice she received which she indicated she would provide to us at a later stage.  As Senator O'Toole stated, this section involves definitions.  Every word or phrase in its natural and ordinary meaning are capable of being defined.  If they cannot be should not be included in any document because people will not understand them.  To a certain extent we are caught because we would be happier if the Minister of State gave a commitment that she would put in a definition of &ldquo;public order&rdquo; on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I have received documentation from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees which includes a commentary on the preparatory papers by Dr. Paul Weis, published by the Cambridge University Press in 1955.  The title of that commentary is <i>Extracts from the Refugee convention</i> 1951 &mdash;<i>Travails Preparatoirs.</i> The issue of the meaning of the term &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; was considered at length by the drafting committee, which stated that while several members expressed dissatisfaction with the vagueness of the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo; and the vagueness given to the term in different countries, it was felt necessary to take into account the jurisprudence which this term had acquired in certain systems of law.  The committee went on to state that the proviso relating to national security, particularly that relating to public order, seemed to the Egyptian representative's organisation to be far too vague and consequently harmful to the interests of refugees.  The committee also stated that these provisions should be very clearly defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK representative stated that the expression &ldquo;public order&rdquo; presented definite difficulties in common law countries which did not possess the same legal connotation in continental <Col N="258" /> jurisprudence.  I am sure the Minister will agree this is a difficult area. However, it is all the more difficult because the effect of including the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; in the Bill could have the ultimate effect of negativing the import and intention of the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>I will not quote recent controversial cases, but it is well known that a gentleman from a Middle Eastern country was initially refused asylum in the United Kingdom recently and it subsequently transpired that the main ground for refusing his asylum application was public policy.  The British Government was afraid of losing business and commerce with a certain Middle Eastern country.</P>
    <P>A broadly known public policy in Ireland is that we seek to improve and increase the prosperity of this country through international trade.  If the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; are included in the Bill, it would open the door to the possibility that a Minister could say asylum cannot be granted to a person on the grounds that we will lose business with another country.  It is easy to gloss over this issue and accept the Minister's reassurances.  If the Minister agreed, I would be happy to leave the definition section in abeyance for now and move on to the next section.  The Minister could reflect further on this matter before we returned to it.  It is the strong view of this side that the phrase &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is too broad and capable of abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody thinks the United Nations Commission for Refugees is being partisan by just briefing Fianna Fáil, and Senator Mulcahy in particular, all Members received the briefing material.  I make this point so it does not appear any group is receiving special favour.  The same applies to the amendments.  We all received briefing documentation; it is not a bagatelle in terms of what gets in first.  All the information is useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the argument effectively made by Senator Mulcahy.  I remember the case in Britain, which involved <Col N="259" /> Saudi Arabia.  Considerable pressure was brought to bear on the United Kingdom authorities to deny asylum for political reasons.  It was subsequently found that this was not justified and the man was eventually allowed to stay.  By including the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, the Minister is opening up the possibility of pressure from external sources operating on or through the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This is extremely dangerous and there is no doubt that pressure will be applied.  The Minister will have no excuse or alibi which would allow her or him to say that only public order is mentioned in the Bill and there is no provision for political pressure groups.  However, these will be provided for if the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; are included.  This is most dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister ably made the case for our side by indicating that policy may change and that it may have something to do with Irishness.  It is not appropriate to have these types of mutable concepts everlastingly brought into play in terms of political pressure.  The Minister has been badly advised, but she is not the first to have been incorrectly advised by officials in the Department of Justice &mdash; I am not referring to the officials in the House.  Misinformation was given in the past and I was in a position to contradict it by putting factual material on record of the House.  I can indicate in previous debates where advice was incorrectly, although not maliciously, provided.  I am sure no Member of the House needs to be reminded that even Attorneys General have been known to give inadequate or inaccurate advice which was subsequently challenged.</P>
    <P>Members of the House received extensive briefings from interest groups, such as Amnesty International, the Refugee Council and the Rescue Trust. My information is that &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; means public order.  I do not have many qualifications, but I speak a little French and I used to teach English.  It is a reasonable assumption that &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; means public order.  If that is not <Col N="260" /> the case, will the Minister explain why that meaning is accepted in all European Union countries?  There are precedents in the Irish administration where the phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is already translated in the European convention as public order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is translated in the European Convention as public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept it if the Minister is stating that as a fact. Perhaps I misunderstood my notes.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this matter, as do Senator Mulcahy and Senator O'Toole, but I hope it will not be pushed to a vote at this point for technical reasons.  If there is a vote, it will be the end of the matter.  It is much better to reason it out now and give the Minister room to manoeuvre if we manage to convince her to introduce an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  It also gives Members the opportunity to gather troops to ensure that, if she does not introduce such an amendment, the Government can be defeated.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why this is a problem?  I hope I am not straying too far from the section but I wish to illustrate where this matter will operate subsequently in the Bill.  Section 18(5) allows the Minister a discretion to refuse permission to enter or reside in the State to a family member on the grounds of public policy as well as public order.  The words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; are also a cause of concern and it must be assumed they were intended to refer to public order.  If so, the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; should replace &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 (1) (g) allows for revocation of a declaration on the grounds of public policy as well as public order. It must be also assumed that this was intended to refer to public order and it should be accordingly amended.  The power of revocation of a declaration and the issue of a notice requiring an asylum seeker to leave the State should lie with the appeal board following a re-examination of the facts of a particular case and the hearing of representations <Col N="261" /> by or on behalf of the applicant for asylum. If the intentions of the convention are to be met, it should not lie with a Minister.</P>
    <P>These are two practical examples where there could be a possible malign application of the phrase &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; as included in the Bill.  I do not suspect the current Minister or Administration in that regard; I do not think it is in the Irish character to do it. However, the possibility will be there if this phrase is in the Bill.  It provides a possibility for the most dangerous type of external political interference in the welfare of asylum seekers, and that is inappropriate.  There are certain definitions of who should be entitled to refugee status and granted asylum.  This matter should be decided on clear grounds, determined by the immediate personal circumstances of the person applying and not on questions of policy. I cannot imagine an argument against this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible, we try to work through a spirit of co-operation in this House.  However, I am getting the impression that the Minister has set her face against accepting any amendment to this legislation.  If that is the case, then so be it and we will go through the Bill in a manner of conflict and confrontation.  That is not the tradition of this House, but if that is the only way it can be done then so be it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has by her own words accepted that there is some confusion about this terminology; but on the other hand she said she understands it perfectly. I am sure both herself and her Department understand it.  The Minister said it had been debated at length in this and the other House.  That is true. However, it is of no value in terms of admissibility of evidence if this ever came under judicial review or consideration in the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that she received the legal advice of the Attorney General to guide her, on which she based her decision.  While that is all very well, it is of no use to the <Col N="262" /> rest of us or to people down the line. The Minister said there are differences of interpretation throughout Europe on this issue.  Since this is a complex international matter, with special regard to European countries, and taking into account the global impact of this legislation, that is another reason why there should be no doubts about it.  The Minister is not being asked by anybody on this side of the House to change anything in this Bill but to put into it what she says is the fact.  We are asking her to eliminate the confusion and ensure there can be no doubt down the line by putting what she feels is the interpretation into section 1.</P>
    <P>I vehemently disagree with the Minister's first point, that the draftspersons decide what should be part of the interpretation section.  That is incorrect.  The Houses of the Oireachtas decide which words need interpretation, not the draftspersons.  Draftspersons draft; we amend, modify, change, accept etc.</P>
    <P>It would not be our intention to push this section to a vote because we cannot afford to lose it.  If the Minister does not give us a guarantee to bring forward an amendment in her own words dealing with matters as she sees them and not changing the nature of the Bill in any way, we will be forced to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which will be fully supported by this side of the House.  That is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Our arguments are sincere and well reasoned.  The Minister should accept our position.  Putting in a definition in this section would save arguing about section 4 and the consequential changes down the line.  Once she has defined it, we no longer have an argument about the wording.  Our difficulty is not with the Minister's interpretation but that the words as they stand lead us to the view that they can be interpreted differently, and perhaps vexatiously.  For that reason I strongly urge the Minister at this stage to consider our arguments and undertake to bring back on Report Stage a definition that is acceptable to all.  There will be no difficulty about that because I do not hear any differences <Col N="263" /> between what the Minister says it does mean and what we say it should mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to pick up on a fundamental point made by Senator O'Toole.  I have not had to allude to the degree to which there is an anti-democratic ethos prevailing within Government for a while but I must do so again on this occasion.  The Senator is right in saying that we legislate and decide on these matters.  In these circumstances it behoves the Government to remember the voting balance in this Chamber.  I do not mind what legislation the Government brings before us &mdash; that is its right &mdash; but there is an increasing tendency on its part to believe that the Executive decides and we are only required to rubber stamp its decisions.  That is not the case and long may it remain so.</P>
      <P>The very nature of the debate underlines the need to clarify the situation within the legislation.  There seems to be different definitions of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  Therefore, why is it not possible within the ambit of the legislation to define the term so there is no confusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Government is coming to this matter with a liberal perspective.  It is the intention of the legislation to ensure that persecuted people are afforded asylum within the country.  If that is the case, it strikes me as even more necessary to clarify what is meant by these terms.  If we do not do this, it is open to some less enlightened Minister and Administration to use them at their discretion.  I am worried on the occasions when we get the Attorney General's definition because frequently in the past his ruling has proven to be incorrect.  If we are approaching this from a liberal perspective, that persecuted people need to be taken into the country, then this is an important matter.  Why is it necessary to define &ldquo;the Geneva Convention&rdquo; and then to include it in the body of the Bill when it is clear from the Bill what it is?  Why is it necessary to define &ldquo;information&rdquo;, a much less clear cut term, &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo;<Col N="264" /> and &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; and not define this term?  The debate has underlined absolutely the need for clarity on this matter.  It will be open to some Minister at some stage to be discretionary and to exclude people who should otherwise be allowed into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to this concern. This House is anxious to support, strengthen and help this progressive Bill.  On those grounds, I have serious concern with anything in that Bill about which there is a doubt.</P>
      <P>I was involved in a Supreme Court case in 1970 over the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; under Article 40 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court eventually made a decision on the basis of the Irish language.  It was seeking &ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; and it found that the word used in the Constitution was &ldquo;idirdhealaím&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;distinguish between&rdquo;, not &ldquo;discriminate against&rdquo;.  If there is a doubt about a word, it is bad law and legislation. We are not talking about section 4 and the difference between &ldquo;public order&rdquo; and &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; but the meaning of &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If we are asking, in the interpretation in section 1, to explain &ldquo;applicant&rdquo;, we should be able to know the exact meaning of &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.  It is an essential point if we are to make this legislation strong, one about which there will be no doubt, which will be able to stand up in court and about which those whom this Bill is designed to support will have its strengths rather than its weaknesses.  I urge the Minister to tell the House that she will bring in a clear definition of &ldquo;policy&rdquo; on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just made a request to some assistants to provide me with a convincing precedent of the translation of this phrase.  I hope to be in a position later in the day to put this precedent on the record, although I am not certain if that is possible.  I am making every effort to do so because it is only fair if one makes assertions, as I have done, to be able to substantiate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> I wish to raise the question of what &ldquo;policy&rdquo; means.  This is the question that Senator Quinn raised so effectively, illustrating it by reference to the fact that the Constitution of Ireland is effective in the first national tongue, and the phraseology used in that language is the significant legal one.  Where there is a variance, the Irish version takes precedence. That indicates the very significant importance of having clear definitions: they may become subject to doubt.  In terms of policy, Ministers and Governments are human.  I do not want it to be thought that any of us were attacking this particular Attorney General, who is an extremely decent man, as were virtually all his predecessors. We are not doubting this Attorney General; we are saying that Attorneys General in the past have given bad advice, as have politicians.  Politicians have made dubious decisions in the past in policy areas.  One need only look, for example, at the passports for sale situation where policies clearly came into matters of the determination of who should be sold Irish citizenship.  If this can happen in matters of Irish citizenship, I do not see why it should not happen as a result of political pressure with regard to the granting of asylum.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy made the case very effectively about the Saudi Arabian man who was denied asylum in the neighbouring jurisdiction, not on grounds of public order, which would have been legitimate, but clearly on terms of public policy, because of the self interest of the Conservative Government in maintaining good relations with the Saudi Arabian regime, which is most certainly not a democracy.  It is a highly religious regime, no doubt, but it is not a democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to assuage certain fears and concerns widely held by those organisations which service the needs of refugees.  For example, I have been prompted to ask whether there is a public policy, for example, in existence at the moment or a <i>rapprochement</i> between Ireland and Vietnam to such <Col N="266" /> an extent that for reasons of trade, Vietnamese family reunification is being halted.  Refugee agencies appear to believe that the Government has no intention of reuniting the number of families seeking it because it does not want to alienate the existing Vietnamese administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a long time in politics. She is a very experienced and able person, and must be aware of these kinds of pressure.  I remember going into a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs with my dear friends, the Iranians, and it was perfectly obvious that I was going to ask them about the treatment of the Baha'is, Jews, lesbians and gay men, the treatment of other minorities and the fatwah on Salman Rushdie, which I did. It was whispered to me that Government representatives were not seeking to limit my freedom of expression, but I was asked to for God's sake remember that £97 million worth of beef deals was riding on the meeting.  That was said to me to put the meeting into context.  I did not regard it as unwarranted pressure.  I thought it was a rather interesting consideration.</P>
    <P>I am a backbencher, and independent Member of the Oireachtas.  I can say whatever I please to anybody and I do; but if I was a Government Minister and I was asked to grant asylum to somebody who might cause trouble to the Iranians, the Vietnamese or somebody else, I might have a very good heart and very good intentions in this matter but I might become subject, even at Cabinet level, to very considerable pressure from the Minister for Finance, because another £97 million worth of beef deals would depend on our sucking up to the Iranians and their appalling murderous barbarous regime.  These are our areas of concern and we need to be very strongly reassured on them.  To date, with the best will in the world, the Minister has not reassured me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give another example of where policy pressures can override human rights considerations. <Col N="267" /> The House will remember that just over a year ago there was a major bombing in the United States in Oklahoma.  Following that there was a tremendous furore about bringing in anti-terrorist legislation, even though the people involved in the bombing appeared to have been American citizens.  I was in America when the legislation was being discussed in Congress and there was a tremendous sense of urgency about getting it through before the first anniversary of the bombing.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the President was apparently very much against one section of the Bill, which I will comment on now, as was Senator Edward Kennedy and a considerable number of other people within the American Congress, because of policy pressures they did not feel they were in a position to exclude this section of the Bill.  This section of the Bill is section 504 K and it deals with situations in which there is no right to ancillary relief.  Under this section, the judge is prevented from considering or providing for relief from removal based on asylum under section 208, the withholding of deportation under section 243 H, the suspension of deportation under section 244 (a) and 244 (e), the adjustment of status under section 245 or registry under section 249.  These are all sections which have to do with appeal.</P>
      <P>There was a considerable amount of concern when I was in the United States about this measure.  There was great pressure within the American legislature at the time to get this very strong anti-terrorist legislation through, but this provision was going to effect asylum seekers, a much larger group of people. I bring this to the attention of the House as another area where policy at a particular time has overridden any human rights considerations which even the most liberal of Governments might feel were much more serious aspects of the whole legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the various points they have made.  In relation to my attitude to the Bill, I have accepted amendments from Senators in a number of areas and I would not, therefore, accept the point made by Senator O'Toole that this Bill is not open to amendment.  I appreciate the concerns Senators are expressing about the translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;&mdash; Senator Quinn's point is particularly important here.  However, we have examined and given much thought to this, having taken legal advice from the Attorney General and others.  I think if one opts for the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo; one would defeat the case the Senators made.</P>
      <P>To take Senator Henry's argument about the United States, &ldquo;public order&rdquo;, which is concerned with law and order, would be a much stronger dictator of action in relation to the Oklahoma bombings, etc., than would the concept of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, which would include the fundamental rights provisions of the US Constitution.  The Senators would then be defeating their purpose.  This point was made particularly eloquently by one Member of the Dáil with whom I had a long and detailed discussion.  In the end, he came to share my view.  To quote from the Weis document, mentioned by Senator Mulcahy:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discrepancy between the English and French terms was recognised and debated extensively by the body which drafted the convention. The memorandum of the executive secretary to the conference of plenipotentiaries, <Col N="269" /> which adopted the convention relating to the status of refugees on the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo; [stated that] the Secretary General considers the use of this expression raises serious questions of substance and consequently feels obliged to draw the attention of the council to the following legal considerations. First, it should be observed that the English expression &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is not the equivalent and is indeed substantially different from the French expression &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; or in Spanish &ldquo;<i>ordem publico</i>&rdquo;.  In civil law countries the concept of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is a fundamental legal notion used principally as a basis for negating or restricting private agreements, the exercise of police power, or the application of foreign law.  The common law counterpart of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is not &ldquo;public order&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.  It is this concept which is employed in common law countries to invalidate or limit private agreements of the application of law. In contrast to this concept of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, the English expression &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is not a recognised legal concept.  In its ordinary legal sense, it would presumably mean the absence ... [This is why the use of the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo; could be potentially quite injurious and dangerous to some of the examples the Senators have sought to protect or enhance.  I came to this view after long thought and consideration of this matter.] This notion is far removed from the concept of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; or public policy.</P>
    <P>The problem is by no means unique to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees.  Other international agreements where a similar drafting technique is used include Ireland's double taxation conventions &mdash; the majority of such agreements contain a provision allowing for the exchange of information. Such provisions contain a clause limiting the obligation to exchange information where the disclosure would <Col N="270" /> be, among other things, contrary to public policy.  This is not the narrow, law and order definition &mdash; it is a much broader concept.  There are in excess of 20 such agreements in force at present, all of which have been approved following the passage of resolutions in the Oireachtas.  The most recent agreements were approved in 1995 and I am not aware that the public policy/<i>ordre public</i> issue was a cause for concern in the approval of any of these orders or any orders implementing these agreements. Furthermore, as I said to Senator Norris, Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome &mdash; the founding Treaty of the EU &mdash; translates &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; as &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;. It is clear from these uses of the French expression in English texts that the drafters of the instruments were conscious of the inadequacy of the English phrase &ldquo;public order&rdquo; to encompass the depth of meaning of the French expression &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the Bill goes into law, it remains until such time as it is amended, so I am specifically concerned that in going for the narrower definition, Senators may defeat the purpose they spoke about so eloquently.  The courts are the final arbiters in these matters and my understanding is that in the UK case referred to by Senator Mulcahy, the application was upheld on the grounds of public policy.  One of the arguments in this case was that commercial interests were at stake.  If a factory in Ireland was to lose jobs as a consequence of one asylum seeker and the narrower, &ldquo;public order&rdquo; definition applied, implying the potential for public disorder, I could envisage that a Minister for justice to whom this concept was offered would be more directed to take a narrower definition than if she was faced with the broader concept of public policy which would encompass constitutional protections.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties but I assure Senator O'Toole that by no means do I not heed what he says.  I have examined this matter at great length &mdash; it is a question of translation from the French and there is a body of <Col N="271" /> evidence showing how this translation has been used.  It has come before this House in relation to the Treaty of Rome and the taxation agreements.  While I appreciate the reason the Senator proposes the amendment, I feel it may defeat the cause he is putting forward. That is my view both as a Minister of State and as an individual, and it is not solely based on advice from the Attorney General.  I am not a lawyer, which is a disadvantage.  However, having listened to the advice which, as a Minister, I am obliged to take from the Attorney General, having read the various documents available and having considered cases such as that raised by Senator Mulcahy, it is my considered view that &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is a more dangerous translation than &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We are not all that eloquent because we have failed to make the point to the Minister.  Either her argument is specious or she totally misunderstood us.

      <P>I indicated that in my reading of the Protocol of Accession there is a well considered series of arguments which strongly advises that the French and English terms have equal standing and that the appropriate translation of the French phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, after a debate similar to the one we have had here.  My belief is that the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is a better term because it is broader but it does not mean &mdash; as is set out in various legal judgements and which is the nub of some Senators' concerns &mdash; the policy of the Government of the day.  The term &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is a narrower one which could be injurious <Col N="272" /> to the case Senators have made and the types of examples given.  I believe that &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is a better translation and is one which has been used by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State for her undivided attention on this point.  That is not what the argument is about, everybody here accepts all that. Can we move forward without restating that?  The Minister of State has made a very valid argument that &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is a better term than &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  I am not arguing that particular narrow point.  The confusion has been created because we have tended to replace the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; with &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  However, as I said, what we intend &ldquo;public order&rdquo; to mean is what the Minister of State interprets &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; to mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one simple way for the Minister of State to prove us wrong by writing into section 1 what is meant by &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.  I need to make this point clear.  The Minister of State does not need to argue with us about the narrowness of &ldquo;public order&rdquo; but simply to write down what &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; means.  All arguments finish at that stage &mdash; game, set and match to the Minister of State &mdash; with no further mis-interpretations. Can we narrow it down to a definition of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; with which we can all live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to say this but Senator O'Toole took the words out of my mouth.  The Minister of State made a very eloquent argument for the proposition that &ldquo;public order&rdquo;, in the context of the Geneva Convention is not a good translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;.  I thank her for educating me on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole said, if something is incapable of definition or of meaning and understanding, it has no place in any legal document.  People are entitled to understand what they are <Col N="273" /> reading and the laws of the land.  It is possible that the phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; is not capable of a sufficiently good definition for the purposes of this Bill. In some of these international organisations, there is jurisprudence the length of Croke Park and back on what &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; means.</P>
    <P>If we, on this side of the House are prepared to accept that &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is a bad translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;, then until the Minister of State defines it she must accept the possibility that the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; are also a bad translation of the phrase.  The demand on this side of the House is for clarity and for definition.  We want the phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; described or translated. If it is to be translated into the phrase &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, we, as an Oireachtas &mdash; those who are elected and selected to draft and frame legislation &mdash; want to decide exactly what the ambit of the phrase &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; will be rather than a High Court or Supreme Court judge.  We want to face head on exactly what it does and does not mean.  The Bill is lacking, in that it does not precisely delineate what it means.  Senator O'Toole's suggestion to ask the Minister of State to come back to the House with either a description of the phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; or a further delineation of the translation of &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; into &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is excellent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Mulcahy has so effectively said.  I am a little bemused by the fact he said that Senator O'Toole took the words out of his mouth and has now said he thinks Senator O'Toole's suggestion is an excellent one.  I dread to think in what part of Senator Mulcahy's anatomy this suggestion of Senator O'Toole's might have been located originally.  However, the points were well made by both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a definition of that, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, the point is about definition.  I do not think any of us suspect <Col N="274" /> the intentions of this Minister of State or her advisers, or their expertise, which is considerably greater than ours. Senator Mulcahy made the very important point that law should be accessible to the citizen.  It should not be written in a language of mystique and confusion.  The debate has suggested to me there is some degree of confusion here.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about this business of policy, and not just in this Bill. &ldquo;Policy&rdquo; is creeping in nastily all over the place.  It is an attempt by Government to extend its influence to all kinds of spheres where it is not appropriate.  I made this point in the debate with the Minister for Education where this business of policy intruded into attempts to intervene in university administration. Of course, the Minister of State is not responsible and is disclaiming any connection with this.  However, policy is coming in here, and it should be fought.</P>
      <P>These definitions are extremely important.  I remember a previous case where we were dealing with the question of public order and morality.  There was a debate as to whether &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; should become &ldquo;public order and public morality&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister can meet the requirements of the situation and we can advance.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach has pointed out, we have spent a long time on this issue, although it is very important.  This is precisely the kind of debate we ought to have in this reflective Chamber of Parliament. However, the Minister can meet the issue by giving an undertaking to look at the question of putting a definition into this section of the Bill which will make it clear that what she has in mind, in terms of policy, is precisely what she has spelled out to us today.  If that is done, then all sides of the House will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State seemed to raise some suspicions about public order operating on its own, some of which may be well founded.  She gave an example of a meat processing plant in the west which operated according to <Col N="275" /> Muslim law and, if pressure was applied, the ultimate owners and operators of this plant might be offended by the admission to this country as a refugee of a person opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, and, if jobs could be threatened, there might be some sort of public disorder in that location.</P>
    <P>I would say that public order already exists in the Bill as an option &mdash; there is no question of dropping it.  That situation will continue to exist because we have &ldquo;public order&rdquo; and &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;. It is no defence against our argument to say there could be a situation where public order would be threatened as that is already covered by the existence of the phrase &ldquo;public order&rdquo; in the legislation.</P>
    <P>While I was outside trying to take a telephone call I believe I heard the Minister of State also raise a difficulty about the legal validity of the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.  I understood her to say that the phrase in English has no legal status.  Perhaps she would confirm this. I would be surprised if that was the case. Perhaps I am wrong, but I understand that the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act is in existence.  If so, there must be a legally valid concept of the term &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My final point is a nasty, narrow chauvinistic one and is about the French.  I speak not of the French language but of the French regime.  If the thinking behind this &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;, including public policy, was French, it would make me much more unsympathetic to it.  One has only to look at the record of various French administrations over the past 20 to 30 years to see why.  We also only have to look at the record in this area of asylum policy. For example, in terms of third country referral of asylum seekers, the UK Government, on appeal, found that approximately 60 per cent of cases should not be returned to France because of its unsatisfactory method of dealing with refugees.</P>

      <P>It is for the sake of clarity that we require to know the meaning of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister of State's explanations of the translations are correct.  However, even from my interpretation of the debate I have heard in America, the policy was superseding human rights considerations. To avoid confusion about this excellent legislation the inclusion of a definition of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; would be most useful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this point.  This matter can be easily resolved.  We do not have to continue the argument about the definitions of terms such as &ldquo;public order&rdquo; or &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; or whether one is different from the other. It is simply a question of including such definitions in the Bill which remove all the confusion.  Let us know what is meant by &ldquo;public order&rdquo; and &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;, to the degree that it does not give discretion to a Minister at a future date to move the goal posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate.  The definition of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;public order&rdquo; is the more appropriate definition. This is generally accepted on both sides of the House.  For example, if one was to deal with a former terrorist dictator looking for refugee status in Ireland, it would not, on our understanding of law and order, be against public order <i>per se</i> for him to do so, but it would be against public policy.  On this basis I would favour the definition of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;public order&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> However, if one attempts to define the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; one will only run into more difficulties.  What was public policy in Victorian times would not be public policy nowadays.  It is a changing concept.  It represents the common good, which depends on changing circumstances.  How could any Government define this in fixed form?  It is similar to attempting to define the term &ldquo;the common good&rdquo;.  What is it?  Should we attempt a definition?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State's position on limiting the interpretation of public policy.  I have also listened carefully to the genuine concerns of the other side.  The Minister of State examined this aspect very carefully when the Bill was going through the other House.  It may be in the interests of all if she examined it again in view of the extreme and genuine concern expressed on the other side of the House.  However, I do not want her to make a promise to change it if she is convinced, even at this stage, that it cannot be done.  The Minister of State is genuine in believing she is doing the right thing in not limiting the definition of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point.  The Minister of State says this is a confusing concept.  She advises that the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is better and is the term she accepts.  There is no argument about that.  Having explained her reasoning, the Minister of State must now tell us what the term means.  The point has been made that one cannot have a definition that is unchanging.  That is the case in respect of many definitions.  Any definition that is not part of science will probably be subject to change in some respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past hour I have consulted with legal people and with legal dictionaries. I have come up with a definition of the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; which the Minister of State should consider and which I will move by way of amendment on Report Stage.  In the meantime I would prefer if the Minister of State were to make a <Col N="278" /> proposal.  I would define public policy to mean: &ldquo;The principle in law that a person will not be permitted to do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public good&rdquo;. This is a clear interpretation, which allows for the kind of change discussed by the Minister of State.  The public good is at all times defined democratically by the Government of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous that the Government of the day interprets what public policy under our public order or public good is.  There are broader definitions under common law.  In practice I agree that in many cases &mdash; for example, in education &mdash; it is the Government of the day which, having an electoral mandate, expresses what the policy in public education ought to be.  However, to narrow the definition of the term &ldquo;public good&rdquo; in a Bill to being a definition of the Government of the day is from a profoundly liberal point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  When I referred to the term &ldquo;public good&rdquo; the Minister of State advised it may be defined by common law.  That is acceptable and I was wrong in what I said about Government.  This was not included in my definition where I finished with the words &ldquo;...public good&rdquo;. I am happier with the Minister of State's definition of the term &ldquo;public good&rdquo; than with my own in that it is a term that should be defined by common law.</P>

My definition states that the term &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; is: &ldquo;The principle in law that a person will not be permitted to do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public good&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>When first referring to this, the Senator followed on.  He may <Col N="279" /> now have shortened the sentence.  I am trying to be helpful.  I have taken into account what Senator Neville has said and would be broadly happy to accept his suggestion.  There is a Pandora's box to be opened here.  I could ask for a definition of the term &ldquo;public good&rdquo;.  In the continuation of the Senator's sentence, which he has now excised, he mentioned the Government of the day. I would not be in favour of the term being defined simply by the policy of the Government of the day, much as, in some cases, it might suit me as a Minister at present.</P>

For the third time I read into the record what my definition means.  It states: &ldquo;The principle in law that a person will not be permitted to do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public or against the public good&rdquo;.

      <P>A little confusion has entered the matter because Senator O'Toole forgot to close his inverted commas in the quotation and gave his <Col N="280" /> own elaboration.  His definition is good. As I understood the point, it was not a question for the Government of the day but a matter of a legal definition which was not subject to interpretation by the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is, because I recall a case in which there was a question of the balance between a certain concept and the &ldquo;public good&rdquo;, but we can return to that matter.  I have been in contact indirectly with the Regius Professor of Law in Trinity College and it appears that debates on the Hague Convention over the years in private international law indicate that the continental understanding of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; has a narrower compass than the phrase in English law.  &ldquo;<i>Ordre public</i>&rdquo; is usually translated as &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; under international law, but it is questionable whether this continental &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; has the same wide political ambit as we know it.  Therefore, according to the Regius Professor of Law in Trinity College, there is an unknown quantity here and that is why we are so concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no precedent in Irish law where &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; was translated as &ldquo;public order&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister of State has won on that point.  Professor Peter Nye, an Australian author, used &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; on its own.  Again, there is confusion created by the phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo; and in eminent legal minds there is uncertainty as to what is encompassed precisely by this formulation. Professor Nye's book on constitutional law did not translate or explain the phrase so perhaps he just assumed a literal translation.  According to Professor Binchy, it is not clear exactly what is meant by &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; but &ldquo;<i>ordre <Col N="281" /> public</i>&rdquo; is translated legally as &ldquo;public policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable degree of confusion. I admit that this discussion has left me throughly confused.  I hope that by accepting Senator O'Toole's definition we could obtain a degree of clarity.</P>

The Minister of State said she will re-examine the situation but we will not be happy unless there is a comprehensive definition in the Bill.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 6 are related and may be discussed together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1) (a)</i> 'well-founded fear of being persecuted' may refer to a well-founded fear of being persecuted by non-State agents, where the State is unable, or unwilling, to provide protection against persecution of that person by such agents.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment reflects the way the interpretation and usage of the Geneva Convention is developing in jurisprudence and practice.  It reflects the reality of modern life in many countries.  The intention of the amendment is to include persecution by non-State agents where the State is unable or unwilling to provide protection against persecution of a person by such agents.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State cannot deny that persecution by non-State agents exists.  I will restrain myself from giving concrete examples of such persecution because the people against whom I might make such allegations are not here to defend themselves.  It is not difficult to imagine situations where a particular person is persecuted by a large tribe within a country or by a particular religious group.  One such example could be if a Muslim community threatened to kill a famous author for a book he had written and a state stood idly by while such persecution was taking place and the author had to flee.  In this case a positive and defence oriented stance has been taken by the state on that person's rights and the state authorities have provided protection.  However, it is not difficult to imagine a situation where a state would leave such a person to the wolves.</P>
    <P>There have been recent examples in central Africa, of which I sure the Minister of State is aware in detail, where the State, or what appeared for the State, stood by while one tribe sought to massacre entire tribes.  We must ask ourselves if we are to deny the protection of the Geneva Convention to such persons.  The origins of the Geneva <Col N="283" /> Convention were in the large number of people who were made refugees after the Second World War.  In pre-war Germany people were persecuted by the Nazi Party before that party came to power and the State did nothing to protect them.  That was before the Geneva Convention.  However, it does not take a huge stretch of the imagination to think of cases where the State could turn a blind eye to persecution of an individual or group of individuals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has no doubt been advised about recent discussion papers and reports at UN and European level on development of refugee law in this area.  &ldquo;Non-State agents&rdquo; is a broad phrase and could include anybody.  We take it as a fundamental principle that it is the absolute obligation of the State to protect its citizens from persecution.  If the State is failing in that obligation and people leave the State following persecution, it would be wrong not to provide such persons with refugee status and asylum.  I am avoiding the temptation of using individual examples.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has extended the definition of membership of a social group.  She is to be congratulated for stretching the boundaries of applicability of the Geneva Convention; they have been stretched to apply to membership of trade unions, sexual orientation and so forth.  Why not similarly stretch applicability to non-State agents?  I earnestly press this amendment and ask the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support this amendment.  It is one of a number of amendments that were circulated widely and accepted on this side of the House. Senator Mulcahy did not wish to put any instances on the record, although in view of his remarks one could draw conclusions about the type of situation he envisaged.  The fatwa on Salman Rushdie is one such instance.  Although it was Government inspired, it was done in such a way that the Government in Iran was able, at certain stages when it was <Col N="284" /> in its interest to do so, to wash its hands of responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>I will give the reason why I feel strongly about this matter.  Let us look at two examples, one of which took place in this country.  It has been made clear that the Government of this State is incapable of protecting its citizens against the operations of non-governmental agencies.  There was such a case in recent years when a convicted INLA member who turned State's evidence had to be protected after serving the prison sentence imposed on him and, with Government assistance, was admitted to Canada as an asylum seeker following advice from the Irish Government that it was incapable of protecting that citizen from the murderous intentions of disaffected fellow members of the INLA.  There already is a situation on our own doorstep in which we acknowledge that we cannot protect our own citizens and it is better to get them out of the country.  That is a cogent argument for including non-governmental agencies.</P>
      <P>The second example is widely known. Many regimes in Latin America suffer from the activities of death squads. They are endemic in that area.  The death squads murder street children and political opponents.  I have just read a book entitled <i>No Human Being is Disposable.</i> In some of these countries categories of people such as the unemployed, prostitues and gays are referred to in common parlance as the &ldquo;disposables&rdquo;. They are disposed of.  They may be disposed of with the connivance of Government but it is not direct Government action.  It is the action of the death squads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to make it clear in the legislation that we would accept as a refugee somebody who was the victim or target not only of a malign Government intention but of an agency such as a death squad.  We have accepted this principle ourselves and we expect other jurisdictions to receive people from our country whom we cannot protect on the basis that they are threatened by bodies other than the State within this jurisdiction. <Col N="285" /> This is a well founded amendment and I hope the Minister of State will consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Some common sense must be applied in the context of this amendment.  Everything Senator Norris said was valid, but it is not affected in any way by the proposed amendment. Let us not get carried away about this. The section defines a refugee to mean a person who has a well founded fear of being persecuted.  It does not state by whom.  The proposers of the amendment are assuming that the section means State persecution, but that is not stated and we should not assume it.  By not defining it, it is open to meaning persecution from whatever source.  It is well left as it is.</P>

      <P>The amendment might be difficult to implement.  The two examples given by Senator Norris are excellent in that one can pinpoint the organisations causing the terror. However, where does that stop?  Does it apply to street gangs or units of British fascist movements?  My only objection to the amendment is that too much discretionary power is required of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments behind the amendments and I support the principle that inspired them. However, I am wary of over-elaborating the definition in the 1951 Convention for the good reason put forward by Senator Gallagher.  I am of the view that the existing wording of section 2, which follows closely the text of the convention, includes the category of persons described in the Senators amendment.  I will go further by saying that it is beyond doubt that the present wording encompasses fear of persecution by non-State agents.  As Senator Gallagher said, this is because the convention definition simply speaks of persecution without differentiating between possible different origins of the persecution in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> I am concerned that we do not stray too far from the text of the convention. It could be inferred by a court at a later date that some other aspect could not be read in a broad way because it has not been expanded on in the statutes. The UNHCR shares this concern and is anxious that the legislation implementing the convention should stick as closely as possible to the convention text so as to avoid this possibility.  I took the action in relation to broadening the definition of social group because I believed it was essential.  Not everybody internationally, and possibly in the UNHCR, agrees with me.  We are under advisement to stick to the convention.  The same thinking applies to the proposed amendment to section 5.  It is an over-elaboration of the position which already prevails.</P>
    <P>As regards the examples put forward, I would like to say something which might put Senators minds at rest.  Over the past couple of weeks I decided in favour of the applicants in three cases seeking asylum.  These cases involved non-State persecution &mdash; two were from Africa and one from a Muslim country. The circumstances outlined by the Senators applied to some of those cases, that is, the people were suffering persecution. It did not matter to me making my decision as Minister whether it was non-State persecution or that the State in a couple of examples was unable to protect the individual.  In one case where someone was of a minority religion in a fundamentalist state, the statutes of the state in theory offered protection but in practice clearly did not.  That is already dealt with on a routine basis, but it is not very usual.  As it happens, there have been three cases over the past month involving this point and I would like to reassure the Senators in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a splendid, comprehensive and convincing reply.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment because the Minister has dealt with it very effectively, as has my colleague, Senator Gallagher.  I was going to say I <Col N="287" /> would be completely convinced if she was able to give some precedent, which she has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened to know that the way this Minister interprets the Geneva Convention includes persecution by non-State agents.  International jurisprudence on this point goes against what she has said in that non-State agent persecution &mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; was not accepted internationally as being within the ambit of the Geneva Convention.  That is why there has been considerable debate on this topic in the past few years.</P>
      <P>If the Minister accepts there is no need for the amendment because it is already covered by the Geneva Convention, why oppose it?  I accept her reticence to expand the exact language, but it is only a matter of clarification.  It does not alter, in the primary sense, the definition of persecution contained in section 2.  Will she accept that a more conservative view could be taken by other Ministers making a decision, perhaps more in line with the conservative jurisprudence I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the points raised by Senator Mulcahy, I understand non-state agency persecution is accepted under the Geneva Convention. It is dangerous to say that if the Minister has no difficulty with the proposed amendment, why not accept it.  That would, in effect, limit or define from where the persecution is allowed to come in terms of refugee status.  By including something, we are, by definition, excluding a source of persecution. In terms of legal interpretation, it is something which Senator Mulcahy, as a barrister, would be well aware of.  It is dangerous to tamper with what is left undefined in terms of legal interpretation. The Bill allows us to protect those being persecuted from whatever source.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) A refugee in relation to whom a declaration is in force, may appeal to the High Court against the refusal of the Minister under subsection (2) to issue a travel document and that the Court may, as it thinks proper, on the hearing of the appeal, confirm the decision of the Minister or direct the Minister to issue a travel document.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is important and sets out that the Minister is not to be the final arbiter of whether somebody should or should not be issued with a travel document.  Section 4, as I understand it, applies to people who have received a declaration as to their status. The Minister, in denying a travel document to such persons, would rely on national security or <i>ordre public</i>&mdash; I will leave the latter in French until it has been finally clarified.  Why should the Minister be the final arbiter of whether a person is in breach of national security or <i>ordre public</i> and, accordingly, should not be granted a travel document?  The High Court has inherent jurisdiction to monitor each and every activity of anybody in the public domain by way of <i>certiorari, mandamus</i> and judicial review.  For the purposes of clarity, there is no reason somebody should not have a normal and direct right of appeal to review a decision of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long debate on the concept of <i>ordre public.</i>  One of the arguments <Col N="290" /> the Minister advanced was that the concept of &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; could be abused by the Government of the day by it taking a narrow interpretation of public policy as meaning essentially Government policy.  If the Minister is consistent about this, she should give a right of review to the High Court to make sure no Ministers ever abuse the powers granted to them under national security interests or <i>ordre public.</i>  I hope that in the spirit of generosity the Minister showed this morning, she will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister's views.  It seems that, in terms of natural justice, applicants for asylum should have the same right of recourse to judicial review or a High Court appeal as anybody else.  They are not criminals but persons whose status in terms of asylum is to be determined. I do not see why they should not be permitted the same rights as other human beings under natural law.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on how the amendment affects this section.  It gives the Minister wide powers of refusal without challenge.  A briefing document which was made available to members of the Dáil Select Committee on Legislation and Security states that: &ldquo;This subsection allows the Minister on the grounds of national security or public policy (&ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;) to refuse to issue a travel document to a refugee&rdquo;.  Under article 28 of the convention, the only grounds for such refusal are compelling reasons of national security or public order.  This is not the way it is phrased in the Bill.  I may table an amendment on Report Stage to insert a phrase of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) refers to &ldquo;in the interests of national security or public order&rdquo; whereas the convention refers to &ldquo;compelling reasons&rdquo;.  The Minister has much wider powers under the Bill than under the convention because the reasons for refusing to issue a travel document need not necessarily be compelling. They may be the reasons of the <Col N="291" /> day and no review may take place.  Why should compelling reasons for such a refusal not be required?  Even though such reasons are not to be required, we are not giving leave to appeal.  I imagine the framers of the convention would be happy with the idea that review was possible.  We are providing for a situation where reasons may not be compelling and yet will not be subject to legal review, which is the natural entitlement of any citizen.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International stated that the words &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; have an entirely different meaning in law from public order and are not an accurate translation of <i>ordre public.</i>  The inclusion of the expression &ldquo;public policy&rdquo; throughout the Bill is of grave concern and is used in all cases to permit the State to opt out of its obligations under the convention. The clear implication of subsection (2) is that public policy is the direct translation of &ldquo;ordre public&rdquo;.  This adds strength to the argument that the Minister would be most helpful if she could give &mdash; I am sure she will be able to do so &mdash; a better definition of the troublesome phrase &ldquo;<i>ordre public</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue by the Minister for Justice of a travel document to an asylum seeker is in many respects procedurally similar to the issue by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a passport.  It can be argued that the issue of a passport is of far greater significance because it is not merely a convenience for the traveller but a declaration of the status of the holder as an Irish citizen. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs refuses an application for a passport, the applicant may have recourse to the inherent jurisdiction of the courts to review ministerial decisions; there is no special statutory process provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I can reassure Senator Norris that in this case the refusal of a travel document is subject to exactly the same review by the courts as in the case of an Irish applicant who applies for a passport but is refused.  This matter involves people who have been granted asylum status not being issued with travel documents. I remind the Senator that a Minister can only issue a refusal after due procedure has been followed and proper consideration has been given to the case.  A Minister cannot act capriciously or malevolently in making such a decision which is reviewable by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill marks a decisive step in developing a strategy for the healthy management of the marine resource and for the protection of the environment of our seas and oceans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it becomes law the Bill will enable Ireland to give effect to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, generally known as the OSPAR Convention; extend the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 <Col N="293" /> miles up to 200 miles and in some areas up to 350 miles off the Irish coast depending on the extent of our Continental Shelf; apply strict limitations on the types of substances which can be disposed at sea; ban incineration at sea, the dumping of radioactive wastes; toxic, harmful or noxious substances and provide new enforcement powers and tougher penalties.</P>
    <P>The previous exemptions which existed for State vessels, including military vessels, will no longer apply.  The Government has decided that, although dumping by State vessels is legally permitted under international conventions, it is no longer appropriate that Governments should be exempt from the restrictions imposed on others by these conventions.  No state, and particularly no coastal state, can ignore its duties of stewardship of the world's oceans and seas.  It is incumbent on Ireland, and all other states bordering on the world's extensive and complex marine resource, to ensure that it is passed on to the next generations in a sound and healthy state.  We ignore this duty at our peril.</P>
    <P>Our knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological processes of our seas and oceans is far from complete. However, we know they are fragile. They are threatened every day by the effect of onshore and offshore activities and they are at risk of long-term damage from visible and invisible processes and actions, the impact of only some of which we fully understand.  Other more insidious damage is inevitably occurring; we cannot await the luxury of the establishment of clear casual relationships in framing and implementing protective measures.  We must also strive to better understand the marine environment, the impact of man's activities on its health, both in the short term and the long term.  Damage done now may be irreversible in the future.  Our policy, and that of the global community, is to take strong preventative and protective action now and, at the same time, to further our understanding and knowledge of the marine resource.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> Approximately 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by oceans.  As I said, the waters and resources of the seas and oceans are fragile, complex and only partly understood.  While coastal states strive to protect their coastlines from misuse or abuse, it is only by concerted and co-ordinated efforts of nations that damage, often insidious in nature, can be avoided.  Due to the nature of the marine system, local action alone will not protect national coastlines, and still less the quality of the high seas.  We cannot, therefore, control deep sea pollution without solid, unambiguous agreements between governments.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR Convention provides a basic and effective framework for the protection of the marine environment.  It is aimed at an extensive ocean area of the north-east Atlantic, which borders the majority of the countries of the continent of Europe.  It is an area of intensive economic and industrial activity where the adjacent seas are particularly threatened by pollution.  National measures must be combined with international agreement to reduce the input of pollutants to the marine environment.</P>
    <P>As an island nation close to major shipping lanes, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to the effects of marine casualties, oil spills and wilful disposal of wastes in the north Atlantic.  Thus, we have a very special interest in promoting protection of the marine environment in the interest of human health, marine life and amenity values.  We also have a deeply principled interest in ensuring that our stewardship of our adjacent seas and oceans will be seen by future users of the resource to have been wise and farsighted.  Ireland is party to a number of international conventions designed to protect the marine environment, in addition to the OSPAR Convention.  It is useful to review the body of national and international law so the House can put the Bill into the overall context in that regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland became party to the London (Dumping) Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, at the <Col N="295" /> same time as the Oslo Convention.  The Dumping At Sea Act, 1981, gives effect to both conventions.  The London Convention, unlike the OSPAR Convention, applies globally and has been globally adopted by the International Maritime Organisation.  The terms of the convention are similar to the Oslo Convention and the new OSPAR Convention. In general, environmental protection trends set under the Oslo and OSPAR Conventions progress to consideration and adoption by the London Convention.  The London Convention is currently under review, following the adoption by the north-eastern European states of the OSPAR Convention in 1992.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also party to the Intervention on the High Seas Convention in case of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, and its 1973 Protocol on intervention in cases of pollution by substances other than oil.  The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, gives effect to this convention.  This Act enables the Minister, following a maritime casualty, to give directions for the purpose of preventing, mitigating or eliminating danger from pollution or threat of pollution by oil or any other harmful substance to the owner or master of a ship which is outside territorial waters.  Where the response of the owner or master of such vessels to such directions is inadequate, the Minister may take such actions and do such things as he thinks necessary and reasonable to prevent, mitigate or eliminate the effects of pollution.</P>
    <P>Ireland is party to MARPOL 73/78. The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, also gives effect to the MARPOL Convention and its 1978 Protocolumn The Act prohibits or controls the operational discharge of marine pollutants from ships through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and vessel construction and equipment standards.  Three sets of regulations made in 1994 under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, on the prevention of pollution by oil, the control of pollution by noxious liquid substances in bulk and the prevention of pollution by <Col N="296" /> garbage, give effect to three of the annexes which form an integral part of MARPOL 73/78.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988, gives effect to the Civil Liability and Compensation Conventions, 1969, and their 1971 Protocols.  The Act requires oil tankers carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of oil in bulk as cargo to hold specified insurance cover.  Oil importers receiving more than 150,000 tonnes of oil per annum into the country are required to contribute to the compensation fund established under the above mentioned conventions.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, gave effect to the International Convention of Salvage, 1989.  It made an important further contribution to the procedures for dealing with maritime casualties.  An orderly system for handling the three main phases of a casualty at sea was introduced, namely, vessels in distress, salvage operations and, where necessary, the removal or rendering harmless of ensuing wrecks.  This Act strengthens the role of both the Department of the Marine's emergency service and its marine survey office, where professionalism and operational capacity have been greatly upgraded in recent years.  In particular, rescue operations now have a firm legislative base.</P>
    <P>The Act places responsibility on owners for the removal or rendering harmless of their wrecks and has given a new role to public authorities in ensuring that owners of wrecks adhere to their responsibilities.  Wrecks of historical interest are also dealt with and the Director of the National Museum will have the right of first refusal on any unclaimed wreck around the coast.  Commercial salvage operations are often high risk affairs which need careful regulation if they are to strike the right balance between the interests of the State, shipowners, salvers and the environment.  The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act strikes that balance.</P>
    <P>Plans are in train for accession to the 1990 Oil Pollution Preparedness, <Col N="297" /> Response and Co-operation Convention. This convention is concerned with preparedness and response issues related to oil pollution emergencies.  It will be expanded in the near future to include emergencies involving hazardous and noxious substances.  The convention is designed to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding to major pollution incidents and to encourage states to develop and maintain an adequate capability to deal with pollution emergencies.</P>
    <P>A memorandum of understanding between Ireland and the UK on cooperation/assistance in search and rescue and pollution control in the Irish Sea is being negotiated and will in due course contribute to our ability to tackle marine pollution in the area.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate from this review that there is a strong body of law in place to deal with marine pollution. This is kept under constant review, as is our operational capacity to implement it in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>I will now deal in some detail with the convention which the Bill intends to carry into Irish law.  As I have already mentioned, the Bill before the House will enable Ireland to ratify the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which is known as the OSPAR Convention. In September 1992, the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for signature, subject to ratification, of this convention.</P>
    <P>Marine pollution in the area of the north-east Atlantic has been covered since the 1970s by two separate conventions, in which Ireland has participated. The OSPAR Convention is effectively an amalgamation of them.  These conventions are the Oslo Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft (1972) and the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources (1974).</P>
    <P>The Oslo Convention is administered by the Department of the Marine.  The <Col N="298" /> Paris Convention is primarily the concern of the Department of the Environment but the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications also plays a role with regard to controlling the discharge of radioactive substances, including wastes from land-based sources.  All EU member states &mdash; excluding Austria &mdash; Iceland and Norway are party to both conventions.  The EU is party to the Paris Convention and has observer status in the Oslo Convention. Contracting parties to both conventions have signed the OSPAR Convention. In addition to these contracting parties, Switzerland has also signed the convention.</P>
    <P>The new convention takes account of developments since the original Oslo and Paris Conventions were signed in 1972 and 1974, respectively, and merges and consolidates their provisions.  The OSPAR Convention attaches particular importance to the need to increase our knowledge of the state and science of the north-east Atlantic.  Contracting parties to the new OSPAR Convention have been preparing for the ratification of the new convention by agreeing on new scientific committees.  Preparations are under way for the completion of a quality status report for the entire convention area by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the UK will be responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the area to the west of Ireland and the area to the west of Scotland.  These reports will comprehensively assess the health of our adjacent seas under a detailed set of criteria.  They will constitute an invaluable input to policy with regard to the sustainable development of the marine resource.  We are currently in consultation with the UK and Northern Ireland authorities about the management of this large, but potentially extremely valuable task.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise in this context the question of munitions dumping in our adjacent seas as the quality status report and the OSPAR Convention generally represent the most appropriate means to address this vexed issue. <Col N="299" /> Up to now it is through the Oslo Convention that the issue of dumping by the UK of chemical and other weapons from World War II has been pursued. Such dumping is a matter of major concern to many of the contracting parties to the Oslo Convention.  We will be ensuring that the impact of the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland and the UK will be specifically addressed in the quality status report as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, met with the Minister for the Environment, Scottish Office, Lord Lindsay, and Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Howe, in London recently to discuss the drawing up of a management plan for the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite, which is situated off the coast of Larne.  Lords Howe and Lindsay confirmed that while there is no conclusive evidence that the laying of the British Gas pipeline disturbed munitions in the Beaufort Dyke, they accept that it is likely that this is the case.  A firm commitment from the UK Government to put in place a system of monitoring and management of the dumpsite was secured.</P>
    <P>A number of key points were agreed. In the first instance, the Scottish Office will undertake a new study beginning this month on the Beaufort Dyke munitions dumpsite in order to remap and rechart the extent of the dumpsite and the distribution of munitions within the site.  Second, it was agreed that UK and Irish scientists will co-operate on the methodology and methods of analysis for the study and they will jointly review the data emerging.  UK scientists and scientists from the Marine Institute have been liaising in this regard.  Third, the gas pipeline between Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be commissioned until its safety has been assured following assessment by the UK Health and Safety Executive.  UK and Irish scientists will liaise in relation to this issue.  Fourth, the remapping of the dumpsite will be complete before a <Col N="300" /> decision is made on the route of the proposed electricity interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The installation of the interconnector will draw on lessons learned from the laying of the gas pipeline.  Fifth, based on the studies which are now to be carried out, UK Ministries intend to issue guidelines on the management of activity around the dumpsite.  Sixth, when the 1996 study of the Beaufort dumpsite is completed, there will be a further meeting in Dublin between the two UK Ministers and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, to assess the results and to discuss what further steps are required at that stage.  I am pleased with the outcome of this meeting and I am satisfied that a high degree of co-operation has been achieved.</P>
    <P>On the international front, I have also raised this issue with the EU Commissioner and I particularly welcome her intervention.  She has indicated that she intends to raise with the UK Government whether there are issues in relation to the dump sites which could be solved at Community or international level.  It is also through the Oslo Convention that agreement has been reached globally on the termination of the disposal at sea of industrial waste.  Such wastes have not been disposed of at sea in Ireland since July 1993.</P>
    <P>The new OSPAR Convention generally obliges contracting parties to adopt, individually and jointly, programmes and measures involving the use of best available techniques, best environmental practice and, where appropriate, clean technology for the purpose of prevention and eliminating marine pollution and protecting the maritime area covered by the convention against adverse effects of human activities.  The new convention provides a stricter marine environmental regime, establishes mechanisms for the protection of the marine environment, allows more in-depth considerations of ideas and proposals affecting the marine environment through an increased number of scientific <Col N="301" /> working groups, operates on a precautionary principle where countries are asked not to licence activities where there is any question of damage to the marine environment and provides an arbitration mechanism for the settlement of disputes involving transboundary pollution.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to ratify the convention as soon as possible.  It is seen as essential that we equip ourselves with the powers to implement urgently and effectively the marine pollution control regime in the convention.  It is also essential that we, as a nation, are not seen to be behind in ratifying this convention.</P>
    <P>An important objective in ratifying the convention is, however, to open the way for the possibility of initiating arbitration between Ireland and the UK arising from the increased discharges from Sellafield since the start-up of THORP.  As Members are aware, this Government is opposed to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and is seeking the closure of Sellafield/THORP plant and the halting of any future expansion.  An interdepartmental committee on the Irish Sea has been established in order to progress Government policy on Sellafield and the Irish Sea in line with the commitments given in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>The operation of the THORP plant results in the transportation near our shores of nuclear materials.  I have serious concerns regarding this matter. We are not alone in this concern.  Small island states and other coastal states worldwide have been vocal in international fora with regard to the transportation of such material.  This led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships, the INF Code.  The code lays down standards for construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high level radioactive wastes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> At the International Maritime Organisations' assembly in London last November my colleague at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, secured agreement with representatives of the 152 countries in the IMO to adopt Ireland's resolution governing the shipment of nuclear materials and to strengthen the INF Code.  Ireland's resolution seeks to address the deficiencies in the INF code.  The resolution instructs the IMO's Marine Safety Committee and the Marine Environment Protection Committee to consider extending the INF Code to include the following: route planning, notification to the coastal state, marking of flasks, protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies and the designation of sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must take place.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief surveyor of the Department's marine survey office represents Ireland on both the MSC and MEPC.  These committees have been instructed to thoroughly examine Ireland's proposal and to report to the next assembly of the IMO next year with recommendations as to how the INF Code should be strengthened.  I am confident that procedures to strengthen the code will have been considered and prepared in time for the next IMO assembly.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed by Ireland and supported by other IMO countries, a special consultative meeting to discuss the code, in advance of consideration of it by the MSC and the MEPC, was called by the secretary general of the IMO recently.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by the deputy chief surveyor of the Department of the Marine and the assistant chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Ireland made a detailed presentation at the meeting calling on the code to be strengthened.  There was considerable support for Ireland's position.  The MSC and the MEPC will take on board the views expressed at that meeting when preparing their recommendations for the strengthening of the code.  I will be <Col N="303" /> pursuing every avenue open to me to ensure that a tough new code governing the shipment of nuclear materials is put in place.</P>
    <P>Three Departments of State have obligations under the OSPAR Convention &mdash; the Department of the Environment is responsible for the prevention of marine pollution from land based sources; the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is responsible for the prevention of pollution from offshore installations and for the discharge at sea of radioactive substances and the Department of the Marine is responsible for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping at sea. Sufficient statutory support to implement the provisions of the convention on pollution from land based sources already exists in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 to 1990, the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and the Environmental Protection Act, 1992.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, which was enacted in December provides an updated legislative framework for provisions relating to discharges or emissions from offshore installations and pipelines, abandonment of offshore installations and placement of disused offshore installations and pipelines in the sea for a purpose other than originally intended.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the convention relating to dumping at sea require that new domestic legislation be enacted to give full effect to the convention.  Legal advice is that the most appropriate way to amend the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, is to repeal the existing legislation and to enact a new Dumping at Sea Act. We have taken this opportunity to carry out a full review of the dumping at sea legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to advise Senators of the key provisions of the Bill before the House and to comment on the extent to which they enhance the provisions of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  The term &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; is redefined to bring into the regulatory net all forms of dredging <Col N="304" /> techniques developed since the 1981 Act and includes deliberate disposal at sea of vessels or aircraft as well as substances or material from or in conjunction with a vessel and aircraft.</P>
    <P>The maritime area to which the Bill applies has been extended beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial seas limit.  It will now extend 200 miles and, in some cases, up to 350 miles off the Irish coast depending on the extent of our Continental Shelf.  Ireland expects to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, in the near future and, under the terms of that convention, contracting parties may exercise control of the maritime environment out to those limits.  This is a major development. Up to now Ireland was only in a position to regulate out to 12 miles.  Our control over the marine environment will be greatly enhanced by this provision.</P>
    <P>The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, prohibits the dumping of substances or material except in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister or a contracting party in the OSPAR Convention if it is in their maritime area.  In line with the new convention the Bill before the House clearly specifies what may not be dumped at sea, thus doing away with any misconceptions or ambiguities.</P>
    <P>The Bill strictly prohibits the incineration of substances or material at sea, the disposal at sea of low, intermediate and high level radioactive substances or material, the disposal at sea of toxic, harmful or noxious substances and the disposal at sea of sewage sludge after 31 December 1998.  A permit may be granted for the disposal of radioactive substances or material below low level subject to consultation between the Minister for the Marine and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. This is intended to allow the dumping of materials, such as dredge spoil, which are found to contain trace or negligible levels of radioactivity.  The House may be aware that all substances and material contain some level of naturally occurring radioactivity.  The Radiological Protection Institute is guided by the <Col N="305" /> European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency in defining below low levels.</P>
    <P>The OSPAR Convention has also been instrumental in addressing the issue of the disposal at sea of sewage sludge.  Dumping by Dublin Corporation, Ireland's only authorised sewage sludge dumper, is being phased out and will be terminated by the end of 1998. Alternative land based methods of treatment and disposal are being developed by Dublin Corporation with that time frame in mind.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House deals exclusively with the regulation and control of dumping at sea and does not regulate the discharge of sewage to coastal waters.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to advise the House of the Government's commitment to tackling the problem of discharges of raw sewage to coastal waters by means of a major programme of investment in sewage treatment facilities around our estuaries and coasts. Under the terms of the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, secondary treatment will be required in all cases by the end of the year 2005.</P>
    <P>The size of the task facing us is best illustrated by the fact that only 14 per cent of sewage discharges are currently connected to secondary treatment plants.  As some 80 per cent of sewage wastes discharge to the marine environment, the vast bulk of the £1.3 billion investment programme required under the directive will be spent in estuarine/coastal areas.  Taken together with the dispersed nature of our population, it is clear that a major programme of works covering numerous locations will be implemented over the next decade.  The overall planning and financial framework for this is being established by the Minister for the Environment with the detailed planning and implementation being the responsibility of local authorities.  I am confident that the level of investment involved will give rise to significant improvements in water around our coasts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> The 1992 OSPAR Convention prohibits the dumping of wastes or other matter from offshore installations.  It allows dumping of an offshore installation under a permit issued by the competent authority of the relevant contracting party on a case by case basis. No permit for an offshore installation shall be issued, however, if the disused installation contains substances which are likely to be deleterious to human health, living marine resources or would damage amenities or interfere with other uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>Last May, following pressure from the majority of contracting parties to the Oslo Convention, Shell UK Limited decided not to proceed with the proposed disposal at sea of the offshore installation, the Brent Spar.  At the OSPAR Commission meeting in June, agreement was reached by all contracting parties to the convention, except the UK and Norway, on a moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore installations until a formal decision was adopted, by 1997 at the latest.  The UK and Norway have however agreed informally to be bound by the terms of the moratorium.  The moratorium is intended to operate pending formal OSPAR adoption of a decision banning outright the sea dumping of offshore installations.</P>
    <P>The Government adopts the precautionary approach in relation to the protection of the marine environment. In the absence of sound scientific evidence that the dumping of offshore installations does not impact on the marine environment, we must legislate for the complete ban of sea disposal of offshore installations.  We will be pressing in OSPAR for a continuation of the current moratorium; indeed, we will be seeking to make the current ban obligatory on all OSPAR states by way of having it formally enshrined in the convention.</P>
    <P>I would regard the situation, involving dumping unregulated by the international community, as inappropriate given the irrelevance of maritime borders for the impact of marine pollution. <Col N="307" /> Since the introduction of the Bill matters have progressed somewhat within OSPAR.  An internationally sound basis for selective dumping may emerge which allows for an authoritative risk categorisation of installations.  This would determine which installations may or may not be dumped.  It may well include regulatory controls, underpinned by an internationally agreed monitoring and policing regime, which would oversee the identification of offshore installations which could be considered for dumping, the identification of suitable dump sites, preparation of the installations for dumping and the dumping operations themselves.</P>
    <P>A special working group of OSPAR experts is currently studying this whole issue.  The EU is also preparing a report in the matter.  Thus, while it is our policy to maintain the ban, the alternative of a properly controlled dumping regime may emerge in its stead.  On that basis, I will be proposing an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage which will allow for this possible outcome following a review in the future of the complete ban.</P>
    <P>The amendment is being proposed to allow Ireland to adhere to future international conventions if it emerges that an internationally accepted regime is adopted for the disposal of offshore installations.  However, I do not foresee such dumping in our maritime area.  The ban may only be removed by way of a Government order which will provide the opportunity to revisit the whole issue in the light of the outcome of international scientific investigation.  I can assure the House that we will relax the ban only on the basis of total satisfaction that an internationally agreed and environmentally safe alternative is available.  If it is not available, the ban under section 4 will remain.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House does not envisage the issue of permits in respect of offshore installations, radioactive substances and other toxic, harmful or noxious substances.  The disposal at sea of all other substances or material is <Col N="308" /> prohibited, except in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister for the Marine and in full compliance with any restrictions, requirements or conditions laid down by the Minister and detailed in the said permit.  The Minister is empowered to revoke a permit issued. At this stage I would like Deputies to gain an appreciation of how seriously the Minister and his officials will approach applications for permits.</P>
    <P>Currently all applications for permits under the 1981 Dumping at Sea Act are referred to the Minister's for the Environment, Enterprise and Employment and Transport, Energy and Communications and any other Minister I consider appropriate for their observations. Applications are rigorously assessed by the Department's marine licence vetting committee.  The committee is multi-disciplinary, composed of Department of the Marine and Central Fisheries Board officials with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, navigation and engineering disciplines.</P>
    <P>Assessment of each application has been based effectively on the criteria governing the issue of a permit as outlined in the First Schedule to the Bill and on the exceptions to the prohibition on dumping as shown in annex 2 to the OSPAR Convention.  For the convenience of prospective applicants, this is outlined and is given legislative status in the Second Schedule to the Bill. Briefly, the criteria used include: the characteristics and composition of the substance or material to be dumped; the characteristics of the dumping site and the proposed method of disposal; the extent to which the dumping might interfere with fish and shellfish cultures, shipping, recreation or navigation; the availability of suitable land based alternatives; proper certification of the disposal vessel and crew and the possibility of an impact on the marine environment. In practice dumping does not take place from aircraft.</P>
    <P>Where deemed necessary, applicants are requested to undertake analysis or surveys of both the waste and the dump site, at their own expense.  If the proposed <Col N="309" /> site is found unsuitable for any reason, alternative sites are investigated. If the waste is found unsuitable for sea disposal, a permit is refused.  On the basis of the committee's assessment, its recommendations to the Minister and the views of other Ministers, the Minister decides to grant or refuse a permit.  I am happy that the assessment procedure guards against any substance or material likely to have a negative impact on the marine environment being dumped at sea.</P>
    <P>The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, exempts State ships and vessels from its provisions.  The Oslo and OSPAR Conventions provide that &ldquo;nothing in these Conventions shall abridge the sovereign immunity to which certain vessels are entitled under international law&rdquo;.  At the June meeting of the OSPAR Commission, the majority of contracting parties, including Ireland, agreed that notwithstanding this sovereign immunity clause, the provisions of the convention should apply to all vessels and aircraft, including those entitled to sovereign immunity.  The UK have given a commitment to cease dumping of redundant munitions at sea.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I strongly believe that the same regulatory provisions should apply to all who want to dump at sea.  I have, therefore, removed the exemption provision from the terms of the Bill, thus ruling out any dumping of munitions off the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister to appoint authorised officers to enforce the provisions of the Bill and makes it an offence to obstruct or interfere with an authorised officer in the course of the officer's performance of functions. Provision has been included to give the Naval Service and the Garda new enforcement powers.  It makes provision for the prosecution of offences by the Attorney General and specifies the penalties for such offences.  Up to now neither the Naval Service nor the Garda had powers of enforcement.  The Navy is in a strong position to detect any unlawful dumping at sea.  The Garda are best equipped to detain vessels when <Col N="310" /> they have been escorted by the naval vessel into a harbour.  This will relieve Naval Service vessels and allow them to proceed with other duties.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the Bill was agreed in the Dáil to make provision to enable the Attorney General to prosecute offences committed under the Dumping at Sea Bill and the Sea Pollution Act, 1991.  The purpose of making this provision is because of the international and diplomatic complications that can arise in cases of this kind.  Offences under the Dumping at Sea Bill and the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, are not like ordinary offences in our jurisdiction and they may involve relations with other countries.  It is important that the Attorney General should conduct the actual prosecution because he sits with the Government and is aware of the diplomatic and international perspectives involved in prosecuting such offences.</P>
    <P>Maritime law is a very specialised area of law which is traditionally dealt with by the Attorney General's Office, which is familiar at first hand with the relevant international conventions and legislation.  This amendment will enable the Government to make use of this expertise when prosecuting offences under the Dumping at Sea Bill and the Sea Pollution Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The objective of the OSPAR Convention is to protect the marine environment by incorporating principles established in international environmental legislation.  One such principle is the principle of &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; whereby polluters are held liable for damage caused.  That is the policy of this Government.  In respect of serious offences the Bill before the House provides for unlimited fines of such amount as the court deems appropriate on conviction on indictment, taking into account the cost of remedial action, five years imprisonment or both.  I specifically made a decision not to put a limit on fines for serious offences because of the potential cost of rectifying any damage caused to the marine environment. I would hope that the possibility of substantial <Col N="311" /> penalties on conviction will be an effective deterrent to would-be offenders.  It is our intention to invoke the full rigours of the law where offenders are not so deterred and the fines to be imposed could run to millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>In respect of summary or minor offences the Bill provides for a fine not exceeding £1,500, 12 months imprisonment or both.  This is the maximum fine permitted in law for summary offences. As you are aware, the distinction between summary and indictable cases arise from the Constitution.  Cases of a minor nature can be taken in the District Court.  There was a case in 1937 which established the upper limit for a fine which could be imposed by the District Court &mdash; it was £100 at the time and this has been updated over the years.  The District Court maximum for summary penalties is deemed at the present time to be a sum not greater than £1,500 and we do not have permission to increase it.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents decisive and strong action on the part of the Government in tackling the threat posed by the dumping of toxic and environmentally damaging substances.  I have stated from the outset that the protection of our valuable marine resource is one of my key objectives.  I am determined to afford it the strongest and fullest protection.  The Bill before the House sets new standards for international marine environment management and gives a firm lead to our European partners.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus a rá nach bhfuilim chun aon riail a chur ar an mBille seo ag dul tríd an Teach.  I warmly welcome the Minister to the House.  This strong legislation is a positive step in the prevention of dumping at sea and, overall, it is to be welcome. I have often said in the House that the seas must live.  If the seas do not live <Col N="312" /> and we pollute and destroy them, we are next in line.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, almost three-quarters of the earth's surface is covered by the oceans and we must protect them.  We, as an island nation, have a great responsibility in the protection of the sea.  However, I suppose it would be fair to say that over the years our neighbours in Britain have acted recklessly by dumping different materials into the sea quite close to our coastline.  Maybe I am wrong to say this, but I do not think they would dump matter so close to their coastline.  If they must dump material, I cannot see them doing so off the east of England.  Everything seems to be dumped on the west coast, with the exception of the munitions which were dumped on the northern coast of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there are no real boundaries in the sea.  If pollution, including an oil spillage, occurs outside our boundaries, it can spread into our territorial waters within a matter of days because of tides and the prevailing winds.  West or south-westerly winds would carry pollution and refuse into the waters off the south west coast.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on the Harbours Bill, 1995, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, accepted one of my amendments relating to nuclear waste. This Bill provides us with a golden opportunity to declare our territorial waters, for which we are responsible, a nuclear free zone.  There is nothing to be afraid of as it would be a major step forward.  During the debate on the Harbours Bill, I said that nuclear powered ships and vessels should not be allowed into our harbours.  I did not expect my amendment to be accepted.  We should do something similar in relation to all our territorial waters.  We have nothing to lose.  I may table an amendment on Committee Stage but I am not sure if it would be accepted as relevant to this Bill or whether we should introduce a short amendment declaring our seas and coastal areas a nuclear free zone.  It would be a historic step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> A few months ago an oil tanker which ran aground off the coast of England caused considerable damage to wildlife in a short period.  Efforts were made to clean the beaches and the oil off the birds, thousands of which died.  Disaster is never far away.  At this moment hundreds of ships located off our coast carry materials and oil that our country needs. Some of the main traffic lanes to England are located off our coast.</P>
    <P>Pollution has occurred in the past and the Government and the Minister of the day were responsible for cleaning up the mess at a cost of millions of pounds.  If those responsible have not yet paid their debts, we must highlight that fact.  It is wrong not to pay for a job well done by the Government.  These people should be brought before the European Court and made to pay for the damage.  We should make an example of some of the insurance or shipping companies involved.  In the past if pollution occurred off our coast, we immediately cleaned up the mess.  We do so with goodwill not expecting compensation but to be paid for the job done.  The Minister should highlight this at the highest level.</P>
    <P>I have being talking about pollution on the surface of the water and we are lucky oil floats because if it sank to the bottom of the sea it would destroy the sea bed.  We seem to accept oil pollution because it does not damage the sea bed. Little knobs of oil, like tar, are washed up on beaches all around our coastline. Deputy Clohessy said in the Dáil that a sailor friend of his in Limerick came across nearly an island of refuse on his way from one country to another.  He said he was almost afraid to sail his boat through it.</P>
    <P>We were very slow to act &mdash; I am not pointing a finger at anyone &mdash; in relation to the <i>Brent Spar.</i>  Shell continued to take it to a dumping ground despite the protests.  We should have sent out a Navy vessel to prevent the company from dumping the rig in the Atlantic.  However, it learned a lesson. Although it said afterwards that its action made no difference to the sale of <Col N="314" /> its petrol or diesel, it did.  It was going against the wishes of people from Ireland, England and elsewhere in Europe.  As this company makes millions surely it can break up and recycle old oil rigs.  The Minister told the Dáil that there are another 60 oil rigs in the North Sea waiting to be dumped.  What will happen to them?  Our voice will be heard if the company tries to dump these rigs like the <i>Brent Spar.</i></P>
    <P>We have been talking about Sellafield-THORP and nuclear waste in the Irish Sea for many years.  Successive Irish Governments and Ministers have done their best to make their voices heard and it is irresponsible of the British Government to allow this to continue. They are running with the hares and hunting with the hounds.  They have sympathy for those affected by the Chernobyl disaster but they continue to allow potential for a similar disaster on their own doorstep.  They should close Sellafield down before it wipes out not just England but Ireland.  The damage which could result from Sellafield and THORP was clearly demonstrated in the television programme &ldquo;Chernobyl Revisited&rdquo; a few weeks ago.  What kind of people in Government and responsible positions in England can continue to allow what is happening in Sellafield? There is the danger which would result if there was a disaster and the issue of waste dumped in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>During the Second World War DDT almost wiped out our wildlife.  Everybody asked how this could happen.  It killed the small insects which birds ate.  A small amount of DDT in a fly would not do it any harm but a bird eats approximately 2,500 insects a day.  When this number of insects was killed by DDT and was eaten by a bird, it died.  We hear a great deal of talk about the level of radioactivity in fish.  If a herring and a prawn have the same levels of radiation and a person eats a nice dinner of ten or 12 Dublin Bay prawns, the amount of radioactivity consumed is multiplied.  There was no harm in a bird <Col N="315" /> eating one fly contaminated with DTT but harm was done when a bird ate a large amount of flies.  Dublin Bay prawns are known all over the world. Will they be damaged?</P>
    <P>We will support the Minister if he asks the British Government to at least state its intention to close Sellafield and THORP.  I believe the British people do not want them either so why are they being imposed on them?</P>
    <P>The Bill is long and the Minister went into great detail on it.  I take issue with him on one point.  He said he will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to allow Ireland to adhere to future international conventions and to allow for a dump site in our territorial waters by agreement with other States. He should not do this.  The door to dump sites should be kept shut.  If there is a need for a suitable place to dump certain materials, it should be found outside our territorial waters.  The Minister said that 70 per cent of the earth is covered by sea.  Surely a dump site can be found away from our few hundred square miles and from other countries. The Minister should not table an amendment and should leave the Bill, which is a good one, as it is.  If in future a dump site is necessary in our waters, it would only take about five minutes for a Minister to table an amendment to this Bill in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Why open the door now to allow people in other countries to say they would like a dump site 200 miles off the west of Ireland?  The west coast &mdash; the Minister fought in Europe for it in respect of fishing activities &mdash; is the most valuable 200 miles of sea in the world because of the richness of its fish and I would like to see it continually protected.  The Minister explained it is highly unlikely that anything will happen in respect of a dump site.  However, the Minister should not amend the Bill and I would like to see even stronger measures.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the provisions on sovereign immunity.  Why should ordinary citizens adhere to legislation if the <Col N="316" /> Army and the Navy are allowed to dump indiscriminately?  The Minister is right in saying that everybody should be treated in the same manner.</P>
    <P>The fine of £1,500 about which the Minister spoke seems small for the offence of dumping radioactive material at sea.  A person could be fined this amount for dumping harmless rubbish on the side of the road.  I will have to go over this part of the Bill again because I did not fully grasp it.  There may be other implications which could result in the Attorney General providing for more severe penalties.</P>
    <P>When flying by plane or helicopter over the Liffey, the sight of the filth flowing through it into Dublin Bay amazes me.  The muck entering the river from pipes is a disgrace.  I know this Bill has nothing to do with pollution of the Liffey but this river contributes to pollution at sea.  The same applies to the Shannon, the Lee and other major rivers flowing into the sea.  The pollution and discoloration extends for ten miles out to sea and is clearly distinguishable, at times from land.  If these rivers pollute our seas, major steps should be taken to clean them up.  Dublin and Cork are beautiful cities and songs are sung about the River Lee and the River Liffey.  However, a disgraceful amount of muck and rubbish has been dumped in these rivers, particularly by tourists, etc.  Something should be done to clean up the mess.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to pollution found under fish cages in many bays where people engage in fish farming.  I have never been a lover of mariculture or aquaculture and opposed their development for many years.  I may be accused of returning to the section of the Bill which deals with fishing but I have a reason for doing so.  I have been informed by divers &mdash; Senator Cashin might be able to support this claim &mdash; that the pollution found under fish cages has killed all marine life in the immediate vicinity.  I was under the impression that there was an onus on fish farmers to move their cages to different areas from time to time.  However, I am aware <Col N="317" /> of fish cages that have remained in the same spot since being placed in the sea. Fish farmers are also obliged to put their cages in an area where the tide measures two to three knots.  Any pollution would be quickly swept away as a result.</P>
    <P>The Mediterranean Sea is very clean because during World War II the Germans discovered that warm water rises to the surface and flows out to sea while cold water remains on the seabed.  They were able to gain easy access to the Mediterranean in submarines by shutting down their engines and allowing the tide to carry them undetected in the cold water current.  The Mediterranean is clean because the surface water continuously flows outward while water nearer the seabed flows in the opposite direction.  Therefore, rubbish is regularly swept away.  Something new is learned from a native of Dingle every day.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the problem of fish cages and the damage they cause.  Allegations have been made with regard to damage to white trout, etc.  I have no evidence to prove such allegations, but Senator Cashin provided me with some private information in this regard earlier today.  I ask the Minister not to amend the Bill to leave loopholes for exploitation.  I fully support the Bill which is a major step forward and adds to other legislation already in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for presenting one of the most detailed speeches relating to maritime matters I have ever heard in Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann.  For people concerned about marine environment and the protection of maritime life and amenities, this is a significant speech. The details relating to the Bill are interesting and should be read by everyone concerned about the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an addition to other legislation enacted in recent years relating to maritime pollution and dumping at sea. I am glad the Minister has seen fit to update the Dumping at Sea Bill, 1981, <Col N="318" /> and incorporate the OSPAR Convention in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is of particular significance to Ireland, an island nation.  As Senator Fitzgerald stated, it is not possible to impose boundaries on the sea.  By virtue of prevailing currents and the global pattern of sea and tidal activity, events in one part of the world's oceans can eventually affect other areas.  Something dumped on the west coast of Ireland could possibly surface on the east coast of America or on the shores of Iceland. Pollution from the west coasts of England, Scotland or Wales can badly affect the east coast of Ireland.  The full power of the sea is unknown and we cannot predict where damage can occur as a result of irresponsible activity by individuals or various nations or states. It is extremely important that international conventions are signed and implemented and that the respective signatory states have the powers and personnel available to ensure that their provisions are complied with fully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it extends the power of the Irish authorities to control dumping at sea from 12 miles to 350 miles.  This is an extremely significant development and is particularly important for the west coast, given the nature of the Continental Shelf.  I am glad the Minister has secured control over the extended area.  The Continental Shelf is one of Ireland's finest national assets and we have a major responsibility to protect it for the benefit of future generations.  Dumping should not be permitted in the area of the Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>One of my basic principles, which seems to be echoed in the Minister's speech, is that anything which comes from the land should return to the land and anything that comes from the sea should return the sea.  We go against the law of nature when we dump rubbish at sea which did not originate there.  I am pleased by the strong, positive and strict line being adopted by the Government in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Perhaps I should not state this, being a Government Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it concurs with Senator Fitzgerald's statement. I am aware of the Minister's sincerity and commitment and I am inclined to encourage the introduction of an amendment to the Bill.  The Minister should argue with the powers that be and insist that, while we will sign the convention, there will also be an outright ban in regard to offshore installations. I welcome the Minister's statement in this regard because multinational companies with major assets argue that dumping at sea must be done in a certain way because of cost factors.  The bottom line is that such companies are only concerned with profit margins.  We have a responsibility to ensure that they pay extra money &mdash; this will barely impact on their profit margins &mdash; to remove pollutants from the sea and dispose of them on land.  This returns to the fundamental principle I stated earlier that dumping rubbish at sea which did not originate there is not acceptable in the natural order of things.  We should ensure that it does not occur.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be complimented on the ground rules laid down in relation to the dumpsite on the Beaufort Dyke.  I am pleased with the conditions he has introduced and I hope he succeeds in securing agreement from the ongoing discussions and negotiations.  A commitment was secured from the UK Government to put in place a system for monitoring and management of the dump site.  This is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important the information is secured and the remapping and recharting continues.  This will ensure more information is available and that when all the necessary detail is compiled it will be possible to make a sound decision.  It is particularly welcome that this will be done in co-operation by the two Governments and that officials and <Col N="320" /> scientists from the Marine Institute will be included.  This is a major step forward and the Minister should be complimented on it.  I am delighted he has secured the agreement, and people with concerns in this area should be aware of and acknowledge the strides the Government has made.  It is also important the UK and Irish scientists liaise in relation to the issue, which is a major and welcome step forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has ensured discussions will go on between the two Governments and I am also delighted he raised the matter with the European Commissioner. The issue is of serious concern to Irish people and the country in general and, following the Government's representations, I am delighted she intends to raise it with the British Government.  I hope every pressure will be brought to bear on it to adhere to controls, which should be as strict as possible.  The issue of Sellafield is also of major importance.  It is vital that the best environmental practices are put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the INF code and that Ireland is seeking to address its deficiencies.  This is welcome and I am delighted the Department of the Marine and the Marine Institute are actively participating in this area.  The Minister said he intends to vigorously pursue this, including further restrictions in relation to route planning, notification to the coastal state, the marking of flasks, the protection and salvage plans in the event of emergencies and the designation of sensitive areas in which nuclear shipments must take place.  This is good news.  It is a progressive development and I wish the Minister and his Department well in pursuing the imposition of stricter guidelines under the INF code.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly defines the terms &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; and &ldquo;maritime area&rdquo;, another aspect which is important.  It goes into detail on this aspect, which I mentioned earlier regarding the extension of the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 miles up to <Col N="321" /> 200 miles and in some areas up to 350 miles.</P>
    <P>The issue of raw sewage entering rivers and waters around the coastline impacts indirectly on the Minister's area.  I am delighted that, in conjunction with the EU, the Government is pursuing a comprehensive programme and that by the year 2005 sewage which is pumped into the sea will have received secondary treatment.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, we cannot afford the continued pollution of our waters, and particularly our estuaries, if we are to provide the type of amenities we hope to provide in terms of marine and tourism activities in the future.  This is an important area which is being addressed very well by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important and one of the better pieces of legislation to come before the House.  In many instances in the past the marine was considered in an easy going fashion.  The Minister clearly defined the importance he and his Department attach to protecting our maritime resource.  This is extremely important and I wish the Minister and his Department every success in pursuing this policy to ensure that a better, more usable and safer marine environment is put in place for future generations. We must strive to ensure an outright ban on nuclear dumping.  This waste is dumped in sealed flasks with certain layers and at certain depths, but one must of think of future generations. Do we wish to be the authors of a major disaster, perhaps in hundreds of years? We have a responsibility to ensure this does not occur.</P>
    <P>World opinion, and public opinion in general, is more aware of the seriousness of nuclear waste.  There was much publicity about the disaster in Chernobyl, but Sellafield is just a few miles across the water and the position there is most unsatisfactory.  I compliment the Government for pursuing this matter with the EU and trying to effect the closure of the plant.  The activities there are unacceptable and the British Government must be pursued at every <Col N="322" /> opportunity and at every fora.  The same applies to the dumping of munitions. We must consider the safety of other users of the sea, including fishermen and ships transporting goods.  There have been a number of unexplained tragedies at sea.  Submarines have been suggested as a possible cause, but one wonders if some of the material dumped came out of place and became entangled in ships' nets.</P>
    <P>These issues are important.  In the past we focused on the environment and land, but we must also focus on and become more publicly conscious of our sea environment and the need to protect it.  The Bill is welcome.  It is comprehensive legislation and its details are hugely commendable.  I compliment the Minister and the Government for going the extra mile in this area and giving a lead to the co-signatories of the OSPAR Convention.  Its details are significant and I hope they will convince others of the importance of this area and ensure they sign the document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill, but it will be viewed as merely a litany of pious aspirations unless real commitment is given to ensure it is monitored and enforced.  My difficulty with the legislation is how that can be done, given that such a huge area must be monitored and protected and given the increasing volume of business activity taking place in the surrounding seas daily.  In addition, the Government is not in a position to provide the necessary resources to deal with problems such as the increased activity of the Spanish fishing fleet due to changes in the Common Fisheries Policy and the increased volume of activity around the coast which is likely to give rise to further pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although legislation governing the dumping of refuse at sea has been in place for a number of years, a huge amount of refuse is still dumped along the coastline.  This was obvious last summer and come of it came from ships and oil tankers.  In the last couple of years a number of beaches along the west coast <Col N="323" /> were seriously polluted by oil that leaked or was drained from tankers. This washed up on the coastline, including some of our most scenic beaches. Some of these offences have not yet been detected.  Most of the local authorities involved &mdash; Kerry County Council, Clare County Council, Galway County Council &mdash; are still awaiting reimbursement of expenditure incurred in dealing with pollution.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the recent reports and documentation from the Marine Research Institute.  I compliment the institute on the work it is doing.  Of the £2 million allocated under the operational programme to deal with a variety of projects in the fisheries area, nothing was provided for projects dealing with pollution control or monitoring. However, joint research projects over a number of seasons were undertaken in co-operation with the German Government on addressing the pollution problems in the lower River Shannon.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for a detailed response to the issue of control of pollution and enforcement of the regulations. While we may strengthen the Bill here, it is pointless to introduce legislation and make painstaking efforts, as we do here, to provide for every contingency if ultimately the resources are not provided to give effect to it.  It is like buying a horse without a cart.  I do not criticise the Minister in this respect because I am aware of the difficulties in obtaining finance to deal with the problems facing the marine at present. However, it is for Governments to realise that if they want to be serious about dealing with matters in the marine environment, including marine resources, they will have to commit the necessary financial resources.</P>
    <P>There is the likelihood that offshore oil exploration will take place later this year.  A Norwegian oil rig is already moving into the west coast.  Indeed, given the advances in technology, we are likely to see widespread oil exploration off the west coast of Ireland, which I support.  However, with this <Col N="324" /> comes the prospect of increased hazards from pollution.  Already, 99 per cent of all trade and commerce in and out of Ireland is carried on the country's shipping lanes.  Unless we are serious about facing up to our responsibilities and providing the Minister with the necessary financial backing, we will introduce legislation here that will not be enforced.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to repeal the 1981 Act, which is a relatively new Act in so far as legislation goes in these Houses.  It contains certain provisions which may not be adequately covered in this legislation.  It is important to look at these provisions to ensure that there are no gaps which would enable people to avoid their responsibilities.  The legislation mentions the Harbours Act, 1946. Presumably when the Harbours Bill, which has been passed by this House and returned to the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is enacted, this will be noted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the monitoring and control of pollution, we now have a huge resource and the Minister mentioned an extension of the 200 mile economic zone to, perhaps, 250 miles. However, at present we have only a few naval vessels endeavouring to come to grips with an onslaught of Spanish vessels into the Irish fishing zone.  In addition, over the past number of years it has been possible to import sizeable quantities of drugs along the west coast, undetected, uncontrolled and unmonitored.</P>
      <P>We cannot deal with these matters effectively because of the lack of resources.  Yet at the same time we are introducing extensive new legislation requiring additional resources for implementation.  In this respect I am disappointed that the Minister has done little to address this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities and harbours around the coastline are involved in control and monitoring to a certain <Col N="325" /> extent.  However, there is no monitoring or control of the conditions on the seas around us outside of the jurisdiction of the harbour boards and the local authorities. Detailed monitoring is required outside the 12 and 14 mile zones, especially in those zones where there is heavy tanker traffic.  One need only consider the damage done to the beaches along the east coast by the Milford Haven incident.</P>
    <P>There is a constant risk from new developments which could give rise to major pollution problems that would devastate some of our most important resources.  It is vital that the financial commitment be made to ensure the necessary resources to minimise this risk.  A monitoring programme should be established outside the jurisdiction of the local authorities and the harbour boards which would keep a constant monitoring of the activities of ships and vessels operating around the coastline. This could be done by the Marine Research Institute.  I commend the institute for the work it has undertaken. In a number of leaflets and documents it has published recently it has indicated the huge volume of work it is doing in extending electronic data bases and introducing modern, sophisticated technologies which will be coming into use as the marine resources around the coastline are further developed and exploited.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to establish an electronic monitoring system, given the developments taking place in satellite communications.  I welcome the work recently done on the River Shannon by the new Shannon Harbour Commissioners in consultation with the universities. They have put in place a detailed response to the monitoring of incidents.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine visited Limerick recently for the launch of this imaginative and sophisticated technological development.  It will provide detailed and specific information on how to deal with oil spillages within the jurisdiction of the Shannon Harbour Authority and the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> The Shannon Estuary is becoming increasingly busy, with the development of Moneypoint and the use of the estuary by tankers with huge cargoes of oil and coal.  These activities must be carefully monitored.  We do not want to find a situation resulting from an accident, emergency or weather conditions that would be almost impossible to control. I compliment the Shannon Ports Authority on its sophisticated arrangement to deal with this.  We need to see more such activity.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the fact that over the years the British authorities, in particular, dumped almost indiscriminately around our coastline.  Although the Government took some action to identify the volume and extent of such dumping, I cannot see how the Minister has power under this legislation to deal with these dump sites.  Perhaps he can do so under existing provisions, but I would like some specific measure included in this legislation to enable the Minister for the Marine or other Ministers to deal with some of the dump sites around the south-west and north-west coasts.</P>
    <P>Recently the British authorities reluctantly gave figures to the Government on the amount of dumping which took place.  I am almost certain that Irish Governments dumped ammunition around the coast as well.  We must monitor dumping which took place in the past and, perhaps, take action to deal with it.  This legislation does not give the Minister the authority to move rapidly to deal with what might be a deteriorating situation in some of the dump sites around the coastline.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the south-west coast.  As many Members know, materials which were dumped have washed up on beaches and on the coastline.  Not only does this put the coastline and the environment at risk but it also puts at risk the lives of people who use the beaches and enjoy the amenities around our coastline and those who work in aquaculture or in coastal communities.  This area of responsibility needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> I am glad the Minister introduced this legislation.  My remarks are not intended to criticise him or his Department but to encourage him to use his influence to impress upon his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Finance, the cost of introducing such legislation, which has not been met.  We do not have the resources or the manpower to deal with these problems.  If we are serious about this issue, we must invest substantial capital.  I am sure the Minister for the Marine will be guided by the Marine Institute and others with experience in this area.  I support the legislation and the Minister's efforts to get additional funding to implement it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made by Senators Taylor-Quinn and Fitzgerald on the dumping of nuclear waste.  In the past year the French flouted every international convention by continuing to carry out a series of nuclear tests in the South Pacific.  They totally disregarded the international community.  The Chinese are testing on a daily basis.  There is also a huge problem in the former Soviet Union with the disposal of nuclear vessels and it is likely that attempts may be made to dump some of them in the seas, which could affect Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister is facing a serious challenge in the next few years to deal with such matters.  He should use every opportunity, especially at international fora, to draw attention to this problem, which will become an international one in the next few years, and give a lead to the international community by seeking to ban nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear waste and submarines, particularly by the former Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>I support this legislation but I do not believe the necessary finance is available to fully implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCashin" hpid="Mr. Cashin Mr. Cashin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cashin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment him on introducing this long awaited Bill.  For a number of years there has been dumping of one type or another around our coastline.  This Bill will address the difficulties <Col N="328" /> and concerns of those living along our coastline.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not mention the ballast water which many vessels carry when they enter our ports.  The vessels are supposed to discharge this water before entering our coastal waters but no one can guarantee this is happening.</P>
      <P>There is a serious risk to shellfish, such as oysters and mussels, from the introduction of photo plankton and zoo plankton which could be toxic.  The Minister is aware of the major problems which have affected shellfish growers along the south, south-west and the west coast of Cork, particularly Bantry Bay which was closed for a number of months in 1994 and 1995.  No land based industry could survive such a closure. The Minister recently introduced relief funding to help growers.  There is a feeling among some shellfish farmers in the Bantry Bay area that the problem may have been caused by ballast water.</P>
      <P>Are the vessels which load gravel from the quarry at Adrigole monitored to see if they discharge ballast water at sea before entering the bay?  My information is that they are not.  Will the Minister ensure that when the Whiddy terminal reopens the tankers will discharge their ballast water before entering the bay?  I also include tankers using the Whitegate refinery.</P>
      <P>We must act on this issue now.  Ballast water is creating major problems worldwide. In the USA, the introduction of zebra mussel from Europe is costing American industries over $500 million annually.  The mussel first came to the Great Lakes and has now drifted down the east coast as far as Florida.  They block outlet pipes, which must be cleaned regularly resulting in huge annual costs.  This is only one species of fish which create problems.  If the Minister does not take the necessary precautions as regards ballast water, the Irish shellfish industry will be badly affected and the huge plankton toxicity problems will remain as the species are now in our waters.  We must try to keep the toxic species out of our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> Each year a number of fish factory ships from Eastern Europe, known as klondykers, come to our ports.  Many people are concerned that a major accident is waiting to happen.  The Minister is aware of accidents which occurred on a small number of these ships in the Shetland area of Scotland.  Surely it is reasonable to include a provision in this Bill to inspect such vessels when they arrive in Irish waters?  The condition of ships, the disposal of their waste and their effect on domestic fish should be examined.</P>
    <P>Are the harbour authorities in Castletownbere and other fishing ports in a position to collect ships' waste on a daily basis or is it stored and disposed of at sea?  Each harbour authority should provide on shore facilities for the disposal of such waste.  It is useless to introduce such a Bill unless vessels which enter Irish ports can dispose safely of their waste.  Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, they will take the easy option and dump their waste 50 to 100 miles out.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister run an ongoing publicity campaign for all vessel owners informing them of the contents of this Bill.  It will not be effective unless everyone knows the consequences. The Minister should have special signs in prominent places as well as leaflet distributions.  I suggest he talk with the Irish fishing organisations, fin fish and shellfish farmers, sailing and yachting clubs and marine owners about the ongoing dumping of materials at sea.</P>
    <P>The losing and dumping of nets at sea also cause a major environmental problem, which urgently needs to be resolved.  The dumped and discarded nets have become known as ghost nets and vast amounts of fish are caught and destroyed in these nets.  These ghost nets should be specifically mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister carry out regular inspections of the seabed in the area around our gas and oil exploration rigs? This type of dumping is creating major problems for fishermen in the North <Col N="330" /> Sea.  It is time we put a programme in place before any more such rigs come into Irish waters.  These rigs have a complement and crew of 230 persons.  This would be the equivalent of an average Irish village.  From this, one can envisage the amount of waste which would accumulate over a period of time.  Is it possible that some if not all of this can be incinerated at the point of source in a domestic way?</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the powers of the authorised officers.  I think the Minister has addressed this in so far as he has given power to the Garda.  Sections 8 and 10 state that the defendant shall be liable to a fine of not exceeding £1,500. This is a minor fine.  In my area a farmer who polluted four miles of a stream was fined £1,000.  I suggest a minor offence at sea should attract a fine which is considerably greater than £1,500.</P>
    <P>Section 11 mentions collection fees. Are they collected by the Department of Finance or the Marine?  I assume it would be the Department of the Marine and if not, I would like it changed.  I note that section 5 provides for a register of all dumping permits granted.  I suggest that these be published in leaflet form and made available to all citizens upon written request.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I welcome this Bill and I firmly believe that the changes I have suggested will strengthen the Bill.</P>

    <P>I certainly was heavily involved in polluting the seas in another life because I spent four years on large tankers. I have polluted the waters approaching New Jersey and Venezuela and I am certain I have done severe damage to Southampton over the years. It was common practice then &mdash; for all I know it may still be common practice &mdash; for tankers changing their cargo, <Col N="331" /> from heavy crude oil to light oil, chemicals or refined petrol, to flush out the tanks at sea.  They were not exactly brigands. I suppose to say they were ignorant would be the most benign way to describe them.</P>
    <P>They did not have the information and knowledge we have now.  The philosophy employed by many people down through the years was out of sight, out of mind and they simply dumped things. They disappeared beneath the surface and that was the end of it.  Nobody got too upset.  Dumping included rubbish, ships, munitions, oil, and sometimes bodies.  All sorts of things disappeared beneath the waves.  It is fair to say that those of us in the world of politics often denigrated what we called busybody environmentalists &mdash; people who were making problems for us.  We paid them slight heed at the time and it is only fair now that we recognise their contribution to raising our awareness of the pollution of the planet on which we live. It was extraordinary that one could create a tremendous uproar by despoiling a field and yet, as the Minister said, 70 per cent of the earth's surface could be despoiled without let or hindrance.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that one of those quirks of human nature &mdash; out of sight, out of mind &mdash; seemed to be the norm.  I am glad to see that the Minister's proposals include a recognition that there was a school of thought that incinerating refuse at sea was another cheap way out. There were ships specially designed as incinerator ships to take stuff from chemical plants, sail out beyond the boundaries, incinerate the material and let it off.  In many cases it was as much a pollutant when they discharged it as when it was first put on the ship.  I am glad to see that is covered.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly, who has the distinction of having been the first Minister for the Marine, mentioned the nuclear dumping in the Soviet Union.  That is the cheapest possible way of decommissioning. The Norwegians felt they could dump their oil rigs all over the place whenever they felt like it.  As more and more <Col N="332" /> equipment becomes obsolete the sea will become and is a very attractive proposition for them.  I am glad to see that is being tackled as well.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine was established by Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach. That was a statement of intent that we were going to get serious about the seas and the marine.  It is only fair to pay tribute to him for his foresight in establishing a separate Department of the Marine.  The fact that we have a Minister from a coastal constituency means that we have a proactive person in charge of an important area of our lives.</P>
    <P>I mentioned oil tankers and oil pollution. We have various examples which sometimes are accompanied by quite unreal apprehension.  For instance, I think the captain of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> had a couple of bottles of whiskey in his cabin and the incident was judged to be due to human error.  The ship went on the rocks and thousands of tonnes of oil spewed all over pristine waters.  The powers of nature in terms of recuperation are amazing.  I saw a documentary on that stretch of water recently and it has been, to a large extent, regenerated by nature itself.</P>
    <P>Our task is to minimise the risk, but there will always be risks.  I sometimes feel sorry for Ministers for Justice because when they go to bed at night some prisoner might get out over a wall.  The same can be said of the Department of the Marine where one does not know &mdash; God forbid that it happens &mdash; what attraction some ship will have for some rock off our coast.  Suddenly one is in the middle of a massive emergency and colleagues on the other side will demand either the Minister's head or that he should have prevented it in the first place.  The reality is that one cannot know; these incidents happen regularly. This Bill seeks to ensure that the State is in a position to react, particularly where pollution is concerned, quickly.</P>
    <P>When we speak about dumping at sea.  I sometimes wonder about the extent of the problem.  I heard my colleague, <Col N="333" /> Senator Fitzgerald, talk about the River Liffey and, indeed, the River Lee, with which I have a nodding acquaintance.  People living in Cork or Dublin believe that the River Lee or the River Liffey does not go anywhere in particular, because they cheerfully dump all sorts of objects into them such as traffic cones, supermarket trolleys etc.  The Dunne family, if it collected all the company's trolleys from the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal, the River Lee and so on, would probably double its wealth.  People cheerfully dump objects in rivers and believe that in some way it evaporates, but it goes down river.  With luck it finishes up in the Atlantic Ocean but when the tide changes, it might drift back again.</P>
    <P>I know some people make a living in some of County Kerry on it; being so cute, nothing goes to waste there. However, such pollution is intolerable when one considers that the Government has invested millions of pounds improving the waterways of Ireland, such as the Shannon-Erne waterway which has attracted many tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>I have the good fortune to be chairman of the task force on the Grand Canal on which huge sums of money are being spent.  In the last three weeks more than 60 boats sailed along the River Shannon into Dublin for the annual Dublin rally, and I had the privilege of officially opening the sea lock from the Liffey into the Grand Canal Basin.  I also had the pleasure of welcoming English visitors who transported their narrow boats from British canals. Those boats are now moored in Ringsend, Dublin, and will be using our canal system for the next six to eight months.  That will be an increasing feature of tourism here because the River Shannon is under used when you consider that there are 8,000 boats in Holland, an area the size of Munster, and there are less than 800 boats on the River Shannon, including those owned by the hire companies.  Our waterways are very popular with the Germans, the Swiss and the French and I hope the <Col N="334" /> peace process will ensure that once again we attract our neighbours in greater numbers.</P>
    <P>The waterways of Ireland have enormous potential but they must be clean. While the Government &mdash; in this case, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy M. Higgins, who has responsibility for the waterways and heritage &mdash; is investing large sums of money in projects, such as pumping stations along the River Shannon, citizens still cheerfully dump all sorts of rubbish into the canals.  The task force of which I am chairman has been concentrating on an education programme to try to ensure that children who live adjacent to the canals understand they are fun places for them.  Three weeks ago, with the assistance of the Office of Public Works and the waterways service, we carried more than 400 children on the canal in an Office of Public Works barge.  We could not cope with the requests.  That will be an ongoing process.  We hope schoolchildren and adults along the canal will appreciate this wonderful resource on their doorsteps. Community employment schemes in Dublin &mdash; one in Clondalkin and one starting in Ballyfermot &mdash; will regenerate the canal stretches which run through these areas and, I hope local people will take control of their own environment in association with the State.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many Dublin people who failed to recognise or who have never actually given any thought to the fact that it is now possible to board a boat in the Minister's Dún Laoghaire constituency and, provided one had help ashore, travel without setting foot on land to Belleek in Northern Ireland, by sailing down the Grand Canal to the River Shannon, entering the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, crossing the Garbally Strait into the Lough Erne system and on to Belleek.  Shortly, the navigations will be added, like those on the Newry ship canal or the Belfast ship canal.  It is now possible to travel by water from Dublin to Northern Ireland. It is as important that the waterways of <Col N="335" /> Ireland are unpolluted and kept clean as it is that the sea surrounding our coast be so protected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Minister Barrett holds the Marine portfolio as he represents one of the greatest maritime constituencies in the country.  Dún Laoghaire has a wonderful maritime museum, a modern harbour, yacht clubs, motor yacht clubs and so on.</P>
    <P>One could not move in the Grand Canal Basin last Saturday due to the number of people who were watching the activities of the Dublin rally.  I thank the Minister, wearing his other hat, for allowing the members of the Air Corps to give many people a great thrill when they engaged in rescuing people from water and boats.  We appreciate his granting permission to have the Air Corps helicopter in Ringsend over the weekend.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proactive approach by Minister Barrett in this whole area.  The matter was close to my old colleague, the late Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, when he was a junior Minister at the Department, and he got on extremely well with another constituency colleague of the Minister, Deputy David Andrews, who treated him with great tenderness and affection in his last days.  He had an abiding love for the sea. He loved working in the Department and if he was around today, he would be glad to see this sort of legislation being brought before the House by Minister Barrett.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators' contributions to the debate were very interesting, especially that of Senator Magner when he referred to dumping in the River Liffey, the River Lee and our canals.  It is indiscriminate and I wish it would stop.</P>
      <P>There is nothing as serious as the long existing threat from THORP and Sellafield to the Irish Sea.  The Government has made great efforts to resolve the problem but the plant continues to operate, and people are anxious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember going to Sellafield for the 40th anniversary of the great fire.  Since <Col N="336" /> the plant is so controversial, I felt there would be a huge crowd of people protesting against Sellafield but when I arrived, much to my amazement, the larger part of the delegation were from Counties Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford.  There were about 50 local people and one local council politician, who would not give his name, present. Everyone else in Sellafield had no interest in the protest because they all earn a good living from the plant.</P>
    <P>If we are to make any progress on Sellafield, we must bring its potential danger to the attention of the British public and educate them because it is a greater threat to them than to us; they must be made aware of that.  I have often suggested that one way of doing so would be for the Irish Government to advertise in British newspapers the effects Sellafield could have on the British population.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be glad to know that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which I am a member, held a plenary session recently in Limerick. The committee of which I am a member will look at the question of the environment in which Sellafield will play a major part.  Since I joined that body great progress has been made and there has been co-operation between Members of the British and Irish Parliament on issues which affect our country. I hope we will be able to help to resolve the Sellafield problem.  I will ask the Minister's Department for support in backing up arguments which I can make to my British colleagues to resolve that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this debate in a positive and constructive fashion.  This legislation is not party political. Nobody owns the environment about which we are all extremely concerned. It is nice to hear Members from both sides put forward helpful suggestions and proposals.  I appreciate the reception I always get in this House and I am delighted to have the opportunity to reply to some of the points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> We are extremely concerned about the dangers attaching to the existence of THORP and the transportation of nuclear materials near our shores.  What strikes me about the marine environment is that people are inclined to ignore things until there is a major catastrophe.  If I achieve anything as Minister, I hope I will have created an awareness of the value of the marine resource.  That means creating an awareness in Government, in Departments and among colleagues about the potential for generating wealth.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner referred to marine leisure and tourism.  This year, for the first time, a subhead was included in the Marine Vote for marine leisure and tourism, although it did not involve an awful lot of money.  I hope I have started something and that in future there will be an increase in the money under that subhead.  The potential in this area is extraordinary.  Anybody with imagination can see what can be done and the interest people have in canals, the sea, rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>People in the inner city do not have the money to own a boat, but that does not mean they do not appreciate the excitement of travelling on one.  If we use our imagination and the God given beauty of this country, we could develop this to an extraordinary degree.  There is potential and we must create an awareness. We have held four public seminars throughout the country in recent months in an effort to develop a marine policy and a framework.  The interest shown at each seminar was extraordinary. Between 1,200 and 1,300 people turned up.</P>
    <P>We are in the process of creating this awareness which we should continue to do.  Like trying to get people to stop littering our streets, we should use every opportunity to say that protection of the marine environment is important.  Every time we dump something, we risk a rich resource.  We must keep doing things to create that awareness.</P>
    <P>Small island states and other coastal states worldwide have been vocal in international fora as regards the transportation <Col N="338" /> of nuclear materials.  This led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Air Radiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships.  The code lays down standards for construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high level radioactive wastes.  We are using every opportunity in this regard.  As a small country it is of great benefit to us to be involved in international organisations where we can use our influence to get support from others to highlight problems and to try to find solutions.  I am in favour of being part of these international organisations.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a concern expressed by Senator Fitzgerald about a proposed amendment in relation to dumping of off shore installations.  I concur with his view that we should retain the ban.  He made the point that if things change in future, we can always amend it.  That is precisely what we are doing.  A section retains the ban on the dumping of off shore installations.  We are only making a provision so that if some time in the future scientific evidence shows that certain forms of off shore installations could be safely dumped or disposed of, we could remove the ban by way of a Government order which would need to be debated in both Houses.  In the meantime the ban remains.  I doubt if we will ever find a way to dispose of off shore installations safely but if we do, we have done precisely what the Senator asks, that is, we will consider it by way of Government order which must be approved by both Houses.  It is important that there is no misunderstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a misunderstanding on my part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why it is always good to have the opportunity to reply on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> Senator Fitzgerlad was also concerned about the dumping of radioactive waste.  The Bill prohibits the dumping of radioactive waste in our extended maritime zone of 350 miles.  He referred to the creation of a nuclear free zone, but I do not believe this Bill is the most appropriate one in which to achieve that.  We are dealing with dumping at sea and a convention on dumping.  All the provisions of the Bill relate to dumping as distinct from declaring a nuclear free zone.</P>
    <P>Senators Daly and Fitzgerald referred to control and inspection.  I would be fooling the Senators if I said it is possible to patrol every square mile or metre of Irish water.  If we had one thousand ships, we could not do so.  It is a question of education and having penalties so that if people are caught dumping, they will be penalised.</P>
    <P>CASA aircraft, piloted by the Air Corps, have been extremely helpful in terms of fisheries surveillance and have done tremendous work with sophisticated equipment linked to an advanced computer network in Haulbowline operated by the Naval Service. In fishery surveillance, these aircraft are engaged in the surveillance of dumping at sea and oil slicks.  They have been extremely useful and have passed information down to naval ships for follow up action.</P>
    <P>I fought hard for and obtained from the EU funds for the provision of additional ships.  There will be an Irish contribution to their cost but we are the only member state which will receive over 50 per cent of the cost of ships.  I sincerely hope that in the next year or two we will see additions to our fleet.  I look forward to the House supporting our efforts to obtain moneys for these ships, nationally and from Europe.</P>
    <P>Dumping of refuse at sea is prohibited under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991.  It can be difficult to enforce legislative provisions at sea and this is why we have given powers of enforcement to the Naval Service and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The cost of cleaning up the pollution following the damage caused to the <i>Sea Empress</i> is estimated at £60 million, which will be met in full under the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund Convention.  This includes the cost of the clean up on the south east coast. This would have equally applied if the incident had happened under the 1988 Act which I mentioned in my contribution. Any costs incurred by local authorities in cleaning up pollution caused by the <i>Sea Empress</i> are covered by the convention.  The polluter pays and we will pursue those responsible for this pollution.</P>
    <P>A point was made about radioactivity and damage to our fish stocks.  I wish to clarify this because it is important.  All the survey work done in the Irish Sea by the Radiological Protection Institute suggests no harm is likely to be caused to anyone from eating fish from this sea as radioactivity levels are minimal.  The thrust of the Bill is to enable the Government to deal more effectively with the THORP and Sellafield issues. Often we say things which could perhaps affect fish consumption and I assure the public that, from all the scientific evidence available to us, there is no reason to be concerned about eating fish from the Irish Sea.  We are trying to promote eating fish and I do not want people to be frightened about doing so.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald suggested that the level of fines is too small.  The fine of £1,500 is for minor offences and the maximum the District Court can impose.  The fine for offences on indictment is unlimited.  This would apply to any instance deemed by me and the Attorney General to be serious.</P>
    <P>The Senator also made a point about sea aquaculture.  As far as I am aware, it is the policy of fish farmers to move their cages from time to time.  This is one of the policies the Department is pursuing and promoting.  The issues raised by the Senator can be dealt with under other legislation.  It is the policy of the Department to encourage the fallowing process and this is becoming common practice within the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> I agree with what Senator Fitzgerald said about river pollution and with Senator Magner about canals.  The estimated value of catching salmon in our rivers is £600.  Rivers have enormous potential and are a brilliant asset.  They provide added value to bed and breakfasts, guest houses and hotels and a living for people in certain parts of the country who would otherwise not have one.  I sincerely hope people will consider seriously that we should protect the potential of our rivers and lakes.  It is good from a regional policy point of view to attract tourists so that people have a chance to make a living and stay in areas which they otherwise would have to leave to move to towns and cities, clogging them even further.  I am all in favour of a regional policy to keep people in rural areas, give young people jobs and create wealth.</P>
    <P>I hope that regional fisheries boards, under the auspices of my Department, will continue to take a strong line on the pollution of rivers and to pursue prosecutions as appropriate.  However, the main responsibility for pollution lies with local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts. We must make people understand, through an education process, the potential of our waters.  If they fail to adhere to the law, we will have to use the powers provided for in these Acts to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly asked whether it is wise to repeal the 1981 Act.  This is being done on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the appropriate authority on such matters.  I am advised that repealing the 1981 Act will not affect or eliminate anything protected under that Act.  The Senator is correct in stating that an amendment will be required on Committee Stage to refer to the Harbours Bill which is currently passing through the Lower House.</P>
    <P>Tank washing and garbage are covered internationally by the MARPOL Convention and increased resources are being devoted to the better enforcement of its provisions.  The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, provides the <Col N="342" /> necessary powers to which the Senator referred.  I welcome his statement that we need all the resources we can obtain and I will continue to fight to secure such resources for the Department of the Marine.  The dumping of rubbish at sea by vessels and aircraft will be prohibited under this convention from the year 2004 and the disposal of atomic reactors at sea is already prohibited under its terms.</P>
    <P>Senator Cashin expressed concern about ballast water.  Ireland is party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships held in London on 2 November 1973 and its 1978 Protocol MARPOL.  The issue of ballast water has been debated and discussed at international level for many years.  Ireland has been very active in these discussions.  In 1993, the assembly of the International Maritime Organisation &mdash; IMO -adopted resolution A. 774 which provides guidelines for preventing the introduction of unwanted aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships' water and sediment discharges. The resolution was further considered by the Marine Environment Protection Committee &mdash; MEPC &mdash; of the IMO in October 1995.  The MEPC approved the report by its ballast working group.  IMO considers the matter to be so serious that it has initiated research programmes into the development of methods of treating ballast water on board ships so that it would be free from harmful organisms.  Ireland will continue to take an active role in this area.  The Marine Institute is embarking on a ballast water programme. International links have already been established and the expertise is in place to identify any problems in the water column.</P>
    <P>With regard to opening Whiddy Island, it is the Department's intention that ballast water will be handled in such a manner that contaminated ballast water will not be discharged into the bay.  This matter is part of ongoing discussions between my Department and the owners of the terminal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> Klondyke operations are controlled by the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, and regulations made thereunder.  Each year, fish factory ships from Eastern Europe known as klondykers operate within the jurisdictions of Castletownbere and Killybegs fishery harbour centres and in Lough Swilly.  The procedure for entry is as follows.  Klondykers engage and operate through shipping agents who, prior to the arrival of the vessels, provide the relevant details to the harbour masters.  In the case of Lough Swilly, the harbour master for Killybegs receives the required details. On arrival the ships and their certificates are inspected and on that basis a decision is made on issuing a licence to operate.  The provisions and obligations of a licence, if issued, are thoroughly explained.  If necessary, interpreters are used for this exercise.  That procedure is checked and repeated during the period of operation.  A ship can be boarded at any time for the purpose of inspection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Fish offal generated from klondyking operations is mainly processed into fish meal.  Garbage reception facilities are available at Castletownbere and Killybegs fishery harbour centres.  Oil waste reception facilities are in place at Killybegs and the upgrading of facilities for oil waste at Castletownbere is being considered by my Department as a matter of urgency.  In the absence of such facilities, oily wastes are stored in reception tanks on board klondykers for later recycling.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the various points raised by Members.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the courtesy extended to me and the constructive approach displayed toward this new legislation.</P>
