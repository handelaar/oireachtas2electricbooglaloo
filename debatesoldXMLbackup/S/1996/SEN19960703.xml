      <P>I have notice from Senator Rory Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide escort facilities on buses transporting handicapped children to the Holy Family School for Mentally Handicapped in Charleville, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to make a statement on the student summer jobs scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Kiely and Senator McGowan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Only Second Stage of item 1 will be taken, from now until 1 p.m., and I hope we can conclude it by then.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. and again from 8 p.m. until the conclusion of Second Stage.  Item 3 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. On items 2 and 3 I suggest a time limit of 20 minutes per speaker.</P>

      <P>We are happy to support the Order of Business.  The problem of drug abuse is in the public arena at present and has been raised many times by Members.  When decriminalisation of drugs has been suggested previously it has been blown out of the sky as it has been interpreted to mean that one should be able to buy drugs in corner shops; nonetheless, this issue must be addressed and considered.  As public representatives we must know the pluses and minuses of decriminalisation and a debate on it should take place.  I do not purport to be an expert on the area but I know a certain amount and I have read what has happened in other countries.  I ask the Department of Justice and the Government to give the official position and outline the research which has been done into the effect of decriminalisation, that is, changing drugs from being illegal substances into controlled substances, not making them freely available but obtainable under prescription or under the jurisdiction of medical personnel.  This matter must be considered because the quickest way to put crime bosses and drug barons out of business is to ensure there is no business <Col N="639" /> for them to do.  Every aspect of the drugs issue must be considered and this is one matter on which I, as a public representative, have little information.  I would welcome being informed, not in an emotive way but in a scientific and researched manner, about the impact of such a move.</P>

      <P>The people campaigning for funds for independent living are again protesting outside the gates of the House today and the Government should make a positive response.  They are not asking for much, simply for the continuation of funds for eight care assistants who have been removed and for permanent funding from now on.  I appeal to the Leader to bring this message to the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has again side-stepped the Bord na Móna issue.  It has gone on for too long and handing a document back to the board is not the way to resolve the problem.  The chief executive officer and the chairman are appointees of the Government not of the board and the package involved was negotiated by the chief executive officer with the former chairman.</P>

      <P>The Leader indicated to us yesterday that we would be coming back on or around 26 July to deal with the crime issue.  We indicated that we do not mind which day the Leader chooses and we are happy to facilitate him. However, I am unclear as to the business with which we will be dealing.  Will we be dealing with the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996?  It is an important Bill and I would like to see it ordered for that day.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shorthall received what can only be described as a threat over the telephone &mdash; the sound of gunshots being fired was on her answering machine.  Such activity must be condemned out of hand.  We must make it clear we will not be deflected from our duty in tackling those responsible for such activity.</P>
      <P>Will item 3, Statements on Agriculture, be concluded before the end of this session or carried forward?  If there is a limit of 20 minutes per speaker there are a few Members who will not get to speak this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the serious anomalies in the price of milk?  In this country milk ranges in price from 99p to 116p per two litres while milk exported from this country retails at 75p per two litres. Neither the farmers nor the consumers are benefiting.  Milk is part of the staple diet of poorer people.  This issue has been ignored by the Minister.  I have a copy of an advertisement which indicates that milk exported from this country is selling at 75p per two litres in Northern Ireland while consumers here are paying between 99p and 116p.  Who is benefiting?  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister and furnish an explanation to the House.</P>

      <P>I support the sentiments expressed yesterday wishing Ireland well in its EU Presidency, particularly in matters of foreign affairs. The British Government has trouble with the &ldquo;Euro-phobes&rdquo;.  I would like to draw attention to the new transatlantic agenda and, in particular, the US treatment of Cuba.  I hope Ireland will hold to its previously liberal line on this matter. Under the Helms-Burton Act, European and Canadian firms have been penalised for investing in Cuba. Will the Leader convey to the Government the concern regarding the treatment of Cuba?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a major reorganisation of the industrial promotion agencies over the last number of years.  We now have IDA Ireland, Forfás, Forbairt, Shannon Development, county enterprise boards, the Leader programmes and a variety of other initiatives to increase employment. However, despite this, there has been criticism from towns like Ennis and Kilrush that they are not getting their fair share of industrial jobs.  The new industries being attracted to Ireland seem to concentrate in the bigger cities.</P>
      <P>Growing concern is being expressed in other towns.  There was a meeting in Ennis recently, organised by the chamber of commerce, and it was pointed out that no major industry has been attracted to Ennis since 1992.  Will the Leader arrange for the House to have a response from the Ministers involved in the various agencies as to how they can co-ordinate their activities to make them more effective?  Despite the efforts of the agencies, the large towns seem to be faring badly.</P>

      <P>In the context of anti-crime measures, I ask the Leader to <Col N="642" /> impress on the Minister for Justice the importance of providing more funding to help the existing community training workshops to extend and to provide more places.  They make an enormous contribution to crime prevention by way of remedial action.  The Leader should impress on the Minister the importance of funding for the existing workshops and the need to bring new ones on stream.</P>

      <P>The G7 meeting took place this week and it made an unequivocal call on the Israeli Government to deal directly with the Palestinians. When the G7, the group of the world's richest nations, makes a direct request we should echo it and request the new Israeli Government to start direct negotiations with the Palestinians on the issues which were supposedly resolved before the government changed in Israel.</P>
      <P>A South African embassy will open in Dublin tomorrow.  This will be an historic occasion.  Dr. Kader Asmal, a Minister in the South African Government, will address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Would the Leader suggest to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that Dr. Kader Asmal, a distinguished former Irish citizen should be asked to address the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate on education.  We have asked for it and it has not been offered.</P>
      <P>There have been threats made against a Member of the other House and there has been much publicity about that.  I have had threats made against me; I was told I would be the first to be burned.  I live in a cul-de-sac and there was graffiti written on the pavement outside my door.  The less we talk about these threats, the better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to take these threats seriously, but not too seriously?  There is no one in this House who has not been threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finneran and ask the Leader to use his good offices with the Minister for Health to ensure that the Centre for <Col N="644" /> Independent Living is sufficiently funded to continue providing assistants.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to have a debate on Bord na Móna at an early opportunity? I agree also with Senator Finneran. Bord na Móna is a creature of statute and the Houses of the Oireachtas established it so if there is a continuing problem, we should discuss it here.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader convey concerns felt by a number of Members at the personal interference by Minister De Rossa in the choice of the board of management at St. Feargal's Family Resource Centre in Bray?  He is behaving in a most outrageous way and is attempting to blackmail the current board by withholding money to put political cronies of his and his wife into office.  Will he use his good offices with Minister De Rossa&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging statements on agriculture tonight.  I support the plea by Senator Dardis that the debate would be adjourned to a sitting day before the end of session and will not drag on over the summer because that would defeat its purpose.  There is great interest in this debate and many people are anxious to contribute.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Leader has any power in this area but will he try to get RTE to stick to their programming times as advertised in the <i>RTE Guide</i> or in the daily newspapers?  I was interested in a programme last Sunday night and it did not appear until a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes after the time that was printed in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis raised the issue of the intimidation of a Member of the other House and we have to condemn that.  This issue should not be dragged out but, nevertheless, it has to be taken seriously and should act as a spur in our efforts to combat organised crime.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government made major announcements yesterday and that all parties in both Houses are determined to take action.  I support what has been said.  It is not enough to announce measures and to indicate intentions and action.  It is important that this House also plays its part in passing legislation. We will support extra sitting days before the end of this session if necessary.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator McAughtry with regard to the EU Presidency and welcome the Taoiseach's indication that Ireland would endeavour to ensure that pro-jobs and anti-poverty measures will be incorporated with the more straightforward economic aspects of the Maastricht guidelines.  I hope our Presidency will be used to further those issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Daly in his call for a look at industrial strategy. I was at a meeting recently where the IDA admitted that the packages they have available to foreign multinationals are good enough to get them into the country but not good enough to get them to locate outside major centres. The companies are saying they want to go to proven sites and do not intend to reinvent the wheel.  A computer company wants to go where the next biggest computer company is because they have done the groundwork.  This has to be looked at and I support the call for a debate.</P>
      <P>With regard to Bord na Móna, I sincerely hope that when the Minister has to do the board's job, he will be supported by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of points raised by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, Committee Stage will be taken next Tuesday.  For the information of Senators, next week's business will include Committee and Final Stages of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, the Final Stages of the Borrowing Powers of Certain Bodies Bill, 1996, the debate on the Ombudsman's report and the National Standards Authority of Ireland Bill, 1996.  There may also be a debate, if it is approved by Government, on the report on the newspaper industry &mdash; two days should accommodate that.  The House will be recalled on 26 July and the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996, will be discussed and another short Bill <Col N="647" /> appointing extra judges &mdash; one day should be sufficient.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of decriminalisation and he has a chance this afternoon to raise that question with the Minister for Justice where I hope he gets full information.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran and others raised the question of the Centre for Independent Living and I have passed on to the Minister the concern and support of the House on that issue.</P>
      <P>The question of Bord na Móna was raised by a number of Senators.  The Minister has behaved impeccably.  It would have been wrong for him to intervene up to now.  The Minister has rightly asked for clarification; perhaps one could be stronger than that.  When that clarification is provided, the Minister will act, but the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is probably the most appropriate vehicle for early debate so that people can be called to give evidence and their views.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the question of the intimidation of Deputy Shortall.  Every Member has to endorse the strong stand taken by the Government on that and its utter condemnation. It must be taken seriously.  There can be no ambiguity about how seriously these threats are to be taken and they cannot be tolerated.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis and others raised the question of the debate on agriculture. This debate has been requested by Senator Rory Kiely for some time.  I had hoped to give plenty of time to the main spokespersons for each group to put their case but the debate will not conclude today.  Of course, if Members wish, they may share their 20 minutes, which is a reasonable amount of time if somebody wants to make a major case. I will see whether there is time next week, but I cannot guarantee it.</P>
      <P>I will inquire into the matter which Senator McGowan raised.  I thought milk prices had been decontrolled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McAughtry raised the question of the US treatment of Cuba and <Col N="648" /> there is certainly strong support for Cuba in both Houses and on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Many Members of this House have been to Cuba and seen it at first hand.  I will find out for Senator Lee the progress made by the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>I can tell Senator Daly that there will be a major debate on industrial policy early in the new session.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh made a good point about more funds for community training workshops and it will be conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with Senator Lanigan because I sometimes have trouble telling one University Senator from another.  I support his point about dealing directly with the Palestinians.  I will raise the other matter, which he should not have raised, at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. There will be a debate on the vocational education committees early in the new session, as I said yesterday.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of Bord na Móna to which Senator Roche referred, and the Adjournment is the place to raise the other matter if he wants information on it.</P>

    <Title>Metrology Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>A major reform of the weights and measures infrastructures in Ireland has been underway since 1992 comprising modernisation of equipment and facilities and streamlining of the organisational structures.  This Bill, which I am very pleased to introduce, will bring the programme to completion by establishing a new legal metrology service.  The primary objectives of the Bill are: first, to update and consolidate existing weights and measures, and <Col N="649" /> quantity control legislation; and, second, to provide the legal framework for the establishment and operation of the new metrology service.</P>
      <P>Measurements constitute the basis for a number of activities that are essential to our everyday lives.  In fact, the act of measuring is such an inherent part of civilisation that its historical, economic and social roots often remain hidden deep below the surface of a society's fabric &mdash; perhaps unknown to a public whose general welfare depends on a fair and accurate measurement process.</P>
      <P>Metrology is the science devoted to the measurement means that make up this process.  It includes: the theory of measurement; units of measurement and their physical realisation; measurement procedures and methods; characteristics of measuring instruments; and persons and organisations who undertake measurement.</P>
      <P>Whenever goods are exchanged from one owner to another, a fair assessment of the value of the products being exchanged is necessary.  Trade is one of the basic elements that has historically governed human interaction.  This is why the economic and social development of a society would be difficult without the use of reliable measurement tools and practices in its basic commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Metrology is as fundamental to modern society as is the unit of currency, impacting as it does on all aspects of trade, science and technology, industry, agriculture, health and safety and environmental protection.  The needs of modern societies generate a constant demand for more precise measurements. For example, in a highly industrialised world the interchangeability of product components and the geographical dispersion of manufacturing units demand worldwide harmonised methods and standards of measurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growing out of a long history of governmental responsibility for protecting citizens from fraudulent business transactions, legal metrology can be considered as the public branch of any given measurement system.  In other <Col N="650" /> words, in many cases where measurement results have a direct effect on the interests of the general public, Governments apply regulations that are intended to provide a consistent and valid basis for establishing the highest degree of measurement credibility possible.</P>
    <P>As civilisations continue to break new ground with never-ending development processes, the world is becoming smaller.  Modern means of communication have reached even the most remote corners of the globe and technological progress in transportation has opened the channels to a geographic accessibility unimaginable even in the recent past.  These advances symbolise a world whose individual societies have chosen to join forces on a path towards international co-operation.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant consequences of the transformation of a world of nations into an international world is its impact on the global economy. Trading between nations determines the overall economic state of the world.  Moreover, a healthy international co-operation within the areas of science, technology, medicine and the environment is a key element for fruitful exchanges of knowledge and expertise. Measurements must provide a strong base for these interactions.  This is why the development of harmonised metrological tools and procedures in parallel with the establishment of international co-operation constitutes another important consequence of the move towards a global community.  A number of international institutions have indeed been established to deal with metrological subjects in fields such as standardisation, physics, chemistry, and health.</P>
    <P>Metrology law in this country falls into two categories.  The first body of law, the Weights and Measures Acts, dating from 1878 to 1961, together with a number of regulations implementing EU law.  concern the following: units of measurement; standards through which the units are realised; organisation of the service; and a system of establishing <Col N="651" /> confidence in measuring instruments used in trade.  Measurement of gas and of electricity are regulated by means of the Gas and Electricity Acts respectively.</P>
    <P>The second, paralleling these measures, the Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980, gives effect to EU directives and deals with the control of quantities in pre-packaged goods.  Section 39 of the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987, deals with short measure in goods sold loose.</P>
    <P>Thus, the existing legal metrology service is based mainly on 19th century legislation, which I am sure the House will agree is no longer suitable for today's technological age.  In addition, the existing service has its organisational origins in the last century.  The organisation is fragmented with overall responsibility for weights and measures and quantity control residing with the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Enforcement resources are dispersed between Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council staff, who enforce weights and measures law within their own administrative areas and Garda sergeant <i>ex officio</i> staff, who carry out similar duties throughout the remainder of the country.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are required to provide accommodation and equipment to enable the inspectorates carry out their work.  Resource constraints have meant that local authorities, with the exception of Dublin Corporation, have had little success in discharging this duty.  An inspectorate attached to the Department of Enterprise and Employment enforces the Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980.  Enforcement of the law in relation to gas meters is the responsibility of the public lighting Departments of Dublin and Cork Corporations, neither of which have been able to maintain these services.</P>
    <P>Essentially, the Bill will update existing provisions and provide for the establishment of a new legal metrology <Col N="652" /> organisational structure which will be merged with the industrial metrology functions under the operational control of Forbairt's national metrology laboratory. The legal metrology service at present operates under the overall control of my Department.  The new service being established under the Bill will operate to the higher technical standards necessary to serve the needs of industry and consumers as well as contributing to the establishment of mutual confidence between the metrology services in an open European market.</P>
    <P>As the world continues to make great bounds forward in science and technology, daily living is becoming more and more complex.  Rapid economic growth has led to the consumer era, accentuating the need for protecting both the interests of buyers and sellers as market forces reflect the trend towards growing competition for new products and services.</P>
    <P>Increasingly in recent years people in business are, on a voluntary basis, seeking third party assurance on the metrological integrity of the measuring instruments which they use.  Many trading companies see the financial advantages of accreditation to quality production standards &mdash; for example, ISO 9000, under which certifiable traceable measurements are the foundation of quality in the production of goods and services.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main features of the Bill.  The Bill will be brought into force by means of a commencement order.  It will, together with the Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1980, be construed as one Act.  The Bill governs measurements used for the purpose of trade.  I will be empowered to extend by regulation the scope of application to uses other than trade.  Existing weights and measures law is being repealed.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, I will have general regulation making powers, including regulations to implement EU legislation, thus consolidating all regulation making powers in the legal metrology field in one piece of legislation.  As at present, the legislation will allow for the <Col N="653" /> charging of fees.  Ministerial approval will be required for new fee rates. Expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall be as sanctioned by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a legal metrology service within Forbairt, and the position of Director of Legal Metrology, who will be responsible for management of the service, thus replacing the existing fragmented structures.  An important element in the establishment of the new service entails the transfer to Forfás, on a voluntary basis, of staff of the existing service.  As I have already done in the Lower House, I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the metrology service, both past and present, Garda, local authority and departmental, who have given valuable service to consumers and industry down through the years.</P>
    <P>My officials have been in negotiation with staff representatives for some time on the transfer terms to apply.  In addition, I personally met with staff and their representatives to discuss their concerns.  The Bill guarantees that staff who opt to transfer to the new service shall not, unless otherwise agreed, suffer any diminution of their existing terms of employment, including tenure of office.</P>
    <P>An agreement was reached with the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors through the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council in January last on the terms of transfer which will apply to Garda sergeants <i>ex officio</i> inspectors of weights and measures.  Negotiations with the union representing 12 departmental and local authority staff are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the appointment of officers of Forfás or existing inspectors who shall enforce the new legislation. Powers are being vested in inspectors to examine and test both measuring instruments and goods to ensure conformity with legal requirements. Provision is also made to avoid employees having conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that bodies other than the service, to be known as &ldquo;special bodies&rdquo;, may be authorised by <Col N="654" /> the director and with the prior consent of the Minister to carry out statutory functions subject to certain conditions. These conditions may include proven technical competency of staff involved, that the measurement standards used be traceable to international standards, that the &ldquo;special body&rdquo; operates its metrological functions in an impartial manner and that the procedures followed be adequately documented and open to inspection.</P>
    <P>A special body will be subject to regular monitoring and if it does not continue to meet the conditions its authorisation may be withdrawn.  It is envisaged that this provision will enable organisations such as the ESB or Bord Gáis to be given responsibility for carrying out respective legal metrology functions in relation to meters used for the sale of electricity and gas.</P>
    <P>Suppliers and users of measuring instruments will be required to ensure that where instruments are intended for a prescribed use they shall conform to legal requirements.  Extending this obligation to the suppliers of instruments is new.  I consider that the existing legal position whereby the user of the instrument is solely responsible for ensuring conformity is unfair.  A significant change in existing law is proposed whereby in special circumstances dispensation from compliance with this requirement may be given.  This dispensation may be granted where field trials of new technologies are necessary to establish suitability.</P>
    <P>Traditionally conformity assessment procedures comprised type approval of new designs and then, in turn, the verification of each instrument of the approved type before being used for a prescribed purpose.  Type approval entails the detailed testing of a new design in accordance with international standards to ensure that its metrological integrity is assured over a reasonable period of time.  The type approval certificate is issued thereafter.  In the restructured service both testing and formal approval will be undertaken by the National Metrology Laboratory, <Col N="655" /> Forbairt.  Heretofore, type approval was a ministerial responsibility.</P>
    <P>Verification, an inspection function, arises when instruments are being prepared for initial use for a prescribed purpose and entails examination for conformity with an approved type and testing for accuracy.  The conformity assessment procedures will be set out in regulations to be made by the director of legal metrology.  An important new provision in section 14(4) enables instruments not intended for a prescribed use to be subjected to the conformity assessment procedures.  This will have relevance mainly for industrial quality assurance.</P>
    <P>A system of in-service inspection will be prescribed by the director of legal metrology.  This is important from both the consumer and owners points of view in that it will maintain public confidence in measurements made in the course of trade.  It is also vital in a free market regime for measuring instruments that member states operate adequate market surveillance procedures.  Provision is made for marking and sealing of instruments to signify conformity with legal requirement.</P>
    <P>Existing law on units of measurement which originated from the EU directive is being reproduced in the Bill.  While Government policy from 1968 onwards was to adopt a single system of units of measurement, <i>le Systéme International d'Unités</i>, SI, also referred to as the metric system, our progress in achieving that objective was determined by the various EU efforts at withdrawing from legal use non SI units of measurement in use in the Community.</P>
    <P>A brake on our progress was also exerted by the relatively slower pace of metrication by our major trading partner, the United Kingdom.  However, I am pleased to say that very significant progress has been made in recent years in achieving the change over to a single system of units of measurement, the SI system.  The Bill also lays down the definition of other units by reference to units of the SI system; the denominations <Col N="656" /> of standards for mass, volume/capacity and length; and standards through which the units may be realised and disseminated.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of standards necessary to support measurements generally in this country is being conferred on Forbairt. But the Bill also permits other competent organisations to be responsible for provision and maintenance of standards in their own specialised fields.</P>
    <P>An inspector's primary responsibility is to establish if, following initial verification, instruments in use for trade continue to remain within the permitted limits of error.  However, an inspector may, if requested by the owner and with the approval of the director, carry out adjustments to measuring instruments in use where they are found to be outside the permitted limits.  A somewhat similar provision is in existing law.  Forgery of marks or tampering with, or unauthorised removal of, marks and seals will constitute an offence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have, down through the years, provided and maintained weighing equipment for public use, most notably weighbridges set up for the purposes of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) (Amendment) Act, 1960, as well as those established for the purposes of markets and fairs laws dating from the last century.  This arrangement is being continued and extended to include measuring instruments.  Public confidence in the operation of such equipment is maintained by a system of controls and obligations applicable to the operator of the equipment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also regulates the sale of solid fuel by reference to quantity.  At present there are no legislative requirements regarding the display of the net quantity on sealed bags of solid fuel, but this omission is now being redressed. Provision is also made requiring the vendor of solid fuel sold loose or in an open container to issue a docket to the purchaser indicating the quantity sold.</P>
    <P>The existing laws relating to quantity <Col N="657" /> control and short measure are being brought together.  Thus they will be more intelligible to the enforcement authorities, the trade and consumers. The Bill lays down a regime of offences, provides for appeals to the District Court, the stipulation of rules for the prosecution of offences and the imposition of penalties for those found in breach of the law.  Finally, the Bill will permit the transfer of property and equipment currently vested in the Minister or the local authorities to Forbairt.</P>
    <P>These are the principal features of the Bill, many which, of necessity, are of a technical nature.  However, it is important to stress that the enactment of the legislation and the associated modernisation programme shall improve considerably the service available to both industry and consumers.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It incorporates, transcends and replaces legislation dating back to 1878, 1889 and 1928.  Metrology is very important to our everyday living.  It involves every part of industry and virtually every part of the profession.  This Bill brings us into line with the requirements of European legislation.  It brings under one unit something that is currently administered by a number of different groups, and this causes some concern.  The Bill is well worded.  It brings into force sensible legislative requirements and addresses some omissions.</P>
      <P>It must be asked why there have been very few prosecutions under the current legislation.  One of the reasons is that, in rural areas, the legislation has been administered and enforced by the Garda Síochána.  It is a fairly powerful weapon when a member of the Garda Síochána comes around to look at the equipment.  If there were problems they are readily put right.  By contrast, in Dublin city, the legislation has been administered by members of Dublin Corporation while in other areas it has been administered by people from the QC department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> All these people have had training and have acquired a great deal of experience in this area.  The Bill provides for training and the charging of fees.  This will enhance the service.  I am sure the Minister of the day will agree to increase the fees commensurate with the requirements to administer the law and improve the service.</P>
    <P>However, there is a difficulty with these three groups of people and how they are to be employed in the future. According to the explanatory memorandum, Part II, section 8, provides that:</P>
    <P>Personnel attached to the existing service may be employed by Forfás in the new service and subject to agreement with their trade unions or staff associations their conditions of service shall be no worse than they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>This appears to be fair and reasonable. However, 20 members of the Garda Síochána are currently employed in the service; these men will retire at different ages.  The members of Dublin Corporation can continue in employment until they are 65 years of age whereas the members of the Garda Síochána retire at 57 years of age.  Given the present small size of the Force there is a possibility that they may retire at a later age. They also have different rates of pay and terms and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>What is to happen to these people? How is the service to be administered? Will those employed by Dublin Corporation seek the same rate of pay and terms and conditions as members of the Garda Síochána?  There will be difficulties in this area and provision should be made to deal with this unfairness.  It would be very unfair to force members of the Garda Síochána to accept a situation which breeds insecurity in their present position.</P>
    <P>One alternative may be to second these 20 men; I understand that most of them are within three years of retirement. Some of them may continue for longer.  I also understand that there is a precedent for making such an arrangement. <Col N="659" /> Another alternative, which would probably be much more expensive, would be to make an arrangement that would entail retiring them and then reemploying them.  The third option would be to employ them as members of the Garda Síochána and increase all the other benefits of all the other people involved to the same level.  We will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage in this area.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of training will be required.  These men have 20 to 25 years service.  One must consider the bottom line given the amount of money involved in training new people.  A sensible arrangement to accommodate the fears of the gardaí involved and retain their services while new people are coming on stream in three years time would be welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for instruments of high technology, but there are also low technology instruments in the measuring world.  The legislation adopts the sensible approach of bringing it all under one heading and ensuring the quality control department, if that is the correct term, carries out that function. It is experienced in the field as it already has a function in this area.</P>
    <P>Our image as a young, go ahead country must be portrayed in all areas.  This matter will bring us into line and enhance our image.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position of the Garda and the other members employed regarding how one can sensibly deal with people from different backgrounds with different terms and conditions in the three departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is updating laws which were enacted in 1878 and slightly amended on a number of occasions up to 1961.  The Bill is significant because it is fundamental to the areas of science, technology, industry, agriculture, health, safety and environmental protection.  It covers a broad spectrum of the workings of the economy and a substantial number of people are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> I was reared close to the local village of Kilmainham Wood and I remember the weights and measures man, who was a Garda sergeant, arriving to measure the amount of petrol per gallon.  That was over 30 years ago and I look forward to hearing the Minister's view on whether gardaí should deal with this area now.  Given the Government's welcome decision to replace 200 gardaí in stations around the country with civilians &mdash; this proposal was discussed by previous Governments for ten years but nothing was done about it &mdash; perhaps it is time to bring this area a stage further in terms of implementing the regulations and bringing them up to EU standards.  People other than gardaí could be used to implement the regulations.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline the type of rates he envisages people will be charged for the service, which must be provided to ensure everything is correct? What is the total number of staff involved?  I welcome that the Minister has already held discussions with the staff concerned and that they are happy with the assurances they received regarding the change from Forbairt to the new system.  It is right that such consultations are held before any changes are made; this avoids problems people may have with them.  What is the overall position of the staff, including the gardaí who are involved at present?  I was of the opinion that the Garda sergeants involved were retired from the force, but it appears that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I understand the proposal the Minister mentioned regarding the establishment of a special body to investigate the running of this service.  He also mentioned that the body will be investigated at various times to ensure it is carrying out its duties in a particular manner.  Is there duplication in that regard?  Are two bodies required?  If not, the matter should be brought to a favourable conclusion to ensure there is not a huge amount of duplication.  The Minister of State has been in the House frequently of late with different legislation; the Minister for Enterprise and Employment <Col N="661" /> was here last week with a Bill while Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, was also here with legislation.</P>
    <P>Given all the new laws and regulations which must be implemented, bodies are faced with the substantial extra workload of investigating each other.  I have no problem with that aspect or ensuring work is carried out satisfactorily and within the law, but are all the bodies being established to investigate whether regulations approved by the Oireachtas are being implemented necessary?</P>
    <P>I welcome that the House is discussing legislation which will bring an incredibly antiquated system into the 21st century.  I often heard farmers at marts make comments about the scales and that it was not weighing correctly. Many complaints were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only if there was under achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If their expectations under achieved.  Nobody ever brought it any further than making comments such as the animals involved were a different weight at another mart previously so the scales must be wrong.  How many cases were taken against people in the past? This matter does not receive much publicity but I doubt there have been many cases.  However, not much was wrong with the system because it worked.  This is my experience of inspections carried out on small shops selling petrol in villages and towns.  Things have moved on dramatically since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is welcome and I hope the Minister is in a position to reply to my questions.  I hope the Bill will ensure consumers and business people are protected because 99.9 per cent of those in business want to ensure what they do is correct.  As the previous contributor said, everything is sold by weight and bulk nowadays.  I am delighted for the consumer as, for the first time, those selling coal and solid fuel from the backs of lorries will have to give identification for the weights involved.  We are not saying these people are doing <Col N="662" /> their jobs incorrectly.  In the old days 20 tons of coal arrived in the local shopkeeper's yard.  It was divided by filling one hundredweight in one bag and so on.  I spent many days filling such bags.</P>
    <P>We have moved on and we are doing two things here.  We are ensuring that the consumer is protected and we are also bringing the regulations in to be administered under one roof.  That is fair and right.  99 per cent of businesspeople will be quite happy that everything is being done to keep our laws current with laws across the European Community.  I welcome this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which I do not see as a technical measure but one which is of very real importance to everyone in the country.  I thank the Minister also for educating me.  I had not heard the word &ldquo;metrology&rdquo; before and I had to look up the dictionary to see what it was.  His explanation is very useful and easier than the dictionary.</P>
      <P>Having a trusted system of weights and measures is absolutely central to a modern market-based economy.  It is a tribute to the quality of the system we have that most people do not even think about it.  I know that we have a history of good standards in this area in Ireland. I do not know when we originally established a recognition but I know that in the 1950s some visitors to my father from England commented on the marks in glasses from which we served.  In those days I think we had a standard in which there was a mark in every glass in a pub.  They did not have this in Britain and had no system of weights and measurements or measuring alcoholic drinks.  We have had a system and standard in this that has been higher than elsewhere for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people go into a shop or a petrol station or a pub, they go on the assumption that they will get what they paid for.  If it is a litre of petrol, they assume they will get exactly one litre.  If it is a kilo of meat, they assume that what it says on the shopkeeper's scale is exactly what they will get.  If it is packaged <Col N="663" /> goods, they assume that the quantity marked on the pack is exactly what they will get.</P>
    <P>If customers could not make those assumptions, then they would find it impossible to compare like with like.  If somebody offers you a few pence off a litre of petrol but gives you short measure, then you as the customer have no way of knowing what the real price is.  But when weights and measures are respected and enforced, then proper competition can take place, and competition is the most effective protection that the customer can have.  We take all this for granted but it does not happen automatically.  The system has to be enforced so that unscrupulous people are not tempted to try to fiddle with it.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of my own business, some two years ago a very large supermarket in America was found, on investigation, to have approximately 100 offences in this area. It damaged the company to the extent that it will be very difficult for it to overcome. I speak of the enforcement of this Bill as a help to business and one we should appreciate more than we have done in the past.  Senator Farrelly has referred to the respect for those who enforced this.  I have been in business for over 35 years and in the 1950s and 1960s when told that a sergeant from weights and measures was coming, it scared that shopkeeper that something might go wrong and embarrass him.  It was a marvellous way of enforcing this because there was respect for the importance of having a sergeant come to do so.  I am not sure if the term &ldquo;sergeant&rdquo; will still be used.  Those employed in this area have always had a high respect that I hope will be maintained, although it is not the intention in this Bill that they should remain members of the Garda.  I understand the logic of transferring somebody so as not to have two bosses.  If somebody is working in this area and is not a garda, I understand why the Garda Commissioner would not want to have them as members of the Garda if they work <Col N="664" /> for somebody else.  I ask the Minister to be sympathetic to the concerns of people involved in this and to having a sergeant do this work.  It has been a great benefit in the past because it has given a prominence and importance greater than would have happened had an inspector come in.</P>
    <P>Enforcing a weights and measures system is a very important role for the State.  It is a perfect example of what the State should be doing in regard to commerce: namely, creating the conditions in which businesses can compete fairly to fulfil the customers' needs.  Without effective enforcement the system would start to crumble very quickly.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, when petrol in the North was considerably cheaper than down here, some of the less reputable filling stations across the Border had two pumps &mdash; a &ldquo;Sterling pump &ldquo;for their northern customers and a &ldquo;punt pump &ldquo;for the people from the South. The point was that the punt pump was not monitored by the weights and measures people of the North but the Sterling pump was.  I leave it to your imagination to work out why any filling station would have two separate pumps in that way.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should modernise our weights and measures system as changing conditions make that necessary. It is right too that we should keep fully in step with EU practice in this regard.  I welcome this Bill from both aspects and I believe if there are any changes needed on Committee Stage that they will get full consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and will not detain the House.  The other speakers have gone into the various details of the Bill, which is establishing a legal metrology service within Forbairt and streamlining the system. As the Minister said, some of the legislation and organisational units go back to the last century.  It is logical that these should be brought together in an organised way to ensure public confidence and conformity across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> Senator Quinn is correct.  Our confidence in measurement does not impinge on our consciousness most of the time. We assume that we will get what we ask for in terms of measurement and weight; but if we did not, then there would quickly be a major effect on how we do our business for both consumer and producer in terms of confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that metrology is as fundamental to modern society as currency. We use it every day in all sorts of transactions and we need to ensure that we have confidence in what we are doing.  We all pay tribute to how the system has been run, but we also agree that it has been diverse and it is necessary to bring the system together.  We need standardisation and uniformity to ensure that companies do not have to go outside to find methods of conformity to recognised measurements, as the Minister said.</P>
    <P>The consumer wants fair play and in a lot of situations we weigh and measure for ourselves.  In supermarkets we weigh our own vegetables and fruit and people like to do that.  When you go into a petrol station, buy a bag of coal or order a drink, you want to be absolutely certain that what you get is what you pay for, as Senator Quinn said.  I was thinking back to buying packets of crisps as a child and sometimes you got one that looked like it had less in it than one bought the day before.  Children have a particularly strong sense of fair play and I felt very hard done by when the packet looked a little smaller than it should have been.  It probably was not, but it is a basic instinct in us all that even if we have paid only two or three pence for something, we want to be absolutely certain that we have got what we paid for.</P>
    <P>Various bodies have been involved &mdash; local authorities, the Garda, the Department, etc.  I welcome the fact that suppliers as well as users of instruments will have a legal obligation to conform to standards under this legislation.  In the past &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; only the person using the <Col N="666" /> instrument was under the obligation.  It makes sense that suppliers should also have a legal obligation to conform to standards as they are in the business of producing the equipment.  I also understand &mdash; perhaps the Minister can clarify this &mdash; that in some cases field trials can be exempted.  I assume that this is so that people are not unnecessarily constrained during the trial period when carrying out research and development into new products.  If that is the intention of the exempion it is welcome.  I know this Minister has been doing a great deal to encourage Irish companies to engage in research and development in order to establish new products and create more employment.  I would like the Minister to clarify that but I think I understand the intention.</P>
    <P>The other point that caused most concern has been the question of the existing personnel and in particular the 20 Garda sergeants who have been working within the system and whose working conditions will be changed under the new legislation.  If they remain members of the Garda Síochána it will not be possible for them to work in the new organisation.  However, if they work in the new organisation they will retain all their pay and conditions.  This matter was raised in the other House.  It is more a question of status than of pay and conditions. The Minister indicated that, according to the response he received from the Department of Justice, it is not possible in this case to retain the same personnel in the same position with the same command structures under the legislation governing the Garda.  If that is the case we must accept it but we would like to do whatever we can for the individuals involved to preserve the jobs they have been doing all their lives. However, we also understand that the legislation has to be complied with.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrelly also mentioned that, in other contexts, such as crime and drugs, we are calling for more targeted use of our Garda personnel.  We welcome the fact that 200 civilians are to be brought into the service to carry out tasks that are not necessarily central to <Col N="667" /> Garda operations.  We cannot have it both ways.  We must understand that this is why these changes are being made.  Nevertheless, we ask that the individuals involved would be given every consideration.  I know the Minister is sympathetic to their case.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House any longer.  I welcome the fact that we are now streamlining the system, both legislatively and organisationally.  I am sure that we will have a modern system about which we can be confident and which will work well for the consumer, the producer and the various commercial outlets involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the necessity for this Bill.  It aims to modernise the original legislation, some of which has been on the Statute Book since 1878.  However, I am somewhat taken aback at the cumbersome and complex mechanism which has been used in this Bill to deal with what, to me, appears to be a straightforward matter.  Behind the scenes there is probably a lot of pressure on the Minister but I wish to give him some advice.  If, as a Minister, I were handed a Bill like this, I would ask the persons who presented it to me to take it away and streamline it so that it would clearly indicate, in a legislative way, what I wanted to do and how I would do it.</P>
      <P>I have read this Bill and it seems we are to build a new system into the existing system which will be under the auspices of certain Ministers and under the control of certain agencies.  It seems to have some independence of its own while at the same time being completely under the control of existing agencies. My description is not too clear.  While I do not wish to be critical and while I support the principle of establishing new legislation to modernise our laws, I seriously question the methodology being used in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with legislation for over 20 years and, in my opinion, we are using a very complicated method to deal with something that should be simple to <Col N="668" /> organise.  If we are to appoint a director to deal with this matter, he or she should be responsible to a small board. The director would be independent and would report to a separate board, calling in the various bodies with responsibilities in different areas, such as local authorities, the Garda Síochána, agencies or private companies.  As far as possible a clear legislative framework should be set down, as has been done in other legislation.</P>
    <P>I am almost certain that in a very short time either this Minister or some other Minister from the same Department will be back here making changes to this legislation because it will be found to be very cumbersome in practice and will not have the desired results.  This is one of the few Bills in which I see proposals to repeal parts of the existing Schedules.  On Committee Stage we may get more detail about that.  It is proposed to repeal Part IV of the First Schedule.  It is important, if we are setting down legislation to deal with these matters, not to talk about repealing some of the existing Schedules. Why is this necessary?  That this kind of situation cannot be avoided baffles me.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we will have a service within a service rather than an independent service under an independent director reporting to a separate board and calling in the various bodies with responsibilities in the different areas.  I am sure the Bill is almost finalised now but I would strongly recommend this course of action.  I doubt if the Minister looked very carefully at this.  He probably inherited memos from various Ministers over the last number of years who had intended to streamline this legislation.  We now have a Bill made from bits and pieces glued together and, in my view, a very unsatisfactory mechanism to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of Forfás, the director of Forbairt and the Department of Enterprise and Employment have some responsibility under this Bill. Either Forfás or Forbairt has been asked to design a superannuation <Col N="669" /> scheme for the new service under the IDA legislation.  It would be better to have a separate body under the director which would draw up its own superannuation scheme and submit it for approval in the normal way to the Minister for Finance rather than using agencies which have been hived off from the IDA and which are using IDA mechanisms to operate their superannuation schemes.  It sounds a very complicated way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Inspectors are granted powers under other sections of the Bill and I am not sure that the necessary supports are in place to enable them to carry out their duties.  For example, the existing authorities, including the Garda Síochána, had powers to undertake certain work in particular areas in order to effectively carry out their duties.  It is unclear whether the inspectors appointed under section 10 will have the same powers and rights as a Garda sergeant with responsibility for weights and measures.  Perhaps we can discuss this in greater detail on Committee Stage, but the section granting powers to inspectors is very vague.  I am not convinced that the statutory legal framework is in place to enable inspectors to carry out the work done heretofore by Garda sergeants with responsibility for weights and measures under the old arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware of this problem because another section of the Bill contains a provision stating that persons who are aggrieved by a decision of an inspector can apply to a Justice of the District Court.  According to the legislation, a Justice of the District Court can levy certain obligations on inspectors if they feel that an inspector has done something which is not strictly in accordance with his or her powers or obligations.  This places inspectors in a very vulnerable situation.  I do not know where that provision originated or whether it was hived off from previous legislation.  Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify the position in his reply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> I hope the Minister of State adopts a constructive attitude to the points I am making.  He should not feel slighted by my comments.  I intend no reflection on the Minister of State.  However, in the interests of placing the best possible legislation on the Statute Book, which will last for ten to 20 years or until 2078 and beyond, it is advisable to consider this matter carefully before finalising our deliberations.  We will then avoid a situation where the Minister of State will be obliged to return to the House in a number of years to amend the legislation because it is deficient.</P>
    <P>Aside from problems with the powers granted to inspectors, there is also a possibility that conflict will arise between the chief executive of Forbairt, who has certain responsibilities, and the director.  A further complication exists because, under section 12 of the Bill, the director is given power to establish certain bodies.  Under section 21, however, Forbairt is also given power to designate bodies.  This view was also expressed by the Fine Gael spokesperson, perhaps not as forcefully, who also believes that there will be bodies all over the place if we follow through on these provisions. Perhaps there is a valid reason that Forbairt will be entitled to designate special bodies for specific reasons.  When one considers the special bodies powers granted to the director under section 12, however, this seems a recipe for disagreement and represents the kind of situation we should try to avoid when introducing legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The issue of the provision of facilities is not very clear.  By and large, the local authorities provide facilities for many of the activities carried out in respect of weights and measures.  They will continue to provide such facilities to the new service.  I presume that under the new arrangements the local authorities will be able to make charges against the service.  Will the Minister of State clarify what the relationship will be between the local authorities and the new service regarding the provision of facilities and accommodation for activities relating to weights and measures?  This has been a <Col N="671" /> sizeable burden on local authorities in the past.  Will that burden be passed on to the new service?  What practical arrangements will be put in place for the service to operate successfully?</P>
    <P>I am curious about the position of the director.  Most of the legislation debated in this House in recent years contains provisions relating to the appointment of directors and personnel.  The House recently debated the Refugee Bill, which provided for the appointment of an appeals commissioner and appeals personnel.  The Schedule to that Bill contained a clear definition of the role, responsibilities, duties and expertise of the commissioner.  The Bill before us contains no such provision.  Section 7 deals with this matter and states that there shall be a director and indicates the functions and duties of the director. However, it does not clearly define the qualifications of the director.  Will the director be an official seconded from a Department?  Will the position be advertised by the Local Appointments Commission?  Will the director have any special qualifications or expertise in this area?</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a director could be appointed who may have little or no knowledge of this area.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position in this regard.  The legislation does not contain a definition relating to the qualifications of the director or a requirement that his or her appointment must be approved by the Minister.  It also fails to indicate whether the director should have expertise or experience in this area, will be a civil servant within the meaning of the Civil Service legislation or will be an appointee of the Minister with no knowledge of the activities covered under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It will streamline and modernise the legislation in this area, which dates back to 1878.  However, a valuable opportunity is being lost to set down parameters for the appointment of a board and director to manage the new service, who would be free from influence <Col N="672" /> by Forbairt, Forfás or any other body.  There are no provisions for a clearly defined pension scheme and the appointment of a director with experience and knowledge in the area.  The Bill also lacks provision to remove the director from office.  The Schedules of several pieces of legislation recently passed by this House contained definitions regarding the qualifications required for the appointment of people to such important offices, how they would be appointed, who could remove them from those offices and whether they could be removed for reasons of ill health or bankruptcy.  No provisions are made in that regard in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I offer these comments in a spirit of assistance to the Minister of State, who has wide experience in and knowledge of the public service and is much respected.  I am baffled that he allowed this legislation to pass through his hands in its current form.  He should reconsider the Bill and ask his advisers to redraft it into a meaningful and manageable form so that we can place an effective piece of legislation on the Statute Book.  As drafted, the Bill seems to have been hammered together in piecemeal fashion by four or five Ministers during the past 12 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  My contribution will be brief.  I am a little less familiar with the Bill than Senator Daly, given his detailed contribution.  The Bill is welcome because it is time legislation was brought forward to update such areas. It is beyond belief that we are using methods more appropriate to Victorian England than to 20th century Ireland. Consumer confidence in packaging and so on is a measure of the success of the original legislation.  If something is marked 50 grammes, it is that weight. Measures marked on the products we buy are accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although consumer confidence is strong in this area, perhaps the Minister will need to reinforce it when the Bill is passed.  He should initiate a short publicity campaign to renew public confidence <Col N="673" /> in our weights and measures.  It is also important for our export trade that such confidence exists in the products we produce.  If a person has a complaint or if they believe they have been shortchanged, to whom can they complain? What redress will they have?  Will they be protected by consumer legislation, or is there anything in this Bill which would help them?</P>
    <P>My interest in the Bill arose because of a long discussion I had with a sergeant of weights and measures.  The concerns of sergeants of weights and measures are valid and should be addressed.  They must decide whether to remain in weights and measures or to return to the Garda Síochána, as most entered the force and then moved into weights and measures.  They did not join the Garda specifically to become sergeants of weights and measures.  Many are over 40 years of age and they must decide whether to remain in the job with which they are familiar or to remain with their chosen profession, that is, the Garda Síochána.  It is a choice which they are reluctant to make.  They would like the legislation to allow them to continue to work in weights and measure and to allow them remain in their chosen profession.</P>
    <P>Sergeants of weights and measure feel very strongly that they should retain the conditions of service they would enjoy as members of the Garda Síochána. They are not sure if they will be entitled to improvements in conditions of service for gardai, whether in relation to early retirement or allowing gardaí to work after the specified retirement age. They would like the conditions and services which would pertain to the gardai in five years time to be available to them.</P>
    <P>They are also afraid this area will be privatised &mdash; I know it will not happen under this Minister &mdash; that they will lose a new set of conditions and work practices and that their working environment would change.  Sergeants of weights and measures are essentially public servants and this change over to <Col N="674" /> being semi-State employees is causing them some angst.  It would be anathema to them if they were to become employees of a private agency.</P>
    <P>While sergeants of weights and measures are supported by legislation, from time to time they rely on the greater powers they have as members of the Garda Síochána.  The realisation among those they regularly inspect in Foynes and other such ports that they have greater powers often guarantees them more co-operation than would otherwise be the case.  They will probably be involved in the training of their replacements.  This aura of additional powers should be given to trainee inspectors, so that there is a continuation of public compliance with the legislation.  I hope the Minister will address the concerns I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was growing up the sergeant of weights and measures was a very important man in my town of Dingle.  His visits were looked forward to; we nearly had people on the main road to see if he was arriving.  He was considered the symbol of honesty and he had a marked impact on the life of the town.  He was responsible for getting rid of the meejum which was not an acceptable measure to the sergeant.  It was a popular measure in the west &mdash; a glass of porter which was half way between a half pint and a pint.  The decision that it was no longer a legal measure caused consternation along that part of the west coast.  For many years after, it was sometimes sold, but people had to haggle over the price.</P>
      <P>Recently, I was told that there is a pub in Castlebar which still sells meejums and that it is written over the door. I ask the Minister to go back to the west to tidy up that anachronism in Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, I explained to someone that as a young lad trying to learn weights and measures behind the counter of a public bar the worst thing <Col N="675" /> was to have a farmer hand back his glass because at that time people held the same glass all night with an inch of stout left in the bottom.  They would ask me to put a meejum into the glass and if one did not fill it up to the top, one was the worst in the world.</P>
      <P>In my mother's shop there was a leaden section in the corner of the scale which was stamped when the sergeant of weights and measures came every six months or so and checked that the scale was working properly.  This was the stamp of authority.  It inspired confidence. When people bought a quarter pound of sweets or a pound of bananas they knew they were getting the correct amount.</P>
      <P>I welcome the objectives of this Bill. It is important and progressive legislation. At a time when Europe is rapidly changing the units it uses to gauge weights and measures in every area from physics to normal items in daily life, it is important that this issue is put on a statutory basis.  It is useful consolidating legislation and the Minister and his officials are to be complimented for bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>I will not go through all aspects of the Bill as I only have problems with one section.  It is the nature of politics that the Opposition tends to be negative about legislation, but I welcome the Bill with the exception of section 8 which deals with the transfer of personnel.  I have difficulty with that section.  The personnel who currently work on weights and measures are members of the Garda Síochána.  They joined the Garda and in the course of their careers they were promoted to the rank of sergeant and placed in this area.  They are gardaí who work full-time in the weights and measures sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome and compliment the political thinking behind section 8 and its attempt to ensure that those who move to Forfás from the Garda have as much protection as can legally be offered in legislation.  The section has been comprehensively drafted, with one exception. It does not allow people an option <Col N="676" /> once they have made the move.  That is a problem.  These people have made a career in this area and they are now being faced with a stark choice.  They can leave the area and start again from scratch, notwithstanding their retention of rank.  Many of them are in the later stages of their career and this change will be difficult for them.</P>
    <P>There is another question which the Minister of State, more than any other Minister in this Government, will recognise and that is the management of change.  There is a golden rule in the management of change &mdash; one must step beyond the problem created for people in their nervousness of change by giving them a guarantee that they can retain their position for as long as possible so long as they do not object to or stand in the way of change and as long as they attempt to accommodate change.  For that reason the sergeants who are being transferred to Forfás under section 8 should be entitled to change their minds.  In the first place, they should be transferred there on secondment.</P>
    <P>I intend to put down an amendment on Committee Stage, which will also be in the names of Senator Norris and Senator Lee, to insert a new subsection in section 8.  Section 8 (1) states:</P>
    <P>With effect from the establishment day, Forfás shall accept into its employment every person who, immediately before that day, was&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a member of the staff of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, or</P>
    <P>(b)  a member of the staff of a local authority, or</P>
    <P>(c)  an inspector for the purposes of the Weights and Measures Acts, 1878 to 1961,</P>
    <P>The section also refers to members of the Garda Síochána.  The proposed new subsection will provide that persons being transferred from the Garda Síochána to Forfás shall be deemed to be on secondment for a period of three years <Col N="677" /> commencing on establishment day.  At the end of that period they can exercise their right to revert to the Garda or to continue where they are.  It also allows the process of natural wastage to take place because a number of people within the service who are approaching or are at retirement age will no doubt exercise that option.  In that way one can implement the change without causing difficulty.</P>
    <P>The amendment does more; it gives confidence to people to embrace this fundamental change in their conditions of work and service.  It gives them the option of saying, we will go for it and transfer to Forfás in the knowledge that if it does not work out we can revert after three years.  I doubt that people will go back but the amendment provides a safety net.</P>
    <P>I hope the amendment will be accepted.  It is very little to ask and does not affect the operation of the Bill.  It is purely a personnel matter but it is a matter of serious concern for the people involved.  The Minister of State will have dealt with similar matters as often as I have in our capacities outside politics. The question of enticing people into new situations means that we must always provide safety nets.  We must tell people they do not have to worry or look behind them but to look ahead and make the most of the new opportunity.</P>
    <P>When people are established in their careers and are in their late forties or fifties they tend to be worried about such a fundamental change in their career paths and they might feel it is a wrong decision.  I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment. Committee Stage is ordered for next Friday and on that day the Minister of State might accept that this is not an unreasonable proposal.  This practical proposal seeks to achieve what this Government believes to be so important, the preparation of people for change.  That preparation involves protecting people.  It means allaying their fears and worries and nothing worries people as much as a change in the fundamentals of their lives and jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> In welcoming the Bill and complimenting those who drafted it, I ask the Minister of State to accept that simple amendment.  It does not in any way interfere with the operation of the Bill but allows for the phased implementation of section 8.  It need not mean that the implementation will be phased. It may well be the case that secondment will not come to anything, in the sense that people will simply accept the change and either stay where they are or, on finishing their secondment, exercise their retirement options.  I will listen carefully to the Minister of State's response in the hope of hearing a commitment that these people will transfer for the initial three year period on secondment.  It does not require any other change in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept that the amendment is realistic and practical and that it will be a comfort and support for the people on whom we will depend to implement the changes in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure why the Bill is before the House but I presume it is the result of an EU directive.  I have never heard anybody in this country complain about enforcement of these matters by the sergeants of weights and measures or by inspectors working for Dublin Corporation.  Many people outside the Oireachtas would suggest that we should not bother changing something that has worked well.</P>
      <P>The only representation I have ever received in relation to this matter was from a person who was being charged with having one-quarter of an ounce less than they should in a certain bag.  The case came to court in Thomastown. Three inspectors from the Department were supposed to come but they were late and the case was thrown out of court.  However, they were still given their expenses.  This was the greatest waste of public money I ever came across.  I have had dealings with the inspectorate for many years.  I owned a coalyard and petrol pumps many years ago and they were often checked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> There was an authority about the sergeants of weights and measures which is not being provided for in this Bill.  One of the reasons there were no major problems in this area through the years was that a Garda sergeant supervised the procedure.  If there was a minor problem, he would tell the person to solve it or he would be in trouble.  A Civil Service authority will now do that job.  This will add another layer of bureaucracy and will cost much more then the present system.</P>
    <P>We purchase 90 per cent of our packaged goods through the main supermarkets, such as Superquinn, Quinnsworth and Dunnes Stores.  The inspectorate could go to their warehouses and check the weights of their goods.  The job could then be done much more efficiently than is envisaged under this Bill.  The Minister is setting up, through Forbairt, another unnecessary layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a reason behind introducing this Bill.  Has the public complained about the operation of the Garda in this regard?  Have consumer bodies suggested that the laws, though ancient, have not been properly operated by the sergeants of weights and measures and Dublin Corporation? From where is the impetus for this change coming?</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech started by putting a question mark in front of &ldquo;metrology&rdquo;.  A number of people, including myself, thought this Bill was about meteorology.  The Minister's speech explained this in great detail, defining it as the theory of measurements, etc.  I thank him for giving us this dissertation &mdash; the first four pages of his speech concentrated on it.  However, he should give us some credit.  The Minister for Justice said we were ignorant last week because we did not understand what she was doing with her legislation. We understand what the Minister is doing in this legislation but we wonder from where is the impetus for this change coming?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> I have been involved with the sergeants of weights and measures for many years.  They were a separate body within the Garda and were seen to be neutral to the trade but had the backing of the law.  However, the new organisation will be made up of civil servants.  There is a sense in this Bill that the existing service was not working and this might appear to denigrate the people who operated the system through the years.  Why change something that is working well? Is the Minister suggesting that they were not doing a good job?  From where is the impetus for change coming?</P>
    <P>The fact that the existing legal authority derives from 19th century legislation might be a reason to change the system.  However, why change if it is doing a good job?  The existing service has its origins in the last century.  If an organisational system in a person's home is working, you do not change it. A man does not leave his wife if she does not bath their baby on time; that is no reason to change the laws of marriage or communication between people.  If the existing service is doing a good job, why change it?  The current arrangement has worked well up to now; for example, the inspectorate could check the foods in the warehouses of the major supermarkets from where 90 per cent of our packaged foods are purchased.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed on section 8.  Seconding the Garda sergeants currently operating the system to the new body would be the best way to proceed.  Under their present organisational structure, most of these Garda sergeants must retire when they reach 57 years of age, although this may be extended to 60 years of age.  People working in Dublin Corporation do not have to retire until they reach 65 years of age.  We are amalgamating two groups who have different terms of employment, salary and pensions.  Most of the 20 odd sergeants will be retiring within the next three years, so why not second them to the new service to help get it off the ground?  They would still have the <Col N="681" /> legal backing from their association with the Garda.  There were no major problems in the past because the Garda rather than the Civil Service were running the system.  I am not criticising the Civil Service but some groups have more semblance of authority than others.  I ask the Minister to agree with these proposals on section 8 and to transfer these gardaí to the new body.</P>
    <P>The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors negotiated on behalf of its members in the weights and measures section.  However, it was suggested that the reason it accepted the package was that it thought the members in Dublin Corporation had done so.  I have been told the latter are still in negotiation on their transfer to the new body.</P>
    <P>With Senator O'Toole and Senator Haughey and others, I ask the Minister to examine section 8 again and to make this change.  It would be a minor change in one sense but its effect on the confidence of the people who operated the system for so long would be major.</P>
    <P>This legislation will have no impact on what happens in the country.  There is nobody standing outside Leinster House saying the Irish metrology system should be changed and complaining that the Garda or the Dublin Corporation inspectors are not doing their jobs. That is not an issue.  We are adding a new group of people and another layer of bureaucracy to something which is unnecessary and is EU driven.  If the Minister can tell me there has been one letter to the newspapers, one commentary on radio or one TD or Senator suggesting changing the metrology system in Ireland I would be satisfied.  If the Minister can give me one instance of interest in this legislation I will support it, except for section 8.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update and consolidate existing weights and measures and quantity control legislation.  It is also complies with EU regulations.  I am not too sure about the necessity for the Bill.  Some speakers mentioned their glasses of Guinness.  I often sample a glass or a pint of Guinness &mdash; in some parts of the country there are pints and in others half-litres. There is confusion regarding weights, especially with the transfer from the existing system to metric.  This Bill covers measurement as well as weights. It is important we have control of weights.  Inspectors and sergeants of weights and measures did a good job ensuring the proper weights in stores and checking weighing scales, measures, etc.  They ensured a stone of meal was properly measured; in other words a person got 14 lbs, not 13 lbs.</P>
      <P>Signposts in the south use both miles and kilometres, while across the Border they use miles.  What is the position regarding these regulations in Northern Ireland?  Will they have to change to kilometres, as is done all over Europe? I do not know whether that comes within the Minister's control.  It is something about which I wonder on the few occasions I travel across the Border.</P>

    <P>I recently inquired about grazing to let in a field adjacent to me.  I met the auctioneer who showed me the map and said there was 4.8 acres in the field, which looked like a big measurement.  I looked at the measurement on an Ordnance Survey map and to my surprise, it was about 4.5 acres.  When I called to the Teagasc office to fill in the area aid forms, I asked the official, whose map <Col N="683" /> was in hectares, to convert the hectares into acres.  He told me it was 4.8 or 4.9 acres, while on the Ordnance Survey map it was 4.5 or 4.6 acres.  This represents an increase of 2 per cent.  Does the whole acreage of Ireland increase by 2 per cent?</P>

Senator Kelly referred to section 8 and the concern of the people involved in weights and measures, especially the sergeants, about the transfers to Forfás.  They did a good job up to now and it is not fair to ask them to leave their jobs and take up private duty if they wish to continue working in weights and measures.  They are in favour of secondment from the Force.  In that way they will still have a job if they go back to the Force.

      <P>I welcome this legislation. It has been sought for a number of years, particularly by the Garda Síochána and local authorities.  Initially, this was not a job for the Garda because they were trained for other purposes.  At the foundation of the State they were slotted into the position they are in now. This legislation is coming through and new laws will have to be passed in both Houses to transfer powers to Forfás.  I agree with much of this.  Over the years the Garda have done a tremendous job in this area and no one can say different. It is also unfair that some gardaí are handling three or four counties.  A change is needed.  There are approximately 20 gardaí left in this operation. In another three or four years, the number of gardaí will be reduced to five. Senator Kiely said an amendment will be put down by the Independents.  It states that in relation to persons being transferred from the Garda Síochána to Forfás, they shall be deemed to be seconded for a period of three years, beginning on the establishment day. This will have to be looked at and supported and the Minister might examine it before Committee Stage.  It was mentioned in the other House and the Minister said it could not be done.  However, a precedent has been set by the Department of Marine and the Department of Defence.  People have been seconded from local authorities and from various Departments and the same can be done in this case.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation because change is needed.  We are now in the European Union and all weights and measures in Europe must be equal &mdash; the day of using a large boot to measure one foot is over.  Maps in the Land Registry now use measurements smaller than inches.  My party supports the legislation but we do not agree with parts of it and we will discuss them on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to consider the section concerning the gardaí and the amendment put down by the Independent Senators, which I support.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to what has been a reasonable debate.  Considerably more interest was shown here than was the case in the other House, I regret to say.  Senator Haughey, Senator Quinn and others acknowledged the need to modernise the legislation in this area because Acts dating back to the last century are not suitable for a technological age.  Numerous examples were given of why such modernisation is necessary, in terms of modern day commerce and to protect the needs and interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>I was puzzled by Senator Daly's contribution because I cannot see anything cumbersome, complex, convoluted or bureaucratic about the unitary system being put in place.  It makes sense to tackle what was the fragmented nature of this service in the past and construct a unitary, modern system with distinct lines of management and authority, to provide this essential service and that is all that is being done here.</P>
      <P>I do not dispute Senator Lanigan's point that there are no marches on the streets of Thomastown to seek the implementation of this legislation and I am prepared to take his word that this is the case.  However, that does not necessarily mean that the steps being taken are not needed or that there is any criticism of the operation and conduct of the service by the existing personnel. To my knowledge, there is no such criticism and no such inference can be drawn from the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions were asked. Senator Farrelly raised the matter of fees; I accepted an amendment in the other House on this subject which requires the fee structure to be approved by the Minister.  In existing law, fees are charged for type examination of new designs of measuring instruments.  The fee rates reflect the cost of testing carried out by the national metrology laboratory and are set by ministerial decision.  Forbairt carries out this function on a fee basis and <Col N="686" /> at the request of the Minister.  The fees are charged to manufacturers of measuring instruments or their representatives. A fear was expressed in the other House about the reasonableness of fees and I accepted an Opposition amendment to give the Minister that supervisory role.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked about the user <i>versus</i> the seller of instruments.  It is correct that existing law imposes the obligation to conform on the user.  I have dealt generally with Senator Daly's various points but in answer to a specific question he raised, the director will be responsible to the board of Forbairt and the manner of the director's appointment is normal practice in a case such as this.  One presumes that, if the board is to appoint a director, it will appoint someone who is considered competent to administer the service we are setting up.  If one wishes to appoint a secretary or manager to a hospital, one does not give the job to someone who is accustomed to running an abattoir but to a person who has skills particular to a hospital.  Similarly, the person being appointed as director of legal metrology will know something about the subject.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, Senator Lanigan criticised me for taking the time to explain what legal metrology is. However, Senator Quinn was gracious in thanking me for doing so.  I am in Senator Quinn's camp because I did not know what it meant either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan is a man of many talents and I take his word that he knew what was involved but I did not.  I assure Senators that they are a great deal more advanced than Members of the other House if they understand this area in the comprehensive sense indicated by Senator Lanigan. Any Deputies who raised questions on the Bill asked about the Title.  They thought it was about mining, weather forecasting or other less mentionable topics but they did not know about the science of measurement.  It was only for <Col N="687" /> that reason that I set out the explanation, putting it in the context of its importance in doing trade and in giving consumers confidence that what they get is what they have ordered.</P>
      <P>Neither is there anything complicated about the superannuation scheme.  Forfás is the employer and, therefore, will be responsible for superannuation arrangements.  There is nothing new or difficult about this because all staff of the development agencies are employees of Forfás.  Neither is there anything unusual about the powers conferred on inspectors by the Bill, which are in line with the range of powers conferred in cases such as this.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrelly and others asked if there was duplication here and if there was a necessity for this.  I think this is a prudent power which, far from duplicating, acknowledges that bodies like the ESB, An Bord Gáis, etc., have the responsibility for metrological assessment in their area &mdash; for example, the ESB has responsibility for metering electricity.  So long as the powers exist to supervise and monitor these bodies to ensure they are operating correctly, it is right that such special bodies have that power.  We could be accused of duplication if we provided that the legal metrology services we are establishing here were to take over functions which, in the past, have been performed competently and without complaint by these bodies.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Daly's question, local authorities will no longer be involved.  As I said, the director will be appointed by Forbairt with the approval of the Minister.  He will be responsible for the management of the service and the terms and conditions will be set out by the board &mdash; that is its job &mdash; with the concurrence of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly asked about consumer complaints; I presume she is referring to short weight or measure in goods.  The provisions in section 28 make it an offence to sell or offer for sale by weight <Col N="688" /> measure or number any product which is less than that purported to be sold. Any complaints arising will be investigated by the new service and prosecutions will be taken if appropriate. There may be a consumer dimension which is a separate matter as it comes within the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In so far as it relates to measurement, a complaint may be made and it will be investigated.</P>

      <P>No matter what colours the Minister is wearing, privatisation is not a likely prospect.  There is a public role involved; it is the task of the State to provide the infrastructure to ensure the consumer is not short-changed and that our trade is not put at risk as a result of any engagement in the practices to which Senator Rory Kiely referred in the part of the country familiar to Senator Kelly.

      <P>Senators raised a number of points on sections 8 and 9 and the <Col N="689" /> serving gardaí who have provided these services for a long time.  Senator Farrelly asked if it was necessary that gardaí should be doing this task.  There is general agreement that it is not necessary. Senator Lanigan referred to the authority conferred by the status of the Garda sergeant.  I do not dispute that but I regret that the status of the Garda sergeant is not what it was in the past.</P>
      <P>However, it is accepted generally that this task is capable of being civilianised and that the task of the Garda should be to engage in policing.  The Judge Conroy commission in 1970 recommended the civilianisation of this function.  It is accepted generally that the place of the Garda Síochána is in policing the State and protecting the citizens.  Therefore, the point of principle is not at issue.  The issue is whether gardaí who have been carrying out this function for their careers should be permitted to continue to do so while remaining as gardaí.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to matter one way or the other.  I accept the points made by Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan. I pursued the matter assiduously with the Department of Justice.  A fact not adverted to is that I do not have responsibility for the Garda Síochána &mdash; the Force is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  I do not have the detailed letter I received from her on this matter which I read into the record of the Dáil.  The Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, states in section 8 (1):</P>
      <P>The general direction and control of the amalgamated force shall, subject to regulations made under or continued in force by this Act, be vested in the Commissioner of the amalgamated force who shall be styled and known as the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that I am told there is no precedent whereby serving members of the Garda Síochána are not responsible to the commissioner.  The commissioner is not amenable to people who are employed in his service doing these jobs being directed by someone <Col N="690" /> else.  They are the lines of authority which must continue to exist.</P>

      <P>I do not challenge what Senator O'Toole said earlier about managing change.  The Garda Síochána conciliation and arbitration system agreed this last January after months of negotiations.  When I began to process the legislation the agreement was recorded.  It is only subsequently that the Garda sergeants affected have had second thoughts.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan asked if it was true that discussions were taking place with the other staffs.  It is true.  However, I went through the agreement with a fine tooth comb &mdash; Senator O'Toole acknowledged it &mdash; and there is nothing capable of being given expression in legislation that is not in the Bill in terms of protecting their pay and conditions.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan wondered if there might be beneficial changes in the future and that the people involved would not benefit.  That is not my intention and I do not know what can be done to reassure them on that point. Neither the State nor the gardaí can have it both ways.  They enjoy retirement at 57 years of age; it is proper that they should because they are the conditions on which they joined the Force and their superannuation is so arranged. If other staff retire at 65 years of age that is something that will sort itself out over the years, as Senator Dan Kiely said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, they rightly enjoy retirement at 57 years of age.  It would appear that, in terms of the agreement reached, if the retirement age was increased by inference it ought to apply to those concerned. Care has been taken to give <Col N="691" /> them the option to continue to do what they have always done.  The only change is that they cannot call themselves Garda sergeants any longer.  The argument put by the Department of Justice is that, for the reasons I explained earlier, they cannot be serving members of the Garda and be directed by a different service.</P>

      <P>Secondment was examined in great detail during those 12 or 18 months of talks.  The negotiators and the men concerned agreed, although they may not have understood everything their negotiators agreed.  The negotiators representing the gardaí concerned at the conciliation process teased through this in considerable detail, including in particular the question of secondment, and were convinced, as a result of the arguments put by the official side, that it was not a feasible option because of the Garda Acts applying to serving members of the Force. Various Senators have asked me to reflect on this before Committee Stage and I am prepared to do that because it does not matter in the common sense, practical performance of these functions. If it is a big factor for the men concerned, and it seems to be, the image Senator O'Toole contrived of the Garda sergeant arriving on his bike with his bicycle clips to inspect is long gone because I am impressed with the mileage these people have covered since this Bill came into the House, and it was not done on bicycles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House, or those who were here at 2 p.m., for allowing the short suspension.  My parliamentary party meeting went on until exactly 2 p.m. and the Acting Leader allowed a 15 minute break out of generosity, courtesy and humanity so that I could have a cup of tea before coming into the House.  The level of activity yesterday meant I went from 3 p.m. until midnight without so much as a cup of tea.  I apologise to Senator Dardis.  I understand his need to be here to discuss this serious issue but, now and again, we should look out for each other with a little humanity.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill forms a key part of the comprehensive range of anti-crime measures which the Government is taking and represents one of the strongest anti-crime pieces of legislation ever brought before this or the other House by any Government.  The Government believes that these measures, with the appropriate safeguards which have been included in the Bill, are a necessary and proportionate response to the grave threat posed to the community by the activities of drug traffickers whose lack of respect for the lives of individuals is only too apparent.  This Government is determined to do all in its power to thwart these evil people and their deadly trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures contained in the Bill will increase the powers of detention in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to provide for a maximum period of detention of up to seven days, with the intervention of the court after the first 48 hours has elapsed; it will allow for the detention of persons arrested for such an offence where it is suspected they have concealed drugs in their persons &mdash; so-called &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo;&mdash; in places of detention specified by the Minister; <Col N="695" /> allow Customs officers to be present at, and participate in, the questioning of suspects detained by the Garda in relation to drug trafficking offences; permit a court to draw inferences from the failure of an accused in a drug trafficking case to mention, during Garda questioning, some fact which he or she subsequently relies on in his or her defence which could reasonably have been expected to be mentioned; allow members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants in drug trafficking cases where the warrant is urgently required and permit members of the Garda, whether they are in uniform, to enter and inspect places where a public dancing licence is in force for the purposes of the prevention or detection of a drug trafficking offence.</P>
    <P>The nature of drug criminality has become all too apparent in recent times. Great efforts are made by those involved in it to frustrate measures to defeat it and I am convinced that to comprehensively tackle drug trafficking we must provide the legislative framework set out in the Bill which enables the Garda to take effective action. Because of the large profits to be made through this vile trade in drugs, those who engage in it are constantly evolving new ways to evade detection.  The international nature of the trade is also well documented.  Primarily for these reasons I consider it essential that the Garda be given the power to detain suspected drug traffickers for the purposes of enabling them to properly investigate suspected drug trafficking and reduce the possibility that suspected drug traffickers could frustrate those efforts.</P>
    <P>I have provided in section 2 for a power of detention of up to seven days in cases of suspected drug trafficking. This represents a significant change but, as I said, it is justified provided it also contains specific and substantial safeguards in terms of the procedures under which it will operate &mdash; and it does contain such safeguards.  To that end, the Bill provides that the detention permitted <Col N="696" /> under section 2 will effectively be kept under regular review by breaking up the seven days into five separate stages.  At the beginning of each of these stages the person authorising the detention is required to be satisfied that the detention is justified.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, the case that the courts here would be unlikely to hold as constitutionally sound a provision which purports to allow seven day detention unless appropriate safeguards are included.  Furthermore, there is a need to have regard to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  As a party to that convention we must keep under review the jurisprudence which emerges in relation to it.</P>
    <P>It is especially as a result of that jurisprudence that we have concluded an essential safeguard which must be included in the legislation is that a person detained under section 2 for lengthy periods must be brought before a court during his or her period of detention. There is a significant corpus of jurisprudence under the convention to the effect that failure to bring a person who is the subject of a lengthy period of detention before a judicial authority is contrary to the convention.  I stress that the advice I have received is that it would be contrary to the convention if we applied for an <i>ex parte</i> hearing when someone was detained for lengthy periods.</P>
    <P>The basis for this is found in Article 5 of the convention.  Article 5 (1) states: &ldquo;Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.&rdquo;  However, deprivation of liberty is justified, according to Article 5 (1) (c), in cases of &ldquo;the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so&rdquo;.  Article 5 (3) states that everyone so arrested or detained shall be brought promptly before a judge.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the relevant case law concerning Article 5, it would appear that an arrested person must be <Col N="697" /> physically brought before the court and must be given an opportunity to be heard.  The advice available to me is that to do so at the expiration of 48 hours after the arrest would not amount to a contravention of Article 5 (3).  At that time the prosecution authority would have to be in a position to establish to the satisfaction of a judge, in relation to a person held on suspicion of having committed an offence, that there was a reasonable suspicion of the person having committed the specified offence and that reasonable grounds existed for the continuance of that suspicion.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of Article 5 (3), in relation to Article 5 (1) (c), is to afford to individuals deprived of their liberty a special guarantee, namely a procedure of a judicial nature designed to ensure that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty and to ensure that any arrest or detention will be kept as short as possible.  Article 5 (3) implicitly stipulates that the detention must not exceed a reasonable time. The reasonableness of the grounds on which the detention is permitted becomes central to any consideration of whether Article 5 (3) is being observed.</P>
    <P>The European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights have defined the powers and qualities required of a judicial officer to comply with the provisions of Article 5.  These are that there should be complete independence when performing in the judicial capacity, that the detainee should be present at the hearing and have the right to make representations, that all the circumstances for and against release should be reviewed and that there should be the power to order immediate release where continued detention is no longer justified.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the European Convention and the jurisprudence which has built up in respect of Article 5, the approach which is being taken in the Bill is that a person arrested under section 2 must be brought before a judge after 48 hours.  Even though the investigation will remain under Garda control, the involvement of the court at <Col N="698" /> various stages of the investigation should satisfy the requirements of Article 5 in the context which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions in section 2 for the involvement of a judge after 48 hours, together with the requirement that the detained person be brought before the court, will be seen as conforming not only with our obligations under the European convention but also the constitutional imperatives which arise in this area.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 there will be an initial period of detention of up to six hours, which may be extended for a further period of up to 18 hours and subsequently for a further period of up to 24 hours on the direction of a chief superintendent, who must have, on each occasion that an extension is granted, reasonable grounds for believing that the further period of detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  Any periods of detention after this first 48 hours will involve the intervention of the courts so that a detained person must be brought before the court on the hearing of each application for his or her further detention and will be given the opportunity to make submissions or call evidence on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>The court, if satisfied that the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence, and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously, may extend the period of detention for up to a further 72 hours and for a final period of up to a further 48 hours.  The garda who makes the application, who must be of the rank of at least chief superintendent, must at the time of each application to court have reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>If the judge decides to issue a warrant for the further detention of a person he or she may at the same time order that the person be brought before the court again at any time or times during the specified period of detention.  If the <Col N="699" /> judge is not satisfied at that time that the detention is justified he or she shall order the immediate release of the person. This is just one of the safeguards which is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A further safeguard in section 2 requires the Garda to immediately release a person when there are no longer reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence, unless the person is to be charged and brought before a court as soon as may be in respect of such a charge.</P>
    <P>I believe that the involvement of the courts, taken together with the other safeguards contained in the Bill, should allay any fears that the detention provisions are excessive or open to abuse. The proposals represent a measured response to the unacceptable threat posed by these so-called drug barons.</P>
    <P>I have gone into detail on these safeguards because, even since the Bill was announced and we started to debate it, the debate has returned to a sense, by the same people in the media and elsewhere, that the Bill is going too far.  In saying this, they have not fully recognised the seriousness of the crimes we are attempting to tackle, nor have they recognised that, since it was available back in 1976-77, many safeguards have now been built into the rights of people who are being questioned in custody by the gardaí.  Fears are on the basis of what the regime was then, not the regime that exists now.</P>
    <P>I wish to make this clear to those who have come full circle from a position they held four or five days ago that somehow I am not taking cognisance of the dangers to our criminal law.  That is not the case.  This is a considered, studied Bill, one for which I was criticised for taking my time in preparing.  This is not a sudden reaction to a problem; it is a considered response and one which is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that those involved in the trade of illegal drugs are constantly evolving new ways to try to avoid detection, including the concealing <Col N="700" /> of drugs within one's body &mdash; the problem known as &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo;.  To provide for the detention of suspected stuffers or swallowers there is provision in the Bill for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice to prescribe a special detention facility where such persons may be detained.  Such a place would be especially equipped to deal with cases of bodily concealment.  I do not have to go into the details.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that section 2 represents a major change to our present law it is right that I go into detail.  It is important for everyone to appreciate and understand the reasons which are to do with the EU Convention on Human Rights.  I have rejected amendments in the other House, and I will have to do the same here if anybody puts them down in respect of this aspect.  I cannot allow and agree for an <i>ex parte</i> application to the courts for further detention because the appearance of the person being questioned in the court is not just for the sake of having him there; it gives the judge the opportunity to see the mental and perhaps physical state of the person at the same time as forming an opinion as to whether extra time is required for questioning.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends sections 2 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which deal, respectively, with the taking of bodily samples and the destruction of records and samples.  The effect of the section will be to allow for the taking of bodily samples in the case of a person detained under the Bill.  These powers are essential for the full and proper investigation of alleged drug trafficking offences. Without them it is possible for somebody to refuse to give those samples, as they are being advised daily by solicitors and barristers to say and do nothing, including the giving of blood, to avoid the possibility of forensic science and testing linking them to any crime.  I have, therefore, built into the Bill the power to take bodily samples in the case of a person detained under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with rearrest.  It generally <Col N="701" /> prohibits the rearrest for the same suspected offence &mdash; or an offence which should have been reasonably suspected at the time &mdash; of a person previously detained under section 2 and who has been released without being charged.  Rearrest will only be permitted on the authority of a judge and only in cases where new information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release.  Furthermore, the judge when authorising a rearrest may also order that the person be brought before a court on arrest or at any other time for the purposes of satisfying himself or herself that the detention is justified.  If the judge is not satisfied that the detention is justified then the person will be released.</P>
    <P>Recognising the implications arising from seven day detentions, especially in the context of rearrest, section 4 provides for a very significant change in the procedures which follow detention on foot of a rearrest.  There is provision for the intervention of the court at an earlier stage than is the case under section 2.  Thus under section 4, the rearrested person may be detained initially for up to six hours, which can be extended by up to 18 hours on the authority of a chief superintendent, totalling 24 hours. Thereafter the detention period may be extended for periods up to 24 hours, 72 hours and 48 hours only on the authority of a judge, following procedures identical to those in section 2.  It is clear why we must build in these safeguards, lest an attempt be made to get somebody for a second period of seven days without the proper checks.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if a person is rearrested on the authority of a judge for an offence which is not a drug trafficking offence, then that person will be dealt with, not under the provisions of this Bill but under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Section 4 also makes it clear that where a person has been arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and is released without charge, that person cannot be <Col N="702" /> arrested again under section 2 of the Bill for the same offence or for an offence which he or she was, or ought reasonably to have been, suspected of having committed.</P>
    <P>Here again, the legislation contains appropriate safeguards.  However, the gardaí will not be prevented from rearresting a person without a warrant for the purposes of immediately charging that person with an offence.  If, after three or four days, they have enough evidence on a person but let him go, they can rearrest him provided they are about to make a charge in connection with him.</P>
    <P>Section 5 applies various provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to persons detained under section 2, so that, for example, when there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting a detained person of having committed any offence he or she must be released. It also covers such matters as the provision of medical attention, access to a solicitor and the destruction of records where a detained person is not prosecuted or where he or she is acquitted.</P>
    <P>Hand in hand with these extra powers which the Bill gives the gardaí is the need for close co-operation between the Garda and the Customs Service.  With this in mind it is proposed that increased powers be given to Customs officers in relation to questioning of persons detained on suspicion of importing drugs.  To this end section 6 of the Bill provides that regulations may be made for the attendance of, and participation by, an officer of Customs and Excise in the questioning of a person detained under section 2 of the Bill or under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, where the offence is one related to drug trafficking.  It also provides, importantly, that where officers of customs and excise are invited to participate in such questioning, they will be subject to the same conditions as apply to gardaí under the regulations made under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, for the treatment of detained persons.</P>
    <P>Section 7 was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil and arose out of a <Col N="703" /> commitment I made to look at the need to restrict the right to silence in drug trafficking cases.  Under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which he or she is suspected.  However, it would not be correct to say that there is an unqualified right to silence &mdash; this is something that has been repeatedly said by many media and other commentators.</P>
    <P>The general rule &mdash; which is in line with a general constitutional protection against self-incrimination &mdash; is subject to a number of statutory exceptions, and the most recent of these were included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters; marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information might be.</P>
    <P>While inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence, the Act specifically provides that they cannot alone form the basis of a conviction.  No Government has ever suggested that silence could be used as the only way in which a conviction can be brought about.  It has always been accompanied by the need to have other evidence to convict somebody.  I do not believe this State would ever see a time when somebody who remains silent would immediately be convicted because they are not giving an account of why they were somewhere.  This is not something I would consider.</P>
    <P>Section 7 represents a further modification of the right to silence.  The Government has concluded that if a person detained on a suspected drug trafficking charge fails or refuses to mention some fact that he subsequently relies on in his or her defence, he or she should run the risk that a court or jury <Col N="704" /> will draw an inference adverse to him or her.  The effect of this provision will be that the judge will be able to tell the jury that it may make an inference adverse to the accused from the late explanation if it would be appropriate to do so.  It is important to stress that an adverse inference is only possible if the accused remains silent during questioning and he or she then puts forward at trial, as part of his or her defence, some explanation that he or she could reasonably have been expected to have given to the Garda.</P>
    <P>As with the provisions in the 1984 Act there is no question of an accused being convicted on the basis of an inference alone.  The inference may be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence in relation to which the failure is material.  However, an accused shall not be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such failure.  Furthermore, an accused must be told in ordinary language when being questioned, charged or informed what the effect of such failure might be, that is, he must be cautioned about remaining silent.  The new section, therefore, represents a necessary and further curtailment of the right to silence and, in the Government's view, it is warranted by the nature of the problem it addresses.</P>
    <P>The fight against the drugs menace is not easy and it is essential that we, as legislators, give the Garda all the necessary powers to respond to existing realities. The nature of the menace often requires quick action by the Garda and this is why I am providing in section 8 for the amendment of section 26 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, to confer power on members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants in circumstances where particular urgency arises and where this is necessary for the investigation of a drug trafficking offence.  Since such warrants will issue in circumstances of particular urgency, they will cease to have effect after 24 hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> Section 9 will insert an additional section &mdash; section 13A &mdash; in the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, dealing with the right of access by gardaí to dance halls where a public dancing licence is in force for the purpose of preventing or detecting a drug trafficking offence.  The purpose of this section is to deal with a particular problem in the law as it relates to Garda powers of entry to premises where a public dance hall licence is in force.  At present, section 13 of the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, gives a power of entry to such venues to any member of the Garda Síochána in uniform in order to carry out any inspection, examination and inquiry as he or she thinks proper.</P>
    <P>In the context of the investigation of drug related offences, the requirement that the gardaí must be in uniform is unhelpful to efforts to obtain evidence of drug dealing in dance halls.  The phrase &ldquo;dance hall&rdquo; used in the Act refers to clubs, discos and other modern terms used to describe such venues.  The proposed amendment, the addition of a new section 13A in the Public Dance Halls Act, will give the power of entry to gardaí regardless of whether they are in uniform &mdash; they can enter in plain clothes &mdash; for the purpose of investigating drug trafficking offences.  Given that the penalty for obstruction or attempted obstruction of a garda acting under powers conferred by section 13 is only £5, there is provision for a penalty of up to £1,000 on conviction for obstructing or attempting to obstruct a garda acting under the new section.</P>
    <P>Some confusion arose in the other House when I mentioned that aspect. One Deputy thought it was the only offence of which somebody might be convicted under the new section. However, it relates to offences such a bouncer stopping a member of the Garda Síochána in plain clothes whom they recognise entering the premises. Once gardaí get inside, other offences come into play, such as allowing premises to be used for a particular purpose or regarding people who are peddling <Col N="706" /> drugs on the premises.  The section relates to a member of the public or staff of the dance hall who tries to stop somebody whom they know is a member of the Garda entering the premises.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is an important section in that it limits the period of operation of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to 12 months from the date of commencement unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that a section or sections shall continue to operate. The section also provides that the Minister for Justice will prepare a report on the operation of the sections and have it laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will give the House an opportunity to debate the effectiveness of the sections prior to agreeing to their renewal.</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone appreciates why it is necessary to give the powers proposed in the Bill to those charged with the investigation and detection of crime.  We must do everything in our power to isolate and remove the malignancy which those who trade in illegal drugs bring to our society.  I accept the powers contained in the Bill are, by any standards, harsh and draconian.  However, I hope it will be understood that they are necessary and that any fears that they might be abused in any way will be allayed by the emphasis put on providing safeguards, such as those in relation to extending periods of detention, against such abuse.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  It was passed by the other House and I hope the Seanad will also approve it.  All Oireachtas Members should examine the package announced yesterday and consider the many measures of a structural nature which the Government has put in place since it took office.  The criminal justice system was neglected by successive Governments in that it was allowed to become overloaded and necessary changes were not made.  I reject criticisms which might arise in the House or elsewhere that this is the only Government response to crime.  The Government has made successive responses since taking office and it will <Col N="707" /> continue to do so.  Measures will be considered and carefully drafted.  They will not be knee jerk reactions and they will take into account the varying views of members of the Government and Opposition.</P>
    <P>The package announced by the Government yesterday and its programme over the last 18 months will yield the desired results.  It includes an examination of the Garda Síochána, how the Force does its business and how it must be modernised to ensure it is effective against present day crime. These issues require the co-operation of Members of the Oireachtas, the public and members of the Garda Síochána, many of whom are expressing frustration. The public is also expressing frustration about the Garda.  If these issues are not openly discussed they will fester and cause problems in the system.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be in the House again; I have almost earned honorary membership at this stage because I have been here so often recently.  I thank Senators for what I hope will be a constructive and supportive debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I am sure there are many other pressing demands on her time.  It will be a thorough and constructive debate and I assure her there will be no time wasting or waffling.  She will agree a national consensus is emerging regarding the need for legislation to assist the officers of law enforcement, including gardaí and Customs and Excise personnel, in dealing with drug trafficking.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said in the other House, this side will support the legislation and be positive. This side welcomes the Bill, but I enter a caveat regarding two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, it is harsh legislation and I hope it will not be on the Statute Book forever.  We all want a country which does not have the scourge of drug traffickers.  Nobody wants a country where people in the inner cities and rural areas are <Col N="708" /> destroyed by those who peddle drugs. We all want a country where we can live free of the fear which the atrocious behaviour of recent weeks has engendered. I make that point cautiously.</P>
    <P>I will not dwell on one negative aspect because I want to be as positive as possible, but this side is disappointed about the length of time it took to introduce the Bill.  The Government took office in early 1995 and I understand the Minister presented the Bill on 6 February 1996.  It is now July 1996 so, effectively it took 18 months for the legislation to reach the House.  However, I will not dwell on that point because we have a Bill now and we will try to get as good a Bill as we can through this House.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the Minister's comments.  It is absolutely essential in the investigation of drug trafficking that the Garda Síochána has the power and ability to cross-examine suspected drug traffickers for a period of up to seven days in a legal way subject to the Garda custody regulations, which are a very important framework for all Garda investigations.  As envisaged by this Bill, this is a power that will have to be subject to judicial control and discretion for the last five days of its use.  Deputy John O'Donoghue, who has done a tremendous job in the other House, questioned the problems that will be encountered by members of the Garda Síochána when they come before the courts for that extra period of five days.  There may be a worry that the Garda will be revealing their hand and that they may be obstructed in achieving the very end that this Bill seeks.  I will not say a lot about that.  However, I ask the Minister, in the present positive spirit, that when this Bill comes to Committee Stage this will be very closely examined.</P>
    <P>I take the Minster's point about the European Convention on Human Rights.  The European Convention on Human Rights is very important, but drug traffickers and the murderers of Detective Garda Gerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin are not concerned by it.  No instrument, even an international <Col N="709" /> one, is sacrosanct because if the European Convention on Human Rights was to be used by drug traffickers as a shield against the questioning of the Garda then it should be examined.  That would have to be by international renegotiation and I agree with the Minister that there is no question of any part of this Bill being in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Everything put into law here must conform to our solemn international obligations, which I consistently argued when we discussed the Refugee Bill: that the primary source of international law on that issue was the Geneva Convention of 1951.  Again, I do not advocate any unilateral change or abrogation in relation to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is said that the first shall be last and the last shall be first.  In many ways one of the most important sections of the Bill is section 11.  It creates a safety mechanism, a review mechanism so that the Oireachtas can review the operation of this Bill on a 12 monthly basis.  That is terribly important.  One thing we do not want and that I will never espouse is the do-gooder or liberal argument in criminal justice.  We have had too much of that and the balance must be redressed a little the other way, but nobody wants to see our entire criminal justice system overturned or negated by a small group of dedicated drug traffickers and professional organised criminals.  We want a criminal justice system that respects human rights, maintains the right to silence and the burden of proof.  But there are extraordinary circumstances and occasions, and the state of crime today in Ireland is such an extraordinary occasion, when sometimes society must move to protect itself.  Society, through this Bill, is moving in one small but vitally important area to protect itself. Because of that, the Fianna Fáil Party will support this Bill.  The 12 monthly review is absolutely important.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome and essential but it is by no means the entire solution.  It <Col N="710" /> Bill gives very specific and necessary powers and because of that we will support it.  Over a whole range of areas there will have to be legislative reforms and new proposals.  In this regard I thank the Minister and the Government for the positive way they have accepted the spirit of the Fianna Fáil Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill, 1996.  I echo the words of our party leader when he said to the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week, &ldquo;either, Taoiseach, it is your Bill or it is our Bill, but let us have a Bill.&rdquo;  That is the spirit that the nation will compel us to act in. The people who laid wreaths outside the gates of Leinster House would not thank anybody in this Chamber for making any political points on the drug situation and organised crime in Dublin and the rest of the country.  That is why we are prepared to accept this Bill in as positive a way as we can.</P>
    <P>Besides section 2 and the powers of detention, I absolutely agree with the spirit of section 3, which relates to bodily samples.  I agree with the inferences from the failure of the accused to mention particular facts &mdash; the partial abolition of the right to silence.  As the Minister has said, it only relates to the issue of corroboration.  It cannot be used on its own to secure a conviction.  As I understand the Bill, once a person is charged, the right to silence will remain in force.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that on Second Stage but I understand that once a person is charged, the right to silence will remain as heretofore. Subject to that, abolishing the right to silence in this limited way is absolutely correct because the public cannot understand why a person who is accused of drug trafficking cannot say in simple language, &ldquo;I am not involved in this activity.  I earn my living like a normal person and here is the way I earn my living.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here is what I was doing last night.&rdquo;  As has been said in other jurisdictions, it is only people with things to fear who fear the abolition of the right to silence.</P>
    <P>Of course, the right to silence does not exist in other areas.  If the Revenue <Col N="711" /> Commissioners decide to audit the Minister or me, we have no right to silence. I cannot tell the Revenue Commissioners I do not particularly want to speak to them.  I have to explain every single penny I earn.  When we have the special debate &mdash; and I hope that this House will also participate in it &mdash; on July 26, people will want to know how and why people who have large assets, which they can barely explain, have not been forced to explain exactly how those assets arose.  The real challenge for the Minister and the Government will be to create legal mechanisms and statutory agencies which will put these people under the microscope and which will go after them in a positive and proactive way.</P>
    <P>For too long now we have had the feeling that these people's assets are only examined when they come to the attention of the authorities.  That must now change.  The authorities must turn the searchlight on these people and ask them to explain themselves.  The people do not want to read in the newspapers about how criminals with nicknames are swanning around and that nobody is investigating their affairs.  The Minister now knows, if she did not already know it, that the people will not tolerate it any longer.  The people want more than legislation.  The people want action, results and convictions, because we all know that these drug traffickers are out there.  Many of them are not behind bars and the people want them behind bars. As long as this is the case, people will be unhappy with us as legislators and frustrated by those involved in law enforcement.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, put section 6 of the Bill under the spotlight in the other House.  There seems to be a problem regarding who is the first to question suspected drug traffickers. In many cases a member of the Customs service is the first person to interview or examine these people.  As I understand this legislation, there is no provision for a Customs officer to engage in a rigorous <Col N="712" /> cross questioning of suspected drug traffickers without the presence of a garda.  If that is the case, should it remain so, or should customs officers have a more proactive role and greater statutory powers?</P>
    <P>I did not expect provision for a drugs enforcement agency in this Bill but provision could have been made for it and not to do so is an omission.</P>

      <P>I called for a national drugs enforcement agency last year and the Minister said that it was not appropriate. Deputy O'Donoghue has also called for a national drugs enforcement agency.  It may well be correct to say that provision of such an agency was not party policy but, as in the Minister's case, policies can evolve and circumstances can change.  I ask the Minister to seriously think about the need for a national drugs enforcement agency which would have powers similar to those available to the police enforcement authorities in the United States.</P>
      <P>The United States has very well developed laws against drugs and organised crime.  Even if the Minister does not support the creation of a national drugs enforcement agency &mdash; I will make a prediction here today that her policy on a national drugs enforcement agency may well change before the term of this Government expires &mdash; I ask her to instruct her officials to undertake a close examination of the racketeering laws in the United States if they have not already done so.  To my knowledge they are the most complex, highly developed laws to combat organised crime to be found anywhere.  I have said on several occasions that where good, constructive, hard hitting legislation in relation to crime and drug trafficking is brought before this House, it will receive a warm welcome.  Fianna Fáil has to some extent been leading the debate in the other House on the crime issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill.  Such a Bill has often been requested in this House.  No subject has been discussed as often in the past three or four years as the concern of this House for the developing drugs situation.  This situation did not develop overnight but worsened steadily over a number of years until it reached its present totally unacceptable level.  The situation has been unacceptable for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of the misuse of drugs and the outflow from it is a great threat to society.  It has created a Mafia type criminal element here which we thought <Col N="714" /> would never occur in Ireland.  When we spoke about the Mafia or the days of Al Capone in Chicago, we did not think that we would see such a situation developing in Ireland.  Misuse of drugs and the money that is to be made by it has created this situation which must be resolved.  This Bill is one instrument which will and should be effectively used to handle the situation.  Misuse of drugs is destroying the lives and the quality of life of too many of our young people.</P>
    <P>While the problem is more pronounced in urban areas, the growth of Ecstasy has meant that it is now a country wide problem and must be seen and tackled as such.  It is causing an increase in robberies and muggings because addicts require money to feed their habit.  There has been a growth in the level of violence which accompanies the type of crimes committed years ago when there was no question of attacks on the person.  Life has become very cheap.  The approach by criminals towards the person has changed dramatically in the past ten years. People who use the proceeds of crime to feed their drug habits have no regard whatsoever for the life or bodily integrity of others.  We can only hope to effectively control the drug problem because it has become internationalised. If we can do so, I believe the level of crime will be dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>Much of the crime that occurs in cities, such as attacks on the person, burglaries and incidents of handbag snatching, is drug related.  This is a major problem with many offshoots, and it is having a dramatic effect on our prison population.  Many prisoners are incarcerated because they committed offences to feed their habits.  Unfortunately, many of those who deal in drugs are not caught and the people who use drugs and commit crime to feed their habits are often the ones who end up in prison.  Drug peddlers and drug barons &mdash; I prefer to call them drug criminals or master criminals &mdash; get away scot free because they cannot be apprehended. This Bill is designed to deal with such <Col N="715" /> individuals and ensure that the Garda Síochána is given increased powers to bring them to justice.  It is also designed to change the judicial system which is not effective in its current form.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Mulcahy's statement that we must be concerned about human rights and ensure that we honour the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, we must be concerned about everyone's human rights.  The most important of these is the right to life, which is under serious attack from the very problem the Bill seeks to address.  Recent events have highlighted the basic right to life.  We must ensure that we discuss all life and we must not be ambivalent towards any type of crime in our society.  Those responsible for the murder of Detective Garda McCabe are just as guilty and accountable as the individuals who killed Veronica Guerin.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to describe the assassinations of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin as an attack on democracy.  These acts represent a fundamental attack on the basis of our democracy &mdash; the gardaí who protect us and the members of the journalistic profession who are key functionaries in ensuring that democracy survives and works.  There was widespread shock following these two dreadful deeds.  Many people believe that the rule of the gun has taken over in certain areas and in certain subsections of the population.  A dozen assassinations have taken place during the past 18 months and the victims, for the most part, were involved in the criminal underworld.</P>
    <P>The killing of a person, regardless of their identity or the business in which they are involved, must never be accepted.  The law of the land and the criminal justice system must be in a position to ensure that society is protected. Acts of vigilantism and battles between rival drug gangs are as much of a threat to society as any murder or assassination because they demean life itself.  The prosecution service recognises <Col N="716" /> that it is almost impossible to bring the drug master criminals to justice under existing legislation and procedures. We fervently wish that those who murdered Detective Garda McCabe and Veronica Guerin will be made accountable for their crimes, however strongly the odds are stacked against such an eventuality.  The measures introduced in the Bill will play an important part &mdash; but only a part &mdash; in ensuring that the gardaí are better equipped to attack the problem of drug trafficking in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It contains a number of measures to tackle the current situation. I also welcome the fact that there will be a strengthening of the powers relating to detention of persons suspected of a drug trafficking offence.  The Bill provides for a maximum detention of up to seven days, with the intervention of the court when the first 48 hours have elapsed.  The Minister comprehensively outlined the safeguards inherent in the Bill which are designed to ensure that people's civil and human rights are protected while in custody.  I am convinced that these safeguards will overcome the concerns expressed about the human rights aspect of this legislation. People who speak about human rights must remember the individuals who died in the past 12 months at the hands of those that the Bill is designed to tackle.</P>
    <P>Everyone is concerned about human rights.  However, it is also a point of concern that it is necessary to introduce harsh laws to ensure the very existence of our society.  I welcome the fact that the Bill allows for the detention of persons arrested for drug trafficking offences, where it is suspected that they have concealed drugs on their persons, in a place of detention specified by the Minister.  It is important that the Bill permits customs officers to be present at and participate in the questioning of suspects detained by the Garda Síochána in relation to drug offences.  On many occasions this House discussed Members' concerns about co-operation between the various bodies involved in <Col N="717" /> trying to control drug trafficking &mdash; the Garda Síochána, customs officers and the Revenue Commissioners.  I am glad that many of the difficulties which exist in this regard have been overcome and that the legislation builds on that co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the past, Members debated at length their views on the right to silence. Those debates occurred when it was unpopular to state that a court should be able to take inference, and only take inference, from a person's refusal to account for themselves or answer a reasonable question.  That situation does not affect the criminal.  If an ordinary person commits an offence and is arrested, they will answer any questions posed by the Garda.  However, a hardened criminal or drug master criminal will enter a Garda station for questioning and stare at the wall.  They are psychologically trained to ignore any questions and nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>As Senator Mulcahy stated, attention has been drawn to the fact that there is not an absolute right to silence in this country.  People are obliged to account to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of their business dealings and cannot refuse to provide a urine sample to the Garda Síochána if suspected of drunk driving.  They cannot use the right to silence.  An inference can be drawn from a refusal to co-operate with the Garda regarding a blood or urine test for drunk driving and the person involved can be convicted on that basis. There is not an absolute right in this regard and I am glad this is being extended to the area of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill allows members of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of superintendent, to issue search warrants in drug trafficking cases where a warrant is genuinely required.  I always thought it ridiculous that a garda could not enter a disco where it was suspected that drugs were being trafficked.  We are aware of the establishments in Limerick and Dublin where it is suspected that Ecstasy is being sold.  Under current legislation, a <Col N="718" /> garda must wear a uniform when entering such places.  I welcome the fact that members of the Garda Síochána, whether in uniform or not will be able to enter and to inspect places where a public dancing licence is in force for the purpose of the prevention or detection of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Drug criminals are apt and efficient at frustrating measures to bring them to justice.  We need a legislative framework to allow the Garda to tackle the problem. The power in the Bill to detain drug traffickers for seven days as well as the other provisions are a necessary response given the present situation. They provide the Garda with measures to deal with the drug problem.  Those involved in the drug trade are apt at devising ways to avoid detection.  The provision involving a judge in the extension of the period of detention beyond 48 hours and the fact that a court hearing must take place shows that we conform to our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will also ensure that constitutional difficulties do not arise.</P>
    <P>On several occasions we discussed the need to ensure co-operation between the Garda and the customs in the fight against illegal drug trading.  I am pleased the Bill provides for the presence of a customs officer when questioning takes place.  We know too well that drugs are a terrible menace to society.  It is essential that the Garda have the powers to deal effectively with the situation.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the escalating crime problem, we must ensure we address the long-term effects of crime. We should not rely exclusively on law and order responses.  This Bill is not the solution.  The demand for drugs must be tackled with education and treatment. Not only does the Minister for Justice have a strong role to play, so too does the Minister for Health, who has initiated measures to assist addicts to come off their habit.  We should educate people at an early age about the damage which drugs cause, how they can destroy their quality of life and how difficult it is to adjust when they come off them at <Col N="719" /> the age of 30 or 35, if they are still alive &mdash; and many people do wish to come off drugs.</P>
    <P>Children of tender years in the community will, because of today's neglect, become tomorrow's criminals.  As a society, we must find ways to help them before they, like many thousands before them, turn their anger on their fellow citizens.  It will be too late when the law and order system intervenes.  We all have a responsibility for the type of society we have built.  We must look at the elements in that society which cause crime to see what we can do.</P>
    <P>We must take the necessary action to address the elements which lead to the type of crime we are witnessing today. That means starting well before today's child becomes tomorrow's threat to society.  It includes voluntary as well as official help and intervention.  The law and order system, however efficient, cannot meet the challenge on its own. We must all endeavour to assist drug addicts with their problem, which is essential.  If we are to address any problems, we must first objectively and dispassionately look at the facts.</P>
    <P>There is a problem, but we must look at the statistics.  Some have said it is out of control, but I do not believe it is. However, the problem could go out of control, but today's measures will improve the situation.  There has been a specific problem in Dublin for some time which has not been as evident elsewhere. The heroin problem was particular to Dublin but it has moved to other cities.  However, areas outside Dublin have a problem with Ecstasy.  There is a hint of tolerance for Ecstasy and we must educate people to ensure it does not take hold.  Ecstasy is an extremely dangerous drug and its full effects are not known.  It can also lead to other drug taking.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals announced by the Minister yesterday evening to tackle the situation.  Her range of proposals include the appointment of extra gardaí, the use of civilians and a review of the efficiency and cost effectiveness <Col N="720" /> of the Garda.  She announced a number of other crime prevention measures, including an increase in the number of youth diversion projects, the strengthening of the juvenile liaison officer scheme and the development of prisons, which was being investigated but she now has money to build.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of months we have started to establish a proper criminal justice system, although much work needs to be done.  The criminal justice system has been neglected by many Governments over the past 17 years. We only need to look at the neglect of court buildings which reflect neglect not only of the building, but of the system. I am glad the Minister has looked at a proper court service and the introduction of the recommendations of the Denham Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have lived a sheltered life in which I had no experience of drugs until seven weeks ago when I got a telephone call from the late Veronica Guerin, whom I did not know.  I am not sure if she wished to consider changing from the role of journalism in which she had been involved in recent years but she telephoned me to say she and her editor had agreed that she should undertake a task, that is, to find somebody to whom she could be a shadow for a few weeks.  The objective was to see how somebody who wears a couple of hats organises their life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She chose me and she came into my life six weeks ago.  For three weeks she was my shadow.  Members may remember her sitting in the Visitor's Gallery six weeks ago, although some may not have recognised her.  I spent three weeks with a shadow.  She came with me when doing the various tasks I must do in the Seanad and in my own work.  I got to know Veronica Guerin well and I learned from her.  I learned about her strong commitment to what she had undertaken &mdash; what I would call her crusade against the dealers in death.  She was dedicated to doing what she could to eradicate from our lives the system we have spoken about today and, as <Col N="721" /> Senator Neville competently outlined, what drugs are doing to our society.  It was clear that her anger and frustration gave her the single minded determination to do something about it.  She undertook her crusade against the criminals, thugs and dealers in death with a sense of humour and fun.  It was clear she could handle both parts of her life.  She was committed to doing what needed to be done in the only way she could.  She was clearly frustrated at the lack of action by others and the Oireachtas holds a great deal of responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what we have not done in the area of criminal justice.  We have not been willing to tackle the problem in the same way we have tackled other problems.  Senator Neville spoke about the right to silence of somebody who is believed to have drunk too much and is behind the wheel of a car.  We passed laws in that area which we were not willing to pass in the criminal justice area.  When we got upset at the thought that somebody could deprive the State of tax revenue we gave the Revenue Commissioners the right to invade our homes.  Only last week we passed the Competition (Amendment) Bill.  In that Bill we as much as say that if a company is found guilty of an offence we will assume that the officers of that company are also guilty, but they may prove themselves innocent.</P>
    <P>We can pass laws when we feel strongly about unfair competition or drunk driving or tax revenue.  The Finance Act, 1992, gave the Revenue Commissioners strong powers.  We also gave the Customs authorities strong powers when we believed the State was being deprived of its correct income. However, we were not willing to give the same powers to those who were fighting crime.</P>
    <P>This Bill takes a step in that direction. The Bill that is to be introduced on 25 July will be a further step.  It is clear those steps are a reaction to the deaths of Detective McCabe and Veronica Guerin.  If that is the case, they will not have given their lives in vain.  I learned <Col N="722" /> about anger and frustration when I heard about the drug dealers, criminals, bullies and thugs from Veronica's reports.  Her death created the same anger and frustration in the rest of the nation.  The emotions the nation has felt since her death this day last week have galvanised us to do something about it. I welcome the fact that we have been galvanised into taking action.</P>
    <P>This is not a definitive Bill which marks the end of the road, but it is a step in that direction.  We are saying to the nation: &ldquo;We will not allow these people to change our way of life, we will demand something better and go back to the rule of law in steps that will enable us to maintain our democracy&rdquo;. In doing so we, who have been given the honour of legislating for this nation, will be able to say we responded to that honour by taking these steps, which we were unwilling to take in recent years. If that is so, Graham's wife and Cathal's mother will not have given her life in vain.  Six year old Cathal will look back in years to come and know that the mother he knew and loved was somebody who not only achieved a great deal in her lifetime but achieved even more with her death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It galls me to have to begin my contribution with the remarks made earlier by Senator Mulcahy but it is essential that they be addressed once and for all.  He constantly suggests that the Labour Party is not supportive of these and other measures to tackle crime in our society.  That is nothing short of nonsense and demonstrates appalling ignorance on the part of the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that when people seek the short-sighted approach of introducing new laws and increasing Garda numbers and claim that will solve the problem, the Labour Party historically looked at the broader issues and the causes of crime.  In dealing with the problem in a comprehensive rather than a superficial manner, it deserved to be applauded rather than criticised.  Far from being soft on crime we are most <Col N="723" /> supportive of these measures.  I believe our parliamentary party meetings have discussed the issue of crime and drug abuse on as many occasions as Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It galls me to have to listen to the Senator crackling like a broken record about the Labour Party when history shows that Fianna Fáil set up the State and was in power for the majority of years since the foundation of the State. To dare to pass the buck for what we are currently tackling in our society to those who are in Government is beyond comprehension.  The Senator's party and its Ministers for Justice presided over escalating crime for many years.  It is appallingly galling to have to listen to the Senator's comments.  I hope this will be the end of the matter because it is shortsighted and not helpful to deal with this as a party political issue.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party established a subcommittee on drugs which was chaired by Deputy Roisín Shortall, who received personal attacks for her strong action on the drugs issue.  The opening paragraph of its report, <i>The Drugs Menace and Organised Crime</i>, states:</P>
    <P>The drugs epidemic is a crisis facing Ireland.  It demands a crisis response. The rapid growth of organised crime in Ireland also demands that we be prepared to fight fire with fire, and to do it without undermining our democratic traditions.  Organised crime in Ireland is represented by a group of sociopathic, vicious and ruthless individuals. Fortunately, it is still a relatively small group that can be tackled effectively with the right set of measures and sufficient determination. The interaction between organised crime and drugs is a major threat.  We are not dealing with small time pushers or a small scale problem. The base from which we must start is that the corruption of young people through hard drugs is the key to a lucrative business for the people involved in that trade.  We know they are prepared to stop at nothing.  Our <Col N="724" /> response must be as determined, but it must also be measured and accountable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party policy on tackling the drugs problem in our society shows that we are dealing with it in a more comprehensive fashion than many parties have done in the past.  We can be justly proud of that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill; it is long overdue. We can cry all we like about giving extra powers to the Garda but it is time to specify them and to itemise what is and is not available at present.  The Labour/Fianna Fáil Government introduced powers under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.  I often wonder if it is being used.  In my experience as a solicitor I have only come across one charge relating to public order and that was in dubious circumstances. At times, it is shortsighted and superficial to say that we need new laws without using those we already have.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it was clearly a problem for the Garda.  While it knew the people involved in drug dealing, its hands were tied.  These people are not ordinary; they are hardened criminals who know the law better than many of us.  They are prepared to adopt an uncooperative approach upon arrest or charge with the Garda.  For that reason, I welcome the main provision in this Bill which allows for the detention of an individual for up to seven days, with the added precaution that this individual must be brought before a judge of the District or Circuit Court after 48 hours for the holding to be extended on a phased basis up to the maximum seven day detention.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy raised a genuine query with regard to the possibility of the Garda being forced to reveal its hand in making its case to the judge to extend the detention period.  How will that be handled?  On the other hand, I am concerned that the judge will assume the Garda is doing all in its power to put the evidence together and will inevitably and invariably extend the period. Therefore, when we examine this Bill in <Col N="725" /> a year's time, as it proposes, statistically the detention period will often be the maximum period.  Be that as it may, time is required to gather the evidence needed to deal with these people, as long as the right safeguards are in place. I have a query on the right to rearrest. I am not clear on the circumstances in which that might be used and its practicalities. It may lead to either 14 days or 21 days detention without charge.</P>
    <P>We have been quick to call for a reform of our bail laws; the Minster for Justice will be putting the matter before the people in November.  However, the basic tenet of our law is that an individual is innocent until proven guilty and one's right to liberty is valued and protected under our Constitution.  It is on that basis that we must balance the need to tackle these criminals and gangsters with the right of ordinary individuals to go about their business.  We must be careful that the laws we introduce are balanced with some monitoring that will ensure these new powers and rights are not open to abuse.  Most people are in favour of granting extra powers. However, with power comes responsibility and the requirement that we balance what we do in our society.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions in the Bill are welcome. I especially welcome section 9.  I regularly attended the dance halls referred to in this legislation before I came to politics and I saw much of what I suspected to be drug taking and pushing there.  When gardaí entered the premises, not only were the bar shutters pulled down but anybody selling drugs rapidly cleared off into the crowd.  Now the obvious presence of two uniformed gardaí would not facilitate in detecting or catching anybody in the act.  The fact that this Bill allows the Garda to enter these premises in civilian clothing is crucial in detecting these people, and that is one of the aims of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 allows Customs and Excise officers to attend the interviews of those arrested of being suspected drug dealers.  It is one thing to provide for this in legislation, but how will it work? I would like a response from the Minister. <Col N="726" /> It is only recently that this Government succeeded in getting the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise to work together. A co-ordinated approach is obviously vital but co-operation to date has not been what it should.  I also welcome the provision allowing for the taking of bodily samples from a suspect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the detention provisions, on what grounds is access being provided for a solicitor and a medical attendant?  Is it under the normal code or are there restrictions in this Bill?  I ask the Minister to respond to that too.</P>
    <P>I also have a query about the provision which gives the superintendent the right to issue search warrants for a period of 24 hours.  Will that become the norm or only in certain circumstances? I know there were difficulties in issuing search warrants, but are we going to the other extreme?  We should balance everything and not respond with a knee jerk reaction.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I welcome the reviewing provision encompassed in section 11.  This allows Members of the Oireachtas to review the progress and action taken under this legislation in a year's time.  We need to have an ongoing monitoring procedure to see how the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners deal with these new powers, examine what more can be done and see how effectively we have tackled our escalating drugs and crime problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed many areas to our satisfaction.  Too many gardaí are doing clerical duties; I welcome the Minister's announcement last night to provide an additional 220 civilians to do this work.  We need to look at how we regulate the Garda.  It is not just a matter of providing additional numbers and asking them to get on with it.  We must look at their efficiency, will and ability to co-ordinate and do what needs to be done.  An overall monitoring body would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I also welcome what has been done in education.  There is a great demand in our society for drugs and until we tackle that, we will be dealing with the end <Col N="727" /> result rather than the source of the problem.  The Minister for Education has run a successful programme in secondary schools over the last two years and she said she may have to introduce it to primary schools; sad though that is, it is deemed necessary at this point.</P>
    <P>That is a long-term measure.  The medium-term measure is to deal with drug addicts, who commit 70 to 80 per cent of our crime and make up 60 per cent of the inmates of Mountjoy.  If we are to deal with them in a proper manner, we must see if we can provide community centres which would organise methadone and other treatments which would be required.  Until we address this problem we will be banging our heads against a brick wall.</P>
    <P>One issue which has not been mentioned is galling to me.  Many community workers are doing good work and, to a large extent, it was residents' associations who forced the Garda and other authorities to take certain action. However, many of the community organisers who advocate a vigilante approach, etc., are a front for the Provisionals. That must be recognised.  We should not simply throw money into the community if it may get into the wrong hands.  In my experience near the Border certain elements in the IRA who brought in drugs are the most vociferous in leading the action against drugs.  That callous, cold-hearted, double approach must be spoken about and tackled because it should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the role of local authorities.  Vast housing estates around the country suffer this problem, particularly in Dublin and other cities. Local authorities have the power to evict those guilty of drug dealing offences but that power is not used. Each local authority should be required to put in place a housing estate management scheme.  Where it is known that drug dealing is openly carried on in a housing estate, the local authority should not give drug pushers and dealers safe houses within those estates at taxpayers' expense.  We must also <Col N="728" /> consider imposing a barring order to remove a drug pusher from the family home and the estate.  That would be an effective measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of prison places.  We cannot continue to introduce laws which will lead to increased numbers being arrested and detained without providing more places.  I note there will be a new remand prison at Wheatfield, in response to what many people saw as an ongoing overcrowding problem in Mountjoy and a consequent mixture of convicted and remand prisoners.  The overall package is excellent but I would sound a note of caution.  When dealing with the result of crime and the supply of drugs, we must examine how we will tackle the demand for them in the long term.</P>

      <P>There is public outrage and the time is now overdue for an all party approach to tackle crime, especially drug-related crime.  We reached that point last night in the Dáil with the Government's acceptance of a Fianna Fáil Bill on drugs.  Perhaps a maturity is creeping into Irish political life, affecting politicians of both Houses, which did not exist before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and Fianna Fáil will support it but it will only be as strong as the resources given to the gardaí, not simply the powers they will receive.  I was amused to hear Senator Gallagher say the gardaí were not using the powers they already have, with specific reference to the Criminal Justice <Col N="730" /> (Public Order) Act.  If she had spoken to gardaí about that Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;she would know that there was nowhere to put youths who have been moved along under that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>If she spoke to them about serious drug offences she would know that if the powers were strong enough there would be no need to introduce this harsh legislation, as the Minister described it.  However, we all agree that it is needed.</P>
      <P>The powers in this legislation will only come into play after lengthy periods of surveillance and detection of drug trafficking and hard graft by the gardaí.  There is need for a specialised drug unit in every district.  The gardaí have been faced with many problems in this work.  It has been documented that they have been involved in lengthy surveillance and detection work, staking out known drug traffickers and barons for months on end only to be told that overtime was being cut back and they had to abandon the operation.  In some cases, gardaí continued this surveillance at their own expense and in their own time but we should not rely on their goodwill.</P>
      <P>If they are involved in surveillance work they need support and the necessary resources.  This harsh legislation will help them to secure convictions subsequently, but they will not be able to secure convictions until they have gathered the evidence necessary to bring the criminals to court.  I have had reports from gardaí about inadequate and faulty communications equipment &mdash; radios and walkie talkies which did not work when they were on the point of entering a premises.  Whatever about legal powers, the gardaí do not have communications resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> There is disharmony among the rank and file members of the Garda.  The problems which have resulted in there being two representative organisations have not yet been resolved.  There is a strong feeling among gardaí that their superiors are almost guaranteed promotion if they are within budget as distinct from delivering policing results. The Minister of Justice must indicate to the management in the Garda that times have changed.</P>
    <P>I am aware of instances when gardaí have been sent out with their notebooks and told to return from duty with a certain number of summonses.  That would pass for adequate Garda work as far as management was concerned.  The Minister must inform the senior management of the Garda that if it requires lengthy detection work to get at the real criminals, sending gardaí out to check car tax is no longer enough.  On behalf of the members of the Force I ask the Minister to inform the Garda management that being within budget will not guarantee promotion.  Unless inroads into serious crime can be made, there should be no guarantee of promotion.</P>
    <P>The increase in the powers of detention to a seven day period is welcome. Senator Neville discussed the nature of some of the criminals who will be held for up to 24 hours but will fix their eyes on a spot on the wall and say nothing. Is it hoped that during the seven day period, while investigations are taking place, these people will crack?  These people have been referred to as &ldquo;hard men&rdquo;, although, to be fair, some media commentators have described them as absolute cowards.  However, the media have given them ridiculous names, such as the &ldquo;Monk&rdquo;, and we should not use them.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of people who called to Veronica Guerin's house and shot her as a warning, who telephoned her and threatened to kidnap and abuse her son and who, finally, shot her dead while she was sitting defenceless in her car because they were afraid of what she might write about them.  Are they the <Col N="732" /> kind of people who would crack during seven days' detention?  Perhaps they are because they are the ultimate cowards. However, I have a suspicion they will demand the presence of their solicitors and will say nothing.  I welcome the provision and I hope it produces the desired results.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill will allow for the detention of persons arrested for drug trafficking offences where it is suspected they have concealed drugs in their persons &mdash; the so-called &ldquo;stuffers and swallowers&rdquo;.  This provision will be a boon to the Garda.  In some flats and houses fires are kept alight day and night so that drugs can be burned if the Garda arrive at the premises.  Hopefully, other elements of the legislation will address that problem.  Drugs are often imported in a body cavity and suspects may not be held long enough for nature to take its course.  Those who swallow drugs are difficult to deal with; it is matter of delicate detail.  This is a welcome provision.  Swallowing drugs has been a way of evading the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow for Customs officers to be present and to participate in the questioning of suspects detained by the Garda in relation to drugs trafficking offences.  The Oireachtas has been critical of the level of co-operation between the Customs service and the Garda and there have been numerous calls for a co-ordinated approach from the two agencies.  However, I am not aware of a call for Customs officers to be present at or to participate in the Garda questioning.  I do not understand the need for it because, if any evidence or statements are required they could be provided in writing.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the need for this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for this legislation because of the enormous profits to be made from the vile trade in drugs.  How have those who made huge profits over many years been able to get away with it?  There have been very few prosecutions, although I am aware the Revenue Commissioners have been threatened.  I was recently contacted by <Col N="733" /> a constituent who had returned from England and went to the labour exchange to sign on.  She did not wish to sign on for a long period because she was confident she would be able to find employment.  She returned from England because of the traumatic effects of the Canary Wharf bombing. One of the officials in the labour exchange asked her to show them how much money she had in her pocket and she produced £20.  Reference was made earlier to the right to silence.  This woman was asked to show how much money she had on her person.</P>
    <P>One of these gangland figures referred to in the newspapers lived in my constituency for many years in a local authority house and was unemployed. I have seen pictures of his mansion in Enfield, County Meath.  A neighbour of this man who had nine children did a window cleaning round to supplement his income.  His dole payment was stopped and he had to repay arrears.  The man who is quoted in the newspapers as saying he did not kill Veronica Guerin but who lives in a mansion near Enfield never received a call from the social welfare officials.  The Garda called on a number of occasions but were unsuccessful in securing a drugs conviction against him although they knew he was involved.  The people who make the large profits are easily identified, yet they seem to have been untouchable.  However, the ordinary people seem to be very amenable to the questions put to them in the labour exchanges.  They are the first to be tackled by the State.</P>
    <P>The extension of the period of detention may lead to space problems.  In my local Garda station in Blanchardstown they do not have room to swing a cat. They will not have room to hold anybody who is suspected of drug trafficking. Many people in the suburbs of Dublin could be arrested in the morning under the powers of this Bill, but there is a need to put resources into upgrading stations.  That is due to happen in Blanchardstown.  You will find a similar position in all Garda stations, <Col N="734" /> perhaps in rural stations even more than urban ones.  There may be a lack of space and that would present a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being careful.  While these are harsh measures, a person's rights are being protected and I know the reason for that.  I do not know if the general public want or are looking for the reassurance that somebody whom the Garda feel genuinely is guilty of drug trafficking offences need their rights upheld.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Mulcahy and Senator Gallagher.  Gardaí who have to go to court to have the period of detention extended to seven days may in fact show their hand slightly because they have to have reasonable suspicion of the person concerned committing an offence and that it is considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so. Those powers exist in regard to bail.  If it is felt that the person concerned may commit another offence or flee the country, the Garda can request that bail should not be granted.  In the majority of cases judges grant bail even if the Garda put those reasons forward for not granting bail.  I am concerned about how strong the legislation is and what kind of case the Garda need to make before a judge in order to get the period of detention extended to seven days.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights and the fact that she is ensuring that these new powers are not open to abuse. To date there have been few cases of the Garda Síochána abusing their powers. There was a case thrown out last week which suggested that was the case, but that was a rare case.  The Minister will agree that there is a perception among the public that the law is on the side of the criminal and the victims of crime are forgotten.  I do not know why the Minister has to &mdash; and I use the term advisedly &mdash; labour the point of protecting the rights of those who are taken into custody and having their period of detention extended.  We on this side of <Col N="735" /> the House will support the Minister if liberties people decide to get on a bandwagon and try to derail this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with bodily samples and the destruction of records and samples.  Perhaps that would cover drug traffickers who throw illegal substances into the fires in their homes. This State has more powers under Road Traffic Acts than it has in murder cases. Under a Fianna Fáil/Labour Act, we have the right to take urine and blood samples and to follow somebody into their home, if we suspect that they have been involved in cases such as drunk driving and hit and run.  We have fewer powers in dealing with someone who has committed murder and until this Bill the Garda had more restricted powers in dealing with drug trafficking.  I welcome that part of the Bill and regard it as a positive move.</P>
    <P>I am not totally with the Minister on section 4, which deals with rearrest.  Is the Minister trying to reassure us that somebody will not be released after seven days detention and brought back in on a whim?  I do not think that is likely to happen.  I would have faith in the Garda Síochána that it would do its job correctly.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not understand Garda and customs service participation in the questioning of a detained person, but I have laboured that point.</P>
    <P>I referred to the unqualified right to silence with regard to the extended period of detention.  The Minister has changed that slightly and it was mentioned by other speakers that nobody has an unqualified right to silence.  Has there been any case in the last five or six years where a judge has drawn an inference from somebody remaining silent? I am not completely <i>au fait</i> with the amendment in this legislation.  Say I am detained for seven days and say nothing but in court at a later stage I say the reason I am not guilty is because I was with Senator Gallagher attending a Labour Party launch of a document on drug abuse.  I do not know if removing the right to silence is a huge improvement <Col N="736" /> in the position.  People who do not break the law believe that if you are asked a question and do not respond to it, you have something to hide.  That is a common perception.  It may be right; it may be wrong.  That is how the ordinary public who do not break the law see the abuse of the right to silence.</P>
    <P>There is always the risk of somebody weak and vulnerable being entrapped, but these are not the kind of people who go to the Four Courts and smile or sneer through proceedings.  Gardaí are reasonably intelligent people.  They know the difference between somebody who will genuinely land themselves in trouble by saying something, as distinct from somebody whom they have had under surveillance or about whom they have reasonable suspicion of being involved in a crime.  The qualified right to silence does not alter it significantly. The kind of people we are hoping to lock up as a result of this legislation will not be stupid enough to come up with the kind of scenario I mentioned in relation to Senator Gallagher and myself.  There is a need to re-examine the right to silence, perhaps in the context of constitutional change or in relation to the bail laws as well.  That particular aspect of the legislation is weak.</P>
    <P>I know of a specific case in Dublin where plainclothes gardaí had been watching a particular premises, which has since been closed down.  On the night they gained entry to the premises with a warrant, one of the gardaí was obstructed by a bouncer on the door.  I do not know if it was a result of that raid, but the premises were later closed. The garda who was obstructed on the way in subsequently found himself, as they say in the force, &ldquo;writing&rdquo;.  There was a complaint lodged by the bouncer that the garda had used abusive language towards him as he tried to find out why they were seeking to gain access to the premises.  He made a complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. The garda was writing for months back and forth to explain why he had told this individual to get out of his way.  The <Col N="737" /> words he used were probably stronger than that, but he demanded that the person who was obstructing them should get out of the way.  It was simply a time wasting tactic.  The Minister referred to it.  That is what members of the Garda Síochána must face when trying to do their work in this city, so I welcome that change.  Praise and congratulations are due to the Minister for raising the fine from £5 to £1,000.  She has made it clear that that is not the end of it as there are other sanctions which would then be imposed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Health was in the House discussing the problems of drug abuse the emphasis was on drug treatment.  I, among others, said that we need to take the profit out of drugs and lock up the guilty.  This Bill goes some way towards doing that, and I hope the other points I made about giving resources to the Garda will also be matched.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister confirm that £20 million of the money for the Wheatfield Prison will form part of the 1998 Estimates? Perhaps it will not come on stream as fast as we thought.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and, indeed, on the overall problem facing society in city and country in so far as these drug gangsters are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that a demand exists for what they are selling and it provides for the continuation and intensification of their efforts.  When one reads in the newspaper yesterday that Dublin is carved up by the drug barons &mdash; they should not be called barons; I should call them gangsters &mdash; it is not any wonder that this is taking place.  The background to this is that both Houses of the Oireachtas passed provisions in the Finance Bill, 1993, to introduce a tax amnesty, about which I had serious doubts at the time.  It allowed these gangsters to declare some of their finances by paying a certain amount of tax to the State and, low and behold, <Col N="738" /> receive a tax certificate to that effect. How effective will the proposals for the seizing of assets be on the basis of the enactment of that legislation since some, if not all, of these gangsters availed of it?</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to a person who was living in a corporation house in her constituency who now happens to live close to my home.  He bought a house in poor condition on a small portion of land a few years ago and started to renovate it.  Then he disappeared for a year, presumably he was locked up at the time.  He has spent somewhere in the region of over £2 million on this property in the last two years by purchasing other property and doing it up.  I wonder whether such people will not be able to claim a clean sheet as a result of their receipt from the Revenue Commissioners in the tax amnesty.  I call on the Minister for Justice and the Government to ask for an explanation as to where such persons &mdash; I am sure this is only one of them &mdash; received funds for these developments.</P>
    <P>I was told the other night at a function about another particular gentlemen who has many bodyguards around the place.  He has a helicopter landing pad on top of his house so that he can get away in the event that somebody comes in search of him.  These are the type of people with whom we are dealing.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that when I inquired from some of the locals about the history of the gangster in Enfield, County Meath, I was told that while he was extremely dangerous and nobody was prepared to trust him, they felt his wife was ten times more dangerous than he.  Therefore, we are not just dealing with gentlemen in this particular game but with families who will spare no life, regardless of what life it is.  When one considers what this Italian gentleman was prepared to do to his own family only two weeks ago, it shows the type of people with whom we are dealing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been working on this matter for some time, even though the impression is afoot that nothing has been done in this area and no real effort <Col N="739" /> was being made.  Some speakers in this and the other House are of the opinion that this whole problem started on 14 December 1994, when it is true to say that the killings started in the last 18 months on the basis of many of these gangsters legitimising money through the amnesty and deciding they would take their share of this city in whatever way they could.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister's package proposes appointing an additional 200 civilians to deal with work in Garda stations across the country.  Does the House know how many Ministers for Justice promised to address that matter?  Former Ministers for Justice Deputy Ray Burke, former Deputy Pádraig Flynn and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn all promised that they would provide civilians to release a substantial number of gardaí from other duties but nothing was ever done about it.  I am delighted that the Minister has decided that this will happen.  They were talking about it for eight years but the proposal is before us today and it will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that extra gardaí will be appointed.  I would like to think, as I said last week, that the Garda Síochána, as the team representing the politicians and the Minister, will pull together and work as a team to get at the root of the real problem.  A previous <Col N="740" /> speaker mentioned the fact that there were two Garda representative organisations and said nothing had been done about them.  It is easy to throw the buck over to the Minister and ask her to solve the team's problem.  What is wrong with the head and the sub-heads of the team that there are so many problems within the organisation dividing it into such a state?  How successful can the team be if it is going in two, three and four different directions?  As I appealed to them last week, I appeal to them today: in the interest of the people they represent, the protection of the State and its people, it is only right and proper to ask them to bury the hatchet, to solve their problems and to let us take on the gangsters who are trying to take over the State in many areas.  In other words, while Rome is burning and many people do not seem to be doing their jobs, these people are being allowed to take over.</P>
    <P>I welcome the bringing together of members of the Garda, Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  At last there will be cooperation in this area.  Senator McGennis referred to the questions asked by social welfare officers of individuals who seem to be able to receive payments without a word being said; that is the case not only in her constituency but right across the country.  We all have encountered such cases, as I am sure the Minister has.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that for the first time in 26 years there will be a review of the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.  I had the opportunity while in New York last March to visit two people who are very involved in dealing with drug related crime in New York.  They informed me in no uncertain terms that they made little progress until they were given powers to seize the assets of these criminals. They also pointed out to me, as I informed the Minister, it was important that the Force itself was effective and efficient and for reviews to take place on a regular basis, in other words, the organisation should be reviewed and helped to deal with the demands of <Col N="741" /> what is happening today rather than what happened 26 years ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other proposed crime prevention measures, such as increasing the number of youth division projects, strengthening the juvenile liaison officer schemes, the establishment of crime councils and special Garda vehicles for surveillance.  It is true that the telecommunications network needs to be improved.  However, I would hate to think that anyone would point the finger and say this problem was the fault of the Minister of the day.  It is up to the management of the organisation which has almost 11,000 members to continue to look for funding to improve these areas if they are inadequate to deal with the menace of these gangsters.</P>
    <P>The proposed 400 extra prison places for remand prisoners, on top of the other 270 prison places which have already been approved this year, is a very welcome development.  There was a radical need to change the courts system and increase the number of judges if we are to be successful.  I welcome the fact the President of the High Court will ensure extra sittings take place so that cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am sure the referendum on reform of the bail laws will be passed by a huge majority.  That is to be welcomed and should take place as soon as possible. I was interested to hear the statement yesterday by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties which advised politicians not to rush into enacting legislation which might go over the top.  When people are prepared to go to war, it is only right and proper for those in authority to enact legislation which will ensure those implementing the law also have the powers to go to war.  I do not think we should be too worried about the protection of the civil liberties of those we are trying to take off the streets.  The civil liberties of Garda Jerry McCabe and Veronica Guerin were not considered by these gangsters.  There is a need to set aside the soft approach of some people to whom politicians have perhaps listened too much over the last ten <Col N="742" /> years and as a result of which we have a mounting problem.</P>
    <P>The overriding factor in this legislation and the fight against these gangsters is the effectiveness of seizing their assets.  I hope the Minister will take on board the fact that if those assets are seized forthwith and their owners have to prove to the State and the Revenue Commissioners that they built their mansions and bought their properties with legitimate money, within 12 months millions of pounds could come into the State's coffers from the sale of those assets.  That is the only positive way to hurt these gangsters who are hurting our children.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the total package of legislation which will be finalised on 26 July.  Mistakes have been made.  All parties have been in Government, some for much longer than others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister attended the House today to introduce Second Stage of this Bill.  All of us, especially those of us who are parents or who have contact with young people, are very aware of the increasing use of drugs and the dangers imposed by the drugs threat to the future safety and health of our children.</P>
      <P>Drug trafficking and drug dealing is a very complex issue.  There are no instant solutions, but there is a great sense of urgency that these issues be addressed. A number of weeks ago we discussed a health package proposed by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.  I said then that we needed to address this issue with a greater sense of urgency and the events of the past couple of weeks have reinforced this.</P>
      <P>The legislation before the House is radical and my party supports it.  The purpose is to deal with a unique problem in society today.  The Bill proposes seven days detention for questioning without charge by the gardaí, which is a major departure in terms of the powers of the gardaí to detain people.  I support the extra powers being granted.  The Minister was clear when she said that there has been much concern to balance of the rights of the individuals who may be detained under the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision whereby, after a person has been detained for 48 hours, a judicial process intervenes. <Col N="744" /> There must be an application to the court, the court must be satisfied that the gardaí are proceeding with the investigation and the judge must make a determination on the extension of detention for a further period.  This is important.  The legislation is balanced to ensure its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister rejected some of the amendments put down by my party in the other House, especially with regard to limiting the absolute right to silence.  However, I acknowledge that she accepted one of the amendments yesterday.  My party wishes to see the curtailment of the right to silence extended to other serious crimes such as murder.  We hope the Government will introduce proposals to extend these measures, and that the measures in this Bill will be introduced in respect of other crimes.  I propose to put down amendments on Committee Stage that were not accepted by the Government but which my party believes to be necessary, especially because of the crisis in society today.</P>
    <P>We also put down amendments in the other House to ensure certain safeguards and to introduce video recordings of interviewees.  This was proposed by us not just as a safeguard from a civil liberties point of view but also as a safeguard which would be of benefit to the Garda.  Many people taken into custody today will allege they have been abused while being questioned. It would be in everybody's interest &mdash; the gardaí, the public and the person detained &mdash; that there be an independent reference, such as a video recording.  It is regrettable that the Government voted down the list of safeguards proposed by my party in the other House.</P>
    <P>Drugs are a great menace to society. They have caused much damage and destroyed many lives and communities. The drugs menace is not merely a law and order issue.  It cannot be dealt with solely by the Minister for Justice.  There is a role to be played by the Department of Health and the Department of Education. Many of us have talked about <Col N="745" /> the concerns of the civil liberties lobby, but we have reached the stage where we need to talk about the civil liberties and rights of the victims of these drug barons, the so called &ldquo;untouchables&rdquo; and &ldquo;godfathers&rdquo; who appear to have garnered the resources through their dealings in crime and drugs to ensure that they can procure for themselves the very best legal, financial and every other kind of advice to ensure that they remain untouchable.  This is unacceptable.  None of us is too concerned about the civil liberties of these individuals because they are well able to ensure, through their ill-gotten gains, that they are well protected.</P>
    <P>The legislation is finely balanced.  It is important that the regulations governing the treatment of persons while in custody for such long periods are fully explained.  They must be clearly set out and understood by everybody, including the gardaí, the authorities and the person in custody.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's advice that section 5 covers such matters as the provision of medical attention and access to a solicitor.  This is important.  Many of the people detained under the legislation will probably be drug addicts or in the process of withdrawing from drugs.  A person suffering withdrawal symptoms is likely to confess to anything. It is important, therefore, that adequate facilities, including medical attention, be available.</P>
    <P>There should be independent verification, such as the video recording of interviewees.  In recent weeks there have been accusations against the Garda Síochána; the number of complaints has been increasing.  Many of those taken into custody file complaints as a matter of course.  This can cause great concern and stress to gardaí.  It would reassure them and the public if such verification was available.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision that the legislation will be subject to review after it has been in place for 12 months.  Many of those who talk about civil liberties on the radio and in the media refer to the heavy gang and the gardaí acting outside <Col N="746" /> their powers.  However, we know the gardaí and we know what they are doing.  If a tiny minority were to step beyond their powers, they would still be within our control but, unfortunately, the gangsters involved in crime have been able to remain outside the control of legislators, the courts and the system. They appear to have been allowed to freely pursue their lives of crime and the destruction of so many people.  In this Bill the Minister has finely balance the civil liberties of people, while at the same time extending the powers of the gardaí which they believe they need.  We will have an opportunity to review the legislation in 12 months when changes can be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed changes in section 9 to the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, which will enable gardaí who are not in uniform to enter premises.  Much of drug taking and distribution take place at dances, raves, etc.  Today the Minister said that such gardaí would be covered under the 1935 Act.  It is important that plain clothes detectives can enter these premises.  Under section 13 of the 1935 Act, the fine is only £5, and in this Bill provision is made for a penalty of up to £1,000 on conviction for obstructing or attempting to obstruct gardaí acting under the new section. However, a fine of £1,000 is very small, given that contract killings are carried out for £5,000.  They will try to obstruct the Garda entering the premises and delay them while the drugs being distributed are disposed of.  The sum of £1,000 is petty cash to these godfathers and perhaps it should be increased.  They have men on the doors of dance halls and they would pay a fine of £1,000 if they could dispose of the drugs on the premises.  The figure of £1,000 is a huge improvement on £5 but the drug barons have unlimited resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, dealt with the debate in other House yesterday.  In her reply she stated that the Progressive Democrats' response to this issue appeared to be just in terms of law and order.  However, I have raised this area with the Minister <Col N="747" /> for Justice on many occasions.  I also raised it with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea.  He heard me state many times that drugs are not just a law and order issue.  Huge problems exist for drug addicts in terms of treatment facilities.  I spoke at length on this aspect on 16 May when the Minister for Health introduced measures to tackle the drugs problem from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>As the Progressive Democrats spokesperson on health, I put down parliamentary questions in Deputy O'Donnell's name in the other House and on each of those occasions the treatment of drug addicts, including those in prison, was raised.  The Progressive Democrats priority question on the last occasion health questions were taken in the other House related to the measures contained in the package announced by the Minister the previous day.  The Progressive Democrats have been active on the health aspect of the problem and in terms of proposing measures for treating drug addicts in prison and trying to prevent people turning to drugs.  This involves empowering people in communities, but not just in deprived areas because everybody accepts the drugs problem is not a class issue.  All children, whether they live in Dublin or rural Ireland, are exposed to the drugs culture and we ignore this problem at our peril.  I accept the health issues do not come under the control of the Minister for Justice but I have raised them with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is responsible for Mountjoy Prison and I have constantly urged her to consider spending the £35,000 it costs to keep a prisoner in the jail on treatment programmes.  I have visited the women's prison and a large proportion of the young women in jail are drug addicts.  When they come out of jail they return to the crime which put them in Mountjoy in the first place to feed their habits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> There is no easy answer to this very difficult problem and I realise these young women, and men, are returning to a lifestyle and culture where drugs are freely available.  A huge number are unemployed and many of them leave school at an early age.  Many factors, such as low self-esteem, contribute to the complex issue, but I hope people do not think the Progressive Democrats only support tough law and order measures.  Many areas need to examine this issue and I acknowledge the Government is considering other ways of addressing the problem.  I would appreciate it if the Minister relayed to his Government colleagues that the Progressive Democrats are not just a one issue party.</P>
    <P>The main drug about which people are concerned is heroin but, in the main, it is only a problem in major cities. There is a major drug problem in rural Ireland; no town or village is unaffected by drugs.  All children are exposed to the drugs culture and the measures in the Bill, which will try to address the problem, will benefit to entire country. The greatest concern in rural areas is the increasing use of Ecstasy.  Many people believe this is only available at raves in cities, but many young people in towns throughout the country attend discos at weekends and they go to pubs. It is frightening that Ecstasy is so freely available.  In the last 12 months, a number of young people have died from taking Ecstasy tablets.</P>
    <P>It is important to discuss the drugs issue and how it is affecting young people.  Drugs are available in every town and village.  If we can get people to understand the extent of the problem, and the fact that it does not only affect children in a particular class in society, they will accept that measures are necessary to rid ourselves of this curse.  The measures introduced by the Minister are one of the ways she proposes to tackle the drugs problem and my party welcomes and supports the Bill.</P>
    <Col N="749" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this modest but important legislation.  It is a further legislative attempt to come to grips with our serious drugs problem.  I was irritated by Senator Farrelly's clumsy comments, but I wish to be constructive.  In common with other Fianna Fáil contributors, I support the legislation so far as it goes and we will endeavour to improve it.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of technical points to ensure Members are clear about the Bill.  Section 2 states that regulations will be put in place to give effect to the provisions of the section.  It would be useful to know what regulations the Minister has in mind.  Will they relate to the special places of detention for persons found with drugs in their possession or on their person? Are they a general set of regulations? How far will the regulations extend and when will they be available?  Despite the best wishes of the Houses in terms of putting through legislation, it sometimes takes a long time before the detail of the regulations are put in place.  I ask the Minister to clarify what the regulations will contain, how soon they will be available and to what extent will they cover the wider issues.  Perhaps they just apply to the section itself.</P>
      <P>I raise this point because section 11 states the legislation must be brought back to the Oireachtas within a year.  We may well find ourselves in a situation where the regulations may not be completed before it is time to annul these sections of the legislation.  I would like some indication from the Minister in his reply as to the necessity to put such a strict time limit on the duration of the special sections of the legislation which it is intended to repeal within a year.  We may well find that we have to repeal the legislation before the regulations have come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is welcome as far as it goes.  Its introduction was signalled about this time last year and a Government decision was taken to expedite it as part of the package announced at the time.  This was confirmed in the <Col N="750" /> explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.  There does not seem to be any sense of urgency in the Department of Justice about getting this legislation on the Statute Book as quickly as the situation warrants.  Everyone here knows about the very serious crisis in relation to misuse of drugs and crime facing the country at present; we have raised it on numerous occasions in this House.  Thousands of people are being exploited by those who have made it their sole profession to get involved in what is for a very limited number of people a very lucrative, if illegal, business. Any legislation the Government can introduce here will have our full support if it is designed to come to grips with the problem of this limited number of highly organised and sophisticated gangsters who are holding the streets to ransom.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record my appreciation of the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State at the Department of Health who recently sent a very useful document to all Members setting out the position in relation to the misuse of drugs from the point of view of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Currie and Deputy O'Shea.  It is a very useful document, but it acknowledges that the Department still does not know the extent of the heroin problem in Ireland. It is relying on statistics available in 1994 which gave a figure of about 3,000 heroin addicts.  How can we legitimately deal with a crisis if we are not familiar with the full extent of it?  The Department of Health or any other Department involved must first do whatever is necessary to identify precisely the nature and extent of the problem.  That is the first prerequisite when trying to deal with this problem, the side effects of which is the gangsterism stalking our streets at present.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind that those making money from this are selling drugs in the full view of our television service.  RTE showed a programme recently in which their cameras showed the sale of drugs in the public street in <Col N="751" /> the Dolphin's Barn area.  The Government and the Minister for Health by their own admission, according to this document which we received a few days ago, are still not aware of the full extent of the problem.  They are relying on research which is underway to identify precisely the size of the problem at present.  If the Government does not have the full facts, how can it deal with the problem effectively?</P>
    <P>The second fact apparent from this document is that the Government does not have sufficient methadone treatments and other services which would enable this problem to be dealt with, even for the limited numbers allowed for in the document.  It is vitally important that the Government in shaping and enforcing this legislation also puts in place the necessary finances and resources to enable the expansion of the treatment services and the development of a response to those who are suffering at present so as to avoid an escalation in the numbers addicted, leading to a greater crisis regardless of what legislation we pass to deal with it.  This is a very frightening thought; this is a very challenging time.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Minister for Justice, other Government Departments and those professionals who have to deal with this problem on a day to day basis, the present emergency needs to be tackled very seriously.  Only now, unfortunately, are we seeing the first indications that this awareness has sunk home in the Cabinet.  There is no doubt &mdash; I do not wish to get into party political point scoring &mdash; that the Minister for Justice outlined the seriousness of the situation and the desirability of dealing with the matter urgently to the Cabinet about a year ago, and put forward a number of proposals which were not fully endorsed by Cabinet at that time.</P>
    <P>We have seen the tragic assassination in the last few weeks of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in Limerick and that of Veronica Guerin only a week ago in Dublin.  As well as that we see <Col N="752" /> the list of assassinations and murders increasing almost by the day.  These are mainly drug related, but in my view illegal organisations are also involved. We saw this in the case of the late Jerry McCabe.</P>
    <P>Despite all the public discussion that has taken place, very little attention has been paid to the fact that the late Jerry McCabe, the late Veronica Guerin and 12 others were shot down with illegally held guns and ammunition.  Nothing in this Bill does anything to modernise our legislation in this regard.  The Garda Síochána is still working under legislation pertaining to the seizure of ammunition which goes back to around 1798.  The legislation is old and antiquated. People wonder how, with all the resources of the State, we can still find areas where illegally held guns, high calibre machine guns and revolvers are in use on a daily or weekly basis.</P>
    <P>It looks to many decent people that law and order is about to break down in this country.  If law and order breaks down, anarchy begins.  It would be tragic to allow a small number of people, whether involved in drug trafficking or in illegal organisations, to hold this country to ransom and to mete out their own form of justice to people who do not agree with them or who write stories which are adverse to the business they are involved in.  As legislators we have an obligation to the community to respond in a positive way.  We also have an obligation to back our comments with finance and to provide the necessary funds to the Minister for Justice or any other Minister who has a problem to deal with and who has to deal with it speedily and efficiently.  We cannot be intimidated or terrified by people who would like to put guns to our heads to stop us doing what has to be done in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I will make one other comment in relation to the Department of Justice, the parliamentary draftsman and those in Government.  It has taken a year from the announcement of the original Government decision to put this important legislation through the <Col N="753" /> Houses.  If that is the case, what can we expect by way of regulations and the provision of resources and additional personnel to deal with these matters? While there may appear to be urgency on the part of the Government to deal with this situation in light of recent tragic events, genuine and responsible people will begin to question whether we are serious about this issue unless there is positive action in the near future.  Members of the public will not differentiate between Members of the Labour Party, Democratic Left, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael in this regard.  As far as the public is concerned, this problem is a plague on all our houses.  We must adopt a responsible position and ensure that the necessary action is taken.  We must also ensure that any legislation required to tackle the menace with which we are faced is provided speedily, effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in this Bill, including those which permit customs officials to be present when questioning is taking place, are long overdue.  Three years ago, a very respectable business person in my area leased an expensive limousine worth £50,000 to £60,000 to a person he believed was a genuine customer. He discovered that the vehicle was used in the commission of a drug related offence.  The individual in question has been without the use of that asset for over three years.  Why does it take three years for a case to come to court involving a person who was apprehended while committing a very serious offence and had drugs in their possession? I welcome the today's decision to provide additional judges.</P>
    <P>It is essential that urgency is attached to dealing speedily with people who are apprehended with drugs in their possession. Such cases must be carried through as expeditiously as possible. However, it is not very expeditious if a person is apprehended, charged and released on bail and it takes three to five years for the case to come before the courts.  That is not an efficient or effective way to deal with these matters. Whether the procedures for dealing <Col N="754" /> with such cases are overly bureaucratic or there are delays in the presentation of books of evidence, an urgency must be attached to dealing speedily with these matters.</P>
    <P>I fully support the provisions in the legislation which deal with the issue of warrants, etc.  This represents a step in the right direction and will prove more effective.  However, some the provisions will make it more cumbersome than at present for members of the Garda Síochána to obtain warrants in respect of re-arresting suspects.  I welcome the provision to enable the Garda Síochána to enter dance halls and places of entertainment. This should be extended to cover major outdoor festivals because drug trafficking occurs at such events. To a large extent, drug dealers have been able to traffic their wares at these festivals and their actions have gone relatively undetected.</P>
    <P>The public at large has a responsibility to co-operate with the Garda Síochána in this area.  While politicians have rightly been on the receiving end of an amount of criticism from the media and the public in recent weeks, the public at large have their own responsibilities.  I am familiar with a certain businessman who operated a very important dance hall discotheque.  The drug squad was aware that drug trafficking took place on the premises each Saturday night.  When undercover detectives and members of the drug squad visited the premises, the owner entered the reception area where tickets are sold and tipped off the people he knew were involved in drug trafficking so that they would not be apprehended by the gardaí.  The owner informed them that the premises was staked out by the drugs squad and that they would be arrested if they were caught selling or buying of drugs.  People like that should be arrested, prosecuted and have their premises confiscated.</P>
    <P>Politicians take their share of responsibility and take necessary action to deal with this problem.  However, many members of the general public have much information, know the identities <Col N="755" /> of those involved in drug trafficking and are aware of what is happening in their streets, suburbs, estates, towns and villages.  As Senator Honan stated, drug trafficking is no longer confined to Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  This problem was experienced at festivals in County Clare last year and is becoming prevalent in small towns and villages.  People throughout the country can play an equal part to ensure that we come to grips with the problem.  I am not prepared to allow people in my constituency or elsewhere to wash their hands of this problem and state that the responsibility lies with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Democratic Left or Deputy O'Donoghue.  Everyone has a responsibility, particularly people who are members of community groups that organise festivals, to co-operate with the Garda Síochána and the authorities.</P>
    <P>We must make a last ditch effort to stamp out this conduct which is bringing the country into disrepute and putting the lives of many young people at risk by causing long-term damage to their health and that of their families.  I welcome and support the legislation.  We will consider it before Committee Stage to see if it can be improved.  It is a modest attempt to tackle the problem of drug trafficking, but more measures, finance and Government action are required.  The Opposition will give as much support as possible to the Government's efforts to come to grips with the problem.  However, there is also a need for the general public and the community at large to recognise that a problem exists which will not be resolved by the Government and politicians alone. The public must play its part in finding a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this legislation, I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice who has encountered difficulties in dealing with the violence which has become an everyday occurrence on our streets.  There seems to be much uproar, outrage and surprise at recent events.  In <Col N="756" /> the not too distant past the media warned that we had gone soft on violence and the men of violence.  There was a perception that people of violence should be treated with caution and that we should not upset them.  It is now obvious that we should not use kid gloves when dealing with armed organisations or criminals who are prepared to bring down the State through acts of violence.  To deal with the problem we must start at the beginning.  As Senator Daly said, we must know what we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the Government and the Minister for Justice are not fully aware of the extent of the drug problem. Did the former Minister for Finance, on the advice of the former Taoiseach, know when they introduced a tax amnesty that they were playing into the hands of drug barons?  When one makes an assertion in the House that the Government and the Minister are not aware of the situation, they should look to the not too distant past when the drug barons, who are well known, were given the opportunity to launder their gains from drugs.</P>
      <P>There can be no let up if the State is to deal with criminals and armed gangs. Any Government who has not done that, has done this country no favours.  I am conscious of the reactions of politicians and parties and the PR exercises following recent events.  My party has no need to engage in PR exercises.  It has stood by the State since its foundation and it will continue to do so. Everybody knows that when people single out the Minister for Justice they are playing politics.  By saying one does not blame the Minister, one is implying that there is something wrong with her. There is nothing wrong with the Minister or the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has been caused by the softly, softly approach adopted by the media and do-gooder politicians for many years.  The moment of truth has arrived.  As Senator Daly said, it is up to everyone to face up to this terrible challenge.  The State will only survive if everyone is prepared to stand up for the <Col N="757" /> gardaí and to respect order.  If people are determined to be disorderly and to arm themselves with guns, how can society survive?</P>
    <P>Politicians have said there is no need for arms decommissioning.  Will they say that today?  How can we deal with armed gangs and organisations and while at the same time say that decommissioning is not necessary?  It is necessary because we cannot have two or three armies in a State.  The State survives through its institutions.  I support this legislation and I wish the Minister and the Government well.  I thank the Opposition for its support.  Long may we continue to support a good Minister for Justice and a good Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because all right thinking people realise that we must get rid of drugs and drug barons.  The previous speaker said the Minister for Justice is a good Minister about which I have no doubt.  However, I have doubts about some wings of the Government.  When the Minister came into office there was a policy to provide more prison spaces and to build new prisons and money was provided but certain wings of the Government &mdash; the liberal wing &mdash; would not adopt that policy.</P>
      <P>If the death of Veronica Guerin, go ndeana Dia trocaire ar a anam, has done anything, it has shaken the liberal wing out of its comfortable seclusion and has brought it into the real world.  It realises once and for all that it must support the Minister and bring criminals to heel.  It is all very well to talk about human and civil rights, but they must apply to everyone.  What human or civil rights have innocent children in the school yard who are being given drugs to get them addicted and then involved in drug pushing?  That problem must be firmly dealt with.</P>

    <P>I am often amazed by the fact that there is hardly a teenager in the country, even in my own village of Grange, a quiet rural village, who cannot tell who is pushing drugs, what is available and at what price.  Journalists can photograph <Col N="758" /> pushers dealing, yet the gardaí do not seem to be able to catch them.  Why?  I have been told the gardaí want to catch the big dealers, the godfathers.  We must remember that if the small pushers were caught, the market would dry up.</P>
    <P>How many of today's godfathers were the Bugsy Malones of the 1970s?  When Fianna Fáil was in power it decided to try to get the Bugsy Malones under control. However, the liberal agenda was popular at that time, so it did not get too far.  Public opinion favoured psychiatric and medical treatment for these people. It also wanted more social and child care workers and resources.  After spending billions of pounds over the past 20 years, some of the Bugsy Malones of the 1970s are today's godfathers. We did not nip the problem in the bud; we were unable to do so because we lived in a liberal society.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I suggested that if we are to end the drug problem, we must start at the beginning.  Many young people who push drugs are homeless. Instead of saying we have no place for them, we should open a unit in the Army in which they could be sent for four or five years not to punish them, but to train, educate and provide them with an outlet for their energy.  What is the point of bringing in child psychologists and then sending them out into the same den of iniquity?  If we are to come to grips with this problem, we must take young people out of this environment and place them in a good one in which they will be trained and educated.  If we do not do so, we are whistling in the wind.</P>
    <P>I echo what Senator Daly said about drugs being sold in discos.  Many years ago if there was a dance in the local hall, there was always a garda or two on duty to maintain control.  We do not see gardaí on duty at discos or dance halls today.  What has gone wrong?  Why are gardaí not on duty in places where young people congregate and where drugs are available?  Why can we not send in undercover gardaí without the knowledge of the owners?  Why can we not introduce a law to provide that if <Col N="759" /> somebody is caught peddling drugs on a premises, the owner of the premises is responsible and their licence will be lost for 12 months and, for a second offence, for five years?  The disco owners would soon get their act together and ensure that the peddlars did not get into their premises if their licences were in danger.  This is the type of action we must take if we are serious about combating the crime problem.</P>
    <P>I believe the gardaí, Revenue Commissioners staff and social welfare personnel are afraid of the criminals.  They have every right to be afraid.  We know what the criminals can do.  They act in one way; there is no trial, no time to make up your mind, you might be in pain but soon it will be over because you are dead.  That is the harsh reality. In Italy policemen and tax inspectors must wear balaclavas so they cannot be identified when arresting the criminals. If our gardaí are afraid of approaching the criminals that is what they will have to do.  They will have to keep their identity hidden but they will have to deal with the criminals.</P>
    <P>A few years ago this House passed a law to confiscate the assets of drug barons.  To date nobody has been brought before the courts in that regard. The law was supported by all sides of the House; it seemed to be the right thing to do.  What is wrong with the system that the law cannot be implemented?  What is the use in the Oireachtas passing laws if they are not implemented?</P>
    <P>There is something else I cannot understand.  Veronica Guerin was abused and assaulted last September and the case has not yet come before the court.  During those months Veronica was available to give direct evidence. I can guarantee that if a Member of this House was stopped for driving at ten or 15 miles over the speed limit he or she would be before a court within a month; if a Member assaulted anybody in the street, he or she would be in court within a month.  Why has the Veronica Guerin case not been in court since September? <Col N="760" /> Now the main witness is dead and the case can never come before the court.  Surely there is something rotten with the system.  Is it not time we faced reality and came up with answers?  The answer is to be able to combat such situations, but we pass laws and cannot implement them.</P>
    <P>We have always had crime problems. Forty years ago we had the Animal Gang, the teddy boys and other gangs. However, the gardaí kept them under control because there was no liberal agenda then.  At that time we had Lugs Brannigan and big Pat Flynn in Sligo. There were men like them in every town and they took on the gangs and sorted them out.  That was the only way to do it.  The same thing would have been done in the 1970s with the Bugsy Malones but public opinion prevented it.  Bear in mind too that, despite the current anger in society, there will be many protests against the new laws from representatives of the liberal agenda. However, we must be brave and pass the laws.  We must also ensure that they are implemented.</P>
    <P>The one area in which we are slipping up is the implementation of law.  I appeal to the Minister to introduce legislation where undercover personnel can be sent into premises where drugs are being peddled and to provide in the same legislation that people who own and run such premises must close down for three months for a first offence and for three years for a second offence. Removing their licences would put an end to the problem.  It is a simple method of dealing with it.  As I said earlier, every teenager in the country can tell where there are drugs and how to get them.  It is no problem.</P>
    <P>I read in last Sunday's newspapers about how America came to grips with this problem.  Criminals were put away for up to 40 years.  We should put away some of our drug barons for 30 or 40 years and no visitors should be permitted for the first three years to ensure that all contacts are broken.  These people are so well equipped with electronic equipment and so forth that they <Col N="761" /> can now operate comfortably from within the walls of the prisons.  They can maintain their contacts and run their business from the jail.  It is probably a lot easier than doing it on the outside because in jail there is no pressure from the gardaí.</P>
    <P>We must break their contacts and connections.  There is no point incarcerating them with word processors, computers and other modern facilities.  I read recently that a man is blocking the work of the Four Courts with his word processor and computer.  Is that the type of service we should provide for criminals? Are we sincere?  There is only one computer for every three Members of this House, yet a computer can be provided for a prisoner in jail.  The best of modern technology is made available. Are we soft in the head?  There is something radically wrong with the system. This issue must also be examined.</P>
    <P>In addition to the other suggestions, we must awaken the general public. Society must realise that it must help both the politicians and the Garda. People cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hound.  They must decide that they want the criminals put away. Do they realise the hardship these criminals cause in families and homes? Look at the young people who are infected with AIDS.  Those problems and many of the unwanted pregnancies and unmarried mothers are the result of drink and drugs.  We must come to grips with those problems.  One need only open the newspapers to see the photographs of the fine young girls who are dying or dead as a result of drug abuse. It is scandalous that we are not making a better effort to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The fallout from drugs is so serious that I wonders where it will stop.  We have heard school teachers speak about children of ten and 12 years of age coming to school with hangovers.  What road are we taking when such a thing can happen?  Where will we be in ten or 20 years if we do not put a stop to that now?  I am reliably informed that drug pushers are going into school playgrounds and putting drugs into children's <Col N="762" /> coat pockets in the school cloakrooms. They will do anything to get them hooked because, once they are hooked, they cannot escape.  We must come to grips with this issue.  It is a massive job and I do not envy the Minister her task in trying to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the Bill.  The Minister is doing her best but every one of us must play our part.  However, we must be sure in our approach.  Nobody should be brought into a Garda barracks without a legal adviser, a peace commissioner or some reputable person being present.  They will not be there to assist the accused but as witnesses.  I would not have said that a few years ago.  I have experience of a case where the Garda tried to accuse a person of knocking down and killing somebody with a van when he was in his house at the time.  We must be careful that we do not go too far.  A judge threw out a case in Cork last week because it was blatantly unfair to the accused person.  We must be fair to people who are accused of crimes.  To do that, there must be a solicitor present who can hold a watching brief and can give evidence of what happens in the interrogation.  Providing cameras or tape recorders is not good enough.  They can be switched on or off to suit the occasion and then it is the word of the accused against that of the prosecutor.  While we must have tough laws, the Minister should also ensure we are scrupulously fair.  If there was a repetition of the Birmingham Six incident, our whole law and order system would be called into question.  Therefore, we must be scrupulously fair.  The way to do this is to have an independent witness of substance present when a suspect is being interrogated to ensure that it is above board.</P>
    <P>We must find a way of getting people off drugs.  Are the methadone treatments, etc. enough?  Is there a danger, that we are only replacing one drug with another?  We must find the money to set up detoxification units to get these people off drugs.  It is very difficult for a person to give something up when he is addicted to it, but we must make a <Col N="763" /> greater effort in this regard.  I am not sure whether we can do that with methadone treatment programmes. Senator O'Toole said we should find a way of supplying these drugs through chemists.  Although it is not the answer, it might help to curtail the drug barons in some way.  That market might then be controlled in a better way and these barons might not have as much influence over it as they have at present.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill and I wish the Minister luck with it.  The Minister has a tough job ahead.  I want to see a law that allows undercover gardaí to catch drug pushers in discos.  Disco owners should have their premises closed down for three months if anybody is caught selling drugs there and three years if it happens a second time.  That would act as a deterrent.</P>

      <P>In a way I feel this Bill is a bit like the curate's egg &mdash; it is good in parts.  I could not be expected to agree with all of it.  My good friend and colleague, Senator Farrell, referred to the liberal agenda.  I suppose I am part of that.  I am certainly not at all hesitant to say that the liberal agenda was a good thing for the country.  I nailed my colours to that particular mast and I continue to do so.  For that reason I do not believe in a knee jerk reaction to these very serious situations with which we are now confronted.  This legislation has been introduced in the aftermath of a series of appalling murders, that of a garda in County Limerick and the journalist Veronica Guerin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <P>May I also say, since I have been invited to make this comment, that a member of Senator Neville's party yesterday attacked the position of the Government on the basis that legislation was introduced a year ago and yet nothing was done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter he raised &mdash; the question of a three pronged attack involving the Customs, the Department of Social Welfare and the Garda &mdash; was raised by myself two years ago and nothing has been done about it.  A lot of the machinery is there but we do not have the kind of co-operation or the involvement of the task force that I and Deputy Gregory, who lives in the inner city and deals daily with the situation, have been seeking.  There has been a certain amount of inaction.  I am saying this despite the fact that I spoke in favour of the Minister the other day when she was under pressure.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of these measures but not all of them.  The Minister outlined six principal ideas in her speech. The Minister talks about increasing the powers of detention in relation to persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to provide for a maximum period of detention up to seven days, with the intervention of the court after the first 48 hours have elapsed.  I have grave reservations about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also wants to allow for the detention of persons arrested for drug trafficking offences where it is suspected they have concealed drugs in their persons &mdash; so called &ldquo;stuffers&rdquo; or &ldquo;swallowers&rdquo;&mdash; in places of detention specified by the Minister.  This may very well be necessary but one would want to know precisely the kinds of places and <Col N="765" /> conditions under which they were kept. Will this involve body searches, the administering of emetics and laxatives, etc. to make them regurgitate this material?  If so, will there be adequate medical supervision?  We have had cases in the past where body searches have been used as intimidatory machinery by police forces and almost as a kind of torture, particularly against women. Although this may be necessary, it needs to be spelt out and we need to ensure that whatever measures are introduced are done so in a humane way.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in allowing customs officers to be present at, and participate in, the questioning of suspects detained by gardaí in relation to drug trafficking offences; it seems to me to be totally appropriate.  In regard to permitting a court to draw inference from the failure of an accused in a drug trafficking case to mention during Garda questioning some fact which he or she subsequently relies on in his or her defence which could have reasonably been expected to be mentioned, I suppose there is a judgment call to be made.  I can certainly envision circumstances in which a clever criminal would make use of the provisions of the present law, but we must also ensure that psychologically vulnerable and intimidated people are not placed at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I have no problem in allowing members of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue search warrants for drug trafficking cases where the warrant is urgently required.  I also agree with permitting members of the Garda, whether they are in uniform or not, to enter and inspect places where a public dancing licence is in force for the purposes of the prevention and detection of a drug trafficking offence.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot entirely agree with Senator Farrell that if an undercover person finds drugs being sold, the licence should be automatically be suspended for three months and, on a second offence, for three years, so that the disco will close.  I have practical <Col N="766" /> experience, having run discotheques, and I know it is impossible to police what goes on there.  I dealt with fairly mild substances.  We did not allow alcohol because we did not have a licence, but I used to find an unbelievable number of Paddy bottles stuffed behind lavatories after a disco.  The crowd also used to take &ldquo;poppers&rdquo;, which raise one's heartbeat and apparently increase the sensation of dancing.  They are not illegal, but I forbade them; and even though I was totally strict, I could not stop them.  I agree with sentencing those who sell drugs and if there is clear evidence of connivance on the part of disco management one should certainly introduce severe penalties.  However, an automatic provision that if a joint is sold on a disco premises it should be closed for three months is swingeing, draconian and completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> today states that the Minister is at last being provided with the necessary economic muscle.  I welcome that; but the sums involved, large though they are, only tackle the supply end of the problem and make no effort to address the demand, which is where a radical solution must lie.  The article states: &ldquo;The major initiative is a £40 million prison for Wheatfield&rdquo;.  This is a new prison and is fine if one wants that kind of thing.  More money is also being allocated to the recruitment of gardaí. However, if sums like this were spent in the north inner city to create jobs or were put into a methadone maintenance programme, the amount of crime in Dublin would be halved.  The city has an enormous problem of drug-related crime, but it will not be solved by locking people in jail for comparatively short periods.  Those not already addicted to heroin will become so within the prison system and when they are released they must wait for over a year to get onto a methadone maintenance programme, while they are still in the chronic position that their bodies are crying out for a fix.  As they cannot even get methadone, they will return to the criminal system.  It is at that level that the issue should be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> There is also the atmosphere which has recently been created.  The Felloni case is notorious because people were horrified that a man with such a background was allowed out on bail on a number of occasions, during which crimes were committed.  According to Mr. Vincent Browne's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today:</P>
    <P>He had been charged with drugs offences in August 1994 and granted bail.  He was charged with a second drugs offence in January 1995 and again granted bail.  A further drugs change was brought against him in July 1995, when he was again granted bail.  He was eventually tried on all charges two weeks ago, almost two years after he was first charged.</P>
    <P>He was imprisoned for 20 years and everyone said that was good.  However, as Mr. Browne says &mdash; and this is one of the few occasions I agree with him &mdash; the point is not access to bail.  If the court system was working Mr. Felloni would have been tried at the beginning and convicted.  It is not working because there are an inadequate number of judges, court facilities and sittings.  I am glad the Government has at last provided some financing for the system &mdash;&ldquo;at last&rdquo; applies not to this Government but all Governments &mdash; but it is simplistic to imagine that it is only deficiencies in the bail laws which allow people like Felloni to operate.</P>
    <P>I have put this on the record of the House so many times it is hardly worth doing so again: we will never stop drugs until we attack the demand as well as the supply and the only way to do that is to treat it on a global level.  A number of weeks ago I asked the Minister for Justice to place this on the agenda of the meetings of European Justice Ministers during our EU Presidency.  Realistically, the only thing which will stop drugs is deregulation and Government control. If people want to inject themselves with certain substances they will do so and if people want to supply drugs they will do so, because there is such an immense <Col N="768" /> profit.  As I have said before, Singapore and other countries hang people for relatively minor drug offences but it does not deter others, because the one drug stronger than heroin is money and it will always win out.  We are only tinkering until we address the real problem and, on a global basis, allow people to do precisely what they like in a clean, efficient and medically supervised way.</P>
    <P>The most serious provision in the Bill is that for seven day detention to allow interrogation.  The Minister is clearly uneasy about this and indicated she is doing everything she can to meet the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights by requiring that the person being detained should be brought before a judge at intervals. However, that in itself is not sufficient. The Law Society has made a submission on this point.  Solicitors working in this area are well aware of the misery imposed by drug addiction.  They are not in favour of drug barons but they are realistic and believe, as I do, that a power of detention for seven days poses a serious risk to the civil liberties of all citizens.  The chairman of the Law Society's criminal law committee, Mr. McGill, said:</P>
    <P>The introduction of seven days' detention without charge represents a serious inroad into recognised constitutional and civil liberties.  The Minister has advanced no evidence to justify such a step.  Solicitors believe, from practical experience, that such powers would be generally used against vulnerable drug addicts who have become the tools of major drug dealers rather than against the drug dealers themselves.</P>
    <P>I share that fear and the president of the Bar Council has stated a similar position. The Law Society representative and the Bar Council president are responsible, professional, middle-class, educated people.  Perhaps Senator Farrell would describe them as adhering to the liberal agenda, but they take a professional view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> In answer to why detention without charge is wrong, the Law Society states that, first, it reverses the fundamental freedom of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.  The detained person loses his liberty without any evidence being proffered against him and proved in court.  Second, detention for the purpose of interrogation has been abused in the past and remains open to abuse at any time.  One need only think of the many miscarriage of justice cases in this jurisdiction, such as the Nicky Kelly case, and in the United Kingdom for proof that this is so.  We were invited to admire the &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; earlier in this debate but I do not, nor do I admire the wrongful convictions produced by this rough policing in the past.  Third, convictions secured on the basis of interrogation are notoriously suspect as confession is often the only evidence against the accused.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, the Government guaranteed that a commission would be set up to inquire into these matters.  It was established under Mr. Justice Frank Martin and reported in March 1990.  In the six intervening years, the recommendations of the Martin report, particularly that requiring the interrogation of detained persons to be recorded audio-visually, have not been put into effect.  It is astonishing that a report making such a clear recommendation exists, yet we now seek to extend the period of interrogation to seven days and no provision appears to have been made for this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The next question is the right of access of a detained person to a solicitor. The Government should introduce access for those on legal aid, as it is empty to allow a technical right to consult a solicitor unless someone detained under these provisions has access to legal aid.  We must make sure it is a real right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year I had the welcome opportunity of participating in a debate on agriculture in this House and I am delighted to be here again.  Nineteen ninety five was a record year for agriculture with agricultural income exceeding £2 billion for the first time.  Since then the BSE crisis has clouded the horizon.  Agriculture has a key role in the national economy.  It is our most important industry in terms of its input into employment, output and exports.  While employment has declined over the last 20 years, particularly in the west, agriculture still accounts for 11.3 per cent of the labour force compared to an EU average of 5.4 per cent.  Agriculture contributes 8 per cent of GDP compared to the EU average of 2.5 per cent.  In 1995 beef and milk accounted for over £2.5 billion or just over 70 per cent of our gross agricultural output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports increased steadily in 1994 by 16.5 per cent compared to an EU average of 8.7 per cent.  About 40 per cent of net farm earnings come from agriculture. Aggregate farm incomes, which are a good indicator of performance, have increased each year since 1992 &mdash; it currently exceeds £2 billion.  Family <Col N="771" /> farm income, which measures on-farm income, was estimated at over £9,000 in 1994.  There was a considerable variation around the average figure ranging from £1,200 to £64,000.  Direct payments account for almost 36 per cent of the aggregate income and payments under the CAP reform package account for the bulk of these payments.</P>
    <P>The 1992 CAP reform and the GATT form the context for the current debate on agriculture and they will determine the declining level of support arrangements and the international trading framework for the rest of the decade. This means we will face more intensive competition.  We need to improve on our structural weaknesses in agriculture and tackle the underlying weaknesses in terms of land transfers to young trained farmers and exploiting new technology to the full.</P>
    <P>The food industry is our single most important industry.  It is worth £9 billion per annum &mdash; half of which output is exported.  I launched the national food strategy last year and it will involve an investment of £640 million, comprising a public sector investment of £283 million. Up to 6,600 additional jobs will be created under this programme and it will mean overall employment of 200,000 in the sector.</P>
    <P>The BSE crisis is a matter of topical interest.  The strategy I have been operating since the crisis hit on 20 March is to ensure adequate marketability. The first step taken was with intervention with a removal of the carcass weight limits and a relaxation on the grades.  That helped us over the problem of a lack of marketability of our stock with a glut of cattle in sheds. We have come through that period, and while prices dropped by about 7 per cent, they did not collapse.  Substantial intervention intakes have occurred.</P>
    <P>My second priority was to have export refunds increased.  They were increased by 12 per cent so that we could achieve an increase in our competitiveness in third country markets. The Border has been sealed to protect <Col N="772" /> the integrity of our national herd.  We have emphasised our controls in relation to the depopulation of herds so that within Europe the problem has been ring fenced to Britain.</P>
    <P>Apart from these market issues the big issue for farmers was compensation. I am delighted to announce that after protracted negotiations, the Florence Summit and detailed representations the original £58 million based on ECU650 million has been increased to £70 million for Ireland.  However, in Luxembourg last week we obstructed an agreement on the share of this BSE compensation because we want a special deal for Ireland.  When I was last in the Seanad I indicated that an essential feature of the price package would be a continuation for Ireland of the slaughter premium payable from January to June of £58 per head, known as the deseasonalisation premium or DSP.</P>
    <P>The rules for that premium required one to have over 40 per cent of slaughterings between 1 September and 30 November to show that one had a seasonal problem.  Slaughterings dropped to 35.6 per cent and we lost eligibility. If Northern Ireland was factored in we were down to an average of 34 per cent during the period.  This meant we would have lost about £16 million a year.  I am pleased to say that I have had the rules rewritten and there is a commitment to lower the threshold to 35 per cent.  This means we have a reasonable prospect for the foreseeable future of holding on to this valuable premium.  It is the most important thing I could have done for winter finishers who have had a difficult year buying stock.</P>
    <P>Our share out of this compensation payable out of the BSE reserve will come to £86 million.  This applies to this financial year which ends in mid-October. We will seek a further round of compensation and FEOGA accounts adjustments for the next financial year. For farmers this means a top up in the suckler cow premium payments in 1995 of £22.40 and a top up for the 10 and 22 month premium of £19.08.  The national envelope is worth £13.3 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> This package is more than reasonable because if the slaughter premia to which I referred are excluded, we get 10 per cent of the compensation despite only having 7 per cent of the animals &mdash; almost 50 per cent above the average. Other member states &mdash; Italy, Germany and the Netherlands &mdash; will get less compensation <i>pro rata</i> to their animal numbers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special envelope of £13.3 million, my Department is putting in place a process to ensure these payments are made speedily.  My intention is that the entire package will be paid by 15 October.  In indicative terms, my intention is to top up the DSP for those who suffered after 20 March to the end of the DSP period, 8 June, by about £50 per animal.  That will use about £8 million and the remainder will be used for heifers slaughtered during the same period.  There are a number of difficulties here because people sell through marts and dealers are involved as well.  My officials are currently working on a scheme in consultation with the farm organisations.  I welcome comments from Senators as to the best way to operate that.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that that addresses the initial need for compensation, but there is also the question of looking to the autumn.  How can we ensure that there will not be a collapse in prices? I am pleased to announce that I have focused on two aspects of this, one is within the European market and the other is outside the European market in third countries.  This morning I met high level Iranian scientists and vets and we had a satisfactory meeting.  I am hoping for a positive recommendation from them.  That will facilitate a ministerial meeting in Tehran which I hope will form the basis of a resumption of trade there by autumn.  However, I cannot promise that it will be successful.</P>
    <P>What is of greater significance is that I had planned to visit Libya but arrangements were not put in place by the Libyan authorities, which indicated that they were not ready to change.  They signed contracts with Australia and <Col N="774" /> others, but these have unravelled.  I am pleased to inform the House that I am going to Libya on the 15-16 July and I am hopeful of a major breakthrough there which is critical for the live trade.</P>
    <P>We will be working with An Bord Bia to look at the European market to get a recovery in consumption as best we can. We are looking to a European promotion fund to do this and I had talks with Commissioner Fischler over the last two days about that.  Let us be under no illusion.  The best case scenario is that consumption would reach 90 per cent of pre-March levels.  A 10 per cent fall in consumption means a drop in consumption of 750,000 tonnes of beef with no market to go to within Europe. This will be a huge pressure on intervention and will cause huge overhang on the market.  This is beyond the control of any one Minister.  This means that under our Presidency we will have to look at restoring a balance in production, demand and consumption.  We were at a 104 per cent self sufficiency; we are now well in excess of that.  In my bilateral meetings we are looking at a number of measures that would cut production. There is no way out of this and some tough decisions will have to be taken over the next 12 months, as intervention is only a short term measure. However, I will be, perhaps at a later date, returning to the outcome of that.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector 1995 was an excellent year &mdash; a record year &mdash; but things have changed.  The market situation has altered.  Russia is not intervening in the market and there is far less buoyancy. This year we have had 8,000 tonnes of butter and over 20,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder removed from the market and we are back into intervention. The first thing I sought to do was increase refunds and we have a 9 per cent increase in refunds for butter and 12 per cent for skimmed milk powder. I have had further discussions with the Commission to look at the longer term price and quota policy arrangements and it is Commissioner Fischler's intention in the spring of next year to come forward with revised proposals for <Col N="775" /> the dairy sector.  I have put in place an expert group in relation to the future of quota after the year 2000 to plan our way in terms of what is best for Ireland. I await the report shortly, but there is no doubt that the effects of the GATT agreement and CAP reform are starting to bite, both in the context of world trade and Eastern Europe.  We will have to try to ensure that the outcome to these changes is as favourable as possible.</P>
    <P>However, there has been a controversy recently about milk quotas.  The problem is that, notwithstanding the drop in price of milk and the further likely price drop, it is the most profitable form of farming at the moment.  We are running 6 per cent over quota, which is a record high.  We are facing a super levy bill, if things do not change between now and the end of the quota year, of £66 million.  That will be horrendous. Last year we found we could not pull back production, despite all the warnings, after the grass season was over.  We have run into a problem this year in the allocation of temporary leased milk.  The problem is not that milk was misallocated but demand for temporary leased milk has exceeded supply by over 300 per cent.  The number of such producers who participated in this year's scheme has increased from 2,500 to 8,500.  Flexi-milk has virtually evaporated and people are opting for temporary leased milk instead.</P>
    <P>In all cases I have tried to act on the basis of consensus.  I accepted the recommendation of the milk quota review group; and when there was a difficulty with their first tranche allocation, I called an emergency meeting last Tuesday.  I am giving approval to their proposal to give priority to small producers, who had legitimate expectation based on last year's allocation, and they will get the remaining tranches.  This is agreed and will be in place rapidly.  We will have to favour the small scale producers in terms of allocation of quota, the 10 per cent clawback and ring fencing <Col N="776" /> for disadvantaged areas; that is all in this direction.</P>
    <P>The first half of the year in the sheep sector has been good, with prices much higher than last year.  Slaughterings have been ahead of last year.  Good prices have brought a steady supply of lambs onto the market.  Close to 85,000 have been exported, a 6 per cent increase on the same period last year. The first instalment of the ewe premium is being paid; 48,000 will get it.  There has been a hold up with the European Parliament during the Italian Presidency with regard to the 1995 extension of the rural world premium in disadvantaged areas.  This will be an A point at the first Council meeting which I hope to chair later this month, and I hope it will be paid rapidly after that.  The delay has not been my fault.  The money has been provided; it is simply a case of getting it through.  The overall value of the 1996 premium is expected to be £110 million.</P>
    <P>The tillage sector is the one that I am most confident about.  Its value increased by 46 per cent last year.  We have had an increase in sowings this year of 50,000 acres over last year.  I am circulating to the Council a paper on eligible land, which has some prospect of moving this issue forward for the next planting season, and we will make a decision at the July Council meeting to reduce set aside to 5 per cent.  All of this means that there will be more native grains for the white meat sector and we are getting nearer to using our national base area.</P>
    <P>Similarly, sugar had a good year in 1995 and the prospects are good for this year.  Yield was up and overall sugar production, at more than 220,000 tonnes, was well above our national quota.  This was a satisfactory outcome and I do not see any threat here in the price package.</P>
    <P>REPS has been a problem, first &mdash; with its popularity.  When I came into the Department in December 1993, even though the scheme had been there for months, there was a slow response. Now over 16,500 farms have been <Col N="777" /> approved under the scheme, with expenditure of £60 million which will have a positive impact for farmers.  Our target is 40,000 farmers.  I recently reached agreement with the Minister for Finance to provide extra resources and I am reallocating resources in the Department for this.  The problem was that when we did an audit check on it, there was non-compliance and invalid plans.  There was a problem with over half of them.  Therefore, we have tightened it up, with the agreement of the Commission, and the revised specifications are in place.  We got a three year concession on the CAP, but we have to put good waste management plans in place.</P>
    <P>I am keen on the forestry sector, although it is not the most popular thing in the world.  We have the lowest level of forestry in Europe &mdash; 8 per cent.  If we had 17 per cent, we would still have one of the lowest levels.  This is an essential way to go.  We can create an extra 11,000 jobs and can increase our annual output from £270 million to over £2 billion and that is my plan over the next 40 years.  I am determined to put this in place.  We have the best climate, we have no taxation, we have £3 billion of EU grants to draw down.  If you look at the future of headage after 1999, when we lose Structural Funds, in part because we lose Objective 1 status, and the overall market prospect for milk and meat, this is the right thing to do.  There are a million acres of land here that can produce more from forestry than agriculture. It gives a better economic return.  It should be planted on the basis of increasing output from 2.2 million cubic metres to ten million cubic metres over that period.  That will give us the critical mass to create the extra 11,000 jobs and have a serious competitive industry.</P>
    <P>The Department set out to publish this 40 year framework, which is the first to have been done, on Monday.  It deals with the A to Z of environmental issues, planning permission, the doubling of the distances between trees and roads or houses, the yield class, species and every <Col N="778" /> aspect of the industry.  Better professional farm forestry is what we want. A farmer with 60 acres should plant the worst 14 acres and produce his or her milk quota and meat from less land through better grassland production. The real benefits of this forestry policy will only be seen over a longer period of time.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Presidency, which is upon us, our priorities in July are to pick up on the Italian Presidency and achieve agreement on the price package and setaside at 5 per cent, and to achieve agreement on the fruit and vegetable sector, on which neither the Italians nor the Spanish Presidencies could achieve agreement.  If I can get that out of the way in July, I will move on to the beef, wine, olive oil, tobacco, and sheep-meat quota arrangements.  I will also be putting in place a number of specific reforms with regard to the veterinary sector, and there will be a major rural development conference in Cork.</P>
    <P>The focus of our informal Council in September will be the future of the beef sector.  The Commission will be bringing forward an adjustment to the beef sector White Paper in September.</P>

      <P>I would also like to see a potato common organisation market established.  It is the fourth most prominent arable crop in the Community.  There are other issues such as the veal crates and the setting up of a veterinary agency in Ireland, all of which need to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no greater crisis in the history of the Common Agricultural Policy than the BSE crisis on beef and I am fearful that the crisis will get worse in a number of respects.  Without being alarmist, it is important that the country which is the largest exporter of beef in <Col N="779" /> the northern hemisphere and the most dependent on beef will have a pivotal role with a hand on the tiller, in conjunction with the Commission, in steering the first steps of the reorientation of beef policy.  I want to make Senators aware of the fact that now we are in a minority.  The situation has changed with regard to the extensive producing countries which had priority at the time of the MacSharry reforms.  It was clear from the BSE debate that Germany, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Denmark are all not now in favour of pursuing a further rationalisation based on extensive production.  This poses a major threat to us.  Therefore, all the following factors &mdash; whether we have a calf slaughtering policy, a buy out scheme for suckler cows or adjustments to dairy cows, plus stocking rates &mdash; will be on the table within the next 12 months.  We must confront it to have a substantial reduction in output and ensure it does not harm our national economy.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.</P>

      <P>First, I want to compare this year's prices to those of last year. The price of milk, for instance, is 5p per gallon lower this year.  The biggest problem of all is the quota situation, especially among small farmers. According to the United Farmers Association, which is helping small farmers, the present milk quota crisis brings the situation into sharp focus. There is little or no quota available to small dairy farmers because of the lack of Government regulation.  The UFA adds that the organisation, formed in 1990 to fight for milk quota for small <Col N="780" /> farmers, has not been given representation on the milk quota review group which advises the Minister.  This must be addressed, because the changes which the milk quota review group made and the Minister sanctioned, did not favour small dairy farmers with small quotas. The UFA is anxious for the creation of a land and quota authority to enable low income farmers to get enough land and quota to survive and that agriculture gets priority over afforestation for all land that becomes available.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter of the milk quota situation on the Adjournment last week. I mentioned that in 1982, when the milk quotas were introduced, Ireland was recognised as an underdeveloped country on the periphery of Europe and received a concession.  Since then, 4.5 per cent of the quota has been taken away and we must fight to get back and increase that quota.  Some countries received extra quota and I cannot see why Ireland should not be in a position to receive extra quota.  The Minister must fight for it.</P>
      <P>To turn to beef prices, bullocks were quoted at 109p per pound while cows were quoted at 94p this time last year in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal.</i>  A fortnight ago, bullocks were quoted at 94p and cows at 70p.  This week, I think bullocks are quoted at less than 90p and cows at between 64p and 65p.  That is the change in a fortnight.  Is that trend going to continue? This is what would worry me. That is a desperate loss to beef farmers or any farmer who is producing cattle to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he had renewed the slaughtering scheme for next year.  That scheme was grand last year and people held over cattle for the winter as finishers. The prices in October and November were about 106p per pound, but in February or March the prices were below 100p or 98p.  There was a loss about which we have informed the Minister on several occasions.  Can the Minister guarantee that the prices will remain static next October for the following year?  The finishers want to know this to ensure they will not be at a loss. <Col N="781" /> It will cost money to finish these cattle, there will definitely be a loss and the slaughtering premiums will be no good to farmers because they will still be at a loss.</P>
    <P>As far as afforestation is concerned, I know the Minister outlined a big programme a day or two ago; but there is worry that Coillte or people other than farmers will acquire all this land.  There are complaints that local farmers do not know about land which is for sale.  The priority must be to encourage small farmers and give them more help to develop their land for afforestation to ensure rural Ireland is not undermined altogether.  If Coillte is acquiring land in rural Ireland and non-farmers are buying land on speculative grounds to invest in forestry and benefit from it while the local community is hunted off the land, that is the wrong policy and it must be addressed.  I do not think the programme which the Minister launched a few days ago addresses this problem.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Examiner</i> yesterday, an IFA rural development chairman urged the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to immediately intervene in the Department's dispute at local Department development services offices and allow the processing of REPS payments and compliance checks for second instalment payment to resume.  That is of concern to the people involved in REPS.</P>
    <P>There is also a delay in the payment of the control of farm pollution scheme grants.  Inspectors do not have the time to visit farmers who have undertaken to develop their farms and to comply with the EU regulations.  There are also delays in relation to other grants. Officials in the local offices say they are too busy.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry came into office 19 months ago he said that the crisis facing sheep farmers was his priority and reviewing the last 19 months, the Minister's number one priority is as good a place to start as any.  In December 1995, one full year after he came into office <Col N="782" /> and identified his number one priority, the Minister finally negotiated a compensation package in Brussels.  To this day not one penny of that package has been paid to sheep farmers.  The promised payment of the rural world premium has not materialised.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question all the Minister could say was that payment would be made soon.  That is not good enough.  In fact, payment has still to be dealt with by the European Parliament and the prospect of payment being made soon is slim.  Clearly the Minister has politically failed to get this deal which was agreed last December through the administrative hoops in Brussels.  After 19 months in office the Minister's number one priority is still outstanding.</P>
    <P>Across a number of key issues the Minister has conspicuously failed to pull his weight.  Through last autumn and winter he consistently misread the clear warning signs as export refunds were repeatedly slashed.  So completely was the Minister at sea that he not once but repeatedly assured farmers that farm gate prices for beef would not be affected by the cuts in exports refunds. We should not forget that before the beef industry was floored by the BSE announcement on 20 March it had been brought to its knees by cuts in export refunds over the previous winter.</P>
    <P>When he was finally awakened to the dire consequences of what was happening, all the Minister could do was launch broadsides against the beef management committee and the Commission. The Minister's ballyragging of the Commission earlier this year was clearly counter-productive.  Indeed, his comprehensive failure to exert any influence in the administration of EU beef policy was illustrated again last week when the beef management committee effectively disbarred up to 40 per cent of our beef from intervention.</P>
    <P>To date, in so far as there has been any resolution of the BSE crisis, it has been enunciated at the Florence Summit and at the follow up Luxembourg Council.  In the words of the Taoiseach <Col N="783" />&ldquo;the lead in to the Florence Council was overshadowed by the BSE crisis and the related British policy of no co-operation on EU business&rdquo;.  In his statement to the Dáil last week the Taoiseach said that compensation was not a long-term response to the BSE crisis.  He went on to say that the long-term solution lies in restoring consumer confidence and in regaining markets.  Examining today the entrails of the Florence Summit produced at Luxembourg by the Minister, Deputy Yates, by the Taoiseach's criteria the Florence Summit, from the point of view of Irish agriculture must be seen as a very serious disappointment. Neither at Florence nor in Luxembourg at the follow up Agriculture Council was any attempt made to address the crucial issues of consumer confidence and world markets.</P>
    <P>What has been provided is an entirely inadequate measure of compensation. The final sum available to farmers is £70 million.  The <i>Farmers' Journal</i> described the £70 million as half a loaf for the autumn. Supposing a best case scenario of total losses to farmers of £150 million &mdash; of which £70 million is less than 50 per cent &mdash; farmers are looking at compensation of 50p in the pound.  In fact, losses may be much higher and this compensation may represent as little as 25p in the pound.</P>
    <P>The Florence Summit failed even in its objective to provide short term respite from the worst of the BSE crisis.  It must surely count as a colossal political failure on the part of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that, from 20 March until last Friday week, they were totally unable to have the vital concerns of Ireland addressed at EU level.  When finally something was done it proved to be too little too late.  By the criteria the Taoiseach laid down last week, with which I agree, the most important issues arising for Ireland from the BSE crisis were not addressed at Florence or, since then, at Luxembourg by the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> A long-term and stable solution to the BSE crisis must involve restoring consumer confidence.  There was no move at the Florence Summit to put in place a marketing fund.  Irish exports to the EU are still down this week by 45 per cent.  If, at the end of the day, beef is not being eaten the crisis will be ongoing.  This issue has a scale and urgency for Ireland unparallelled in other EU countries.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased by the display at the Horizons exhibition in the RDS this year.  I am sure the industry will benefit from such a showpiece for Irish beef and other products.  Our beef industry is 80 per cent dependent on exports.  If markets are not greatly improved before the autumn, when the bulk of beef comes to the market, the entire industry could be irrevocably dislocated. I am very worried about the maintenance of prices in order to qualify for the slaughtering premium, which the Minister was so proud of getting from the EU the other day.</P>
    <P>Why the Taoiseach and Government failed to even seek, let alone achieve, having the Commission mandated to examine on its own authority those aspects of GATT which are now strangling the Irish beef industry is beyond comprehension.  Clearly, in the light of the BSE crisis, the EU must urgently seek a revision of the relevant aspects of GATT, and given the extraordinary circumstances prevailing, we would be well within our rights in doing so.  What has been conspicuously lacking is the political will from our Government to push the issue.</P>
    <P>With the Irish Presidency of the EU now upon us there is an urgent agenda to be addressed.  The issue of consumer confidence must be addressed.  This means that resources must be set aside to ensure the necessary marketing and educational campaigns can be carried out.</P>
    <P>If the above matters are not successfully addressed as a matter of urgency by the Irish Presidency, the beef sector will face calamity in the autumn.  If confidence in cattle rearing is not quickly <Col N="785" /> restored, finishers will not buy store cattle in the autumn and, in turn, there will not be buyers of stock from suckling farmers.  The short-term result will be the possibly irreparable dislocation of our cattle trade.</P>
    <P>Those who are most dependent on beef for a living are also most likely to be among the most marginal in agriculture. Any further substantial damage to the beef industry will have dire prospects for the viability of family farms. The Florence Summit, as proven by the results of the Luxembourg Council today, did not address the core issues in the BSE crisis.  The compensation offered is, at best, a short-term respite. The Irish Presidency must urgently address the underlying issues.  The BSE crisis has dominated the last few months.  Perversely, the crisis has given the Minister a useful camouflage to deflect attention from a range of ongoing matters.</P>
    <P>The farmers' charter was the Minister's main initiative during his term of office.  Its implementation lay entirely within his personal remit.  It was launched in a blaze of publicity at a cost of some £250,000.  The Minister must agree that the charter is a proven shambles today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>Staff relations in the Department, already strained by the failure of the Minister to consult his Department over the decision to relocate to County Wexford, were brought to breaking point by the charter.  The Minister promised in his charter a plethora of new services from his staff.  The problem was that he did not consult with them on how this might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Ombudsman's report, in 1995 complaints against the Department rose by one third over 1994.  On the league table of complaints against Departments, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is now the target of 20 per cent all complaints as against 15 per cent in 1994. <Col N="786" /> Far from improving the situation, the delivery of services from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the tenure of this Minister, and after the implementation of the charter, has seriously deteriorated.</P>
    <P>The short-term approach, always geared to the next headline or the next news bulletin, has characterised the Minister's time in Government.  The dispute with the district veterinary officers continued for too long and disrupted farmers.  I had to bring to the notice of the Minister that Department officials would not issue results of blood tests, etc.  It caused desperate problems for farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to win the respect and co-operation of his colleagues on the EU Council of Ministers. His unfortunate and ill chosen spars with the EU Commission has left an enduring bad taste in Brussels.  When Irish farmers most needed the co-operation and understanding of our European partners it was not forthcoming. The Minister's mé féin approach to dealing with these bodies has reaped a bitter harvest at home.</P>
    <P>In 1995, when the full effects of the MacSharry reforms and the consequences of seven years' hard work in the Department were flowing, resulting in record incomes for farmers, the Minister could apparently do no wrong.  Now we can see that it was not so much a case of doing no wrong as doing nothing at all.  The Minister has let the grass grow beneath him and has let events catch up with him.  The teflon factor is peeling off him.  When the going gets tough he is simply not up to it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that we export substantial amounts of fresh liquid milk to Northern Ireland which sells at a price of 75p for two litres while the price in this State is between 99p and £1.16?  I raised this on the Order of Business.  Farmers are not <Col N="787" /> getting all of the money.  There is an ongoing racket which is unfair to consumers. Will the Minister comment?  I am sure he understands that this is a serious matter.  Milk is a very important part of one's diet.  Why should consumers here pay one third more for it?</P>
      <P>With regard to the BSE crisis, despite all the remedies that are being put in place, the restoration of consumer confidence is the biggest achievement we could make.  The Minister has visited County Donegal and has met many committed farmers.  They tell me that in the present climate, real confidence will not be restored until we in Europe and the UK decide to take cows out of the food chain.</P>
      <P>Some consider this to be a sensational proposal.  This is far from the case. Approximately only 8 per cent of cows go into the food chain.  Those putting them into the food chain could be compensated. The life expectancy of cows is eight to ten years.  They are drugged continually, whether it be by mastitis treatment or whatever.  There is a bold, courageous step to be taken to get meat back to the consumer and I ask the Minister to consider taking it.</P>
      <P>I differ from my colleague, Senator Rory Kiely, in supporting the Minister's afforestation policy, de Valera said that the economic problems of the country could be solved if we grew sufficient quantities of timber.  He made mistakes, even though he was a visionary.  We have a lot of land, including in my own county.  I do not want to see it designated for bird watchers.  One third of west County Donegal is proposed for designation, which will not be accepted by the county.  I ask the Minister to help us ensure that we are allowed to plant the land.</P>
      <P>I visited Finland two weeks ago.  Its economy is booming, largely because of its timber production, which includes pulp and paper.  Finland produces a different species of tree, which is the same thickness from top to bottom.  Can it be introduced here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> I support the Minister's programme to increase the acreage of timber.  I hope he and his Department will recognise that there must be care in selecting afforestation areas.  It should not be a question of bidding for land from local people who wish to buy it.  There must be a balanced approach.  There are thousands of acres of wasteland in my county and I hope, therefore, the Minister's policy is implemented with care and concern and that the fears expressed by others can be allayed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. If he had sent his Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to the House any more we would have had a permanent seat for him, given how much we have seen of him.  He has done an exceptionally good job in debating agricultural issues.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed so far with the trend of debate among the Opposition benches.  I had hoped to hear some new ideas.  We have debated agriculture inside out over the past six months.  I wish to address the early retirement scheme, sound investment in rural development with regard to agri-tourism and the development of land suitable for forestry.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on the expanding area he hopes to have under forestry.  We must be careful as to how it will proceed.  While there is land which is not suitable for planting, much land which is unsuitable for intensive agriculture is very suitable for forestry.</P>
      <P>It is essential that every activity taking place in rural Ireland today has access to funds at reasonable interest rates.  There is good availability of money at present, but interest rates are still hovering around the rate of 10 per cent.  Building societies can hire out money at rates of 7 to 7.5 per cent.  Agriculture is just as important as industry and it should receive the same benefits on interest rates.</P>

      <Col N="789" /> Many organisations now represent rural development.  The Leader programme has 16 companies across the country and Bord Fáilte operates through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in the area of agritourism. In addition, there are the new county enterprise boards, the county development organisations and the latest community groups under the auspices of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  These different organisations should be brought together under one heading with the establishment of a mother organisation.  This would ensure co-operation and consistency in respect of the areas to be developed.</P>
    <P>Teagasc is involved in all the schemes, and disadvantaged areas must be examined in terms of reclassification and the various headage payments.  It is vital that the manner in which these matters are operated by the various departments is examined.  We must try to pull the strings together and ensure the organisations are more cohesive.  Five organisations are working in County Wexford &mdash; the Minister's county &mdash; in the same jurisdiction.  They are doing the same thing and there is much duplication and wastage.  I do not suggest the boards are not doing a good job, but five or six organisations are working in the same place in the same area and dealing with the same people.  In some cases people applied to all the organisations to see which came up with the best deal.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is still the cornerstone of the rural economy and will be for some time to come.  I argued in the past, and I continue to do so, that when import substitution is taken into consideration, agriculture contributes between 30 and 40 per cent of the total economy.  As far as rural areas are concerned, its contribution is essential and fundamental not just to farmers but to villages and towns and the shops and other small businesses in those areas.  By and large, they are sustained by the agricultural community. These aspects should not be <Col N="790" /> overlooked when agriculture experiences difficulties from time to time.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the creation of jobs in the services area.  Agriculture is one of the biggest consumer of services and a huge number of people are employed directly or indirectly in the agri-business sector.  In terms of agritourism we should not forget that the country can only sustain a certain level of tourism.  If there is over capacity and a heavy expenditure of money without proper planning, worse problems will be created.</P>
    <P>There is a planning and marketing strategy, but the tourism industry is very competitive at present not only on the home front but also abroad.  I support packages which involve bringing people from one area to another and activities such as heritage parks, hill climbing, pony trekking and other types of tourism attractions.  These aspects are important to rural areas and help to keep people there, provided they receive a fair deal and good value.  Some people tend to take advantage of bus loads of visitors, particularly from outside Ireland, and we should not pick up that habit.  I appeal to people working in the industry to give good value, particularly to visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>Ireland faces much competition from Scotland and Norway, but Bord Fáilte has not adequately sold tourism in this country.  Much more emphasis should be placed on the European rather than the American market.  American visitors are most welcome, but greater emphasis should be placed on Europe, given Ireland's stronger links with it.  We are closer to that market, and fares nowadays are competitive and encouraging. Ireland should have a tourist information office in every major European city.  Such a move would be worthwhile and provide a good return and I encourage such a development.</P>
    <P>The EU early retirement scheme is fundamental to the development of rural Ireland and to ensure the number of people living there is sustained.  It ensures older people have a reasonable income when younger people take over <Col N="791" /> farms.  The current retirement scheme is working well and it has added considerably to the wellbeing of a huge number of small farmers.</P>
    <P>The beef crisis has been thrashed out in many discussions, but it cannot be overlooked in debates on agriculture, particularly in view of the current situation. It is sad to note that, according to today's newspapers, the problem still exists.  The EU is working on it.  I hope that Britain will come to a reasonable arrangement so the problem can be resolved and consumer confidence can be won back.</P>
    <P>The origin of the problems in the sector relate to the GATT agreement which was concluded in 1993 and which came into force on 1 July 1995.  Under those proposals, export refunds were to be reduced by 36 per cent over six years, a cut of 24p a pound on a beef side.  In practical terms, it meant the export of beef from the European Union had to be reduced from 1.3 million tonnes in 1993 to 1.12 million tonnes in the first year of the agreement, which runs until 30 June 1996.  This is a serious reduction in volume on top of everything else.  In addition, the UK BSE scare in the last six months has seriously affected consumers and reduced considerably the consumption of beef in the State.  By and large, these three items together have created the current problems in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The long and protracted GATT negotiations started in 1986 and were scheduled to conclude by December 1990. However, that did not happen because sufficient progress had not been made in many areas, including agriculture.  They concluded in 1993 and, as I stated previously, the United States, New Zealand and Canada are in a much more favourable position than the EU.  In several agricultural areas the position of the EU will deteriorate.  For example, the EU was asked to give guarantees to its partners of access to its market without receiving similar guarantees itself.</P>
    <P>The GATT agreement came into operation on 1 July 1995 when the beef <Col N="792" /> industry was being handled by the EU beef management committee and not by the Minister.  People tend to blame the Minister and the Government for the difficulties, but they did not make the arrangements.  The management committee's actions and decisions have proved negative for Irish beef producers.  I cannot understand why the price of cattle from July to December was kept artificially high.  It then proceeded to cut export refunds in November, particularly for the live cattle trade, creating an imbalance and also a non competitive situation when there was no competition in the market, thereby reducing the price of beef by approximately 6p a pound around 1 December.  These are the hard facts of the decisions taken in the latter half of 1995.</P>
    <P>I am most critical of the decisions taken by the EU beef management committee in view of events over the past six months.  The GATT proposal, as far as the agreement is concerned, is that the refunds should be reduced by 36 per cent over six years.  However, there was a 25 per cent reduction in the first year of operation and this was ridiculous. It makes no sense and it is a warning to the entire Community that the actions and decisions of the committee must be monitored.  I ask the Minister to ensure it is monitored closely, given that he will chair the agriculture section during Ireland's EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>The live trade must be encouraged. The Minister said the position in relation to Iran is looking reasonably good.  He met veterinarians from Iran today and I hope the market will reopen.  The Minister also stated that deals done with Canada have unravelled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding Iran is just as important, if not more so, because the volume is higher.  The Iranian, Libyan, Egyptian and Russian markets are most important.  I am not sure of the position in relation to Russia; the Minister visited there and I understand <Col N="793" /> the deal is reasonably good.  However, it is important to encourage increased live cattle exports to those four countries. The Egyptian market has opened up reasonably well and I understand there is a further increase of approximately 10,000 tonnes in the volume of exports to that country.  I welcome that development, but the Libyan and Iranian markets are important.  These markets will be terribly important between now and October because there is the danger of a collapse at the moment.  Such a collapse would only come in the autumn.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to see that these markets are opened. We will give them every support.  It is all right to talk about losses to the feeders, but if there is a collapse, everybody will take advantage of it.</P>
      <P>I would also like to use this occasion to ask the meat factories to be more generous to farmers.  This week they dropped the price of cattle by 2p per lb for all grades and there was no need to do so.  I checked before I came into the House this evening and my information is that there was no real reason to reduce the price by 2p per lb, except that there is a slight oversupply at the moment and once there is an oversupply, the factories take full advantage of it.  I ask them to be generous.</P>
      <P>By and large, the producer will take the greatest share of the losses in the beef industry brought about by the BSE scare.  It is not just a scare in Europe, it is a global scare which is having very serious effects.  In recent times BSE has become the subject of enormous media attention internationally.  A great deal of inaccurate information, and even misinformation, has been circulated, some of it in relation to Irish beef.  It is of critical importance that Ireland's trading partners be made aware of the facts. The facts, which are verifiable by the appropriate international organisations, are that our beef is and remains clean and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has taken every step to ensure that it remains clean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> I ask the media to stop using the term &ldquo;mad cow&rdquo;.  I do not know why they use it.  The cows do not go mad; the disease affects the brain.  It is very difficult to pronounce the full name of the disease and I am not going to try to do it, but the term that should be used is BSE.  I appeal particularly to our television announcers to use the term BSE and not &ldquo;mad cow&rdquo;.  The consumer is frightened easily enough without using that particular term.</P>
    <P>It is very important that our levels of inflation and interest rates remain low. Inflation is running at approximately 1.6 or 1.7 per cent at the moment and interest rates are stabilising at between 8 and 10 per cent.  We cannot afford to lose sight of these two factors if we are to plan properly for investment in the economy.  We have had some very bad experiences over the last ten years. Interest rates were running in the region of 12 to 20 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s and inflation was running at between 6 and 10 per cent.  This was disastrous for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad our Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, insists that demands made on any sector of the economy, whether for a decrease in taxes for the PAYE sector or an increase in social welfare payments, must be based on these figures.  I fully support his approach in this regard. Low inflation and interest rates are fundamental as far as the economy is concerned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to pay all premia as soon as possible.  It is most important that the ten month premium and the 22 month premium are paid prior to the buying in of cattle in October.  It is also important that financial institutions make all their facilities available to farmers because of the huge losses suffered last year and that individual bank managers do not take it upon themselves to be judge and jury in these cases.  If this were to happen it would seriously damage the whole beef industry, and enough damage has been done already.  It is vital that the premia are paid promptly.  If possible the <Col N="795" /> Department should start paying from the end of September, and certainly not later than 15 October.  This would help farmers' cash flow.  The banking institutions should be generous with those who suffered heavy financial losses over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about milk and milk quotas.  We have had a running debate about quotas of one kind or another. The proposed 21 per cent cut in the volume of EU dairy exports will mean a cut of 24 per cent to milk producers over the 1991 levels.  That is a very serious reduction.  These matters cannot be lost sight of because this is what is happening.  The quota reductions agreed for CAP reform will not be sufficient to meet GATT requirements.  It is proposed that the level of dairy imports will rise to 5 per cent of the domestic market. The combination of quota reductions and increasing imports will result in the necessity for a 5 per cent cut in the national milk quota.  This is a very serious cut.  The position will be especially critical for cheese exporters. GATT may allow an increase in EU butter exports, but there is little demand for this.</P>
    <P>We have had an argument about how much of the milk quota was available for small producers.  My understanding is that 42 million gallons are available and that 20 million gallons have been distributed.  Producers under 35,000 gallons received 70 per cent of the quota already distributed, producers under 55,000 gallons received 20 per cent and producers over 55,000 gallons received 10 per cent.  This was a fair distribution. However, as a milk producer &mdash; I am being generous &mdash; in view of the very large demand for milk quotas at the moment the Minister should distribute the remaining 42 million gallons to producers under 35,000 gallons.  Nobody would disagree with that.  I am prepared to accept it.  There has been a huge demand for the quotas and these people are more entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I had intended to say a few words about forestry but as I have only one <Col N="796" /> minute left I will make a few remarks about the Presidency of the EU.  The Minister said that our priorities for the next six months in the agriculture sector will be to get agreement on the agricultural price package for 1996-97.  I appeal to the Minister to conclude this agreement as quickly as possible so as to tackle the difficult situation pertaining in the beef sector.  We have said enough about that.  This matter has often been debated in this House and the Minister of State is aware of all the problems.</P>
    <P>Another priority will be to progress the reform of the organisation of the market and of a number of sectors; that is very important.  The Minister also wishes to deal with a number of measures in the veterinary sector regarding food safety, animal health and welfare and also to progress trading rules and rural development.  I wish the Minister every success, because they are all very important to rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, every success as President of the Council of the Agriculture Ministers during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The continued crisis in the beef industry is becoming more serious daily for all Irish farmers and presents the greatest challenge to the industry for many decades.  This week again we see cattle prices falling at the factories with quotes for heifers having fallen as low as 83p per lb and cow prices to 64p per lb. These prices, if allowed to continue for any prolonged period without adequate compensation, will spell the death knell for many family farms.  To lose £150 on a single animal is crippling.  Ireland took over the Presidency of the EU this week and for all those involved I wish a successful Presidency.  It is vital for our image in Europe that the Government takes up the challenge of the BSE crisis and works to ensure that the problem is resolved immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now President of the Agriculture Council and is in a position <Col N="797" /> to act swiftly on a number of issues to assist the industry.  The compensation package of £86 million agreed with the Government, in respect of losses which could total almost £200 million, is completely inadequate.  The news that compensation might be paid on 1996 applications would make payment unacceptably late.  I urge the Minister to ensure that payment is made on 1995 applications and is targeted at small farmers and those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>The announcement from Brussels that the intervention weight limit will be lowered to 390 kilogrammes must be reversed because 40 per cent of Irish bullocks will be excluded as a result. This can only lead to chaos when supplies of cattle peak in the autumn because all factories are currently reporting low kill figures, steer disposals to date are running 8,000 head behind last year and heifer and cow slaughterings are running 29,000 head lower than last year.  There are also very few live exports.  The Government and the Minister must act swiftly to have the limit increased, because any attempt to restrict market support at this crucial time would have disastrous consequences in light of the current market situation.</P>
    <P>The continued failure on the part of the Minister and the Government to have export refunds increased has made the situation relating to beef prices much worse than it might have been if such refunds had remained at early 1995 levels.  Prior to the unreasonable cuts made by the Commission, which resulted in a fall of over 40 per cent in live exports to third countries in the first half of this year, such exports brought real competitiveness to cattle markets which was good for the industry.  It is very disappointing that the Government has not made any real effort to have these refunds increased and has allowed Australia and other countries to fill contracts much needed in Ireland.  The Government's failure to launch a major sales drive to third countries or send a trade delegation to Libya is also disappointing in light of the current market <Col N="798" /> situation and the hardships endured by many farmers.</P>
    <P>Consumer confidence in beef produce is the key to increased sales.  Price confidence must be restored to the consumer in respect of the unquestionable quality of Irish beef, which is produced in a clean, green environment.  International studies have shown that BSE is not a problem in Ireland.  Had earlier action been taken in Ireland to ban meat and bone meal from feedstuffs and an immediate slaughter policy put in place, it would have necessarily and correctly protected Ireland's image as having a white, disease free status and provided a guarantee for consumers at home and abroad about the unique quality of Irish beef.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency of the EU, the BSE crisis must be our first priority.  The Government must ensure that there is an increase in farm budgets for next year by securing an intervention scheme along 1992 lines, increasing export refunds and restoring consumer confidence in the quality Irish beef.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry must during this Presidency redress their recent policy failures on behalf of Irish farmers and the agricultural industry. Confidence is at an all time low in beef farming and thousands of jobs are on the line.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to take immediate action during the coming week on the points I have outlined. Thousands of Irish farming families are dependent on its success.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to do everything in their power to address this crisis immediately.  The cattle industry is at an all time low and is continuing to slide on a daily basis. We must do everything possible to restore confidence, ensure that people return to eating beef and make foreign customers aware that Ireland is not attached to Britain and did not adopt the same policies as the British authorities during this crisis.  We should <Col N="799" /> stand proudly over Irish beef.  The Minister and the Taoiseach will be in the driving seat during our Presidency of the EU and I believe they can take the necessary action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four problems in the beef industry, which is worth £1.7 billion to our economy.  I do not believe that those problems will be solved by laying the blame on the BSE crisis.  There are four elements to our present predicament, namely, problems experienced within the beef processing industry, the CAP/GATT agreement, the BSE crisis and, most importantly, the lack of consumer confidence in beef.</P>
      <P>This week there was much discussion about drug barons, a handy name for criminals.  We should not forget their first cousins the beef barons, another handy name for criminals.  The beef barons brought the industry to its knees through straightforward fraud and robbery. Along with some farmers, who insisted on using growth promoters, hormones, angel dust, etc., they gave beef a bad name.  I congratulate the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring; Tomás Mac Giolla; the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, and Deputy O'Malley, who blew the whistle on the activities of the beef barons.  They acted in the national interest in doing so and deserve our thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CAP/GATT agreement came into effect before the present Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry took office.  This agreement reduced export refunds and also reduced the volume of beef exported to countries such as Libya.  A reduction greater than that agreed in respect of export refunds came at the worst possible time for winter fatteners.  At the time of the CAP/GATT agreement, area aid was introduced to subsidise the expected fall in the price of cereals.  However, that fall did not materialise, leaving the winter fatteners caught on both fronts. They faced high cost feed inputs and a reduction in export subsidies.  In January, <Col N="800" /> before the BSE scare, farmers protested about this outside the House, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>We were then faced with the BSE scare.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the Luxembourg beef compensation package.  He did an excellent job.  Those who criticise him are making cheap political capital out of an industry valued at £1.7 billion, or else they do not know what they are talking about.  If the price of cattle remains as it is at present, everything will be all right.  However, if it drops significantly, the Minister will have to go back to Brussels to look for more money.  Nobody knows with any certainty what will happen, but I hope prices do not drop.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister proposes to spend the £13.27 million special measures payment, although money will be used to assist farmers who sold bullocks and heifers between 20 March and 9 June.  I am delighted that the Minister has succeeded in getting assistance for factory type heifers.  Will this include butchers' heifers?</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look at the submission made by dry stock farmers. Most are entirely engaged in dry stock farming and do not produce calves.  They make a convincing case for help.  The price which they must pay for calves or stores takes account of the subsidies which they later get.  This category of farmer gets no area aid, sugar beet, suckler cow or milk quotas.  They have nowhere to turn when the price of their product drops and they need urgent compensation.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has done an excellent job for farmers, he must do everything possible to restore consumer confidence in the industry.  He should start by putting farmers who add angel dust and other such rubbish to cattle feed behind bars, which would also act as a deterrent.  We must be in a position to give cast-iron guarantees to the consumer that there is no risk from consuming Irish beef.  The ability to assure consumers will ultimately decide the <Col N="801" /> eventual fate of the beef industry, since the consumer is all important.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that the BSE epidemic was probably caused by feeding cattle with meat and bonemeal contaminated with scabies pathogen, which was helped by the processing of carcasses in plants which did not guarantee that the casual organism was completely inactivated.  I accept Irish rendering plants did not operate in the same way, so the risk in this country was greatly reduced.  However, we have had 124 cases too many.  We must strive to reduce this number to zero as soon as possible, which can be done.</P>
    <P>When the connection between feeding animals with meat and bonemeal and the occurrence of BSE was recognised a ban on feeding cattle with meal produced from all ruminants was introduced. I congratulate a former Minister for Agriculture, Senator O'Kennedy, on that.  There is now general agreement in the UK that, even with this ban, some contamination of cattle feed with meat and bonemeal occurred in storage bins used to store feed previously.</P>
    <P>A ban on feeding ruminants with meat and bonemeal is essential. However, I disagree with the recent call to the pig and poultry industry to recommence feeding meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry.  This would be a retrograde step and, while solving some of the problems for the renderers, it would be very unwise in the long term.  From speaking to constituents, I know this is completely out as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to urgently consider the possibility of using animal offal and meat and bonemeal for incineration with a view to generating electricity. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, recently requested tenders for the commissioning and running of a 30 megawatt biomass power plant.  The core utilisation of various feed stuffs, including animal offal, would enhance the viability of such a product.  A significant <Col N="802" /> by-product of the processing industry is tallow or animal fat, which could be used for liquid biofuel production &mdash; for example, biodiesel.  This House should send a strong message to the Government to consider these options rather than trying to encourage the refeeding of meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry, which might solve a short-term difficulty but which would have many long-term consequences.</P>
    <P>Factory offal is a consequence of beef processing and if at the end of the day the industry must contribute to its disposal, then so be it.  With imaginative thinking we can help to minimise any hardships involved.  To those who will ask what will happen to the rendering industry, it is my opinion that these companies will still need to be part of the solution.  Instead of making meat and bonemeal, they could use their facilities to process offal to a stage where it can be used for electricity generation or biofuel production.</P>
    <P>We can capitalise on the quality of Irish beef if we can convince consumers of its freedom from disease.  We need innovative thinking in this regard and, above all, to give the facts.  The existence of a credible research infrastructure has never been more needed.  We must ensure that this valuable national asset is strengthened and that necessary resources are provided.  I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled the beef crisis.  We are lucky to have such an excellent Minister in charge of agriculture.  Long may he continue in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to wish the Minister well at the start of his Presidency of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I thank him for outlining the present state of the agriculture industry. I also express good wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, and I am glad he will have responsibility for a very important conference in Cork.  It is good that the agriculture Presidency will involve other parts of the country in discussions at Europe level because it is <Col N="803" /> important that other areas benefit from it.</P>
      <P>This is an important time for Ireland and the Government has done substantial work in setting the agenda for the Presidency and in outlining Irish priorities. While wishing the Minister and the Minister of State well, I reserve the right to be critical of areas which need attention. While there is consensus as regards the importance to the economy of the agriculture industry and the need to strengthen it, there will always be areas of disagreement between us.  The Minister is well used to debate with the Opposition on many important matters in the agriculture arena.</P>
      <P>I would like to express our gratitude to the farming organisations which have kept us informed, particularly during the recent crisis in the beef industry, and for the sound guidance and leadership which they are giving.  Most constituencies have had the benefit of meetings with the farming organisations who were willing to brief us on the issues and how they believed matters could be resolved.  It was enlightening and educational to have the opportunity to discuss with them the intricate details of the agriculture industry.</P>
      <P>I am critical of the Minister's speech this evening from the point of view of the serious problems in the dairy industry. My main objective in participating in this discussion is to highlight the severe problems in the south-west and particularly in County Clare, an important dairying county where many farmers depend on a viable dairy industry to enable them to survive in a severely handicapped region.  I am disappointed that the Minister, in outlining the priorities for the Presidency &mdash; there were a number of important items on the list &mdash; did not include milk, milk quotas and the future policy for the dairy industry.  I hope it might be possible for the Minister, in the course of the Presidency, to bring this issue to the top of the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that many member states regularly flout the EU regime <Col N="804" /> governing the production of milk and dairy products.  Prior to the Italian Presidency Italy snapped its fingers at that regime and apparently behaved in a most irresponsible manner.  In the west and south-west of Ireland the future stability of farmers' incomes from dairy production is vital to the future survival of the small farming community. The Minister spoke of the importance of direct payments and said that 36 per cent of aggregate income for farmers comes in direct payments from the EU.  That is most important. However, if a time should come when, as a result of policies being pursued in Brussels or elsewhere, the income of the small dairy producer in the western counties is undermined to the extent where it becomes unviable for them to be involved in dairying, it will sound the death knell of the small farm family and of the small communities which are trying to survive in limited circumstances in those areas.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the situation of dairy farmers who produce milk for Golden Vale must be underlined.  In County Clare 500 farmers are faced with a fine of more than £1 million because of difficulties in the co-operative and with milk quotas.  When the Minister of State was dealing with An Bord Bia legislation last week I availed of the opportunity to bring this problem to his attention.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the problems in that area tonight.</P>
    <P>In the most severely handicapped areas of the west coast of Clare, 500 of the smallest milk producers in Ireland are being penalised to the tune of £1 million at a time when they are finding it almost impossible to survive on their small holdings.  It is one thing to say that the problem is for the management of the co-operative, but the point is that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry have a responsibility to come to the rescue of these farmers either through direct Government action or through action at EU level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> The efforts that have been made to date have left the small farmers in my constituency very disillusioned with the Minister, the Government and their co-operative and in a situation where they are almost faced with bankruptcy.  Not only are severe fines being imposed on farmers for producing milk above their quota but many of them have already paid substantial sums to lease the quotas.  Now they are being hit on the double, first with repayments on the leasing arrangements they negotiated and, second, with a huge fine which will cost up to £13,000 in some cases, even though their milk quotas might be as little as 5,000 to 7,000 gallons.  The Minister may respond that farmers with quotas of that size should not be involved in the dairy business.  However, small as that income is, it is important income for those farmers and their families. They need to be given an indication by the Minister of whether he can do anything for them and if there is anything the EU can do by reorganising milk quotas in a way that will take account of the special hardship being faced by these farmers at present and the difficulties they will face during the winter months if their incomes are severely restricted as a result of the fines for over-production.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain to a small farmer who works very hard with his wife and family to increase production and make extra money why, after all their effort and work, they are penalised. The Minister might say I have given a simplistic assessment of the situation but the reality is that people are faced with a real dilemma.  They must decide whether to continue in dairying and, if they cannot, there is no prospect or future for them on their farms.  The decline in the rural population, in the number of farm families and in the number involved in agriculture in the past will be nothing compared to the haemorrhage that will occur in the west and particularly in County Clare unless something radical is done.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in agriculture today &mdash; it has been expressed at the meetings <Col N="806" /> I have attended throughout the country &mdash; that small farming family communities are being sacrificed on the altar of large farmers who are being catered for by the co-operatives.  The small farmers are being sacrificed to secure substantially increased quotas and volumes of income for huge dairy producers.  It is difficult to convince the small farmers otherwise.  I will not go into detail about what has happened in milk production in the last couple of years but it is a matter of serious concern and needs to be explained.  If small farmers cannot be protected, there is little point is us making speeches and holding debates on these issues.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to take an interest in this issue.  He is from north Kerry and is aware of how critical the situation is for many small farmers. He can resolve some of them if he sits down with the co-operatives, the farm leaders and the European Union and finds a mechanism by which support or assistance can be given to people who are being put to the pin of their collar to survive.  Following this evening's debate I want action to deal with the situation in County Clare where 500 small farmers in a most severely handicapped area are being penalised to the tune of over £1 million because they work and produce milk.  It is unrealistic and unfair that they should be penalised and it is impossible to explain why to the people involved.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, Senator McGowan and Senator Kiely have already highlighted the problems in our beef industry and I do not want to go over them again.  However, there is a genuine fear, especially in western areas &mdash; there are many western Senators here &mdash; of what will happen to the store cattle business at the fall of this year.  The Department and the Minister have a responsibility to maintain confidence in the store cattle business.  The Minister made a speech recently which in no way would restore confidence; it would undermine it.  I am not sure why the Minister did this &mdash; it was widely reported on television and in the media &mdash; where he predicted dire <Col N="807" /> consequences for our beef industry. That may well be the case, but it is not the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to make predictions about dire consequences but to take action to ensure it does not take place.  An indication must be given, even with the present problems in our beef industry, that some mechanism will be put in place to maintain the income of the small store cattle producers who are and always have been the backbone of our beef industry.</P>
    <P>If calves are to be sold at £1 a head like 1974 and our whole beef and dairy industries are threatened at the fall of this year, we would be in a dire situation. However, there is one major difference between the situation in 1974 and that in 1996.  We now have a booming economy.  The finances of this country were never in a healthier state.  If there is any reason to have a healthy and thriving national economy, surely it is to take action to protect those who are vulnerable in that situation.  We speak almost every week in this House about the plight of the unemployed and the handicapped, many of whom are picketing our gate today.  We are speaking against the background of an economy which was never so wealthy.  Never in the history of the State have the finances of this country been in such a sound position.</P>
    <P>Many sacrifices were made to bring about that situation.  When things were bad in 1974, efforts were made to secure farmers' incomes.  When things are bad in 1996 and if there was to be any threat to the store cattle business, we would expect this Government to take action to ensure that the incomes of the small and vulnerable western store cattle producers and that of their families would be protected.  We are not encouraged by what we have seen to date with the dairy and milk industries.  It is hard to see how assistance will be provided for the store cattle producers, many of whom are the same people I speak about in relation to dairy products.  A more vigorous effort must be made by <Col N="808" /> the Government and its agencies to get to grips with the marketing of beef and beef products.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to beef barons and irregularities in the industry over the last few years.  The whole rationale behind the drive to develop our beef industry, which went on for a number of years under successive Governments, was to try to establish a way in which jobs could be provided. Mention was made about the provision of 20,000 jobs by the proper reorganisation and development of our beef business. If that can be done, it would certainly create opportunities for those people leaving agriculture.  This is the way in which we should be heading.</P>
    <P>Last year the British beef industry exported over £1 billion worth of beef to European markets.  Who will fill these markets at present and in the next few months?  The British beef market is in dire straits and its industry is in chaos. Even allowing for a fall off of 50 per cent in beef consumption in these markets, this still leaves £500,000 worth of business.  We could organise our beef industry to capitalise on those markets, but are we doing that?  We have all had the experience of marketing boards which had no money to promote their products and we have heard the objections and complaints from the farming industry and its leaders on this matter. We are not satisfied on this side that action is being taken to ensure we protect not only our markets in Third World countries but that we vigorously promote the opening up of these markets. We have not seen this from the present Government since the beef crisis erupted.</P>
    <P>We need to invest heavily in the industry.  We now have the revenue to do this; we did not have it in 1974.  The Government decided yesterday to invest £50 million to deal with crime. Why can it not invest a similar amount of money to boost the beef marketing industry to capture these markets that are not being filled by other producers? Why can the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his junior colleague <Col N="809" /> not lead a campaign to win back the third country markets which we seem to have lost?  Why can we not make a more vigorous approach in identifying and marketing Irish quality beef and not have it tagged as coming from the United Kingdom or elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Anything I have said here is in no way meant to be personally critical or to shower any derision on the Minister or the Minister for State.  I am trying to be constructive and to indicate clearly the urgency of dealing with specific areas of importance that need to be tackled.  I ask the Minister to do something for the small dairy producers in my constituency who are faced with bankruptcy and to ensure that action is taken now, and not in September or October, to protect the store cattle business so their prices will not collapse come the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I attended a meeting given by Teagasc leaders.  I do not have to quote from what was stated because it remained indelibly in my mind and I have no reason to doubt them.  They said that to be viable in the near future and to stay in farming, a farmer will either need to have a 30,000 gallon quota or 100 herd of beef.  The Minister should take that statement seriously.  We should have a revolution. We are allowing farmers with a milk quota of under 30,000 gallons to be forced out of farming.  This is happening because of the farming organisations, which pretend to look after the interests of small farmers.  The co-operatives and the PLCs do not want to know about small farmers.  Everything they do and plan is designed to push them out by stealth.  In the 1970s Mansholt told everybody what he would do, but they are now withdrawing his plan by stealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What alternative system is there for people in agriculture if they are forced out of farming?  Are there alternatives <Col N="810" /> in tourism or in venison production?  All over Ireland there is dissatisfaction with the manner in which this was promoted as being an alternative to farming and the way in which it is being handled.  I recently received correspondence from the Kerry Deer Producers' Association. I was not satisfied with the reply I received on 18 March, which mentioned the work and finance put into the production of venison and slaughtering of deer.  The reply contained no answer to my question about where the deer were being slaughtered in the Cork/Kerry area.  I have yet to receive an answer. My opinion is that they are not being slaughtered there, because the system is not working as An Bord Bia and the Department believe it to be.</P>
    <P>When speaking in my local area, I said that milk quota transfers have been unfair and biased against small farmers and that strict control by the Revenue Commissioners was now essential.  I said this because the PLCs and co-ops could redistribute milk quotas and excess milk quotas with no supervision as to whether they went to people who deserved them most or to those with the greatest influence.  I demanded a radical overhaul of milk quota regime controls to protect the interest of small and struggling farmers, which is what this evening's debate is about.  I ask the Minister to establish a system whereby quota transfers are stamped by the Revenue Commissioners before they are submitted to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, so that the authenticity of the arrangement will be known.  I have seen red faces in my area &mdash; I have not verbally confronted those involved but they know I have spoken about this issue.  I know exactly what is going on but there is nothing I can do other than to appeal to the Minister to act.</P>
    <P>Payments are alleged to have been made to major milk suppliers through fertiliser and feed accounts for excess milk production, which is in breach of EU regulations.  The Minister may not be aware this is happening, but presumably reports have been made.  The system <Col N="811" /> favours the bigger milk producers and it is worrying, given the influence wielded by the major farming organisations and PLCs.</P>
    <P>Those who have recently bemoaned the state of agriculture are paying and have been encouraging the payment of £5,000 per acre for land, when its agricultural value is in the region of £2,000. What is this but people with excess capital investing in land and increasing their holdings at the expense of those who wish to create a viable holding?</P>
    <P>I have received correspondence from the Castleblath area of Ballyhooley.  I do not wish to be parochial but it is disconcerting that this area has again been excluded from the disadvantaged areas scheme.  A number of sheep farmers in that district, between Ballyhooley and Rathcormac, should qualify for this scheme.  I ask the Minister to inquire about this matter.  We must take this area seriously and defend our small farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I wish him and the Minister, Deputy Yates, every success during our EU Presidency.  They have the capability and energy to make achievements for agriculture in Ireland and across Europe.</P>
      <P>As Senator Sherlock and others have said, milk quotas are a live issue in the south-west.  There is much dissatisfaction among smaller milk producers about the distribution of quotas and oversupply of milk.  Many of them were badly advised last year by some co-ops &mdash; I will not say which.  It was hinted, or even overtly stated, that there would be no problem if people oversupplied the co-ops in the expectation that everything would be all right in the end.  Now the producers have bills for several thousand pounds and I know one person who did not receive a cheque last May.  I am sure the Minister has experienced this in his area also.  There is great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, this year will be extremely difficult also as milk deliveries are again <Col N="812" /> running far ahead of quota.  I understand that by the end of May they were over 6 per cent above the quota and some 2 per cent in excess of deliveries during the same period last year.  The demand for quotas from the temporary leasing pool has been far greater than anyone could have expected.  In the first stage demand exceeded supply by over 300 per cent.  Demand from smaller scale producers has mirrored this &mdash; the number participating has increased from 2,500 producers in 1994 to 8,500 in this year's scheme.  It is this huge increase in demand rather than changes to the scheme which was the major factor in the reduction of the quantities allocated to individual small scale producers in the first stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new procedures for temporary leasing.  These will apply in the second and third stages, so that total priority will be given to producers with an available quota of under 35,000 gallons, with a view to focusing that quota on those whose needs are greatest.  I am also glad that total priority will be given within this category to those producers allocated quotas under the first priority category of the 1994-5 and 1995-6 schemes, that is, producers whose available quota in those years was less than 30,000 gallons.  That tackles the problem highlighted by Senator Sherlock, which is that people with quotas under that level do not have a viable income.  Some people are trying to manage on quotas of 15,000 to 20,000 gallons, but they do not make a decent living.  As the position develops they will have less opportunity and a worse standard of living, so it is important that the priority remains at that level.</P>
    <P>Something must be done for those people to ensure they remain in farming. We are always discussing rural development; and the recent announcement of loans for inner city dwellers to transfer to the country is welcome, because we need them.  Most importantly, however, we need farmers to stay in rural Ireland.  There is a massive movement out of agriculture and we must do as much as we can to stop it. <Col N="813" /> Inevitably it will continue, but we must reduce the rate of movement because if there are no farmers in a rural area the community will have lost its backbone.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision on quotas should ease the position of those small scale producers whose needs are greatest.  The final allocation will depend on the amount of quota available and the current demand is such that it will be extremely difficult to satisfy the requirements of all those small scale producers who will apply for additional quotas.  I welcome the Minister's reaffirmation of his intention to ensure that the operation of the milk quota system will continue to be biased in favour of smaller producers.  He has already made a commitment to arrange that the outcome of the second stage of the temporary leasing scheme will be carefully analysed after its completion in August to establish whether further refinements are necessary in the operation of its third stage.  In addition, the Minister recently announced the introduction of a further scheme subsidising the purchase of quota by small scale producers under this year's restructuring scheme. Every avenue open to the Minister must be explored to ensure the needs of small scale producers are addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their thoughtful and constructive contributions.  It is inevitable that, as well as dealing with the contents of the Bill, Senators voiced their concerns about crime in general. The House will be aware that yesterday the Government approved a major package of initiatives as part of the fight against crime, in particular organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline the major features of that package.  Many of the measures <Col N="814" /> represent the culmination of work that has been going on for some considerable time.  They have been subject to painstaking analysis and research and strike a measured and appropriate balance in dealing with the crime problems that confront our community.  The package is not exhaustive and the Government will continue its work on developing other proposals to respond effectively to the problems debated on Second Stage.  The contributions of Senators to the debate form a useful contribution to that process.</P>
    <P>The package contains measures dealing with the various agencies involved in the criminal justice system.  For example, there are additional resources for the Garda Síochána.  There will be an increase in Garda strength with the recruitment of an extra 400 gardaí over the next 18 months.  An additional 200 civilians will be recruited between now and early 1997 to enable an equivalent number of gardaí to be released from clerical and administrative duties to operational garda duties.  As well as providing these additional resources, the Government has approved the carrying out of a full review of the efficiency of the Garda Síochána under the Strategic Management Initiative to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the question of better co-operation between the various agencies in targeting the assets of criminals.  I am sure they will welcome the fact that the Government will set up a special unit, headed by a member of the Garda Síochána, to target suspect assets.  This special unit will comprise members of the Garda and officials from the Revenue Comissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Government nominated for appointment by the President two new High Court judges under the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  It is also proceeding with the nomination of nine Circuit Court judges, including those provided for in that Act, for appointment by the President.  A new Bill will be introduced to provide for the <Col N="815" /> appointment of an additional three Circuit Court judges.  Special arrangements are being made for additional sittings at the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Extra resources for the Garda and the courts would have limited potential unless there is adequate prison accommodation available.  In this context the Government has agreed to build a new remand prison capable of holding 400 prisoners on a site already available at Wheatfield.  Planning for this project will commence immediately.  The Government has also agreed to expedite the prisons building programme approved last January.  This includes the main prison in Castlerea, a new women's prison at Mountjoy Prison and a new wing at Limerick Prison.  In addition, the Government has approved a new scheme involving intensive supervision of 100 prisoners initially on early release.</P>
    <P>During today's debate there was a general welcome for the Bill.  It is important to emphasise that it is just one of a range of legislative measures in the criminal justice area the Government is undertaking.  The Government has agreed that a constitutional referendum will be held in November to allow the refusal of bail because of a danger of the commission of serious offences.  The accompanying arrangements will provide for compulsory review by the court of refused bail applications after four months if the trial has not taken place.  Legislation will also be introduced to tighten up the bail laws generally, including requiring a person going bail to act as guarantor for the good behaviour of the accused while on bail.  These proposals taken together will rebalance our system of bail in the interests of the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>Work is also proceeding on a wide range of other criminal law reform measures which will be discussed in this House over the coming months.  These include measures relating to saving Garda time spent in court, insanity, nonfatal <Col N="816" /> offences against the person, juvenile justice and fraud.</P>
    <P>The proposal to introduce detention for periods of up to seven days contained in this Bill is a strong measure and Senators are right to be concerned to ensure adequate safeguards are in place in relation to it.  We will discuss the details of the Bill's approach on Committee Stage, but I remind the House that persons detained under the provision, as well as having the explicit safeguards which the Bill contains, will also have the protections contained in the custody regulations drawn up under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>There is a concern that, because of the understandable emotional reaction to recent events, we might be panicked into proposing hasty and ill-judged measures as a response.  That would be a disastrous course of action and I assure the House it is not a direction the Government will take.  There is a need for the considered measures contained in the Bill.  These measures were prepared with painstaking care and show a proper concern for drawing the right balance in this area.  I thank Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to raise this important matter.  While I welcome the Minister for Social Welfare, I am disappointed that the Minister for Education is not here to deal with this.  This issue concerns her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the Holy Family School for the Mentally Handisioner <Col N="817" /> capped, Baker's Road, Charleville, which is over 25 years old.  It was built voluntarily and was the brainchild of Dr. O'Donnell, a former of Member this House.  He, Mrs. Máire McCarthy and others were concerned about a school for mentally handicapped and they founded this school through voluntary subscriptions and fund raising.  It is serving a wide catchment area, the widest in Ireland, with the longest bus routes.  The catchment area embraces five constituencies. I am sure Senator Sherlock is aware of that.</P>
    <P>The parents are concerned about escorts for children on the five buses who travel to this school because the bus drivers have enough to do without worrying about what is happening behind them.  Handicapped children need special care on the buses.  A child could have an epileptic fit and the bus driver would not know about it, but if there was an escort, the bus could be stopped.  I would prefer a male driver with a female escort or, if there was a female driver, a male escort.</P>
    <P>These people are concerned about the safety of the pupils.  On one of the buses there is an escort who was procured through a FÁS scheme; she was good.  She reported to one of the parents that the child was kicking another child on the bus.  The parent was disappointed but that happens with retarded children. The parent asked the escort how did she prevent it.  She said that she took off the child's shoes; this was a sensible thing to do.  It is essential to have escorts to look after handicapped children.  Many of these children are moderately handicapped but a previous Minister asked that a special class be set up for severely handicapped children and it is these children who cause a share of the problems.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility that a bus could break down.  What should the driver do?  Should he abandon the bus or stay with the children?  How could he contact anyone?  It would be impossible for him to abandon a bus with handicapped children in it.  Someone would have to stay on the bus while he looked <Col N="818" /> for help or for someone to repair the bus.  I have heard of a child falling out of the window of a bus when the children were not being looked after.  This is the danger.</P>
    <P>This committee wrote to the Minister and was disappointed that they did not get a reply.  That is why I am disappointed the Minister is not here.  She should have the courtesy to reply and outline the position as regards providing escorts on buses transporting handicapped children to this school.  There are children from Tipperary, Limerick and Cork attending the school.  The Minister should treat this as a priority and ensure that the parents know nothing will happen to their children. The Department should provide escorts on the buses transporting these children to Charleville.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education regrets that she is not able to be here. She has asked me to present the position to the House on the matter raised by Senator Rory Kiely.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education is aware and appreciates the difficulties encountered by some children with disabilities in travelling to special schools and would be anxious to alleviate those difficulties wherever possible.  The Department provides school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services.  However, in some cases, this is not feasible due to particular circumstances, such as excessive costs, too long a distance or the inability of a child to avail of the service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases, the Department offers a grant to the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, the Report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended that &ldquo;the Department of Education should grant aid the provision of escorts on school buses, where the need <Col N="819" /> for them has been shown to exist&rdquo;.  In 1995, the Minister for Education allocated a sum of 150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant aid towards the provision of escorts on special school transport services.  Similar funding was made available in 1996.  All special schools and schools with special classes were invited to apply for funding.  Following consideration of all applications in the Department, it was decided that funding under the pilot phase of the scheme should be concentrated on the following areas: to facilitate the appointment of escorts on services to special schools and special classes with a physical handicap, and to provide assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.  It will be necessary to fully evaluate the operation of the pilot phase of the scheme before considering any modification or expansion.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to include the school transport routes referred to by the Senator in this pilot scheme at present.  Earlier this year Deputy Allen, Minister of State, established the school transport review committee to review the entire school transport scheme.  The provision of escort services will form part of this review.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that the needs of the children attending the special school in question will be given every consideration in the event of any further expansion of the escort scheme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put forward a problem that we <Col N="820" /> have not only in Donegal but nationwide, where hundreds of thousands of brochures were circulated to third level students.  Without fear of exaggerating, tens of thousands of students have been bitterly disappointed.  The letter that was sent out by the Department of Social Welfare was one that I hoped a student would never receive from any Department.</P>
      <P>For a student to be invited to apply for a job, line up a job with a local authority, business centre or industry, apply to and comply with the conditions as set out in the Department's brochure and then to find out by letter that as they are disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance, they will not be eligible to take part in this year's scheme. The letter to which I refer added that if the student wished to apply for unemployment assistance, they should contact their local social welfare officer.  It further stated that to qualify for this payment a student must be genuinely looking for work and must satisfy the means test.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister says or how professionally his statement is prepared, students are now very dissatisfied. The students and I believe this was a badly arranged scheme which has collapsed. I could put forward 100 different scenarios but I am constrained by time. The cover of the brochure of the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed states that if you think the economy is working, ask somebody who is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not that it is important to give me an answer.  However, I ask the Minister to give an answer that will satisfy those who have arranged summer jobs with their local authorities and have received a letter from the Department of Social Welfare telling them they cannot take it up but must sign on.  They are caught in a trap.  This is the first breakdown in the approach of a student.  Everybody who believes in this State and in the future does not want the children of the future to be directed to an unemployment exchange.  That is fair comment.  I hope nobody in Government would participate <Col N="821" /> in planning to direct a student to draw unemployment benefits.  That would be a disaster.  I am sure thousands would agree that you can cure cancer but you had better not let a person get hooked on the dole.  I do not know how the Minister can encourage young people to do this; it is a major mistake.</P>
    <P>A mistake has been made in the Department.  Perhaps the Minister is not personally responsible for it but he has ministerial responsibility.  I ask the Minister to write to these students and ask whether they have secured a job with a local authority or in industry.  It will cost the State more money to pay them unemployment benefit but if the Minister goes ahead with this proposal have no doubt these young people will be demoralised for life.  I am shocked and surprised that nobody can see what the Minister is doing to these young students.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority and I am certain Senator Maloney will support me.  My local authority had to advertise jobs in the newspaper because the students were not available.  I have hundreds of letters asking what I am going to do about it.  I feel obliged to raise the matter here and ask the Minister for an explanation which will satisfy those whose hopes were dashed by the collapse of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Why did the Department send out hundreds of brochures?  Nobody in their senses would tolerate that kind of con; it is nothing short of a trick on vulnerable young students.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this plea.  It will not break the Department to change its attitude; it would not be a big problem for the Minister.  He would be rectifying a mistake.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McGowan for sharing time.  The main point being raised is that representations were made to many Senators from a large number of constituents who could not participate in the summer jobs scheme or were refused entry to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the scheme has been indicated by the number of applicants <Col N="822" /> this year alone.  I read that 23,572 people have applied this year and the indications are that the total number of participants at the end of the day will between 16,000 and 17,000.  This has proved to be one of the most successful schemes, and it is now in its fourth year.</P>
    <P>When the scheme began in 1993, Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare and about 4,400 students participated. Significant changes have taken place since then and the scheme has proved attractive.  The fact that students can earn up to a maximum of £600 during the summer holidays is appreciated by everyone concerned, especially parents who find it hard to support their children during the summer if they are unable to find work.</P>
    <P>When the scheme began it was intended primarily to benefit students from lower income families and to be seen as a support for them.  The problem I, and I am sure many others, find is that many of the representations are coming from families where both the husband and wife are working.  In one case in my town, a student, whose parents have good salaries, got a job in a local authority area.  In another case a young girl was refused entry to the scheme but the daughter of a big farmer down the road who had a couple of hundred acres was accepted.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises where, when one parent is working, some students are being cut off because of the means test.  In some cases it is extremely hard on the student when they have lost out because they are only a few pounds over the limit.  There is something seriously wrong when one considers the salaries of some parents whose son or daughter is accepted on the scheme compared to cases where only one parent is working and students are refused participation in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan touched on one of the most embarrassing aspects of the scheme.  Students who have been refused a place on the scheme have been encouraged to apply for unemployment assistance if they are unable to find employment.  I thought the intention <Col N="823" /> of the scheme was to avoid people claiming social welfare at an early age.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the existing problems.  I ask the Minister for a satisfactory answer because the problems need to be ironed out at this stage.  It is not good enough that some people can con the system while genuine applicants are being refused entry.</P>
    <P>Again, I thank Senator McGowan for sharing his time.</P>

      <P>First, the scheme being operated this year in no way represents a mistake or a cutback in the allocation. The opposite is, in fact, the case.  The scheme has not collapsed, as the Senator alleged, but is working very well.  The fact that so many students are complaining because they cannot get on the scheme is an indication of its popularity. A sum of £3 million was allocated towards the scheme in the 1994 budget and £6 million was allocated towards it in 1995.  Arising from the improvements I made to the scheme in 1995, which I am not aware of the Senator praising at any time, I succeeded in obtaining an additional £4 million, which brought it up to £10 million, to cover the increased demand for the scheme.  This year a further sum of £10 million has been allocated for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of students participating in the scheme rose from 4,400 in 1993 to just under 16,000 last year, largely because of the improvements I introduced. Given the growth in demand for the scheme, I am determined to ensure that those students at whom the scheme is principally targeted will be given a place on it if they cannot find other summer work.  It is entirely unreasonable and impractical for Oireachtas Members to argue there should be a place for everyone who applied, regardless of means or other social welfare entitlements.  It is particularly odd for a Fianna Fáil Senator to demand this kind of expenditure when his party leader is demanding at the same time that I cut <Col N="824" /> back on social welfare expenditure. That is a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>At present we have 60,000 third level students in universities, 37,000 regional technical college students and 57,000 second level students who have completed their leaving certificate.  I have been urged to include all these categories of students at various times by various Senators and Deputies.  The cost of such an extension, if only half of those who are qualified participated in the scheme, would be around £45 million.</P>
      <P>With a sum of £45 million I could increase unemployment assistance rates by 5 per cent, giving a weekly increase of approximately £3 in personal rates of payment; or increase carer's allowance by 225 per cent, giving a weekly increase of approximately £150 in personal rates of payment; or increase child benefit by 15 per cent, giving a monthly increase of approximately £4 per child.  Are Senators seriously suggesting I should spend £45 million providing summer work for students many of whom are better off than those entitled to social welfare?  It does not bear thinking about, particularly when Fianna Fáil, as I said, is demanding I spend less on social welfare, not more.</P>
      <P>I made significant improvements in the scheme last year by increasing the amount payable per student from £520 to £600.  That level of support has been maintained this year.  I also allowed third level students with even a minimum entitlement under the means tested unemployment assistance scheme to take part.  Therefore, a person can qualify for the full £600 even if they are found to qualify for only £1 in unemployment assistance.  These changes resulted in a very significant increase in the number of students participating in the scheme.  In 1994, 9,200 students took part, while last year the number jumped to just under 16,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the improvements I introduced last year remain in place, except for the <Col N="825" /> £200 bonus for students whose sole parental income was social welfare.  This bonus gave rise to many anomalies.  In some cases a student's parents could be working and have take home pay very little in excess of potential social welfare entitlements.  In addition, I felt it would be fairer to use this money to give a greater number of less well off students an opportunity to participate in this year's scheme.  The continued popularity of the scheme is a testament to the value of the improvements I made and has given rise to the increasing numbers of disappointed students who now want to participate.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of the scheme when it was introduced in 1993 was to provide income support for the less well off third level students who were disqualified by the then Fianna Fáil led Government from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months if they could not find work.  Students who are not affected by the Fianna Fáil cut in social welfare for students, such as mature students and students who have completed their courses of education, can qualify for unemployment assistance if they are unable to find work and satisfy the normal means test.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate and emphasise once again that there are no financial cutbacks in this year's scheme.  The same amount of money is being provided as was available in 1995.  I have refocused the scheme this year to ensure that the maximum number of eligible students &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;eligible&rdquo;&mdash; who need income support from my Department and who would get it but for the abolition of their unemployment assistance entitlement by a Fianna Fáil led Government, are allowed to participate.  To date, a total of 24,763 students have applied to take part in this year's scheme, which is about 1,800 more than last year, and over 17,100 students have been approved to date by my Department to take part in the scheme, which is greater than the number who took part last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> In relation to the letter being sent out to students, Senator McGowan claimed that I am advising people to claim unemployment assistance.  I am not doing anything of the kind.  I am doing in that letter what I am obliged to do in law, which is to tell people who are refused a benefit what their rights are. If they do not qualify under the student summer jobs scheme and if their means are below a certain level, they may be entitled to unemployment assistance if they are actively seeking work.  The letter is advising them of their rights &mdash; nothing more or less.</P>
    <P>In relation to the claim that a child of a big farmer is in receipt of the summer job certificate, that clearly arises because the person concerned is providing wrong information to the Department. Given the numbers who have applied and the degree of flexibility which we seek to use in order to make the process as unbureaucratic as possible, it is not possible to check every item on every claim, but we do our best. A significant number of people have failed to get on the scheme because they do not qualify for it.  I do not know if the Senator said there was a person with a certificate whose parents are both working.  Unless they are both on very low pay, incorrect information must have been provided.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that many people have been refused because their means were marginally in excess of the unemployment assistance rate.  I have arranged within my Department to have all of the refusals which were made on that basis reviewed.  We are allowing those applications where the income is found to be £1, £2 or £3 over the rate because we do not want to exclude people.  However, we have to remain within our budget and ensure as far as we can that those who are entitled to be on the scheme get on it.  For every person we allow onto the scheme who is not entitled to be there, either on the basis they have an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance or have excess means, we are excluding somebody who has that right and has no <Col N="827" /> other means of income because they are not entitled to unemployment assistance and cannot find work.  We are attempting to apply this scheme fairly.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan mentioned a person who found a job with a local authority and then found that he or she was not entitled to avail of the scheme.  The fact is that such a person's right to seek a job is based on their having a job certificate from the Department of Social Welfare.  The local authority or anybody else is not entitled to offer a job to somebody who has not got a job certificate from the Department of Social Welfare.  The error is on the part of the local authority, not on the part of my Department.</P>
    <P>There has been a complaint about us distributing hundreds of thousands of brochures on information regarding this scheme.  We are doing what we are duty bound to do to ensure that as many students as possible who may be interested in the scheme can find out the basis of it, assess whether they may or may not be entitled to it, apply for it <Col N="828" /> and if they qualify for it to get onto it. To do otherwise would be a dereliction of our duty to notify people who may be entitled to participate in this scheme.</P>
    <P>I reject claims that this scheme is a mistake or that mistakes have been made.  It is a good scheme, it is working very well, the work that the students are doing is excellent and the work provided by the sponsors is excellent.  The scheme has provided enormous social benefits in communities where it is operating.</P>
    <P>The fact that some students do not qualify for it is because their family means are over the unemployment assistance level or because they have an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance if they do not get alternative work.  Students who are entitled to this scheme are those who were denied unemployment assistance by Fianna Fáil since 1993.</P>
