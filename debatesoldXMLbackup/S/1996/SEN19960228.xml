      <P>I have to announce that the following Member has been elected to fill the casual vacancy in the membership of the Seanad to which the Resolution of Seanad Éireann on 20 December 1995 has reference &mdash; Industrial and Commercial Panel, Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel: Sam McAughtry.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Senator McAughtry was introduced to the Cathaoirleach and then took his seat.</i>

      <P>On the first real day of spring and on the day when the peace process happily and thankfully is back on the rails and revitalised, it is particularly significant that we have an opportunity to welcome Sam McAughtry as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  He comes from a community which should have a voice in this House.  It is a voice which in the past was eloquently represented by John Robb and our late colleague, Gordon Wilson.  Senator McAughtry follows in a great tradition.  We know he <Col N="930" /> has an important contribution to make and what he says in this House will be listened to.  We congratulate him and wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I welcome our newest Member to the Upper House.  He is the latest in a list of distinguished writers who were Members of this House.  The first Seanad included W.B. Yeats and Oliver St. John Gogarty among its Members and it could be said that the Senator has a hard act to follow.  We look forward to Senator McAughtry's contributions.  I am sure they will be characterised by his wit, humour and sense of justice.  In the man Senator McAughtry is replacing, our late great friend Senator Seán Fallon, our newest Member also has a hard act to follow.</P>
      <P>Like his predecessors from the North, I am sure Senator McAughtry will have many trips to make both to and from this House.  Most of them will be by car although I have no idea if the Senator's affections extend to motor vehicles or whether, like J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield, he &ldquo;does not give a damn&rdquo;. Like the Senator, I have a great love of horses, especially fast horses.</P>
      <P>On the day when the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the British Prime Minister, John Major, are sitting around a table trying to bring peace to this island, it is appropriate Senator McAughtry is with us.  I welcome him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators, I welcome Senator McAughtry, having known and admired him for so long through the peace train movement and admired his tremendous insight into a part of Northern Ireland which really has not been represented in this House before.  If the debates prove somewhat tedious and difficult for the Senator, perhaps he will take out his book <i>Play it Again, Sam</i> and read us some extracts which are most informative about life in Northern Ireland. Senator Wright has mentioned something with which the Senator could start <Col N="931" />&mdash; the story of the drunken monk.  It is about a horse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I am happy to welcome Senator McAughtry.  He represents a strong tradition in Northern Ireland which we are happy to have represented in this House.  He speaks with honesty and wit and we look forward to hearing him address the House.</P>
      <P>Today is an auspicious day in the peace process and it is particularly significant that we welcome Senator McAughtry to the House.  In the months ahead we will need to hear individual voices of unionism because there is not just one voice.  In the past 24 hours I was somewhat concerned to hear the term &ldquo;pan-nationalist front&rdquo; being used by unionist leaders.  Senator McAughtry will find that there is no pan-nationalist front; there are many views within nationalism and many views among the parties in this House.  There are also many views within unionism and what we need now is a spirit of coming together and trying to understand each other and each other's point of view. We look forward to hearing Senator McAughtry's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome Senator McAughtry, the Member from Tiger Bay, to Seanad Éireann.  It is important that the distinctive voice of Northern Ireland, which has unfortunately been absent since the death of Senator Gordon Wilson, be heard.  I look forward to it being heard in the House again because it is an important voice.  I am aware of Senator McAughtry's contribution to the peace train movement, etc. I was encouraged by the undertaking he gave when elected to try to use his influence to prevent loyalist paramilitaries reentering the fray.  I thank him for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Senator Wright my preference seems to be for slow horses, not fast ones.  I look forward to Senator McAughtry's advice as to what horses we should back at Cheltenham.  The Senator is very welcome, we are glad to <Col N="932" /> see him.  I congratulate Paddy O'Hanlon on the good fight he put up during the election.  I commiserate with him and the other unsuccessful candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to him speak on that occasion and I am satisfied a good choice has been made.  I have no doubt that Senator McAughtry's experience, etc., will make his contribution to this House very worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and other Members for your warm welcome.</P>
      <P>Someone said that they expect me to provide the unionist perspective.  I am a hybrid unionist in that I am happy to live in the United Kingdom but I am happier still to be Irish and to proclaim my Irishness.  As I stated on the day of my election, it is my dearest wish to see this island inhabited by 5 million Irish people, living in two jurisdictions with consent, but with institutions established to emphasise their Irishness.  I have urged for some time that we should negotiate as Irish people to Irish people.  I am greatly saddened to see graffiti on walls in my area with references to the Irish as some sort of enemy. For people living in areas, such as Ballyhackamore, to discourage the Irish language seems a sad error of judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to my contribution to this House, there are certain things on which I will make no contribution.  For example, I am still attempting to work out the ramifications of the beef tribunal.  I will leave such things to the Government of the Republic.  My background is labour, and the issues that would interest a labour man in any jurisdiction &mdash; South or North &mdash; will interest me.  I should advise the Seanad that the population of the town of Comber from where I come is almost entirely Protestant and they are just as glad as Members seem to be <Col N="933" /> to see me take my seat in the House.  I bring that news from the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They also have some of the best restaurants in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>In saying so, the Senator should name the restaurants involved.</P>
      <P>Since the news of my election broke, people North and South have asked my advice on many matters relating to the peace process.  They have asked me how it will end.  They have been saying this for 25 years but they are saying it to me more often now than ever.  My reply is that I do not know.  This reminds me of the taxi driver in London who was hailed by C.S. Lewis.  When he got into the taxi the driver said, &ldquo;hello C.S. Lewis.&rdquo;  C.S. Lewis said it was nice he had recognised him to which the taxi driver replied: &ldquo;We meet all sorts of big names in this business.  I had Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, in my taxi the other day.  I asked him, &lsquo;What is it all about?&rsquo; and he did not know. I said how do you expect me to know?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have developed a number of interests over the years.  I will tell another tale before I sit down, because I will not often have the chance to do this.  When I was with <i>The Irish Times,</i> they sent four writers to the four corners of Ireland to talk to pupils who showed an interest in English.  I was invited to lunch in a convent school in Donegal.  While I was having lunch and speaking to the headmistress at one end of the table, a very old nun kept looking up the table at me and dissolving into titters and sniggers.  I thought &ldquo;God bless her, they keep them for a long time in the teaching game&rdquo;.  When it was time to leave and go back to the classroom, I stopped behind her, put my arms on her shoulders and thanked her for her hospitality over lunch.  She asked if I wondered why she had smiled at me and I said yes.  She replied that she wondered what they would say in Tiger Bay if they could have seen me.  I wonder what they would say in Tiger Bay if they could see me now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> I thank all who warmly greeted me. I am conscious of the friendliness I am shown on the streets of Dublin.  I hope to travel around Ireland a great deal and to begin to learn about the process of Government at the heart of democracy as it is demonstrated here.  I live for the day when we in the North will also use pure democracy to run our lives, as people here do.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Fahey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to outline the planning process and time schedule for the major hospital development plan for University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Wall on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to investigate the provision of bathrooms in tenant purchased local authority housing occupied by old age pensioners where no such facility exists.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to encourage members of the dental profession to carry out certain orthodontic treatment in an effort to reduce the high cost of such treatment.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the Government's actions in response to the nuclear incident that occurred in the vitrification plant at Sellafield on 2 February 1996.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Sullivan on the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ensure the principles of conservation are applied to forestry management policy.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Fahey's and Senator Wall's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the proposed Order of Business.  A summit is taking place at the moment between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. I understand that, following the Taoiseach's return from London, the Lower House will deal with the matter. I ask the Leader to afford this House an opportunity to comment on the communiqué and the end result of the summit as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's call for statements on today's summit in London.  I would not wish to clash with the business of the Dáil, but perhaps time might be made available tomorrow.  It would be a logical development of the statements we had last week on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader make time available, as a matter of urgency, to discuss the <Col N="936" /> report of Focus Ireland with regard to having a statutory authority to protect children and an ombudsman for children? The report's recommendations are worthy of debate and consideration in this House.  Unfortunately, almost daily we read of more incidents in which children have been abused sexually or physically.  The Government must pay attention to such matters; it has responsibilities in this regard, apart from the people who had children entrusted to their care.  I ask the Leader to make time available in the near future to discuss these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's comments with regard to the information which has come to light recently about child abuse.  We should have an opportunity to debate the matter.  We should focus on the orphanages involved and also on the departmental officials who had been made aware of the situation.  Although some of those officials may have retired, the matter should be investigated.  It is bad that people who worked in the public service at the time and who had been made aware of abuse failed to respond and to have the allegations properly investigated. I call on the Government to initiate an investigation into the orphanages involved and the Departments who were informed of the possibility of the abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>A fortnight ago I called for a debate on street children.  While I support Senator Dardis, the debate needs to be focused on a single issue. Too often the subjects for debate in this House are too wide, and nothing comes from them.  Either Government time should be made available for a debate on street children or I will put down a Private Member's motion.  However, I do not want the issue included in an overall debate on children; rather we should have a debate on one specific issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in asking for a debate on the horrific incidents which <Col N="937" /> have come to light.  Our debate should not be a knee-jerk reaction to the abuse of children or the issues raised about orphanages.  We must consider the issues carefully before a debate takes place because we might leap into a debate on certain issues without approaching the important question of where we go from here.</P>
      <P>I grew up in the late 1940s and 1950s and it was a brutal time for children, whether in the home, in orphanages or other places of care.  We must investigate how these things were allowed to happen and their effects on the people involved.  We should not jump into the issues simply because a series of incidents has come to light.  We feel strongly for the people who were affected but we should not leap into an ill-informed debate.  We must wait until we have an opportunity to go into the implications of what happened, and what the Government, the various agencies, the religious orders and those in the caring services are doing.  We all know there were faults in these areas.  I ask that we tread carefully before we have a major debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Community employment schemes are causing great concern throughout the country.  People employed in local authorities are in conflict with union representatives over this issue.  Union members are concerned that the community employment schemes, which offer short-term jobs, are taking over from legitimate council work which union members could do.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term unemployed, who might be taken back into the workforce, are losing money.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue because this conflict is not being caused by trade union members or by county councils.  The guidelines must be reviewed to assure union members that we are not trying to take them out of full-time employment and create part-time jobs in order to boost employment <Col N="938" /> figures.  I ask for an early debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Christmas I asked for a debate on children.  We should discuss the Constitution in this regard because it does not give children a lot of protection.</P>
      <P>Several nuns have been criticised recently for their actions, but we must take into account that many nuns were kind and caring individuals who were let down by the State which did not provide the necessary resources.  Although I am not apologising for their actions, we must remember that, but for the nuns, many thousands of girls would not have received an education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesman for Northern Ireland, I join with colleagues in requesting the Leader to make time available to discuss a report.  He will find that the House will act responsibly and will be supportive in every respect.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Sam McAughtry on behalf of those who did not vote for him.  The vigorous sharp wit which has always been a feature of the communities in Northern Ireland, particularly of the Protestant community, will enhance our debate.  Another person, Mr. Sam Thompson, made some dramatic and authentic representations of life in the community about which Senator McAughtry has spoken.  We can never measure up to that fresh vigorous voice and sharp wit.  There is a lovely old Irish saying: &ldquo;Beidh na fataí nithe, brithe agus ithte ag an Ultach sular mbeadh prátaí raíté ag an Mumhanach&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;those fellows are so sharp in the tongue that they would have the spuds washed, skinned and eaten before we would have said potatoes&rdquo;.  We can learn a lot from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Northern Protestants and Unionists realise that we only have one interest in respect of their role in the future &mdash; we want them to play a full and vigorous part in the future of the communities on this island, not on our conditions but rather to see them <Col N="939" /> released, as we all need to be, from the barriers of the past.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Constitution not having specific provision for children, if anyone has failed in that area it is we as legislators. The Constitution specifically provides, although it does not necessarily literally mean children, that it is mandatory for it to treat all citizens and children of the nation equally.  If there has been a failure, it has been on the part of the legislators and administrators. I look forward to the debate nonetheless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, I request a discussion on the White Paper on mental health.  It was indicated to us that we would have such a discussion before Christmas but we are still waiting.  We are facing possible industrial action by nurses &mdash; psychiatric nurses, general nurses and nurses who look after the mentally handicapped.  It is important that we do not let this dispute worsen. This issue should be addressed very quickly and I call for a debate on the White Paper.  We have been waiting for such a debate since 1992, when the Green Paper was debated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the outcome of today's summit, I have already asked the Taoiseach's Department if he would be available for a debate but, unfortunately, he is leaving for the economic conference this evening and will not be available.  However, I will invite the Tánaiste to attend tomorrow if he is free.  I hope that debate can take place tomorrow but I will communicate with the other groups later about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis and other Senators raised questions arising out of the recent spate of television programmes and other coverage of the position of children. I understand from the Minister today that legislation is already at an advanced stage on an independent statutory inspectorate and should be available fairly soon.  That relates to one <Col N="940" /> aspect of the problem and was in train before the recent documentary.</P>
    <P>I would be amenable to a debate on the status and position of children.  As Senator Magner said, it needs to be focused and if those Senators who desire such a debate could put together the main elements of what they want to discuss, I would be happy to make time available for it &mdash; perhaps the week after next.  If those Senators could come to me later with their specific proposals I would be happy to make time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly and Senator Lanigan are right; we should stand back from the current controversies and have more information before we rush to judgment on whole categories of people, many of whom did very good and positive work in a very unrewarded and unsung way over a long period.  At the same time, we must apportion blame and ensure that similar incidents never happen again.  However, some reflection on the matter and more evidence would be helpful.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised another issue which, I suspect, would be more suitable for the Adjournment &mdash; at least for a preliminary canter.  If he does not get sufficient satisfaction there I could then think of making time available for a debate.</P>
    <P>On the question of a debate on mental health, I have spoken to the Minister who has no problem with that.  Perhaps we can find time fairly soon for that debate.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is consequential on amendments Nos. 23 and 24 and all may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (1), to delete lines 1 and 2, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  part of a vehicle,</P>
      <P>(b)  an article designed as a vehicle but not capable of functioning as a vehicle,</P>

      <P>The effect of these three amendments is to strengthen the law on abandoned vehicles.  They will repeal the existing provisions of the Litter Act, 1982, concerning abandoned vehicles and insert a new section in the Bill to deal with the matter.  The proposed section 71 expresses a re-enactment and strengthening of the existing provisions in sections 10 to 13 of the Litter Act in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes to amend the definition of &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; in section 5.  This amendment is consequential on the proposed insertion of the new section 71.  The existing definition <Col N="943" /> of the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; would be replaced with the more extensive definition in the Litter Act so that it now includes a part of a vehicle, a load on a vehicle and a vehicle no longer capable of functioning as such, for example, a bulk or wrecked vehicle.  Amendment No. 23 is the principal amendment.  It proposes to add a new section 71 to the Bill to deal with abandoned vehicles. Amendment No. 24 proposes to repeal sections 9 to 13 of the Litter Act, which deal with abandoned vehicles.  These provisions would be replaced and updated with the proposed new section 71 and related amendments.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I advised about the complicated way this legislation was being dealt with in that a number of Acts were mentioned or repealed and the overall picture was confusing.  Since the initial debate these amendments have been added.  We could go on like this.  This is acceptable to me but it is an undesirable situation, which is why I suggested it might be timely for the Minister to look at the possibility of consolidating much of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 5 (1) defines &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; and there is also a procedure in later sections about the regulations governing dealers.  Will there be a specific dealer's licence similar to that a fish dealer must get before they can buy and sell fish because it is not clear in this definition?</P>

      <P>In the case of a fish licence, an applicant must apply to the District Court for a certificate on the fitness of their premises.  I am not sure whether <Col N="944" /> there is a provision in later sections of this Bill specifically setting out how dealers will be registered or whether the suitability of the premises in which they operate will have to be the subject of court proceedings.  It may be found that in certain cases, that the premises where dealers plan to operate could give rise to serious concern from the point of view of the operation in which they might be involved, especially for community and local residents.  A mechanism where dealers could be brought before the courts to certify that their premises are fit for this type of operation might be put in place.</P>

      <P>This question comes up in later sections of the Bill and we might then have a further opportunity to expand on it.  However, it would have been better if a specific mechanism for registering these dealers with a special licence had been put in place providing an opportunity for people who are dissatisfied, or may have valid concerns about these dealers, to raise these issues at District Court level similar to the procedure which is in place for those who wish to set up a fishmonger business.

      <P>This section repeals a large amount of legislation governing specific areas of activity.  Is it sensible and wise to do this as this new legislation has not <Col N="945" /> been fully tested while the old legislation has, in many instances, stood the test of time?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that some of this legislation has been contested strenuously in the courts. Where we are introducing new legislation and repealing legislation which has already resulted in convictions for offences, is it wise to repeal the whole body of legislation which has been effective in the control of pollution and such matters?</P>
      <P>I am interested particularly in the pollution of rivers.  The legislation proposed to be appealed includes some of the Acts relating to fisheries and water pollution.  In an area as complex as this it would appear to be advisable and wise, even though we are strengthening legislation here, to leave in place some of the Acts which have stood the test of time.</P>

I wonder what sort of circumstances are envisaged there because, where somebody is avoiding their responsibilities it appears there are grounds for the Minister to introduce a regulation which would allow them to do so.  That is my concern.  I am prepared to listen to what the Minister has to say to alleviate that concern.

I am sorry to have to come back to this after all this time but &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; has broken out all over this Bill, almost to the point of being a rash.  Subsection (6) states: &ldquo;If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation . . .&rdquo; Why not say &ldquo;for the operation&rdquo;?

      <P>This section specifies the maximum penalties which may be imposed on a person convicted of an offence under the Act.  A person who is summarily convicted will be liable to a maximum fine of £1,500 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.  A person convicted on indictment will be liable to a maximum fine of £10 million or imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.  One thousand five hundred pounds is the figure that has been decided upon in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My point relates more to the fine than to the size of the fine.  It is easy for the Government to spend other people's money.  I can understand a £10 million maximum in the case of an oil spillage; maybe it should be £20 or £30 million.  I am not whingeing on behalf of businesses, but I am concerned at the ease with which it is possible to impose fines without, as far as I can see, any particular restriction.  I am not questioning whether it is right to give total power to impose a fine without having regard to the ability of a business to meet it, but to what extent would the Minister be prepared to look at the Bill with a view to imposing some broad requirement, perhaps on Report Stage, which would inhibit a local authority from ignoring the ability of a business to pay?  It may exist somewhere but I was not able to find it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> I am always impressed at the ease with which people can spend other people's money.  If the fine included State money in some form or other, I wonder to what extent would we leave such lack of control on the ability to impose that fine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I raised the difference between the fine on summary conviction of £1,500 and the maximum fine of £10 million.  On that occasion I recall saying that such a discrepancy brought the issue of fines into disrepute.  It seemed that figures were being pulled out of the air.  It is inadvisable that we adopt this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £1,500 is the maximum fine that can be imposed by the District Court.  The figure of £10 million is to act as a deterrent to private companies against a major oil spill or catastrophe resulting from major neglect or carelessness.  The ultimate figure is a matter for the courts but it is our duty to put in place a deterrent which will ensure that people will take their responsibilities seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that and I made the point myself that £10 million might not be enough for a major oil spillage but is it possible to take account of the ability of the party to pay?  I can understand where businesses make mistakes and deserve to be fined but the Minister might consider making provision for taking the size of the fine into account before the case goes to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to linger unduly over this point because it may appear to be not particularly relevant. However, there are serious issues arising in terms of how the State goes about concealing possible penalties.  I take Senator Quinn's point but one could turn it around and ask why there should be a limit of £10 million where a clean up costs £20 million or £30 million. When one takes all the variables into account, £10 million might be peanuts for a major oil enterprise.  Why should <Col N="950" /> the State limit the possible penalty if other circumstances seem to justify a more severe one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum fine is £10 million.  Senator Quinn asked whether consideration should be given to the means and ability of the offender or convicted party to pay.  The court will decide the level of fine to be imposed in light of the ability of the person to pay. As well as imposing the maximum fine of £10 million, the court can decide that the offender should be responsible for the clean up operation and repair of the damage done to the environment.  That would be in addition to the £10 million fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 5, after &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the Regional Fishery Board for the area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to insert into the legislation the fact that fishery boards would be entitled to a share of fines where penalties are being shared out between different authorities.  I am aware that legislation already exists whereby a proportion or all of a fine can be paid to the relevant fisheries board, for example, where pollution damages a region's fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can assure me that payment of some of these fines is already covered under the section, and <Col N="951" /> that boards can receive part of the fines, then the amendment is unnecessary. However, it does not appear that regional fishery boards would be entitled to a share of fines or payments under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Daly on this issue.  One can envisage circumstances where there is a major fish kill and the reinstatement of the fishery would logically fall to the fisheries board which should be given the resources to do the job.  The fine would arise as a direct result of the loss of the fishery and, consequently, it should be devoted to its reinstatement.  Since the fishery board would undertake the reinstatement, the amendment are sensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would empower regional fishery boards to apply to the courts for payment of fines imposed on foot of a prosecution under the Waste Management Bill to be paid to the board.  I consider these amendments are unnecessary and I cannot accept them because section 11 (2) provides that</P>
      <P>. . . the Minister may, by regulations, provide that summary proceedings for an offence aforesaid specified in the regulations may be brought by such person (including the Minister) as is so specified.</P>
      <P>If regional fishery boards are so specified under that subsection, they would be empowered under section 13 to make application to a court for payment of fines arising from any summary proceedings brought by them under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendments would be to provide that a regional fishery board could make application for the payment to it of a fine in a case in which it played no part. This would certainly be inappropriate. Regional fishery boards are empowered to take summary proceedings for offences under the Water Pollution Acts <Col N="952" /> of 1977 and 1990, and to make application for the payment of fines arising from such proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the legislation was being strengthened a few years ago because of cases of severe pollution that had taken place, the Water Pollution Act was being operated by local authorities and the Fisheries Acts were being operated by regional fishery boards.  An attempt was made to bring these together so that the most effective body of legislation would be in place to fight the increasing damage being done by pollution, especially to inland fisheries. Everybody in this House knows that damage to fisheries arising from pollution has been escalating in recent years.</P>
      <P>Since definitions, including seepage from silage, are covered in this legislation, one could find a local authority bringing a charge because of an incident causing £100,000 worth of damage to a fishery.  As Senator Dardis said, the local fishery board has responsibility to restore the fishery but, even where a substantial fine is imposed, the board will not be in a position to claim part of it.</P>
      <P>In moving these amendments it was not my intention that the fishery board would seek part of a fine.  However, where fines relate to pollution which has damaged fisheries and waters in a region, it is only reasonable and fair that this provision should be inserted into the section.  The Minister has made a case for it rather than against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned penalties under the Fisheries Act and the Water Pollution Acts, but they are much less than the penalties specified on indictment in this Bill.  I am the chairman of a local angling club which was forced to take civil action to recover money to allow us to restock a damaged river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine what happened to Lough Sheelin, a resource which was worth many millions of pounds.  It brought a substantial amount of money <Col N="953" /> to the local economy, yet it was almost destroyed.  It has taken much voluntary effort to restore the lake.  The same thing happened in Lough Ennell where the local authority allowed the enrichment of the lake through the absence of tertiary treatment.  For many years that lake was unfishable.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to accept what the Minister said about section 13, but I would be happy to do it by way of an amendment to section 11 (2) if the Minister so wished.  The Minister has made orders and directions and now he is making regulations.  He is becoming involved in all these matters to an unhealthy degree.</P>
    <P>Fishery boards should have a function which, I am prepared to concede, might be dealt with under section 11 (2), although I think Senator Daly's amendment to section 13 is a stronger way of doing it.  In the event of that not being acceptable, however, the Minister might consider amending section 11 (2) on Report Stage to deal with this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly and Senator Dardis have a reasonable case. This is a formidable and, in many respects, a magnificent piece of legislation with a massive amount of detail. Pollution of rivers and fisheries springs to most people's minds in terms of the public's perception of some of the country's worst cases of pollution.</P>
      <P>If we can have so much detail in the Bill there is a strong case for specifying the role of regional fishery boards in this respect.  If we do not specify it, we are disappointing a certain public expectation as to the consequences that not merely may flow but will flow from this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 11 (2) states that:</P>
      <P>. . . the Minister may, by regulations, provide that summary proceedings for an offence aforesaid specified in the regulations may be brought . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without doubting the Minister's goodwill, Senator Daly and Senator Dardis have made a strong case for including this amendment.  I hope the Minister <Col N="954" /> will be prepared to look at it on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the range of fines.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, defines fines up to a maximum of £10 million. As well as being fined, polluters can be ordered to meet the cost of any necessary clean up involved.  If fishery boards are faced with a huge cost factor in cleaning up an area under their responsibility they can pursue the matter to recover the clean up costs.  As well as the regional fishery boards, other bodies that could be so defined are, for example, harbour authorities, health boards and a range of other statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>I understand the points that have been made and I undertake to give consideration to prescribing fishery boards as prosecuting authorities and allowing them to apply to the courts for payment of fines.  The suggestion that we should look at it again on Report Stage gives us time to think about what has been said.  We will address it again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that assurance.  I would draw the Minister's attention, however, to the fact that the fishery boards were very suspicious of local authorities and how they would be treated in terms of fines, especially when the local authorities were causing so much pollution themselves.  I recall many cases in which Clare County Council caused deleterious matter to flow into the Annageeragh River, one of the best salmon rivers in west Clare in which I am sure Senator Dardis has fished, and wiped out the entire fish stock.  The fishery board spent years trying to get a few pounds from the county council to repair the damage.  Boards are rightly wary of local authorities in this matter.  We must be clear about this, otherwise local authorities will try to evade their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>To reinforce what Senator Daly said, we must be conscious <Col N="955" /> of the optics of this as far as the public is concerned.  This is public education legislation in certain respects in terms of consciousness raising and enhancing awareness.  Since the public is far more aware of the importance attached to particular agencies and approaches when mentioned specifically, this is desirable.  I accept the Minister's willingness to look at this on Report Stage and to specify regional fishery boards. As far as public perception is concerned, regional fishery boards would rank highly in terms of which authority should have power to take action against pollution and waste.</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by the tone of the Minister's response to Senator Daly's amendments.  Local authorities' determination to rectify damage to fisheries is much less than that of the regional fishery boards. Senator Daly is right in that it is frequently suggested that farmers and industrialists are the main polluters.  I believe evidence would suggest that local authorities, certainly in terms of the magnitude of pollution, are the greatest offenders.  I know that a local <Col N="956" /> authority was sued by a fishing club to recover damages.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a point about fines under the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  In my experience prosecutions have arisen as a result of the Fisheries Act and the Water Pollution Act rather than from the Environmental Protection Agency Act. I do not know of any prosecutions in respect of pollution of fisheries which have arisen from that legislation.</P>
      <P>Last Monday Kildare County Council discussed the water quality management plan for the River Liffey.  At present Dublin Corporation abstracts 52 million gallons per day from the waterworks at Ballymore Eustace.  It has permission to increase this to 70 million gallons per day, although its original intention was to abstract 120 million gallons.  Now the corporation is talking about 100 million gallons as a compromise.  The mean flow of water in the River Liffey is 190 million gallons per day.  The suggestion is to abstract half of the water from the head waters of the River Liffey and lose one third of it through the pipes of Dublin because they leak.  One must question the determination at local authority level to preserve resources which have survived intact since the Ice Age.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Bill does not interfere with the powers of the regional fishery boards to pursue whatever course of action they decide on.  As regards the suggestion in relation to section 11 (2), I will consider specifying regional fishery boards which would give them the power to take summary proceedings under the Waste Management Bill.  It is something we will consider. Fishery boards are not dependent on local authorities to take decisions on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and it was deliberately done that way.  When the Water Pollution Act was introduced &mdash; I was in Government at the time &mdash; a deliberate decision was taken to leave fishery boards with their own powers and functions because of the fear that <Col N="957" /> local authorities would continue to pollute and show the same reluctance to repair damage.  We want the boards to be named in the legislation.  If the Minister assures us that he will look at this favourably before Report Stage, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2d:</P>
      <P>In page 19, lines 27 to 31, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to authorised officers and their authority to enter private dwellings about which I am concerned. When we discussed other legislation, serious reservations were expressed about the rights of the Garda to enter private dwellings in connection with offences.  I am not sure we should deal with this in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would delete section 14 (2) which qualifies the right of an authorised officer to enter a private dwelling where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there may be a risk of environmental pollution arising from the carrying on of an activity at the premises.  I cannot accept this amendment because the provisions of subsection (2) are reasonable and necessary.  The subsection places a restriction on the right of entry to a private dwelling without the consent of the occupier.  An authorised person must give at least 24 hours' notice before entering a private dwelling unless a District Court warrant is obtained under subsection (7).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is designed to safeguard domestic privacy.  Entry to a private dwelling is likely to arise only in exceptional circumstances &mdash; for <Col N="958" /> example, for the purpose of securing or inspecting records.  Broadly similar provisions can be found in sections 81 and 83 of the Planning Act, 1963, section 28 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, section 22 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, section 14 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and section 13 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister could assure me that entry into a private dwelling would not take place without a court warrant, I would be prepared to accept that.  However, this is not the case.  We are not clear who these authorised officers will be, their qualifications, status and authority.  Therefore I am reluctant to give authorised officers powers to walk into somebody's private dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These safeguards are necessary on constitutional grounds. Subsection (7) provides that where authorised persons in the performance of their duties are prevented from entering a premises, where they have reason to believe that evidence on a premises relating to a suspected offence may be interfered with, they or the body which appointed them &mdash; the agency or a local authority &mdash; may apply to the District Court for a warrant authorising entry to the premises, which may include a private dwelling, for the purposes of exercising their powers under this section.  The warrant, which may provide for Garda assistance if considered necessary, must be executed within one month of the date of issue.</P>
      <P>The question related to the term &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;.  That is defined in section 5 to mean a person appointed by the Minister, the local authority, the agency or any other person who may be so prescribed in regulations made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not seen the regulations so we are not sure precisely who the authorised officer will be.  In such a situation I am reluctant to give a person, who will be defined by ministerial regulation <Col N="959" /> under section 5, more authority than some members of the Garda Síochána have at present.  The issue of a private dwelling is important.  If the Minister of State can give an assurance that an authorised officer who enters a private dwelling will have a warrant from the District Court, that would be a reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>All of us would have a sense of unease if there was any danger of abuse, if there is lingering uncertainty about who these people will be and if regulations about them must still be made.  Senator Daly's unease about the matter is not confined to himself.  I recognise there are protections and provisions but striking the balance is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly wishes to know who these people will be.  They can be defined by regulation; for example, with regard to the Senator's earlier uneasiness about excluding the fishery board, we could prescribe officers of the fishery board as officers. That is something we will look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised officers of fishery boards have a warrant and authorisations which carry the seal of the board.  Under this section authorised officers will have a certificate.  Will it be similar to the warrant that is available to fisheries personnel?  I cannot accept a situation where an individual who has limited experience and knowledge of an incident might have the power to walk into somebody's private house without warrant or authority, other than something conferred by regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State understands that Senator Daly's doubts about this section are shared by other Senators.  Perhaps he would look at the section before Report Stage.  To be able to enter somebody's house without a warrant and with just 24 hours' notice appears to be a draconian measure especially when, as Senator Daly has <Col N="960" /> pointed out, we do not know at this stage who these people will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty arises over the categories of people who would be allowed to enter.  The normal image we have is that such a person would be a member of the Garda.  That is a reasonable power where there is suspicion of illegality.  However, we are extending that power to a wide range of people and that is the disquieting aspect: the categories of people upon whom this power is conferred and not the power in itself.  We accept that there would be circumstances where it might be necessary to effect an entry but the question at issue is the categories of people who are allowed to effect the entry.</P>
      <P>When the Road Traffic Act was being discussed there was much debate about this aspect of the legislation as it related to the Garda Síochána.  I had personal experience over Christmas of how the legislation worked.  A road block was located very close to my house.  Several people came to visit me and their cars turned into my home quite legitimately. The gardaí, however, thought they were avoiding the road block and arrived into my yard.  They did not need a warrant as under the Act they were entitled to do it.  However, it is an uncomfortable experience to have the gardaí arrive at one's doorstep while guests wonder why they have been followed.  None of them had any intoxicating liquor taken.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Daly and the other Senators.  I was surprised to hear the list of legislation the Minister of State read out and to realise how we have whittled away one's right to the privacy of one's home.  The Minister offered a number of examples of legislation under which people have the right to come into one's home without a warrant. That list would not be the end of the matter because I am quite sure that other legislation would include VAT and tax inspectors and many others whose rights of entry would have surprised <Col N="961" /> those who thought of their home as their castle and who thought they had the right to privacy in their homes.  This provision appears to be even vaguer because the terms used in regard to those who have the right to come to one's home are not prescribed in the detail with which I would be happy.  I urge the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Quinn have brought to our attention the open ended nature of the possible categories of people who could be specified as qualified or authorised.  I presume these follow from the groupings in section 11 (2) which the Minister may, by regulation, authorise.  It is potentially open ended.  There is also a more general principle involved. Obviously as the complexity of modern life becomes more intense the State must be involved in more aspects of life. There must be more regulations, intrusions and controls.  However, this opens up possible interference with traditional personal rights and that is something about which the Oireachtas should be very conscious.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Agency or a local authority shall as soon as may be after the conviction of a person, publish a list of convicted persons in a newspaper circulated in the area, giving details and fines imposed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this amendment is to allow for the publication of a list of persons convicted under the legislation in a newspaper circulated in the area involved.  The Minister of State is aware that recent provisions were made to publish a list of revenue defaulters which has had a dramatic effect on the number of people who default.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the <Col N="965" /> publication of the names of those convicted under the legislation.  This will deter others from continuing such activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would require that the agency or local authority publish details of persons convicted of offences under the Waste Management Act in a newspaper circulating in the relevant area.  I am unhappy with the amendment at present because section 19 of the Bill requires that local authorities and the agency maintain a register, for the purposes of the Act, which will be open to public inspection. The Minister will prescribe the matters to be contained in these registers.  In this context, it is intended to provide that details of all successful prosecutions initiated by the relevant body shall be specified in the registers.  This information will, therefore, be available to members of the public.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment would impose an unnecessary and possibly costly obligation upon the bodies concerned. I ask the Senator to consider this argument as a reasonable one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, we will be dependent on the press accurately and comprehensively to record the contents of the document.  If a journalist is pursuing a vendetta against somebody &mdash; God forbid that should ever happen in any local authority area &mdash; the documentation could be used in a selective manner.  If it is to be in the domain of public knowledge, there is a case to publish it in some consistent format where the same information is <Col N="966" /> available to everyone rather than it being accessible to those with time and motive to pursue the way to which I referred.  I accept that the Minister is unhappy with the amendment but there is much validity in Senator Daly's approach.  If we are to try to impress on the Irish public the necessity for raising our game in terms of consciousness of the dangers and threats of waste, this is a very effective way of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment would not prevent any journalist from, previously or subsequently, misrepresenting a situation.  The register will be available, in a central area in a public place, to anyone interested in obtaining information.  From my own experience of local authorities I am aware that they are enduring problems, due to lack of finance, in carrying out their duty to publish lists of planning applications.  Some authorities had to terminate placing advertisements in the press to inform the public of applications they received the previous week. The amendment goes too far in imposing costs when the register will be available in a public and central location for inspection at any time.</P>

      <P>I was inclined to agree with Senator Daly, but having listened to the Minister of State, I accept that it is probably more interesting to read a news story about a conviction.  There are many local papers in competition with each other and a spicy article relating to a conviction might be more interesting than a list of names of those convicted, which might not be read at all.  I go along with the Minister on this occasion.  Senator Daly's objective is worthy but the Minister is probably more sensible in trying to achieve the objective set out.</P>

      <P>I defer to the collective wisdom of my colleagues but I would still register support for Senator Daly, even if only in principle.  Readers at local level would certainly take cognisance of any list of names of transgressors. <Col N="967" /> This does not have to be presented in spicy form.  The names of one's dearly revered parishioners could be the sexiest reading in the paper that week.  Publishing lists of names in newspapers would involve a cost for local authorities but there is also a cost involved in people looking for access in terms of the time taken up by officials. On balance I would prefer Senator's Daly's amendment but I accept the other view is the prevalent one.</P>

      <P>In my long experience as a Member of the Oireachtas nothing has focused public attention more on the issue of tax defaulters than the publication by the Revenue Commissioners of lists of such defaulters.  These lists are eagerly looked forward to by many people.  The purpose of the amendment is to create an awareness of the damage caused by pollution and to focus public attention on the fact that if people are convicted of this type of activity they will not get off lightly.  This would certainly focus public attention on pollution. It was stated earlier that this issue has a great deal to do with perceptions, but the perception must exist that the Government means business with regard to pollution matters and that the names of people who are convicted of serious offences will appear in newspapers. I do not believe lists will be big and will require whole supplements of newspapers.  In view of what the Minister has said, I reluctantly agree to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In the register there may well be a number of items.  A person who wishes to see a reference in the register will have to look for a specific item even though there may be three or four further items, which will not be evident from what is proposed here.  I would like to see this changed.  When people seek valuations of properties from local authorities they are given precise certificates for the properties for which they seek valuations, whereas there may be ten other valuations.  A register could contain a number of serious matters.  Unless people seek information on specific matters, they would not be aware that there are other entries on the register without being able to see it.</P>

      <P>This a standard provision. If there is a large detailed register, this would not have to be produced in full in court proceedings.  Evidence of entries in the register would be sufficient.  May records are now kept on computer and there would be a problem in bringing forward all lists in registers.  The subsection provides that evidence should be produced which satisfies courts that entries are contained in registers.  I think this provision is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>There would be a certain amount of confusion.  It appears there will be two registers, one kept by the agency and the other by the local authority. <Col N="969" /> To determine an issue there may have to be a search of some kind before a person obtains the information they require.  There may be other relevant information in the register in addition to the individual registration in question. Will there be two registers as I have outlined and, if so, what will be the relationship between them?  If a full picture of something is required, which may involve four or five entries in a register, how can this be provided without the full register being seen?</P>

      <P>I can see the sense of the subsection in that I do not think it should be required that the full register be produced.  A section of it should be adequate as evidence; this is what the subsection has in mind.  However, I share some of Senator Daly's reservations.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) (a) states that the agency may keep a register under this section otherwise than in legible form. I suppose this is to do with computer language so that the register is capable of being used to make a legible copy or reproduction.  It may also have something to do with the type of illegible prescriptions Senator Henry and her colleagues give us at times and which need to be translated.  I am not sure exactly what is involved in this subsection.  The Minister referred to computer technology and perhaps the subsection is related to this.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the imposition of a further obligation on local authorities. This was discussed already in both Houses.  I do not object to this but to the fact that moneys must be found to exercise the obligation.  Almost always the obligation to raise moneys for what is required under Bills falls locally.  One of the many examples of this is the maintenance of courthouses. If central Government imposes obligations of a statutory nature, it has a responsibility to fund them.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis's insight into legislation is uncanny.  He is right that this part of the Bill is because of <Col N="970" /> doctors.  A few years ago the Medical Council register could not be produced in court because it was on computer and the case was lost.  Since then sections like this had to be inserted in Bills.

The full register will be in the possession of the agency and each local authority will have a register relating to its own jurisdiction.  When local authorities are involved in court proceedings they will comply with the provision to produce evidence that there is an entry in their register.</P>

Confusion may arise which will leave gaps in the legislation.  A situation may arise where there will be disagreement between the agency and the authorities as to who is responsible for what and the Minister may be called upon to adjudicate on a regular basis.

The scope for the transfer of functions to the agency is limited.  Functions where the possibility of a transfer would be envisaged would be: responsibility for the issue of permits in respect of the commercial collection of hazardous waste and regulatory functions under section 39 (4) in respect of the recovery of hazardous waste or under section 51 in relation to the recovery of specified agricultural wastes.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (1) could envisage transferring power under section 36 to make by-laws in relation to the presentation of waste plans to borough corporations and UDCs which operate waste collection services within their functional areas.

      <P>&ldquo;(c) failure by a local authority to make a plan as may be prescribed within the time set down shall be reported by the Minister to both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that in the event of a local authority failing to formulate a plan within the time set down by the Minister, the Minister would report it to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am prepared to look at ways to improve the amendment.  If the legislation is to be effective we have to put responsibility on the local authorities to make the plans and if an authority fails to make a plan we should be informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 6 because I see no penalty in the Bill for local authorities if they failed to make plans within a prescribed time.  Even under the 1979 regulations plans have not been submitted as they should. There may be great difficulties sometimes in getting local authorities to finalise plans.  There should be a reason for the local authorities to feel they have to make the plans in a prescribed time.</P>
      <P>Local authorities who fail to submit plans on time should publish the reasons in a newspaper which circulates in its area.  I take the Minister of State's point about the expense of advertising in newspapers.  A publication of the reasons in this case could take pages because the local authority may have many reasons for not having submitted its plan.  Government Departments often publish advertisements which cost money and the advertisements I propose in this regard may be more useful than an example I saw recently of a lengthy advertisement for Supreme Court and High Court judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> I seem to remember when we dealt with the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, only barristers were eligible to apply for positions in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  When I saw the advertisement and considered the number of people who are eligible to apply, I thought it was a great expense for the Department of Justice when the advertisement could have been handed out in the Law Library or posted to those not present there.  It was an enormous expense for the Department of Justice unless the public was being given an invitation to apply for those posts. While I realise we must be frugal as regards publication of names in newspapers, it might not be as expensive as the advertisements for judges in the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept these amendments.  The proposals seek to impose on the Minister an inappropriate supervisory and reporting function in relation to the actions of individual local authorities. This is at variance with the approach now being adopted on the function of local authorities and their relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency.  There is no precedent for such provision in relation to any obligation imposed on a local authority.  We must accept that local authorities are being given the duty to produce waste management plans, which some are already doing.  The expectation is that those plans will be produced within 12 or 18 months and that the obligation lies with the local authority.  The Minister cannot take control of local authorities in this way.  Under section 22 local authorities will be subject to a binding legal requirement to make waste management plans by such date as will be prescribed by the Minister.  It is important to accept that local authorities have a role to play and that they have obligations which are written into this Bill. The thrust of this Bill is not that a Minister will supervise and keep control.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister about local authorities.  I refer her to section 7, which states that &ldquo;The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or for the purpose of enabling any provision of this Act to have full effect.&rdquo;  That is some distance away from the aspiration expressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendments are reasonable.  I mentioned earlier the water quality management plan for the River Liffey in County Kildare.  I tabled an amendment in January 1994, but the discussion was adjourned.  We finally adopted it last Monday, two years later.  Under section 22 a waste management plan must be reviewed &ldquo;at least once in each period of 5 years after the date of making of the plan&rdquo;.  However, those obligations do not appear to have been met during the preparation of the county development plans and other similar planning proposals.  One of the papers laid before the House after Christmas dealt with the register of electors. County Kildare was given an extension of the time needed to prepare the electoral register.  An intervention was made in that regard, although it was less important than this legislation.  For that reason, I support the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister has said.  I have never been a member of a local authority so I would be slow to criticise them.  However, the spirit of local authorities is often willing but the flesh is weak when it comes to action.  Penalties are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the principle behind the amendment and I support the autonomy of local authorities in those areas where it is appropriate. However, the purpose of this legislation is to try to raise the national consciousness and to ensure that the provisions of this formidable legislation are implemented.  To suggest that if a local authority chooses to opt out it will be allowed to do so seems to be contrary <Col N="976" /> to the spirit of the legislation.  Section 22 (2) states that &ldquo;each local authority shall, not later than such date as may be prescribed . . . &rdquo;.  I presume it is prescribed by the Minister, therefore the Minister is already prescribing what local authorities should do under this legislation.  To say that if local authorities do not do this we will insist they do, seems to be subversive of the spirit of this legislation.  To state that a waste management plan shall be reviewed &ldquo;at least once in each period of 5 years after the date of making of the plan&rdquo;, but then to state that if local authorities do not make a plan in the first place we have other things to do, seems to be a contradiction which is subversive of the spirit of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendments do not go far enough.  What happens once they are reported by the Minister to both Houses?  Senator Henry mentioned circulating the list in the newspapers in the area.  That is a step in the right direction. However, if the Minister does not have the power under this legislation, for which she has expressed high hopes, to insist that it be implemented, it makes a mockery of the principle behind the legislation.  I support the amendments, but I would prefer if they had been stronger.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, although at the beginning I did not understand the need for it.  We talked earlier about imposing a possible £10 million fine.  It is easy to include something in legislation which someone else must pay.  I share the same concerns expressed by Senator Lee.  It seems that when we tell a local authority it has been naughty, we are mild about imposing a fine or authority.  If the Minister seriously considers this amendment, she will recognise the need for something along these lines.  If she is unable to accept it, perhaps she has an alternative option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain the <i>status quo</i> at present.  The Environmental Protection Agency has a <Col N="977" /> supervisory role in relation to local authorities and it also has considerable powers.  Section 63 (1) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, states:</P>
      <P>Where the Agency is of opinion that a local authority has failed to perform a statutory function of that authority in relation to environmental protection, or has performed that function in an unsatisfactory manner, the Agency may request a report within a specified period from the authority in relation to the matter and the local authority shall comply with the request.</P>
      <P>It also states:</P>
      <P>The Agency, having considered any report of the local authority may, with a view to ensuring the satisfactory performance of the function in question&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) issue such advice and recommendations to the local authority as it considers necessary, or</P>
      <P>(b) provide, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed, such assistance or support as the Agency considers, in consultation with the local authority concerned, would be helpful.</P>
      <P>That is the carrot, but there is also the stick.  Section 63 (3) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Where the Agency is of the opinion the response of the local authority to advice or recommendations issued or assistance or support offered under subsection (2) is inadequate for the purposes of environmental protection it may, without prejudice to any of its powers under this Act or any other enactment, direct the local authority to carry out, cause to be carried out, or arrange for, such action related to the function in question as the Agency considers necessary for the purposes of environmental protection within such period as may be specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> (b) Where a local authority fails without reasonable cause to comply with a direction under paragraph (a) the Agency shall carry out, cause to be carried out, or arrange for, such action related to the function in question as it considers necessary to ensure compliance with the direction and the costs of such action may be recovered by the Agency from the local authority as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has a supervisory function which is well defined in the Act and it would be most inefficient and ineffective to have a parallel system under which the Minister could also adopt a supervisory role. There will be a binding legal requirement as regards the time scale.  The Environmental Protection Agency has a supervisory role anyway in relation to the whole area of environmental protection and its relationship with local authorities is already defined.</P>
    <P>I accept the points which were made in relation to ensuring that local authorities live up to their obligations.  We have to trust them but perhaps we should not trust them absolutely.  There is a clearly defined procedure in relation to supervision which is reasonable &mdash; we do not want to overdo it.  I ask for that to be recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the Environmental Protection Agency's supervisory role is that this section has nothing to do with the agency.  In fact, the agency is only mentioned once in the section in relation to the hazardous waste plan, which is a separate issue as we are discussing the waste management plan.  This is a key section of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the fundamental issues is that if a local authority, for whatever reason, does not produce a plan the whole Bill is negatived.  We need to know that.  I refrained from going further than proposing a basic, minimum requirement that the Minister would, at least, inform <Col N="979" /> the Houses.  If any or all of the local authorities decided not to produce a waste management plan, there is precious little we could do about it.  There is no method by which we would know whether they had produced a plan.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I tabled is the basic minimum which is required &mdash; I did not go as far as Senator Henry is prepared to go in requiring it to be published in the media, which would involve some expense.  However, the expense of publishing notices every day in the newspapers would not be enormous. The argument put forward by the Minister of State is that the agency has a supervisory role in relation to the waste management plan.  However, as far as I can see, it has no role under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is essentially the same as that of Senator Daly.  I accept what the Minister of State said about the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, the obligations on local authorities and penalties.  However, I do not see the connection between what is in the Environmental Protection Agency legislation and this particular aspect of this legislation &mdash; the Minister of State has not established that conjunction to my satisfaction.  As far as I see it, they are two separate issues; the amendment should be accepted if they are two separate issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that proposition. On Second Stage, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, drew a clear distinction in regard to this section between the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in the area of national hazardous waste management and in the non-hazardous area.  Perhaps I misinterpreted him.  He stated that the Minister will have power to specify in detail the form and content of local authority plans, to require local authorities to coordinate their plans or to make joint plans.  Section 22 (3) states that two or more local authorities may jointly make a plan.  I was going to ask who decides whether they jointly make a plan, but <Col N="980" /> the Minister is saying here that he will have the power to require them to make joint plans or to vary a local authority plan.  The Minister clearly envisages a proactive role in that respect, if I am interpreting this correctly.  The amendment is in the spirit of that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister missed the point.  Under the proposed amendment, if a council has not complied with the rules and regulations as laid down by the Minister, that information would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A number of Senators are not members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have seen many Bills going through the House with sections almost identical to the amendment proposed by Senator Daly.  The Harbours Bill, which went through the House before Christmas, contains a provision that if the companies of the 12 or 13 harbours do not comply with the time prescribed, the Minister would lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A number of Bills contain a section with almost identical wording to that of the amendment, that is, if something was not done the relevant Minister would lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not see anything wrong with accepting the amendment as it was good enough for the Harbours Bill.  The wording was not identical but it stated &mdash; I remember it clearly because I read every word of that Bill &mdash; that failure to comply would result in the Minister laying it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Minister of State cannot accept this amendment because its intent is to give information to Members of these Houses.  Local authorities tend to drag these matters out.  If they looked after their waste we would not have this Bill today and there would be no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points which have been made.  The Environmental Protection Agency has a supervisory role in this regard as waste management is part of environmental <Col N="981" /> protection.  I have already outlined its powers under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, which is already in place.  We need to clarify that such powers include waste management.  A specific point in relation to hazardous waste is included in this Bill.  For Senator Lee's benefit, I wish to point out that, of course, the Minister has a proactive role in the sense of bringing forward the best legislation possible, but not the supervisory role envisaged in this amendment.</P>
      <P>The example of the Harbours Bill was raised.  I am not aware of an authority in that field which is equivalent to the Environmental Protection Agency.  We have an established agency with specific powers and a specific relationship with local authorities.  Its powers are extremely strong when it comes to ensuring local authorities live up to their requirements for environmental protection. The Act under which the agency operates includes this aspect of potential delay.</P>
      <P>If the Senators wish, I will look at it again and return to it on Report Stage. However, I want to underline that we must get out of the old modes of thinking. Environmental protection is established now on a rather different basis to that of the past.  It is not simply a pure relationship between the Minister and local authorities.  There is a dedicated agency dealing with this area and we must ensure it has the powers which it has, and that it receives recognition for its supervisory role.  If the amendment resolves a problem, I will bring it back but I ask Senators to consider what I have said.  I am concerned that we may be duplicating rather than being efficient in introducing legislation.</P>

      <P>I too urge the Minister to do this.  I am happy to accept what <Col N="982" /> she has said up to a point.  The other Minister may have gone over the top in the language I quoted earlier but I will not hold that against him.  I was concerned whether local authorities had the technical expertise at their disposal to do the ambitious planning intended here or if they might have legitimate reasons, in the context of their current expertise, for delaying.  I would not necessarily call those legitimate reasons but there may be such reasons for not conforming rapidly, which is why one would like to see what date the Minister has in mind in the phrase &ldquo;not later than such date as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  What lead-in time does she intend to allow for local authorities?</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is prepared to take this back because I wish to emphasise another aspect.  We are always engaged here in an educational process for all of us, whether we are Members or the public outside.  Publicity and an indication of the earnestness and seriousness with which the Oireachtas takes this legislation are therefore crucial. One way to ensure that is to require dereliction to be reported &mdash; not necessarily by the Minister, if the problem is that he or she is getting in between the agency and the local authorities.  There should be the best possible opportunity for public knowledge of what is happening &mdash; or, in this case, what might not be happening &mdash; in order to stress to everyone the importance we all lay on this aspect of Irish life.</P>

      <P>I accept it does need consideration.  As regards funding, financial assistance of £1.5 million is available to local authorities in developing these plans.  The local authority in my county has been effective in drawing in expertise to prepare an elaborate plan &mdash; not without political knots, tangles and confrontation but it is the role of local authorities to take difficult decisions.  I take the point that information should be accessible.  I will take the matter to the Department and bring it back on Report Stage.  It may be possible to provide the information without <Col N="983" /> the difficulty of duplication.  May I also say this is an educational process for Ministers too.</P>

      <P>I was anxious when the Minister said at the outset that the expectation was that all these things would happen.  There is a joke about the difference between expectation and reality &mdash; I do not intend to tell it here but in this situation expectations are not good enough.  We need the reality of what will be written into this section because it is one of the key provisions of the Bill.  If subsection (5) says that before a plan is prepared, notice must be given in the media, I cannot understand why there is not a routine follow up.  In other words, if it is announced in the media that the local authority intends to prepare a waste management plan, the least it could do is to announce when the plan has been prepared and that it is open for inspection.  We have put many things back this afternoon and I am worried that if we keep postponing decisions we will minimise the impact of the legislation and people will fear we are not serious about it.  I wish to press this amendment.</P>

It is reasonable to adopt my approach of looking at the points made here and bringing this back on Report Stage.  That is the procedure and I hope the Senator will be co-operative in that regard.

      <P>In page 28, subsection (7), between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) the availability and unavailability of facilities for the reception of industrial waste;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment tries to be helpful.  In planning decisions on bringing industry into areas, problems often arise about whether facilities exist for the waste from such industry.  I put down this amendment because if the plan states there are or are not such facilities for industrial waste, it would save a great deal of time for the IDA, industries which wish to locate in the area and local people who might wish to entice industries.  There would be no waste of time or protests about planning for industrial waste, as is happening in Senator Daly's area at present, if there had already been a waste management plan setting out whether facilities were or were not available for the disposal of industrial waste.</P>

      <P>In accordance with this provision local authorities will be required to identify available facilities for the recovery or disposal of all types of non-hazardous waste, whether of municipal, commercial, agricultural or industrial origin and to determine which other facilities may be required over the lifetime of the plan.  Local authorities will also be required to have regard to the provisions of the plan prepared by the agency under section 26 in relation to hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>The full spectrum of waste is already included and this amendment would be an example of duplication. Therefore, I ask the Senator to recognise there is already a requirement in that section that covers her concern.</P>

      <P>I assume it would fall to Kildare County Council to prepare a waste management plan in respect of the dump in Kill although it might be operated by Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation. There are provisions in the Bill that allow local authorities to produce joint efforts but in the instance of one local authority operating a dump in another's jurisdiction, which would be its effect, who would prepare the waste plan or consider the facilities?  While I realise it is a specific question and it may be a little invidious of me to raise it with the Minister under this section, nevertheless it is relevant.</P>

The real emphasis and effort of the Bill will be on section 22 (6) (a).  Are all the paragraphs of this subsection of equal importance or will we first put our energy into section 22 (6) (a) and so on?</P>
      <P>One aspect of section 22 (6) (c) that worries me &mdash; and it also comes up in the Third Schedule &mdash; is incineration. Some people would say that incineration causes pollution.  I hope the individual paragraphs in section 22 will be taken in order of priority.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Henry and hope the paragraphs in section 22 (6) will be prioritised.  Can the Minister indicate how effective section 22 (6) will be without specific targets?  Fingal County Council produced a waste management plan almost two years ago and, while it reads well, there are no real specific targets for waste reduction, recycling and reuse. The spirit of this legislation, and specifically section 22 (6), could be lost unless the Minister defines targets.  Local authority managers will argue strenuously that the targets we suggest are unobtainable. Unless the Minister defines these <Col N="987" /> targets, the local authorities will not make any significant attempt to reduce the amount of waste produced.</P>

      <P>As regards the plan, Kildare County Council would be responsible for the provision of facilities within its boundaries.  Section 22 (7) (d) reads:</P>
      <P>the type and quantity of waste which the local authority or authorities concerned expect to be transported into, or out of, its or their functional area or areas for recovery or disposal during the relevant period;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There are difficulties with waste management and I do not underestimate them.</P>
      <P>On the point of setting priorities and targets, while the top of the list would be of prime importance, each aspect is part of the overall strategy.  The Government has made it clear that its concern is to reach certain recycling targets, look at reducing waste and ensure the minimum amount of waste ends up in landfill sites.  However, most of the arguments are not about recycling but landfill sites.  We must ensure that each element of the waste management plan is given the importance it requires. There is always the danger of putting the difficult questions aside and deal only with those that are attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the question of target setting to a point but it is the job of the local authority to take up that function.  They have demanded extra powers and greater control over their geographic areas for many years.  In my view, a local authority is the best authority to judge achievable targets.  It is one thing to set <Col N="988" /> targets for Fingal County Council but it is another to set for Laois/Offaly which has a largely rural based population and where recycling is not as easy to organise. Setting a blanket target across the country would not be appropriate and local authorities are in the best possible position to know the level it can strive to achieve within the larger framework of the national recycling strategy. Knowing where we can set that target is difficult but it is the function of a local authority to understand and know how far it can go.  There is a major difference in dealing with a rural population and a highly urbanised one as regards recycling and that has to be recognised. The role of a local authority is fundamental in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this is being helpful to the Minister or to Senator Henry but on the whole this is not just an important Bill; it is actually a good Bill.  There is an internal logic in the particular sequence which Senator Henry listed.  I recollect Minister Howlin stressing, although I cannot remember in which rhetorical manifestation, that there was a logical sequence to these four steps on the ladder.  To be fair to the Minister, that should be stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have become so enthusiastic about this that I think I will put down an amendment on Report Stage to insert the words &ldquo;in this order of priority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says up to a point.  But my own experience in Dublin, where the bulk of the waste problem exists, is that local authority management have had to be dragged screaming to even confront the issue of recycling.  We have had debate after debate about the levels of recycling which could be achieved.  At one stage the Kerbside scheme, which is popular and works well in Dublin, was about to be dropped because it is an expensive way to deal with waste. However, the reality today is that dealing with waste is expensive.  Local authority  <Col N="989" /> management told members it was expensive because there were no markets for the paper and cans at one stage, that it is that kind of market.  You can either succeed in having the waste dealt with by some of these firms which want paper, or they decide they do not want it.  At one point the Kerbside operation was collecting segregated waste but there was no market for it and it was then brought in trucks to the landfill dumps.</P>
      <P>This is the reality.  That is why I say this is a good Bill and I want the House to strengthen its provisions.  It is not that I do not believe that the Minister's intentions and those of the Members are good, but it is specifically because I want to see an end to the continuing battles about landfill sites.  Mulhuddart, which is my electoral ward, was the focus of the recent An Bord Pleanála decision not to allow a dump to be sited there.  That was a battle royal, just like the situation in Kill, County Kildare. We must force local authorities to achieve objectives and re-educate people even in rural areas &mdash; and I am not really sure why it is so fundamentally different in rural as opposed to urban areas except that in urban areas there is a mass of houses to be dealt with &mdash; that cardboard, bottles, cans, etc. must be transported to the nearest recycling bank.</P>
      <P>From my experience, I think the legislation is good, but I know what will happen at management level.  There are no specified targets so they will tinker around with it and do what they feel compelled to do, but they will not take on board the thrust of the Bill.  The Bill does not set targets and, as with any Bill, unless targets are set, management will say, for example, that they have a recycling scheme for 20,000 houses and there is a place at the dump for oil, etc. The Minister must force local authorities to comply in order to achieve the objectives of this Bill, and I say that as a member of a local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Have local authorities already gone ahead with waste management <Col N="990" /> plans which pre-empt this Bill?  If they have, it is wrong.  I will speak about this on another section of the Bill which affects Kerry County Council, where I believe it is not adhering to the provisions of the Bill.  That local authority is proceeding under different rules and regulations with regard to transfer stations and I am amazed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We will probably move towards setting targets.  With regard to the national recycling strategy, we have already set a target of 20 per cent of commercial and domestic waste, with which I am sure Members are familiar. I am concerned that realistic targets are set and that they match the reality on the ground.  This Bill is helpful to local authority members who are facing the reality of recycling, recovery and landfill disposal sites.  Senator McGennis hoped there would be no more battles.  The question of providing landfill sites is a difficult political issue and no Bill in the world will address that political reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It will always be the case. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We must ensure that many people's concerns and anxieties are addressed but I suppose that is a separate issue again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to prioritisation, Senator Lee made the point about there being a kind of logic in that it is a sequence of steps.  I want to bring to Senators' attention that in the section on waste prevention, that is section 28 (2) (a), the Bill stipulates &ldquo;A person who carries on any activity of an agricultural, commercial or industrial nature (including the manufacture of any product) shall have due regard to the need to prevent or minimise the production of waste from that activity and, as the case may be, from any product manufactured by him or her as a result . . .&rdquo;.  So the message is reinforced in the Bill in relation to prevention.  As I say, all the elements must be included, because it is clear that the issue of landfill sites is a difficult one <Col N="991" /> and one which must be taken on board by waste management plans.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked about the preparation of plans.  Local authorities have started to draw up plans in some cases.  Obviously, this Bill will apply to them as it applies to anybody else, but I feel we should not be knocking local authorities for having taken the initiative because the difficulty is more likely to be with local authorities which have not looked closely at the need for waste management.  If the initiative has been taken to start the process, it should be commended because it is one of the major local issues which must be addressed.  The European Community's waste regulations of 1979 require each local authority to prepare a waste plan indicating the type and quantity of waste for disposal, the general technical requirements, suitable disposal sites and any special arrangements for particular wastes.  That probably puts the matter in context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Minister.  I am mindful of the environment and would be totally in favour of the Bill.  If some county councils have gone ahead with their own rules or rules which have existed to date and the Minister and the agency have not been notified, this Bill will involve separate rules by which they should be governed. This is where my difficulty lies.  The procedures for lodging an objection under this Bill, which is a good one and I commend it, are totally different to those in the old legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to make a big issue of it, but Kerry County Council plans a waste transfer dump for a site which is 50 yards from my house and against the wall of a hospital in Dingle, County Kerry.  The county council will place a notice in the newspaper for four consecutive weeks, then there will be four weeks in which to object, it will go before Kerry County Council which will vote on the matter and that will be the end of it.  They are doing all of this in spite of the fact that a private individual <Col N="992" /> received planning permission from Kerry County Council over a month ago for the same development on a site two miles outside Dingle which is miles away from houses.</P>
    <P>We discussed money with Deputy Allen.  There seems to be enough money for this rigmarole and advertising, but the county manager and the man in charge of refuse told me there is room for only one transfer station in Dingle. I cannot understand why they are going ahead so fast.  In view of what this legislation will do, they should hold their fire because there is no great hurry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have already made plans, as required by law. This Bill expands and strengthens the functions of local authorities in relation to planning and requires the making of new update plans.  As a result of this Bill, we will ultimately have waste management plans which are far more comprehensive and deal with the issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 30, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Any person may within a period of 21 days make an objection to the Minister in relation to a plan.</P>
      <P>(6)  Any objection shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) be made in writing,</P>
      <P>(ii) state the name and address of the objector,</P>
      <P>(iii) state the subject matter of the objection,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> (iv) state the full grounds of objection and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.</P>
    <P>(7)  Any objection shall be accompanied by such documents, particulars and any other information relating to the objection as the objector considers necessary or appropriate.</P>
    <P>(8)  A person making an objection may request an oral hearing of the objection.</P>
    <P>(9)  Where a request is made for an oral hearing of an objection the Minister shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing and the Minister shall give notice in writing of that decision to the applicant and the authority or authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Minister having considered any such objection or oral hearing may require a local authority or, as the case may be, two or more local authorities to very (whether by addition or deletion) a Waste Management Plan made by it or them in such a manner as the Minister may specify or to replace the plan by a new Waste Management Plan.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This legislation places some heavy and onerous responsibilities and obligations on local authorities, businesses and individuals. In a situation like this it is only correct and proper that we give people who may be aggrieved by a plan an opportunity to raise their fears, objections or concerns after they have raised them with the authority and the Minister. This amendment provides that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that a local authority shall give people an opportunity to make observations or comments on a proposed or varied plan within a specified time limit.  However, if those who make the objections are dissatisfied with the outcome of the representation, they <Col N="994" /> do not get a further opportunity to have the matter discussed by a superior authority.</P>
    <P>I am proposing the addition of some new subsections to provide that a person who has a problem with a plan as announced and who is not satisfied with the outcome of their discussion with the local authority can supply their documentation and objections to the Minister. I have set out how that would be done.  It would be in writing, include the name and address of the objector and state the subject matter of the objection. It would also state the full grounds of the objection and the reasons they are putting it forward.  This would be submitted to the Minister within a specified time and the Minister would have the authority to consider the objections. The Minister could also direct that there be an oral hearing of the matter.  After he has had the opportunity to consider the representation and the oral hearing he would then be in a position to direct the local authority to make further alterations or to draft a new plan.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to further strengthen the rights of the individuals who would be to some extent affected, some seriously and others not so seriously.  At least they would have an opportunity to voice their concerns directly to the Minister, who could take account of the legitimate concerns expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment for reasons I have already outlined. There should be some procedure, such as that provided in the amendment, whereby a person, persons or group could make their views known to the Minister directly, after the council has made its decision.  There is nothing in the Bill which gives that power to a person.  A decision will be made by the local authority on a waste management plan and that seems to be the end of it. One can make objections to the council, but it ends there.  It should go further, because over the years councils have been the worst offenders in terms of planning buildings.  There should be a <Col N="995" /> higher authority with the power to overrule the council, and individuals or groups should have the opportunity to make their objections known at a higher level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment.  It attempts to make local democracy more meaningful, which was the stated wish of all Members of this House and the relevant Minister during the debate on the Local Government (Dublin) Bill which introduced limited local government reform.  There is a belief among the public that local government is very remote, even though it is the form of democracy closest to people.</P>
      <P>Reading the explanatory memorandum on the section reminded me of a well known business person and developer in Dublin who is reputed to have said &ldquo;We will hold the public inquiry and then we will build the road.&rdquo;  It suggests that we will go through the procedures but it does not matter what the public has to say about the waste management plan.  It will proceed as though there had never been any objections received.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly's amendment is very worthwhile.  It is almost a copy of the planning procedure whereby interested parties have a right to make their views known to the local authority.  The decision of the local authority can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  There is a mistrust in the community and that is a shame.  However, particularly in the area of waste management, there is a feeling that the local authority will proceed regardless of local feeling.</P>
      <P>I may be repeating something that has already been discussed.  Is the making of the waste management plan an executive or reserved function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On that latter point, the reserve aspect is dealt with in section 22 (10), which states:</P>
      <P>The making, review, variation or replacement of a waste management plan shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment.  It does no more than bring this legislation in line with general planning law and general planning practice.  When drawing up a county development plan, there is a procedure whereby people can make objections. One has a public hearing on a motorway scheme.  This is just as environmentally important as the construction of a motorway.  The single biggest effect this would have would be to allay public fear that all these decisions are being made in an abstract vacuum and that people do not have a direct input.</P>
      <P>The section says that written representations in relation to the proposed plan may be made within a period and will be taken into consideration.  They may well be taken into consideration and then rejected, and because of that there must be some appeals procedure such as the reasonable one outlined in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I support the idea of an oral hearing, such as that outlined in a county development plan, where people can make an oral presentation.  This is required from the point of view of consistency and to make sure the public is assured that these decisions are not being imposed on them.  The general perception is that such decisions are being made in a vacuum without any public input.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that decisions on locating landfill sites are emotive and people frequently feel that such decisions are made without any reference to their needs or their legitimate concerns.  There is an obligation to listen to what appropriate organisations have to say.  When we debated the National Heritage Council Bill we tried to include people in the protection of the environment, and from that point of view this amendment makes sense.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of public unease about this matter.  In terms of reassuring public consciousness that justice is being done and being seen to be done, it is desirable that procedures should be incorporated to reinforce a feeling of confidence in everything underlying this legislation.</P>

      <P>The amendment refers to a person making &ldquo;an objection to the Minister in relation to a plan&rdquo;, but is this the whole plan or just a section of it?  What does Senator Daly mean by that?  I will paint a scenario for him. When the local authority draws up the plan, individual A decides he does not like it, objects to it, and the plan is revised.  However, another individual then has the right to lodge an objection to the revised plan so the plan might never be implemented because a series of individuals play hopscotch with it.</P>
      <P>There may be conflicting views also. For example, in my county council area a plan to put a dump in Slieve Phelim has been objected to by many people.  If the county manager put that into a waste management plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would have the support of people in the west of the county who, at the moment, take the bulk of the county's refuse.  Therefore, people west of the River Maigue will support it. A number of locations could be suggested in the plans for the siting of a major dump and the local people would object to it wherever it was proposed to locate it.</P>
      <P>Does Senator Daly see any time limit applying to objections in such a case or would everybody have the right to object to the plan or the amended plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Senator Kelly's point, I expect a lot of representations will be made in connection with the plan.  In the first place, representations will be made to the local authority, and this is provided for.  What is not provided for is a situation where no <Col N="998" /> account is taken of the representations, and people feel aggrieved.  There may be 30 or 40 applications and that is why I put in a time limit.  It will be done within a few weeks but we can shorten that to ten days if necessary to make it more effective and efficient.</P>
      <P>If the representation does not get results there will still be an opportunity to speak to the Minister about it by way of an oral hearing.  We have oral hearings every day of the week on social welfare claims, but there would be nothing like that number of claims in this area.</P>
      <P>The section appears to provide an opportunity for people to make representations to a local authority when the plan is being prepared.  Nevertheless it does not give them any satisfaction if, for instance, a local authority simply takes note of their views.  They would then have no further recourse to an appeals process.</P>
      <P>That is not the case in other sections of the Bill where an elaborate mechanism is built in to deal with situations where people are dissatisfied.  Senators will have noticed the similarity between what I am proposing and what appears later in the Bill's provision for management licences.  It is taken from the Minister's Bill so I cannot see why he would have any objection.  I will be proposing a similar amendment in relation to the hazardous waste plan.</P>
      <P>There are a few simple issues in this Bill which include the preparation of local authority plans and the preparation of a national plan.  However, it falls down because there is no provision in the Bill for people with legitimate grievances that are documented and supported nor is there any such facility to assure people their views are being taken into account in the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment, although I am sure it could be tightened up.  There is a similar provision in section 10 already and there could be a combination of that and what the Minister has already proposed.  I will press this amendment which is fundamental <Col N="999" /> to the choice of people in a local authority area to appeal to the Minister and their right to be heard.  The final decision will rest with the Minister who has the final decision in the Bill anyway.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to what Senator Daly has said.  However, at the end of his amendment it states that the Minister may specify that the plan must be changed or may &ldquo;replace the plan by a new waste management plan&rdquo;.  Would an objector then be in a position, as Senator Kelly mentioned, to object to that plan within 21 days?  If the Minister said that yet another plan must be produced, could Senator Daly's amendment allow someone else to object to that plan within a further 21 days?</P>

      <P>An important point must be made in relation to this amendment. We have to be serious about local democracy.  If we draw up a framework that ultimately means decisions will be made by the Minister, we are failing local democracy.  That is what this amendment proposes, so Senators should consider it seriously.</P>
      <P>The question of whether this is a reserved function gets to the core of the matter.  It is a reserved function and we have to be serious about giving power to local public representatives.  We must not pay lip service to the idea but say that this is a function that local public representatives have and are being entrusted with.  Obviously, if local public representatives fail to meet their obligations there has to be a fall back position which, as Senator Henry indicated, is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>By accepting this amendment we are in effect saying that we do not trust local public representatives and that people may object directly to the Minister. There is a genuine concern among all political parties about the lack of local democracy.  We must ensure that when legislation is introduced the principle of subsidiarity is at its core.  If subsidiary does not mean anything, we do not need to elaborate on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> I am concerned about an amendment which rolls back legislation.  A parallel was made with the planning process.  We have moved away from this solution in planning legislation because people were not satisfied with a Minister having such authority and An Bord Pleanála was established.  We require an established principle that local democracy determines issues as far as is practicable. There is always a safeguard if local democracy does not function and people do not take decisions.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this amendment puts in place a structure which takes away from the status of local public representatives and their right to make decisions.  This will undermine local democracy rather than protect, it as the Senator said.  I ask that Members see the amendment in this light.  We are framing legislation in the context of a commitment to local democracy and subsidiarity. We are moving away from centralisation, where people do not have a say at local level.  We must look at this in that context.  There is a safeguard in the Bill and it would be detrimental to take local democracy out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with what the Minister said about local democracy.  However, I do not see an inconsistency between keeping a reserve function and allowing local democracy and a system of appeal.  I am prepared to concede that if one looks at the totality of the amendment, particularly the last part, there is a tendency towards centralisation.  The principle is still correct and there should be a system to consider an appeal and to hold an oral hearing.  As I said, this exists in the case of the county development plans, and members of county councils have heard people make oral presentations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in that I have heard many county councillors talk about the need to devolve more powers. However, when Kildare County Council was confronted with a decision about hackney and taxi licences nobody wanted to take that difficult decision.  I <Col N="1001" /> am at one with the Minister in that if we want more powers, we must be prepared to make difficult as well as easy decisions.  I do not see an inconsistency between wanting to do something locally, subsidiarity and an appeals system.</P>

      <P>Kerry County Council wants to build a recycling plant in Dingle and it will make the decision to do so.  A private individual wants to do the same thing two miles away in a far better location.  However, he must go through the planning process.  Although he has already received planning permission for his development, people have the opportunity to appeal that decision to An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister is saying that people have the right to object to the private individual, but that they do not have the right to object to what Kerry County Council wants to build in a built up area against a hospital wall and 20 feet from houses that do bed and breakfast.</P>
      <P>I do not have the right to lodge an objection with An Bord Pleanála about Kerry County Council's proposal. Although the private individual has received planning permission from Kerry County Council, he must wait three to six months.  Is that democracy? That is why I support this amendment. We must remember that private companies collect more waste than the councils and they must abide the strict rules.  People have the right to object to such developments, but they cannot object to a local authority development under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Once An Bord Pleanála rules on something, that is the end of the matter. Therefore, what Senator Kelly said was somewhat nonsensical.  This Bill must take account of the rights of people to object to council proposals.  The structure in Dingle is almost 100 feet high, but I can only write to the county manager and to the council to object.  I visited three private sites which were kept extremely clean, although there was a problem with vermin.  However, I have no rights under this legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister.  The reason I asked about this being a reserved function is that it strengthens local democracy.  There is a further problem, and Senator Dardis may agree with me on this.  We adopted a waste management plan about which people in Kildare were not overly happy.  We had to go through the planning process to get permission for the dump in Kill.  If we want to provide a landfill site within an administrative area, then local authority members must make a decision.  All local authority members want more functions except in relation to halting sites and landfill tips with which they do not want to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Our manager decided to give that function to the corporation, although the members have decided to take it on themselves.  They will probably be sorry afterwards.</P>
      <P>In the case of Kill, the local authority applied to the planning authority in County Kildare and people had the right to object and to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  However, unless one has a lot of money, one has no influence, regardless of subsidiarity or the devolvement of powers.  I have seen this in my constituency. In Mulhuddart business people came up with the money to fight that case.  Even before An Bord Pleanála, one is very much at a disadvantage unless one has qualified planning consultants, barristers and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the local authority's waste management plan extends into another local authority area the concepts of local democracy, reserved function and subsidiarity do not work.  It can be honestly said that it suited the four Dublin local authorities to dump their rubbish in Kildare.  They took no account of the feelings of the people in Kildare.  Unless there is a system whereby people who want to object to that type of decision by a local authority can do so without spending huge amounts of money, there is no local democracy and local accountability. As things stand, it would be <Col N="1003" /> worthwhile having a look at how An Bord Pleanála works.  My own experience is that where there are big corporations and small communities the small communities will not win unless they have plenty of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by the Minister of State. However, it is hard to discuss section 23 without taking account of section 24. The Minister has the power under section 24 to direct the county council to scrap its plan and produce a new one. I am endeavouring to cater for the local community or local people who have grievances and objections.  The Minister is paying lip service to them in this section.  The Minister has included a provision which appears to give them some input into the procedure. However, no account need ever be taken of their input.  If no account is taken of their input under section 23, they have nowhere else to go.  The Minister still has somewhere to go because he or she can direct the county council to vary the plan, produce a different plan or produce a new one.  What I am proposing refers to the powers the Minister has in section 24.  That could probably have been deleted had the Minister of State accepted the other amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to look carefully at what is proposed.  It is a mechanism whereby the local community would have an opportunity to make its input between the local authority <Col N="1004" /> and the Minister.  One certainly would not wish to see an ongoing appeal procedure; this would be a once off procedure whereby within 21 days of the plan being published the local community would have an opportunity to state its case within a specified time. The Minister, if required to do so, has the absolute right to decide whether to have an oral hearing and objectors would have the opportunity at such a hearing to put their points of view.  At the end of the day, the power which is already in section 24 would come into play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be useful to define the differences that exist between the Planning Act and what is proposed here.  If one applies for planning permission one does so to the local authority. It is not a reserved function whether the planning permission will be granted.  People have the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which is a change from past procedures where the Minister was involved.  That power was taken away and vested in An Bord Pleanála. When a local authority draws up a development plan it is a reserved function and, in the same way as this plan is a reserved function which has a certain safeguard at the back of it, the development plan procedure has a similar safeguard in relation to the Minister intervening if necessary.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Minister are clear. Senator McGennis made a good point that people with wealth are able to have a great deal of influence at oral hearings. That is not to say that wealth is necessarily the factor that determines decisions.  However, it is an advantage if one can afford to have senior counsel, planning experts, architects and so forth.  It enables some people to use the oral hearing to great advantage.  It is not in itself a perfect system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a waste management plan.  The nearest equivalent in the planning area is the development plan. Local representatives come together representing the best interests of their community to determine policy.  If we <Col N="1005" /> include an amendment which obliges them to run to the Minister, it will be the Minister who will determine policy. That is not desirable.  It does not reflect the genuine wishes of the political parties and independent Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about what happened subsequent to Luggala.  I was involved in that matter and there was concern, because until that decision was made there was no procedure with regard to developments carried out by local authorities or State bodies.  The public consultation procedure is now in place.  With regard to the waste management plan, there is a consultation procedure in place.  It was improved when it was debated on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The consultation procedure is knitted into the entire process.  If, for example, a decision about a landfill site is made democratically and as a result of consulting with and including people in the formulation of the plan, there is still the EIS procedure to go through. People are also familiar with that procedure. There are safeguards in place.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, if people go badly astray and if local representatives do not do what they are obliged to do, the Minister can require two or more local authorities to jointly draw up a waste management plan.  The Minister has that authority if there is a difficulty between two counties.  The Minister can:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> require the making of waste management plans, whether under subsection (2) or (3) of section 22, by two or more local authorities be co-ordinated in such manner and in relation to such matters as the Minister may specify, and</P>
    <P>(c) require a local authority or, as the case may be, two or more local authorities, to vary (whether by addition or by deletion) a waste management plan made by it or them in such manner as the Minister may specify or to replace the plan by a new waste management plan,</P>
    <P>That surely is enough of a role for a Minister if we are serious about ensuring that planning and policy are based on the principle of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>I accept the Senators' good intentions and I do not wish to cut across them. However, if we provide that the procedure is simply a step for the council in order to get to the Minister and hold an oral hearing, it is dishonouring the whole purpose of local democracy. Under this Bill the public is to be consulted before the plan is drawn up.  That is important.  At the end of that part of the process it is the elected public representatives who determine the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to formulate a policy to counteract the growing trends where satellite television channels demand exclusive rights for sporting events, some of which are staged in Ireland, which in view of the development of paid TV could lead to individual payment being demanded for events such as the All Ireland Finals or Soccer Internationals.</P>
      <P>There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about the Minister being in the House.  He has been here twice in succeeding weeks to discuss matters of mutual interest and I again welcome him.  This motion is timely and, like all on this side of the House, I will be interested in the Minister's response.</P>
      <P>It is an indication of the rapid advance of television technology that five years ago this issue would not have been discussed.  The British Broadcasting Act, 1990, makes no mention of subscriber television, although it includes a section protecting sporting or other events of national interest from what is known as pay per view television, which was at the time perceived as a threat to terrestrial or land based TV.</P>
      <P>The merging of Sky television and British satellite broadcasting in the mid-1990s accelerated the advance of satellite TV.  Today Mr. Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite station is on the threshold of achieving a near monopoly of major sporting events in western Europe, especially on these islands.  This development poses a serious challenge to Irish broadcasting.</P>
      <P>A new system of television delivery is less than two years away with the advent of digital TV.  A report in <i>The Observer</i> of 19 November 1995 stated:</P>
      <P>At the touch of a button you will soon be able to control how you see live sporting events.  Imagine being able to follow your favourite golfer around a course, to watch any football game being played that day, or even to view a grand prix from inside one of the leading cars. . . all during live broadcasts.  This is all going to be possible thanks to digital television.</P>
      <P>Live sport on television as we know it today will become as outdated as the old gramophone records.  Sky television has signed digital satellite contracts for enough capacity to broadcast more than 100 channels.  Some 500 channels will become available after satellites earmarked for digital transmission are launched this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently most sporting events purchased by Sky television are subscriber based but this new technology will allow the system known as pay per view to be established on these islands.  This arrangements is where viewers pay to watch a specific event as opposed to <Col N="1009" /> subscribing to the entire channel's output, as is currently the case with the Sky Sports package.  Pay per view TV is already a proven success in the United States which pioneered the concept.  It dominates world championship boxing matches and generates massive profits for companies such as Home Box Office.  This is mainly due to the high access cost which in America is on average about £15 per sporting event. However, with the arrival of digital television and the resultant large number of channels available, viewers in this country are likely to pay as little as £1 to £1.50 to watch a football match.  The problem which will face RTE, and TV3 when it comes on air, is how they will be able to compete in the market with the massive resources available to Sky television.</P>
    <P>We have been well served by RTE television in its coverage of major sporting events.  However, due to its dominant position, RTE, like its sister stations in Britain &mdash; BBC and ITV &mdash; has been getting sporting events cheaply. It was this consideration that motivated the English football Premier League and the cricket authorities to negotiate substantial financial contracts with Sky television.  The deal cost Sky £250 million at 1992 prices and will be renegotiated in 1997.  Rumour has it that Rupert Murdoch will have more than £600 million available for football rights in 1997.  As a source in BSkyB put it, &ldquo;It is an open chequebook&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A recent example was the decision last year by Sky TV to compete with the European Broadcasting Union, of which RTE is a member, for the rights to transmit the Olympic games in Atlanta this summer.  As a result of Sky's arrival at the bargaining table the EBU significantly increased its original financial offer, although the final decision to award the final contract to the EBU was taken as a matter of policy rather than on financial considerations.  The Olympic movement believed the greatest possible number of people should have TV access to the greatest sporting <Col N="1010" /> event in the world, and I am sure we concur with that view.</P>
    <P>We propose that the Government introduces legislation to protect a specific number of sporting or other events of national interest from satellite TV, that is, subscriber or pay-per-view channels. These events would include all the GAA national finals, rugby and athletic finals and other national sporting events or events of national interest which the Minister of the day would deem suitable for inclusion on a scheme of listed events.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusion about the difficulties the Minister will face in framing legislation preventing sporting organisations in this country from entering into lucrative financial deals with satellite television.  It has been argued plausibly that the massive sums of money made available to British football and cricket has resulted in an impressive improvement in sporting structures.  It has been argued also that more money is available for the development of sport than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have hardly fallen over themselves to provide the necessary resources for the development of sport.  It has rarely been on the list of priorities when allocating budgets. The pilfering &mdash; I use the term advisedly &mdash; of the national lottery funds originally earmarked for sport and diverted to other things has not gone down well with sporting bodies. One can hardly blame our sporting organisations if they find the prospect of massive injections of funds in return for TV rights an attractive option.  It is a powerful argument and one which, as a lover of sport, I find persuasive.</P>
    <P>However, we must address the question of whether we are prepared to deny the majority access to major sporting events and other events of national interest.  Despite the huge financial advantages that will accrue to the relevant sporting organisations, it would be detrimental to the long-term development of sport.  I have no wish to deny major sporting organisations, such as the GAA, the freedom to negotiate <Col N="1011" /> TV rights, which will form a significant proportion of their annual income in years to come, irrespective of what TV station negotiates those rights.  My colleague, Senator Wall, will concur that within the GAA there is a growing body of opinion which would be attracted to a significant financial inducement from a TV company.  Whether that body of opinion would be in the majority or the minority is a question for another day.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about permitting the continuance of an environment in which terrestrial Irish based TV channels, such as RTE and TV3, will not have the resources to compete with the huge sums available to satellite television. The removal of major sporting events from our local station will reduce viewing audiences and, given that sport has always held and will continue to hold the anchor role in devising TV schedules, this would have serious implications for the viability of stations, particularly RTE, which will rely increasingly on the Government to give it the necessary financial resources to compete effectively.  If the viewers are denied access to major sporting events on the national public broadcasting service they will seek their television viewing elsewhere.  The resulting drop in audiences and advertising revenue will put an intolerable burden on the Exchequer to bail out RTE.</P>
    <P>These are the challenges posed.  I do not have a monopoly of wisdom in this matter.  Now is the time to address the problems, rather than wait for developments to come on stream more rapidly than might be envisaged, in order to protect the vast majority who have no wish to buy a satellite dish or pay extra money to subscription TV channels and who certainly have no wish to pay each time they wish to watch a sporting event.  The Minister should address their concerns and, considering his track record, I have every confidence he will have the wisdom of Solomon and produce a solution acceptable to all.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus ba mhaith liom freisin cuidiú leis an rún.  Senator Mooney has outlined clearly the problems that television technology will present.  It will be a sad day if people who are not in a position to travel to a GAA All Ireland final or some other sporting event, cannot watch it on local television.  If we do not take action RTE will become redundant, because there will be little need for it if we allow monopolies such as Sky TV to take over our sports programming.  Sports programmes are central to schedules and if we do not have the coverage we may as well not have a local television station.</P>
      <P>I am sure other European countries will agree with Ireland that there is a need to preserve their national identities and national sports and show them on their local television stations.  If Sky can buy out the GAA or Irish soccer, RTE will not be able to compete in the market.  A law must be introduced whereby RTE will have a right to show sports, as it has done since it came on air and as radio did beforehand.  When Micheál O'Hehir came on the radio it was the first time the excitement of GAA and the All Ireland finals was brought to many rural parishes.  Only a very few could afford to go to Dublin for the games.  It would be a great pity if generations to come were to be denied that excitement.</P>
      <P>The issue is a minefield and it may well take the wisdom of Solomon to cross it.  The satellite companies have to have a base in the country and we may thus have a way of controlling them and ensuring RTE can continue to give good coverage of sport.  If we are to have a pay as you view system, people will not pay the television licence.  Why should they if they cannot see the sports or other programmes they have always watched?  I ask the Minister to look at this situation and to ensure that RTE will be able to compete with other stations.  We do not want one organisation to have a monopoly in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;while recognising the prerogative of the owners of broadcasting rights in major sporting events to negotiate with whomsoever they wish, notes with concern the growing international trend whereby exclusive rights to national and international sporting events of major public interest are being successfully negotiated by the operators of subscription and pay per view broadcasting services, notes that similar concerns are being voiced by other member states of the European Union, recognises that any solution to this problem can only be achieved in an international context, urges that all possible steps be taken to seek to ensure that such events, particularly the All Ireland Finals, Soccer and Rugby internationals, continue to be available here to the widest possible audience at no extra cost.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This debate is timely and useful.  There is a growing trend among television companies, particularly the Sky television network, to buy the rights to screen big events.  It is difficult to compete with that.  Some sporting organisations have seen the benefits of this. The Minister must examine what can be done in this regard.  It would be a tragedy if events such as the All-Ireland finals, soccer or rugby internationals or the Grand National were not available to people.  There is no doubt that money talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney said we should introduce legislation.  However, I do not know if that would work in these days of free trade.  We should appeal to organisations not to allow these television companies to buy the rights to screen their events because that will prevent many people from watching them.  Many publicans now have Sky <Col N="1014" /> Sports.  A soccer match was due to be shown on RTE this evening, but that has now been cancelled due to interference from another company.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that £200 million has been offered to screen the Five Nations rugby championship.  If Sky buys those rights, I do not know what will happen to Fred Cogley or Jim Sherwin. If Sky does the same in the racing world, what will happen to the likes of Tony O'Hehir?  Introducing legislation will not solve this problem.  RTE will not be at the races in terms of bidding for some of these events.  People are concerned that television stations will have exclusive rights to big matches.  I would not like to see Sky screening the All-Ireland finals or other big contests here.</P>
    <P>Some organisations may sell the rights to big events if they get more money than RTE could afford.  They should, therefore, use that money to help develop and improve the game.  It is sad to see people togging out along the side of the road and having to go home after a match without taking a shower.  I ask the Minister to respond as positively as he can, although I appreciate the difficulties involved.  Senator Mooney did not provide any solutions to this problem.  The amendment notes our concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>We do not want a situation where people will not be able to see some of our best events.  Some people subscribe to Sky Sports, but many cannot afford to do so.  I do not know how many people in this House have subscribed to it.  I commend RTE for its good sports coverage.  It has some of the best commentators, covering a wide range of sports.</P>
    <P>We need a general debate to outline the problems.  Few people do not watch World Cup matches or soccer or rugby internationals.  There is nothing to stop a sporting organisation from being approached or approaching a television network to sell the rights to an event.  If the money is right we could be on sticky wickets.  We must ensure that our big <Col N="1015" /> events are screened on national television.</P>

      <P>I am not clear why an amendment was tabled, because I thought a discussion was what was needed at this stage rather than a confrontation or adversariality.  I inquire about the meaning of one phrase in the amendment. What does the phrase &ldquo;continue to be available here to the widest possible audience at no extra cost&rdquo; mean?  Extra cost to whom &mdash; the viewer, RTE or the Government?  Can anybody enlighten me?</P>

      <P>It would have been helpful to know what I was going to argue against.  I congratulate the drafters of the amendment on the skill with which they concealed the meaning of the amendment at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we are joking about it, it is quite a serious issue and it will become more serious because sport is becoming ever more central to our way of life &mdash; which is a natural result of growing affluence and will continue to be the case &mdash; for males and females.  It could be argued that it is also increasingly central to our idea of who we are; many would argue that our other marks of distinctiveness are declining to some extent.  Sport arouses the greatest sense of identity with something called &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the minds and hearts of many people; whether it is GAA in Ireland or following the fortunes of the soccer team, in particular &mdash; it would be the rugby team if it had fortunes to follow &mdash; Olympic athletes and so on. <Col N="1016" /> Sport is very serious but, at the same time, we all want to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>It is highly appropriate for this motion to be tabled at this stage.  I accept entirely that it is a very serious and difficult issue to which there is no easy solution.  However, I was disturbed by the hint of defeatism &mdash; although that may be an unfair term &mdash; when Senator Cosgrave asked what one could do in this age of free trade and wider access.  No doubt, they limit the potential of what one could do but one should not throw up one's hands.  On the contrary, if the pressures are in that direction, it behoves the Government to think all the more carefully about what its role can be.  I do not envy the Minister or anybody else who will contribute to that thinking.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney said that one would need the wisdom of Solomon.  However, one would be more likely to need the contents of King Solomon's mines to compete effectively in what is perhaps the best example of pure capitalism in the world, apart from some stock exchanges.  Such capitalism leads, as does much raw capitalism, to something verging on monopoly.  Although it may begin by introducing competition, the control which television organisations acquire over the sport subordinates the sport to the television spectacle.  In due course, we find that, although money was injected initially &mdash; but one might wonder whether it is wisely used when one looks at the current state of English cricket &mdash; schedules, programmes, dates and the priorities of the games themselves are increasingly subordinated to the need of the television presenters.  In that way, the issue is not just the television channels on which people watch a sporting event.</P>
    <P>I take the points which were ably made by the proposers of the motion about the implications for sport and the knock-on effects for RTE.  From every point of view, there are a series of issues lurking in this, some of which are technical, but also fundamental value issues about the type of country we want.  It is one of the more important challenges <Col N="1017" /> confronting the way we think about organising matters in the coming decades. I have no solution to offer at this stage but I welcome its appearance on the agenda.  The Minister is engaged in many important activities in terms of defining our future self image.  In many respects, this is by no means among the least important of them.  I hope the Minister finds the time to devote the attention to this issue which its intrinsic importance deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. As an active member of the GAA, the biggest sporting organisation in the country, it is an issue close to my heart. Sport is an essential indicator of the well being of our community.  It contributes to the physical and psychological development of our children.  It adds to the spirit of community life, both at a national and local level.  We all remember the sense of pride we felt in the feats of the national soccer team over the last decade.  Dubliners will also remember the sense of joy brought to that county when it finally ended its 12 year wait for an All-Ireland win last September. There is no need to explain to the House the joy of the people of Clare when they won their first all Ireland final in 81 years.</P>
      <P>Sport contributes enormously to our cultural life.  Fortunately, we in Ireland have experienced few of the drawbacks associated with sport in Britain.  Hooliganism is a rare occurrence, for example.  Rivalry tends, on the whole, to be keen but friendly although there are, of course, some exceptions.  It is important to place the debate in this context.  Sport is an integral part of our community life.  In that context, I support the spirit of the motion which refers specifically to two sporting events &mdash; the All-Ireland finals and international soccer games &mdash; but it could go further.  Golf, rugby, cycling and so on could also be added to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish there was a simple solution to the problem we are facing.  However, it must be recognised that we have a series <Col N="1018" /> of competing rights &mdash; the right of the widest number of the public to view important sporting events and the right of the organisations involved to get the best possible revenue for their sporting organisations.  Unfortunately, this is not a simple matter.  Were it an issue of profit <i>versus</i> the common good it would be clearer, but it is not.  Money received by sporting organisations is used to further develop those sports.</P>
    <P>This is not a hypothetical issue as it is already happening.  In Britain, for example, the increased revenue from pay as you view television has enabled football clubs to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor report.  Given the horrific incident which occurred in the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield some years ago, who could question that this money is both needed and well spent?  No doubt, when framing this motion the Members opposite drew on the experience of Britain where an increasing number of sporting events are screened only on subscription channels. Unquestionably, viewers are being denied access to events they once watched, such as the cricket world cup and the Ryder Cup.  About 16 million people watched the Ryder Cup in 1993 when it was last covered by terrestrial television channels; that figure declined to 2 million in 1995 when the event was available only on satellite television channels.</P>
    <P>Our capacity to deal with this development is limited.  First, many of the sports in question take place outside the Government's jurisdiction, thereby limiting our ability to do anything about it.  Second, unlike in Britain where Parliament is absolute, we are faced with constitutional difficulties in imposing obligations on the property rights of organisations.  Thus &mdash; and I would like clarification on this point &mdash; the option pursued by the British in their 1990 Act on broadcasting is not open to us.  That is unfortunate because there is much to commend the British approach and there are unquestionable parallels between their and our experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> The All-Ireland finals, for example, are arguably more than sporting events and are part and parcel of our heritage. In this regard, I do not envy the Minister his task.  I know he is aware of the problem as he stated as much in this House during our recent debate on broadcasting.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say this evening.</P>
    <P>However, the obligation should rest not only with the Minister.  Sporting organisations also have an obligation, which many British organisations recognise. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, for example, runs the British Open Golf Championship which is widely recognised as the most important golf tournament in the world.  It has taken the position that this event should receive the widest audience possible.  The British Turf Club also recognised that its sport requires the widest possible audience in order to thrive, and there are similar examples on a wider scale.  The International Olympics Committee recently decided to grant the broadcasting rights for the forthcoming Olympics to the European Broadcasting Union, despite a large monetary offer from Sky television. The International Olympic Committee justified its decision by referring to the aim in its original charter of promoting the Olympic Games.</P>
    <P>The GAA's strength derives from its place in our community and the people who organise its activities on a day to day basis.  It would be wrong and ultimately self-defeating if that organisation, for a cash consideration, did not consider the widest possible audience access to its showpiece events.  Without this exposure the GAA's position as a dominant sporting organisation could be undermined.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the argument that some competition in the buying up of sporting broadcasting rights is important.  One argument in Britain is that the commercial value of some sporting events was never properly recognised by the BBC and that in effect the BBC and ITV operated a cartel to control the market for those products. <Col N="1020" /> In Ireland until recently, the only potential buyer of these sporting events was RTE.  I am glad the situation is changing.  With the advent of TV3 and UTV's developing interest in sport, it should be possible to introduce some competition into the buying of broadcasting rights.</P>
    <P>As a GAA member I would like to see the organisation get the best price possible for the televising of its respected events.  I see the worthwhile use this money is put to in the clubs.  I wish more people could attend the All-Ireland finals, but despite the recent improvements the capacity of Croke Park is nowhere near sufficient to cater for all those who would like to attend the games and regrettably some are excluded.  It would be worse still if we were unable to watch the matches on television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I first became interested in the subject of this motion in 1990.  I was intrigued that a Conservative Prime Minister, who had pursued a policy of privatisation of water, heat, transport, etc., was not willing to allow his national sporting heritage to be privatised.  The issue affected our country last year, when the Ryder Cup was taken over by the satellite broadcaster, Sky.  It was a great success for Europe, Ireland and my own area, because Mr. Philip Walton is a neighbour's child, so to speak. However, the next day people expressed great regret that they were unable to see this success.  That brought home the meaning of this motion.  In his reply to a Dáil Question No. 61 on 28 November last, the Minister said it would not be in the public interest for this phenomenon to continue and gave a commitment to legislation.  However, the Minister has not followed through either on that commitment or the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lee that the amendment to tonight's motion sends all the wrong signals.  It suggests the Minister is washing his hands of the problem in that it states: &ldquo;any solution to this problem can only be achieved in an international context&rdquo;.  He must follow <Col N="1021" /> the lead taken in the UK Broadcasting Act, 1990, which endeavoured by regulation to ringfence certain national events.  Our motion has mentioned similar Irish events which he, as the custodian of those events and as the Minister responsible, should ensure are not exclusively taken over by a satellite or pay per view channel.</P>
    <P>It was Mr. David Mellor MP, in his then capacity as Secretary of State for National Heritage, who introduced the regulations in 1990.  At a recent House of Commons Select Committee meeting, he said those regulations had not gone far enough.  That is a recognition by a former Conservative Minister. Lord Howell's words in the recent House of Lords debate on the new UK Broadcasting Bill should be dear to the Minister's heart:</P>
    <P>To deny the millions of elderly who supported their sport in better days the opportunity to do so now, in old age or difficult circumstances, is not acceptable.  It is anti-social.</P>
    <P>Since this issue has gained public prominence, that is the view taken by punters who attend sporting events or watch them on television but who, for whatever reason, cannot afford Sky, or &mdash; more importantly in Ireland &mdash; those to whom it is unavailable.  We have now seen the recent development whereby one pays not only a subscription to Sky Sports but an extra £9.95 to watch a particular fight.  Fianna Fáil put this motion down in November last because we had formed the view that this was the coming trend.  But little did we think it would happen so quickly, that within four months of putting down the motion, the Irish public would be faced with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave mentioned that RTE understood it had a contract with Sky to show an important FA Cup replay tonight but at the last minute the rug had been pulled &mdash; perhaps the Minister may find out the reason at a later stage.  In the last week in England the BBC thought it had an understanding with Sky to show World Cup cricket, <Col N="1022" /> England's national sport, but now it cannot even show highlights of events.  I accept the Minister does not believe that is how national sporting events should be handled.  However, on the basis of his reply to the Parliamentary Question last November, the Government amendment to tonight's motion does not send the right signal to the public.</P>
    <P>It is in the Minister's hands to ensure a legislative programme is brought forward. The amendment suggests there may be constitutional problems, as there may be in the UK.  I admire much of what Sky has achieved for sport but not its exclusive rights to many national sporting events.  The Minister does not want to be the person associated with handing over our national sporting heritage to the likes of Mr. Don King, but that is what will happen.  As he says, this may well be an international problem; but we must start with a national policy and from there consider it at an EU level.  However, this should not be left to the goodwill of our national sporting organisations.  I have no doubt they will ensure fairness; but, ultimately, the best way to secure our sporting events is through introducing legislative proposals to deal with the problem.  In his reply to the Dáil Question on satellite and pay per view broadcasting mentioned earlier, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Question raised by [Deputy Nealon] is one which I will address as I develop firm proposals for legislative change.</P>
    <P>Our policy document last week stated that when we return to office, a Fianna Fáil Administration would bring forward legislative proposals to ensure that what everybody, possibly including the Minister, wants is protected.  The Minister can do that by producing a list system to prevent Sky or other satellite television channels from taking over these sporting events, as they have done elsewhere, and giving them the signal that these sporting events are in our national interest and are sacrosanct.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a matter of immense importance to thousands of people.

      <P>It is also a pity that Senator Wright used emotive terms, such as the Minister not throwing away this opportunity.  Senator Wright knows as well as I that if the Minister adopted the procedures he requested, he would be in the High Court and the Supreme Court for the rest of his term of Government. It is a pity to spoil what is essentially an important matter, properly raised by the Opposition, with a complete disregard for the situation.</P>
      <P>The House is <i>ad idem</i> in its view that the multinational aspect of control and domination of television should not be allowed.  However, as Senator Lee said, we still face the problem of rank and rampant capitalism, a system to which the majority of the House have always subscribed.  We are now beginning to reap the whirlwind, because this is about chequebooks and nothing else. Television is a window on the world. Somebody is about to buy the venetian blind and turn it off, not on those people who can afford to watch it but the thousands who are not economically able to pay, such as the poor and the sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television is a daily companion to thousands of our people.  Billy George, an excellent sports commentator in the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> points out that the punter has been asked to pay three times in this case &mdash; first, for the television licence; second, for the cable; and, third, for the pay per view.  It is anticipated that the price for watching <Col N="1024" /> the Bruno-Tyson fight will be £9.25 per household.</P>

      <P>I will not be deflected by Senator Cassidy.</P>
      <P>Billy George also said that if one fifth of Sky subscribers decided to pay £9.25 for the Bruno-Tyson fight, Sky will collect £10 million.</P>
      <P>For decades &mdash; certainly since we joined the EU &mdash; we have been told that business is about competition, the open market and ending monopolies.  What is this but a monopoly?  I cannot understand how the EU in particular, with its open market and its demand for competition laws, would allow this situation to obtain.  It seems to be against both the spirit, and in many cases, the letter of European Union competition laws. What is being encouraged here, especially with television companies like Sky, is a monopoly situation.</P>
      <P>There was a recent attempt by Sky to buy up the television rights to the Olympic games for the next few decades and it involved billions of pounds.  I was delighted the International Olympic Committee decided to offer its product to the European Broadcasting Union, which ensures the vast majority of European citizens can see those games at the normal rates being paid at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright referred to the British example of ringfencing.  I read David Mellor's contribution in the House of Lords; he introduced the Bill as heritage Minister.  It is not a problem in England because it does not have a written Constitution; <Col N="1025" /> its Parliament decides on the matter.  In this country, since many actions on decisions taken in this House have been challenged in other places, Senator Wright knows that his suggestion of stopping satellite channels from tampering with any of our major sporting events would not leave the floor of this House.  That is not to say we are helpless or should consider ourselves to be so, because we are not.  Every provision of our Constitution has a section which says it is subject &mdash; no rights are absolute &mdash; to public order and morality. Therefore, we as citizens and legislators must realise we are dealing with a Constitution that hardly envisaged the airplane, never mind satellites.</P>
    <P>I hope one of the side benefits of dealing with issues like this is that we will have, as soon as possible, an opportunity to look at our Constitution and bring it into line with modern needs and requirements.  We are constrained by it and it is not possible to put forward the quick fix solution Senator Wright proposed. What is possible is that a debate on the rights of citizens against monopolies must take place and be hardened and focused within the context of the European Union.  That is the only way that countries can tackle what is essentially a new problem, a problem that is less than a decade old.  While the laws in our Constitution protect the rights of ownership, no law is absolute. When it conflicts with the overall good of the citizen, we should obviously take steps to change it and I am sure the Minister will address that in his speech.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the present Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has shown enormous skill, imagination and flair in dealing with the world of film and technology.  I know of the Minister's commitment to public service broadcasting, which was shared by the proposer of this motion, Senator Mooney, at a debate in this House last week.  He was joined by Senator Cassidy, <Col N="1026" /> who is also interested in that area. I have no doubt that within the laws of the land as presently constituted, nobody will fight the battle better or more effectively than the present incumbent.  I am also confident that, given all party support, we can make inroads into changing not only the laws as they apply to this country but also in formulating new laws in the EU.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil rightly put this matter on the agenda and it has been openly debated.  The matter under discussion would be better served by Fianna Fáil not moving its motion and the Government not pressing its amendment.  It has now been brought into the arena.  We will hear the Minister's response and, for the moment, sufficient work has been done.  It would be in everybody's interest if Fianna Fáil decided not to move the motion and the Government decided not to move its amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the motion before the House, a new situation has arisen and it is much different to that which prevailed when RTE began broadcasting in 1960. I want to speak about the pressures placed on emigrants.  I ask the Minister to find out who is holding the public to ransom.  How come emigrants are being asked to pay phenomenal sums to watch their national sports?  At one time, fees were involved only for the All-Ireland football and hurling finals but our sporting activities have expanded now into the worlds of soccer, boxing, rugby etc. As a person who lived in the USA for a number of years and used to watch the <Col N="1027" /> All-Ireland football and hurling finals, I am speaking specifically about emigrants in the USA.  These matches were transmitted by RTE to the GAA in the USA for a fee and people went to the local cinema and paid their contribution. Technology has advanced since then and a new monopoly seems to have set in since the introduction of satellite television, Sky television, etc.  To date, publicans, restaurant owners etc. in the USA were asked to pay an annual fee for the right to receive the sports coverage. That has now changed.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months, RTE programmes, such as the All-Ireland football final, rugby matches and soccer matches, are being transmitted to the USA by satellite from Ireland via Canada. The proprietors of these premises are no longer being asked to pay an annual fee of £2,000 or £3,000 as had previously been the case and which they were prepared to pay.  On the day of an All-Ireland football final, for instance, they would charge at the door to offset the charge for the entire year.  In that way, they gave emigrants 364 days of free viewing and would only charge for one day.  Now our emigrants are being asked to pay for everything.  These people now control entry to every pub, restaurant and cinema across the USA and nobody can give a responsible reply as to who is in control, who is at the head of the gravy chain and who is getting the millions.  They are charging $20 per head per event 365 days a year. There is something wrong with that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister in charge of broadcasting, Deputy Higgins should be able to get a reply.  While proprietors of these premises want to provide a free service to their customers, they are now being compelled to take $20 from each person at the door in order to have the event transmitted.  This now involves not only GAA matches but also rugby, soccer, boxing and every major event.</P>
    <P>If RTE wants to make money, let it <Col N="1028" /> transmit to people in the USA who are prepared to get involved on a commercial basis and pay it.  They are willing to pay huge sums of money to make these sports events available to our emigrants. This is my main concern and I ask the Minister to address it.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Magner when he said there was a constitutional problem.  The current Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was the only Minister at the Council of Ministers when he went there first who was in favour of public service broadcasting whereas four or five Ministers of member states are in favour of it now.</P>
      <P>Sky television's monopoly is contrary to how we were led to believe the free market would develop.  The Minister has a great opportunity to address the matter at EU level since television is a conversation piece for those at home: the sick, the poor and the lonely, and its educational and entertainment value is important.</P>
      <P>The GAA can benefit enormously from the revenue which can be made from Sky television.  We must ensure RTE or TV3 can transmit sports events but if Sky television wants to transmit them to the rest of Europe, where they are not being transmitted there at present, surely the GAA could benefit enormously and reinvest the proceeds in grounds, facilities etc.  I would not be totally opposed to the GAA, in particular, having a non-exclusive deal.</P>
      <P>I would like to put another idea to the Minister.  Surely Sky television could get involved in minority sports &mdash; basketball, swimming and cycling &mdash; because these sports could benefit from the revenue which it would generate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that 70 per cent of the penetration of advertising is through television.  This is why many millions of pounds are involved in Sky Sports' <Col N="1029" /> proposition.  For example, the Sky Sport magazine which is released in Europe every month sells six million units per month.  It would be reasonable to expect to sell anything from 20,000 to 100,000 units as a result of advertising in that magazine &mdash; I know that from my own line of business.  Satellite television has become the norm.  It is a big attraction and I would not rule it out altogether but it must be considered as a nonexclusive franchise as happens in other countries.</P>
    <P>Protect Ireland but if we can make money for our sporting associations, in particular, let us do so.  Then the sporting organisations and clubs could have the revenue to reinvest in sport.  Sport is an outlet in which everyone encourages the youth to participate.  A healthy body means a healthy mind and a person who is fit, will not go too far wrong.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a rá go gcuireann sé áthas orm a bheith ar ais sa Seanad chun cursaí crealacháin a phlé don tarna uair taobh istigh de seachtain. It is, indeed, timely to be discussing the motion before the House this evening.  I have just learned that RTE has had to cancel its planned live coverage tonight of an FA Cup match between Liverpool and Charlton football clubs.  I understand the reason for the cancellation relates to an exclusive deal regarding the broadcasting rights to the FA Cup competition between the English FA, BSKYB and the BBC.  I believe this unfortunate development demonstrates the international context of the issue before the House and underlines the appropriateness of the wording of the amendment.  The match which RTE planned to cover is not an Irish event. It is a match between two English soccer clubs in an English competition organised by the English FA.  However, it is a competition of significant interest to Irish television viewers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> Senators will agree that it is futile to think of addressing such an issue in the context of national broadcasting legislation alone.  I welcome the tone of this debate and the emerging consensus in support of public service broadcasting. All of the issues raised in the discussion are at the core of the Green Paper, which raises the question whether we, as consumers and citizens, want broadcasting to be a cultural product or commodity. We will not be able to run away from these realities.  It is not a case of adopting a position on an issue like this evening's.  It is a matter of where does one stand on broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House addresses a symptom of the fundamental changes that are taking place in broadcasting services throughout the world.  Senators will be aware that just last week we had the opportunity in this House of hearing statements on the challenges facing us in regard to broadcasting in the future.  The coverage of significant sporting events, while it has always been an important part of television schedules, is just one of a number of concerns which face us as we move towards the next century.  The concern underlying this motion is not confined to sport.  The reality is that the same thing is happening in other areas, with the exclusive acquisition of film libraries and programme archives by the owners and operators of subscription and pay per view services.</P>
    <P>In the profusion of new technologies and new combination of technologies which are being developed, it is easy even for the most able participants to become confused and uncertain about the future of broadcasting.  Digital compression, fibre optics, video on demand, pay per view will mean that for the viewer, broadcasting will change in the most fundamental way, and not always for the better.  As I said in the House last week, the new technologies represent both a promise and a threat.  Our <Col N="1031" /> task is to maximise the promise and minimise the threat.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a number of the points raised by Senators.  I will take them as they occur.  I was very interested in the very positive tone of the contributions this evening.</P>
    <P>As the capacity for delivering different broadcasting services becomes almost infinite by today's terms and as the capital cost of providing that capacity is reduced, the competition for programme material of mass appeal is set to become more and more intense. Many of those competing for audience share are entirely commercial operations without any shred of public service ethos.  I emphasise again however the need which exists for a fundamental resolution as to what is meant by broadcasting. There is no easy alliance between commodity and cultural product. One must make one's mind up in that regard.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Senator Cassidy said about what is happening in Europe. A few years ago when I first became Minister, I was the only Minister going to the Council who was in favour of public service broadcasting.  Others have converted by the consequences of their own actions in relation to pursuing market place ideology in extremes.  They are trying to row back from the consequences of an absolutely unbridled market philosophy which saw broadcasting services simply as product served into a market place.</P>
    <P>Sport has always been an integral part of a public service broadcasters schedules. It is a prime example of popular public service broadcasting.  The coverage of hurling and football matches is for many a part of our broadcasting heritage.  The vast majority of viewers and listeners in this country would feel an incalculable loss if they did not have access through our national broadcasting services to live coverage of the All-Ireland finals on television and radio. <Col N="1032" /> The whole country has taken part in the ten year adventure of the Irish international soccer team as they qualified for and took part in two World Cups and a European Championship.  Without coverage on television channels charged with the universal access remit associated with public service broadcasting, many if not most of us could not have felt part of such important events.</P>
    <P>Irish participants at international events, in athletics, horse racing, motor racing, show jumping, cycling, and many of the other Olympic Games disciplines have traditionally been brought to us by such television services.  We all want to share in the success of our sportsmen and sportswomen at the highest level. Supporting a national team is a shared experience and is part of our shared symbolic world.</P>
    <P>In this regard, we must base even our legitimate expectations on reality.  With the ever increasing number of international satellite delivered television channels and with the importance of sports events in particular in attracting audiences of sufficient size to interest advertisers, sporting organisations promoting such events now find themselves in the position of being in a seller's market in which public service broadcasters with constrained financial resources can be regularly outbid for the rights to cover them.  For many it would be unthinkable if coverage of such events were not available freely &mdash; or more accurately for the price of a television licence &mdash; on our national broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>Even when traditional broadcasters retain broadcasting rights to such events the costs of such rights is increasing considerably. Is it realistic to continue to expect the same level of coverage as heretofore at the cost of a licence fee which has not changed for ten years?</P>

      <P>As I said last week in the House during statements on broadcasting, we may have to ensure that public service broadcasters have sufficient support to compete with the transnational services who would seek to corner the market on popular programming.</P>
      <P>Senators will conclude from my contribution to this debate so far that I have considerable sympathy with the motion put before the House.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to see any good that might come from the migration of the All-Ireland finals or soccer or rugby internationals from RTE to subscription or pay per view channels.  It would be more expensive for viewers and damage RTE's ability to provide a complete public service.  However, the wording of the motion is such that it suggests that this is a relatively simple matter which can be addressed in isolation by the Government.  This is not the case.  It is a complex and difficult area involving the rights of sporting organisations, issues of unfair competition, rights of broadcasters and the public interest.</P>
      <P>Many of the events which are of interest are organised abroad by international bodies.  Many of the new broadcasting organisations are commercial international companies obliged to generate maximum profits for their shareholders and not bound by national legislation.  Ireland is not the only country where concerns such as those expressed in the motion and in the contribution of Senators to the debate have been raised.  This is why I would urge this House to accept the amendment which, while in sympathy with the motion, recognises the complexity and the international aspects of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be clear about one central issue.  The freedom to sell broadcasting rights to sporting events generally belongs to sports bodies concerned with organising such events.  There is no point in pretending otherwise.  Any <Col N="1034" /> measure we might consider taking would have to respect this fundamental right.  However, such a right and freedom must be exercised within the more basic parameters of the public good and that is where we will be challenged in relation to such proposals as I may make.  We have to recognise that the sporting bodies themselves will have to examine their attitude to exclusive coverage deals and balance the monetary gains which might be made against the long term effects of such deals on the accessibility and development of their respective sports.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, I would hope that many, if not all, of our sporting organisations continue to recognise that they have a social and cultural role that transcends pure commercial considerations. However, some sporting organisations argue that the funds derived from exclusive deals with subscription television services have been put back into the sport to the benefit of players and spectators.  The English Premier League clubs argue that the exclusive deal which they have entered into with BSKYB has allowed them to expand and improve their stadiums to provide increased all seating capacity which enhances safety and comfort.  This is only one argument.  Other sporting organisations which have concluded exclusive contracts claim it allows them invest more money in training and coaching in their sports at grassroots levels.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, some sporting organisations recognise the value of traditional terrestrial broadcasters in reaching the widest possible audience with coverage of their events.  Recently the International Olympic Committee has chosen the European Broadcasting Union, of which RTE is a member, as the primary broadcaster until 2008.  It is interesting to note that the EBU bid for the right to coverage of the Games was not the largest.  I will look for the support of both Houses when I come to <Col N="1035" /> make choices between the philosophy of the EBU and the philosophy of the marketplace. If I go down the road of the EBU, I would like to think there would be consensus on that.</P>
    <P>In Holland, I understand that recently the Royal Dutch Football Association, the Dutch equivalent of the FAI, joined a consortium which plans to establish a dedicated sports channel for Dutch cable networks with exclusive rights to first and second division soccer matches, including international matches.  This move has caused considerable concern in Holland where the local football association seems to be under pressure to leave the consortium.  However, the cable channel may go ahead in any case.</P>
    <P>Exclusive sports deals and the activities of broadcasters who conclude such arrangements also raise issues of competitiveness and fair trading.  I agree with Senators who say that some monopolists arrive in the name of competition, only to change their nature into monopolies very shortly.  Such arrangements are under investigation from this point of view in the UK and in Holland. While the EU Commission does not appear to be taking any formal action, it is keeping a watching brief on the situation. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, that no formal complaint of anti-competitive trading has been made to him regarding broadcast sports coverage here.  Apart from exclusive live coverage of particular events, questions regarding the availability of edited highlights and news reporting of such events also arise.  We should remember that at this stage RTE has not lost the broadcasting rights to any Irish events of most concern to the Senators.</P>
    <P>My approach is not based within the rules of competition.  I argue within a philosophy of cultural exception and of its importance in a general sense.  I am as concerned as the Senators that cheque book power would be abused to <Col N="1036" /> the point of dislodging best broadcasting practice, and I will do my best to stop that.</P>
    <P>From what I have said already, Senators will be aware of the complexities of this area.  In the context of developing legislative proposals arising from the Green Paper on the future of broadcasting I will, of course, be addressing this issue in a national context and I will be consulting with my colleagues, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, and with broadcasters and sporting organisations.</P>
    <P>However, the issue of coverage of major sporting events must be seen in the context of the many challenges facing us with regard to developments in broadcasting today.  When I first began to attend meetings in Europe as Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, I was a lone voice in expressing concerns at the effects of so-called deregulation of broadcasting in other countries. Those who argued for deregulation and market hegemony in everything have now seen the consequences of their actions in more than the continent of Europe.  We need to have a context in which we would develop our proposals.</P>
    <P>I have continually stressed the need to support the tradition of public service in broadcasting in the interests of viewers and listeners, in the interest of preserving the diversity of our cultures that is Europe, of preserving our national identities, and in the interests of democracy which sees citizens as important rather than consumers.  You will not be able to have it both ways.  You will have to desert the excesses of the marketplace if you are going to have cultural diversity within a flowering democracy.</P>
    <P>I have argued that the public service model of broadcasting has served Europe well down the years, and I repeat that the issues arising from the new regime cannot be addressed solely from the viewpoint of the internal market <Col N="1037" /> and competition.  While much of what I was saying originally appeared to fall on stony ground, I now find, thankfully, that other EU Ministers with similar responsibilities to my own are beginning to express concern at the effects of so called deregulation on public broadcasters in their own countries.  There is, therefore, an important international aspect to this issue which I will be pursuing in an EU context and in other international fora as the opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>I would like to reply to some of the specific points raised by Senators. Senator Lee asked what was meant by the phrase &ldquo;at no extra cost&rdquo; in the amendment.  By that I meant at no extra cost to the viewer in terms of pay for view subscription.  The United Kingdom's 1990 Broadcasting Act did indeed protect listed events from pay for view services, but it did not prevent exclusive deals on subscription services such as Sky Sports.  The House of Lords is addressing this very issue.  Senator Lee also spoke trenchantly about the effects of what called &ldquo;unbridled capitalism&rdquo; on our society.  He rightly said that value issues are at stake.</P>
    <P>As the Minister with responsibility for broadcasting, I thank Senators and I appreciate the consensus from elected public representatives in support of cultural diversity, public service broadcasting, and of putting significant blocks in the way of the commercialisation of the important product that broadcasting is.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Mooney's point that this problem will become more intense as the impact of technology becomes more acute.  I appreciated the Senator's reference to the European Broadcasting Union, whose history was built on the very principle that everybody could share what was broadcast.  However, that principle has been under threat from market ideologues who simply do not care and add broadcasting services to the menu of commodities, as they saw them, to be exchanged for profit.  Broadcasting and film are more than commodities; <Col N="1038" /> they are cultural products.  For that reason one must look at a regime other than a strictly competitive one to adequately frame legislative proposals and international arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke about the particular position of a person in the regions who would either have to attend or be excluded if one could not pay. Senator Cosgrave spoke of the difficulties that arise in relation to the Constitution, but I would not be as pessimistic as him on that point.  Our Constitution is not there to defend private rights exclusively, but only within the context of the public good.</P>
    <P>Senator Wall spoke about the importance of sporting organisations striking a balance between the income they might legitimately expect to have from competition from broadcasters and, at the same time, their obligations to their supporters.</P>
    <P>Senator Wright commented on the British experience in this regard, and I would only differ with him on a matter of language.  I prefer the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; to &ldquo;everyday punter&rdquo; because the issues raised here go beyond sport.  They are issues of citizenship and I will try to address them as such.  There is nothing sinister in the preparation of the legislation on broadcasting, which is a complex area.  I hope the broadcasting legislation I will introduce later this year will bring us past the end of this century and into the next one.  The legislation will deal with technology that is located and sourced outside our jurisdiction.  A complex set of issues have to be addressed, but I will address them.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner correctly raised an important point.  In so far as I am asked in the motion to formulate a policy, my orientation is to come down in favour of society rather than the marketplace, and in favour of cultural product rather than commodity.  I will try to address that line of policy feeding into the preparation of the legislation.  My own view is that the listing as it is applied in Britain might <Col N="1039" /> only be a partial solution.  The abuse of a relationship of exclusivity in relation to rights is the fundamental broadcasting issue.  I am not addressing one point to defeat the other; I am setting the context in which one might best examine it.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner spoke of the rights of citizens.  At the root of this issue there is a fundamental philosophical problem as to whether technology will be delivered into a democratic model in our society or used to abuse us as sections of a marketplace.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Kiely's point about the position of emigrants and I will investigate his point concerning the possible abuse of rights in relation to venues in the United States.  I will communicate with the Senator.  I was interested to hear Senator Cassidy's point about accepting that we are not in the same constitutional position as Britain.  At the same time, however, I appreciate that there is in this House widespread support for the diversity of broadcasting which we are trying to sustain.</P>
    <P>I have listened with great interest to what has been said and I welcome the consensus on this issue.  I will try to address it however complex it may be, although I am not instancing its complexity as an excuse for inaction.  We must pursue it at an international level with the European Union where more and more people share our concerns.</P>
    <P>In so far as I have been asked by the Seanad for an indication of Government policy, it is firmly within the ethos of public service broadcasting in the new international context in which we find ourselves.  I will be guided by the principles I enunciated in my speech to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As always I have no difficulty with the Minister's commitment to the concept of cultural diversity in broadcasting.  I have admiration for the trenchant defence he expounded <Col N="1040" /> tonight and at national and European level.  However, much of what he said seems to be a case of on the one hand this and on the other hand that, although he may believe I am being unfair.</P>
      <P>Because of the philosophy which obviously drives the Minister in his brief in broadcasting and when he refers to phrases like &ldquo;cultural exception&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural product&rdquo;, I would like to ask him who decides what is for the greater good.  If the Minister decides, will he say after a decision has been taken in a legislative context, that he does not care if only one person watches or listens to a programme because it is for the common good and it is making a contribution to cultural diversity?  I do not believe the phrase &ldquo;cultural diversity&rdquo; means anything if 99 per cent of the population switches off their radio or television.</P>
      <P>A challenge for the Minister in his legislation will be to create a balance between the evils of the marketplace and the protection of our cultural identity and the provision of cultural diversity in broadcasting.  I say this as somebody who works in a State organisation which has a monopoly in broadcasting. I have been trenchant in my criticism of programme decisions.  While somebody may think a programme is of value, as a broadcaster, I know nobody is listening to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point introducing legislation which would place broadcasters in a straitjacket.  I am probably being unfair to the Minister because he has not yet unveiled his legislative programme. I am making these points because when the time comes, he might keep in mind that the marketplace is not all or always evil.  The Minister correctly trumpeted the fact that when he went to Europe it was ignoring the concept of public broadcasting which seemed to be in full flow towards deregulation and that now it must suffer the consequences. I agree with him in that <Col N="1041" /> regard and I am delighted that it was an Irish Minister for Arts and Culture who pointed this out to Europe because it is a continuum of a long tradition of this country pointing out to dark Europe exactly where it should stand on cultural matters.  That is nothing new.  I applaud the Minister for doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the licence fees and the question of international events and he cited the example on RTE television tonight.  We are only looking at national events and we believe the Minister not only has an obligation but a legislative right to decide what national events can be exposed to the evils of the marketplace. That is our primary concern.  The Minister referred to the flaws in the 1990 Broadcasting Act.  In my opening remarks I said the Act was flawed because of a lack of comprehension in relation to the rapid advances in technology which have taken place since 1990.</P>
    <P>David Mellor, who was responsible for steering broadcasting legislation through the House of Commons, admitted that it was flawed and that it should have included subscriber channels as well as pay per view.  It was not pay per view which grew but subscriber channels. This requires a simple amendment to the Broadcasting Act.  I do not see why the Minister cannot do that in advance of his grand legislative plan for broadcasting which he indicated will come before us by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> The Minister referred to the cable television which the Dutch were attempting to set up.  This is happening closer to home.  Manchester United, one of the most successful football clubs in Britain, has already indicated &mdash; it has not stated this unequivocally &mdash; that following the end of the Sky television contract in 1997 it will negotiate independently to set up its own cable television which will place further restrictions on those who wish to see Manchester United games and that it will sell on.  As the Minister correctly identified, we are looking at very complex area.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's criticisms of the European Commission yet, at the same time, there is a certain irony in the fact that he referred to it as the engine room of change &mdash; I hope the Minister is right.  I have no doubt he will constantly remind it of its duties and obligations in this regard.  Despite all that has taken place and what the Minister said &mdash; I agree with much of it &mdash; I cannot understand why, in the light of the importance of this issue, he cannot agree to the possibility of introducing a simple amendment to the Broadcasting Act. The Minister said that he will not do this without further consultation with sporting bodies, broadcasters and sports people.  They will probably say to him &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; and that they want the right to negotiate.  However, that is where the Minister's responsibility starts and their responsibility ends.  I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  A number of old age pensioners who recently visited my clinics do not have bathroom facilities in their houses.  In a recent budget this problem was overcome regarding tenants occupying local authority housing.  I ask that a similar scheme be implemented in the case of tenant purchasers of local authority houses who are old age pensioners.  A major financial outlay would not be required, given the numbers involved throughout the country.  However, such a scheme would be of great benefit to the unfortunate people involved.  Due to extra pressure, it is not possible for health boards to provide that financial outlay.  A major problem exists with regard to county councils, essential repair grants and the health boards.</P>
      <P>Most of the queries I receive relate to essential repair grant applications involving flat roofs and extensions.  County councils do not accept these applications as being entitled to essential grant status.  Such applications are forwarded to the health boards and this causes major backlogs of work in relation to their grant schemes.  As a result, it is not possible for the health boards to do anything in relation to providing bathrooms for old age pensioners, etc.  I ask that the Minister of State investigate the issue of providing bathrooms for senior citizens or old age pensioners who are tenant purchasers of local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had numerous requests for action in relation to houses built in the mid 1930s and early 1940s by local authorities. A number of these houses have no bathrooms or facilities and people must use an outside toilet during the night.  This is not acceptable in modern society.  The people involved do not qualify for reconstruction loans under county council rules and have no other way to generate finance.  Many of these people live alone.  I am aware of a case where two brothers, who are old age pensioners, inherited their parents' house and have no running water or toilet.  They cannot put such facilities in place due to the financial constraints on <Col N="1045" /> their income.  The Department would not incur great financial cost in relation to such claims.  I am sure that there a number of similar situations in every county.</P>
    <P>It would not represent a major cost for the Department to investigate this matter with regard to tenant purchased houses.  Other houses occupied by senior citizens have requisite facilities. It is an anomaly that in a recent budget grants were made available to local authorities to provide bathrooms for tenants occupying houses within their remit.  Tenant purchased houses are purchased over a number of years, with people paying rent of perhaps £2 every six months.  If one approaches the council in relation to such dwellings, one is informed that they are part of old tenant purchase schemes.  This matter warrants serious investigation to see if a scheme might be put in place to alleviate the major problems experienced by those involved.  Perhaps ten to 15 people have approached me in relation to this issue.  I hope the Minister of State will review the matter and find a satisfactory solution.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  At the outset, I should state that houses purchased under tenant purchase schemes are, to all intents and purposes, private houses. Tenant purchasers are, like all other homeowners, responsible for the upkeep, maintenance and improvement of their houses.  Moreover, the price of a house under a tenant purchase scheme is based on its market value in its existing state of repair and structural condition, less generous tenancy discounts which can amount to 30 per cent of the market value, plus a further discount of £3,000 in lieu of the new house grant. The lack of a bathroom in a house being purchased would, therefore, be reflected in the relatively low price of the house to the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the favourable terms of tenant purchase, the full range of <Col N="1046" /> measures available to improve substandard housing are, of course, also available to tenant purchasers.  Some of these options are purposely aimed at elderly persons; others are more general in nature and can be used to assist the elderly and other categories of need.  I suggest that the Senator pursue some of the options I will now outline.</P>
    <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly is specifically designed to enable elderly persons living on their own, if they so desire, to remain in their existing accommodation, even though it may not be fully up to standard.  The scheme provides for the carrying out, at no cost to the occupier, of basic works to prolong the useful life of the house so that it can continue to provide, for as long as necessary, an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. The works undertaken may, where appropriate, include the provision of sanitary facilities, including a bathroom.  The scheme is operated at local level by health boards under the direction of the community care programme managers, who have responsibility for decisions in individual cases.  If the Senator is aware of particular cases, he should bring them to the attention of the health board for investigation as they may qualify under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, the local authority may improve or extend privately owned houses occupied or intended to be occupied by an approved applicant.  The authority can arrange to have all necessary works of improvement carried out to the house at no cost to the occupants other than a small weekly or monthly charge, based on the cost of the works, for a maximum of 15 years.  Such works may, of course, include the provision of bathroom facilities. The disabled persons grant scheme, could also, in certain circumstances provide substantial assistance towards the cost of providing a bathroom.  Under this scheme, grants of up to 33 per cent of the cost of necessary adaptation works to private housing may be made <Col N="1047" /> available.  Normally, grants under this scheme can amount to up to £8,000.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a range of assistance available to those who do not themselves have sufficient resources to improve their dwellings to a reasonable standard, including the provision of bathroom facilities.  This is especially so in the case of elderly persons, whether tenant purchasers or not.  Even though these people are private house owners, <Col N="1048" /> it is possible for them to apply to the health board and/or local authority under these schemes.  Such schemes are specifically designed to ensure that elderly people do not live in the substandard conditions to which Senator Wall referred.  Sadly these conditions remain a feature and I recognise the Senator's concern in relation to this problem.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 February 1996.</P>
