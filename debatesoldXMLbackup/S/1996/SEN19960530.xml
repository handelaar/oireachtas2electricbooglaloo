      <P>I have notice from Senator Roche that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the failure of her Department to properly process a series of complaints lodged by the parents of children attending a school (details supplied) under the aegis of Bray vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to outline his attitude to the recent Consumers' Association of Ireland survey into the country's 13 big mortgage lenders.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I call the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be <Col N="1291" /> taken until 12 p.m., when it will conclude, and the Minister will respond not later than 11.45 a.m. Item 2 will be taken between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. and if it has not concluded by 1 p.m. it will continue after 3 p.m. until conclusion. Item 3 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 3 p.m. and I propose ten minutes for each speaker.</P>

      <P>The Leader is aware of newspapers reports today in relation to the fishing industry and the EU proposal for a 40 per cent reduction in the size of the fleet. There is also a possibility of similar cuts in the quotas.  This would devastate one of our national industries and I ask the Leader to afford the House an opportunity, before the summer recess, to get across our support for the Minister who must fight the cause at EU level on behalf of the industry and the many people who depend on it.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice to congratulate the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, Mr. John Lonergan, for giving the staff and prisoners there access to RTÉ personnel who are making the programmes we hear each day on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;? They are most informative and gives the public some idea of the concerns of the staff and prisoners in the jail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage we cannot say with certainty who won the Israeli elections but it seems as if Mr. Netanyahu will emerge as the new Prime Minister of Israel.  The House should urge, whether through the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach, that the peace process should continue in the Middle East and Israel.  Those of us who were there for <Col N="1292" /> the Palestinian elections were most inspired and we hope the progress can be maintained.  It is our hope that, irrespective of who wins the election, the peace process will continue.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Forfás report has been circulated to Members. If not, perhaps the Leader could arrange for it to be circulated.  The House should discuss it within the next few weeks by way of statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we bring the Minister for Finance to the House to have a debate on the national lottery?  There is great unease among the public that no £10,000 prizes have yet been won from its scratch cards.  This seemed to be clear from the debate on RTÉ this morning. It is unjust and unfair that people buy these scratch cards thinking they have a chance of winning a £10,000 prize when it is obvious it is not there.  We should have a full debate on the national lottery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you advise me on how I can raise it, Sir?  It should be raised.  If the prizes are not available, they should not be advertised on the ticket and the matter should be clarified. Some two million of these tickets are sold each week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's welcome for the Governor of Mountjoy Prison in allowing RTÉ to report directly from there.  If the reports emanating from that prison underline anything, it is the grave error made by the Government in not allowing the building of the high security prison in Castlerea.  That facility was never more needed than now and that has been underlined by these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader ask the appropriate Ministers to elaborate on a report that a motorway is to be laid down through Leopardstown race-course? This is the flagship racecourse in the Dublin area.  The <i>Irish Field</i><Col N="1296" /> report provides a sketch outline which shows that racegoers would have to take a bus to get to the grandstand and there are various other worrying aspects to this proposal.</P>
      <P>On the Control of Horses Bill, can the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry enlighten us, for example, on whether assistance would be given on licence fees for horses etc. I have seen loose horses roaming around the Cherry Orchard area.  To what extent will boys who own horses be assisted under the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis' request to the Leader of the House to have an opportunity to discuss the Fórfas report on long-term economic planning. An RTÉ journalist said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning that long-term economic planning might be abandoned if there was a new Fianna Fáil-PD alliance.  The PD's can speak for itself, but before the Labour Party was in Government, the Fianna Fáil Administration had accepted the principal of long-term economic planning and made it clear that in no way would it be at risk.  It is unfair to let people make comments like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you a question relevant to today's Order of Business, Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader should talk to RTÉ to ensure it puts independent commentators and not ones scoring political points on the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to comment on the issue raised by our Leader about the risk posed to jobs in our fish processing industry because of the European Commission's proposals that fishing activity should be reduced by 40 per cent.  Such a reduction would have a devastating effect on the industry and I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Marine to give us an up to date <Col N="1297" /> report on the situation in Brussels? There is serious concern on this matter. This is happening at a time when the Community is allowing a huge increase in the number of Spanish fishing boats to operate off our coastline.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am shocked and horrified by the news that Senator McAughtry has dropped on us, that the premier racecourse of Dublin could be altered. If this must happen, can we ensure the motorway goes through the flat rather than the jumps course so that we would at least preserve some of our heritage?</P>
      <P>The Government has recently produced a report on the needs of children in special education.  The Minister for Education and representatives from her Department came to this House on a number of occasions and said she would put resources into special and remedial education etc.  The Minister guaranteed us that this report would not gather dust in the Department.  However, the Minister decided this year that no resources will be put into the area of children with special needs and those in need of remediation. It is disgraceful and we should ask for an updated report from the Minister on the progress she has made in implementing the recommendations of this costly report.</P>

      <P>Can the Leader of the House afford us the opportunity to debate health issues?  While he allowed a partial debate, it was confined to drugs and in no way allowed for the broad debate we have sought for some time.  I <Col N="1298" /> mentioned a number of headings to him before.  I will do so again and ask him that they be included in a health debate &mdash; for example &mdash; the debate on the White Paper on Mental Health.  A report suggests that many young children have committed suicide in the Eastern Health Board area.  Can the Leader put this and the nursing home issue on the agenda as well?  I hope such a debate will come about in this session.</P>
      <P>A recent report regarding the quality of water in the River Shannon was published and it established that it is in poor shape.  The Shannon is one of the finest waterways in Europe and we should have a debate on that report.  It would be unfortunate to leave it on the shelf. Can the Leader give us the opportunity to debate it?  That report was commissioned by local authorities and it involved up to ten of them.  It would be opportune to debate the issue in this House and we could then make our views known on it.</P>

I also ask the Leader to congratulate the Minister for Education for her wisdom, however belated, in withdrawing the proposals concerning the role of history and geography in the junior certificate.

      <P>A request was made to discuss the comments made about Mountjoy Prison on the radio this morning. One of the prisoners was asked which he would opt for if he was given a choice between a £500 fine or six months in jail.  He said that he would take the six months in jail because he would go in on a Friday and get out next Tuesday.  The prisoner was asked what he thought of the matter.  He said that he goes home and comes back when the governor tells him.  I ask the Leader of the House to raise this as a matter of priority.  The prisoners are dictating to <Col N="1299" /> the courts.  I also ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice to intervene in a case where a justice in the west sent a man to prison for five years for a minor offence.</P>

There appears to be a crisis in this area.</P>

A general debate is being held in the Dáil today and I would appreciate an indication from the Leader that a general debate on agriculture will be held soon in the Seanad.  Prices for agricultural produce are decreasing while costs are increasing.  In view of the delay in the administration of the farm pollution grants and other matters, it is essential that a debate on agriculture is held quite soon.  It is one of our major industries.</P>

      <P>Before responding to the Order of Business, I wish to point out that this is a House of Parliament and some of the points raised this morning are a disgrace to a House of Parliament. I ask my colleagues to take the Order of Business seriously.  If we do not take ourselves seriously, nobody else will.  I am sure my sentiments are shared by the Leader of the Opposition and other Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I propose a change to today's business because the Order of Business has taken far longer than anticipated.  I propose that item 1 be taken until 12.30 p.m. with the Minister to conclude not later than 12.15 p.m.  It is proposed to order item 2, which was ordered from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock, from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.  If it is not completed it will be taken after item 3.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Wright, I would be happy to arrange a debate on the fishing industry and the proposed cuts in that area.  It is a matter of urgency and I will do my best to ensure that the debate takes place as soon as possible.  I agree with Senators' comments on the open policy of Mountjoy in giving RTÉ access throughout the prison.  It was a useful exercise and it is clear that there is more than one point of view on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis and other Senators raised the Forfás report.  I will ensure that it is circulated.  It is an important issue and I will make time available for it.  A number Senators raised the summer <Col N="1305" /> jobs scheme.  I told Senator McGowan yesterday that a question on the Adjournment was the appropriate way to raise the matter.  He probably would have had an opportunity to raise it on today's Adjournment.  If Members wish to obtain clarification on this matter, a motion on the Adjournment is the easiest and most appropriate way to do so.  If that fails, I will seek to make time available for a debate.  However, Senators should use the easier and more speedy devices available in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised the question of the national lottery.  I also listened to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; this morning and I agree that perhaps there is a need for the national lottery to be more forthcoming with information on these matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly raised the issue of Mountjoy Prison.  Senator McAughtry raised the issue of a motorway being constructed through Leopardstown Racecourse.  This is the first time that matter has been brought to my attention. I hope that Senator McAughtry's news does not have any basis in fact. Last week Senator Enright stated that the CPSU work to rule in the Houses had ended.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of Forfás and a question raised in that regard by a commentator on an RTÉ radio programme this morning.  I must inform the Senator that I was also surprised about the content of the question.  I suggest that a telephone call to RTÉ by the Senator might have a speedy and desired effect.  There is not doubt that it was a bizarre question.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the matter of a debate on special needs and I agree that this is an important issue.  I must inform Senator Finneran that there will be a further, structured debate on health.  The last debate on the health aspect of drug abuse was important and timely.  It is my intention to ensure that such debates are conducted within a structured format.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point raised by Senator Lee.  Everyone is glad that the threat to the teaching of history, <Col N="1306" /> whether real or perceived, at second level has been removed.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised a number of issues, particularly in relation to the abuse of charities.  The Senator referred to a recent RTÉ television programme that dealt with the outrageous abuse of public trust by the Irish Children's Hospice Foundation.  This plays on people's generosity in the most appalling way. There is a need to tighten the regulations in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised a question which would be more appropriate to an Adjournment debate.  If she does not obtain satisfaction in that regard, I will endeavour to provide time for a debate on the issue in the House.  However, I request that she first attempt to raise the matter on the Adjournment of the House.</P>
    <P>I remind Senator Enright that the question he raised will be the subject of a debate this afternoon.  I have no intention of acceding to Senator Mulcahy's request, while I have every intention of acceding to that made by Senator Rory Kiely.  I assure Senator Kiely that I will try to arrange a broader debate on agriculture before the end of session. Senator Roche also raised the matter of Forfás, with which I dealt earlier.</P>

If he wishes to receive an accurate reply, I suggest that Senator McGowan raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House.  I cannot adjudicate on remarks made by Members during the course of the political argument that occurred yesterday.  I suggest that the Senator raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House and I will endeavour to have it taken as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of delivering better government concerns every citizen and taxpayer and should concern every Member of the Oireachtas.  The manner in which government is delivered is vital from the point of view of obtaining value for taxpayers' money and achieving the best possible service for the citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we debated this issue I made the point that government is not user-friendly.  It is user-hostile and is excessively centralised, secretive and bureaucratic.  It is extraordinary that 30 years after the establishment of the Devlin committee, Irish government should be the subject of another study. It is also extraordinary that this study, carried out through the strategic management initiative, should reach precisely the same conclusions as the Devlin report 30 years ago.  The basic conclusion of both studies is that there is a Victorian notion, nonsense or myth at the heart of government which involves the concept of ministerial responsibility.  The nonsense that each Minister is aware, through his or her wisdom, of everything that occurs in every nook and cranny of their Department was never meant to be taken literally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of ministerial responsibility is taken literally in this country when it suits the politics of a situation. A little over 12 months ago the then Taoiseach was expected to resign because a senior public servant consigned a letter to a drawer in their desk. At present a similar dispute is taking place in relation to the Duncan extradition warrant.  I submit that this type of political argument is facile, politically disruptive and damaging.  We live in a State where people are not merely obliged to deal with an excessively centralised, bureaucratic and secretive <Col N="1310" /> administration, but one with which the vast majority of people feel they have no contact.  There is a feeling of anonymity at the interface level and that people are not being served by the administration.  This view is not unique to Ireland.  There are problems in all developed economies with the relationship between the citizen and the state.</P>
    <P>Some years ago Professor Dror of the Hebrew University listed challenges which he said faced public administration as we went into the final years of the century.  He talked about an economic environment where resources are less abundant than in the past and a changed cultural environment where the public demands the right to participate in government.  He talked about a growing sense of individual rights where people are no longer prepared to be told what to do by administrative bureaucrats without having some say in it.  He talked about a growing and healthy tendency to question authority and a general disenchantment with government.  He also spoke about the growing complexity of society and the external environment in which public administration exists.  He said all of these and other reasons provide us with a rationale for ongoing examination of the administrative structures and reform strategies.</P>
    <P>The reform strategies which we have adopted have been episodic in almost the same measure as they have been unsuccessful.  Thirty years ago we put in place the Devlin team which produced a very fine report.  For a variety of reasons, ranging from a lack of political will across the spectrum to senior administrative obscurantism and obstruction, the Devlin report was never put into operation.  I remind the Minister of State of a very fine speech made at her party's Ard Fheis some years ago by John Boland, who had similar ministerial responsibilities to those of the Minister of State.  He pointed out that the myth of a lack of political will did not stand up to examination. In 1977 the then Taoiseach gave commitments when he took office on <Col N="1311" /> the implementation of the Devlin report.  His predecessor from the Minister of State's party had also given such commitments.  However, those political commitments were obstructed by administrative activity.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the Devlin report left us with a situation where we had a 19th century form of administration dealing with a growing variety of public services and an increasingly complex society. For that reason I appreciate and applaud the central proposition in this report.  However, I suggest respectfully to the Minister of State that much more needs to be done.  The central core of Senator McGowan's point this morning was the bureaucratic language of a letter which meant nothing at the end of the day.  There is, unfortunately, too much jargon in this report.</P>
    <P>A bigger lacuna in this report is that when the Devlin report collapsed in the 1970s and 1980s it was not unique in that regard.  A variety of what were known as &ldquo;grand reform strategies&rdquo; collapsed around the world.  The Fulton report was consigned to the waste bin in Britain.  The Glasgow report went the same way in Canada.  There were also problems in the United States with reform strategies.  Out of that collapse an alternative view was taken which was the subject of an OECD paper in the mid 1980s.  That paper suggested that rather than go for &ldquo;grand reform strategies&rdquo;, it would be much more sensible and economical if governments pursued &ldquo;selective radical strategies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I wish to suggest to the Minister of State a number of reasons why that approach should be adopted.  Second, if the Minister of State looks at the Programme for Government which her partners in Government and her party prepared, she will see selective radicalism outlined in it.  I can say that with some confidence because the relevant ages were agreed between my party and the Labour Party in November 1994 and were obviously carried across into the negotiations by the Labour Party, which I welcome.  They were good ideas <Col N="1312" /> when I wrote them down and I am pleased the current Government has gone along with them.</P>
    <P>Selective radicalism suggests that maximum political attention would be focused on relatively short areas of administration.  Second, we could reform key areas of our administration. Third, we could provide continued learning experience regarding administrative reform.  Fourth, a strategy of selective radicalism would help the reformers, including the Minister of State, to keep an eye on what was happening and to make necessary changes.</P>
    <P>It is unusual for a Member of the Opposition to suggest what should be done, what is missing and the areas the Minister of State might like to look at and address in the fuller implementation of this report.  Over the last 30 years efficiency and effectiveness have been dealt with by our public administration. We have had personnel strategies; initiatives aimed at improving management competence; resource allocation and control strategies, from PPBS to zero base budgeting; the introduction of new technologies and disciplines; and a variety of other approaches.  We should be focusing on the point &mdash; the interface &mdash; where the citizen and the State come into contact. There are political, economic and organisational benefits from such a focus.</P>
    <P>The contact between the citizen and the administration is politically important because it represents the borderline between the citizen and the State.  There is growing evidence the citizen of this State are not happy with how they have to deal with the administration in their day to day lives.  Attitudes towards the institutions of State are very important, because if people have a negative attitude towards them they will not have a positive attitude towards the policies which any Government attempts to implement in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>There are economic benefits if we can avoid friction between the citizen and the State.  It costs a great deal to fix a <Col N="1313" /> case which has gone wrong.  The disruption in the House this morning is a case in point.  An extremely badly worded letter from the Department of Social Welfare is causing mayhem for students who want to avail of that scheme, and in this House.  The avoidance of friction pays dividends to the State.</P>
    <P>A smooth relationship is also important in terms of how the people of the nation view politics as a whole, not just the political parties of the day, and how they accept the legitimacy of the Government and its processes.  That is important in the Irish context because there is a vivid tradition here of being &ldquo;agin&rdquo; the Government.  If everybody is &ldquo;agin&rdquo; the Government, there cannot be any cohesion in the implementation of public policy or any forward direction, and one is continuously stymied by artificial debates and disputes.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to an OECD paper which was published in the mid 1980s, and which suggested five alternative strategy areas which any reforming Government could look at.  The areas ranged from very simple strategies to very complex ones.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly mention the five areas.  The first was amelioration measures &mdash; a general improvement in the ambience of public offices; staggered office opening and closing hours; and joint case handling, where if a person's case transcended the boundaries of two or three organisations the one receiving the case would have to take the case and operate as the case handler in other areas.  Amelioration measures would also include simple matters such as forcing public servants to wear identity badges and to identify themselves in communication, and to give people clear <Col N="1314" /> guidance on who they could approach. None of these measures would be costly and they would pay tremendous dividends. Ministers should also look at putting an administrative procedures Act on the Statute Book which would outline good practice and make bad practice illegal.</P>
      <P>The second type of measures are information ones.  These range from simply improving the way language is used in official texts to the use of modern technologies.  I draw the Minister of State's attention to, in particular, an initiative used in France where there is a range of telephone numbers, like directory inquires, which put one automatically through to in-house experts in the telephone system.  They will tell the citizen who will deal with the citizen's case and will provide additional back-up. There is a cost benefit to this in that those who are confused and go to three or four administrations are eating up administrative time. I can submit details on this to the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Another initiative with which the French were involved was the establishment of a form audit agency.  The Minister of State's Department has been attempting to do some form auditing here.  There is a need &mdash; as set out in the Programme for Government &mdash; for a stand alone form audit agency.  There is also an urgent need for user councils, where citizens drawn from a wide spectrum look at forms to ascertain if they are comprehensible to the average citizen.</P>
      <P>The third area is consultation measures.  This covers the entire gamut, including from introducing measures such as the employer labour conferences, which we already have. However, we do not have consultations with the consumers of public services. Every public service department should have a departmental consultation committee drawn up with clients to give a feed back to the department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Institutional measures are very important.  We have looked at a number of these and have introduced institutional changes.  The Minister of State <Col N="1315" /> is proposing a major institutional change in the document by proposing to get rid of the nonsense of ministerial responsibility.  I applaud this and I hope she will be supported from all sides of the House in expeditiously getting through the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>However, other institutional measures are necessary.  In addition to looking at measures such as a form audit agency, the Minister of State should look at the idea of creating more joint one stop shops. For example, a person came to me last week who had taken in a child from a family with drug abuse problems.  The child was living with the grandmother who admitted this to the Department of Social Welfare whereupon she lost all her social welfare living alone allowances at a stroke.  This happened not because those working in the Department are heartless individuals but because they were applying the rules.  There was no way they could contact the community care people in the health board.  There should be far closer institutional liaison.</P>
    <P>With regard to the deinstitutional measures, there is a need to audit regulations and to get rid of excessive regulation. Over her political career the Minister of State has shown an interest in the business community and in the real world outside politics.  She will know that, especially with small businesses, excessive regulation bears down as a burden which becomes intolerable. The irony of this is that, in attempting to introduce measures such as improvements in workers' rights, we have created problems for those who want to employ workers.</P>
    <P>There is a huge amount to be done.  I wish the Minister of State well.  My only criticism of the report is that there is an extraordinary and excessive use of jargon. The Minister of State did not write it.  Many years ago a person bought stamps from a clerk in a post office.  The person complained about the design of stamps to which the clerk responded that he did not draw them, he only sold them.  It is a pity there is not more common <Col N="1316" /> sense use of language in the document. Perhaps the Minister of State will ensure that her Department will use more ordinary language from hereon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Roche for his generally supportive and very constructive contribution on which he has spent a considerable time.  I may invite him to send me greater details on the two French initiatives to which he referred.  I also note his points on the stand alone audit agency. I support the concept of one stop shops and have been beating that drum for some time at local and national level.  I refer the Senator to what I said in my opening speech in this debate on the urgent need for regulatory reform.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate on <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  It has been an interesting and constructive exchange of views and I appreciate the thought and consideration they have given to this important issue.  Widespread cross party support for this initiative will be one of the key factors in ensuring the success of delivering the programme.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators said that the document was open ended and did not contain enough specifics as regards implementation.  Once again, I stress that this is a framework for change which sets out a clear direction for the future.  It is part of a process which will involve discussion and consultation with the staff and customers of the Civil Service in working out the arrangements for detailed implementation.</P>
      <P>However, work is already well under way on specific aspects of the programme, including new legislation amending the Ministers and Secretaries Act which should be enacted before the end of the year.  I note the supportive comments of Senator Roche and others on the need to clarify the area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to the nonsense of where responsibility rests to the point that a Taoiseach was expected to resign last year because of human error <Col N="1317" /> in the public service.  That was not the reason there was expectations on the then Taoiseach to resign.  Human error is human error and the difference between the problem with the Duncan extradition warrant and the troubles that befell Deputy Reynolds when he was Taoiseach was in the way he responded to the House and the inaccuracy of his reports to the House on what happened.  We will not go down this avenue because we would be here for two days.  However, there was a major difference and I wish to put this on record lest my silence lends assent to the remarks that Senator Roche made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator.  Now we know where we stand.</P>
      <P>The basic concepts behind <i>Delivering Better Government</i> can be put in three simple statements.  In the first instance, it entails delivering an excellent service to the various customers of the Civil Service.  This is the principal tenet and most important concept.  Second, it involves putting in place the appropriate legislative systems, human resource management and financial management systems to support the delivery of these excellent services.  The proposed Administrative Procedures Act, referred to by the Senator, is included in the legislative reform.  Third, it is concerned with ensuring that authority, responsibility and accountability rest in the appropriate place.  This point was made by Senator Roche and others.  I hope the proposed legislative amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Act will be through both Houses by Christmas, if not very early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern, competitive world in which the Civil and public Service are operating necessitates that a new approach is taken.  <i>Delivering Better Government</i> brings together in an integrated and coherent way a series of changes across all elements of the Civil Service to respond to this changing environment.  Far from being a document prepared by politicians to be <Col N="1318" /> imposed upon the Civil Service, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> has been generated by civil servants themselves. This will be an important factor in ensuring the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>There is a major difference here from the Devlin Report.  There are many similarities between what Devlin recommended and what is in this report, but the problem is that we did not manage to implement Devlin.  We will implement what is in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> because the civil servants themselves have ownership of this report and are pushing for change.  It is not being imposed centrally by the Department of Finance merely as a cost cutting exercise nor externally by the politicians; civil servants have owner-ship of the report which is a most important difference.  The programme is also designed to be inclusive and gives a commitment to full consultation with staff and unions on the implementation of <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  This will be critical for the success of the initiative.</P>
    <P>I wish to reassure Senator McAughtry on this last point since he expressed concern that the unions would not be sufficiently involved in the implementation process of <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  Indeed, he drew upon his experience with the British reform programme. The Civil Service unions and ICTU will be represented on the new co-ordinating group of which I spoke when I commenced statements in this House.  This group will oversee the implementation of this programme of change for the Civil Service, validate reviews of programmes as requested by Government and report regularly to Government on the progress of the change programme and the SMI.</P>
    <P>In this way the unions will have a central involvement in the progression of SMI.  Overall, the group will be representative of civil and public servants, consumers and the private sector. Working groups are being established to work out the details on the key areas identified in the report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Senator Cotter said that &ldquo;those involved in changes should have a big input&rdquo;.  I am in full agreement with him and that is why, alongside the working groups, participative structures will be established in all Departments to involve staff at all levels in bringing this process forward.</P>
    <P>This process of inclusion has already begun within the Civil Service.  At the time of the launch of this programme on 2 May last, civil servants in every Department and Office around the country were given details of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> in organised briefing sessions.  Summaries of the main report were made available to everyone with explanatory leaflets tailored to meet the needs of each individual organisation within the Civil Service.  The establishment of structures to enable staff to have an input into the working groups will build on this.</P>
    <P>External groups will also be included in the consultation process.  Initially, provision for wide public consultation has been made through the provision of a general information leaflet on this programme of reform which is available at Departments and Offices around the country.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Dardis was concerned, as were Senator Roche and many others, that consumers might not be fully consulted on the implementation of <i>Delivering Better Government.</i> I can assure him that they will be an important part of the process.  As part of the quality service initiative, a process to ensure continuing consultation with, and feedback from, the public will also be put in place.  This will include periodic customer surveys in order to benchmark improvements in service and relevant research.</P>
    <P>These are some of the main reasons I am confident that this programme of reform will see results in the Civil Service. I take Senator Lee's point that this report contains no analysis of where previous reform initiatives went wrong, but I think it can be taken that important lessons have been learned <Col N="1320" /> from previous attempts to reform the Civil Service.  These have been reflected in the way this initiative has been put together and the action it is now proposed to take.  In particular, a very different approach to consultation and involvement of staff and unions in bringing the process forward is being adopted.  To date there has been involvement across all Departments at senior level in the preparation of the proposals and I believe the process is supported by very strong political leadership.  I would emphasise in this context the need for cross party support on a continuing basis, and I thank Senator Roche for his comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>As Senator Dardis commented, &ldquo;there is a quality management deficit in the Irish public sector&rdquo;.  To achieve the objective of providing an excellent service to the public, the Civil Service needs to make changes in how it manages performance and in its procedures and processes.  In line with this, it is essential that staff be sufficiently motivated and rewarded for their endeavours. The issue of how to provide incentives for staff was raised during this debate.  I will not pretend that these details have been worked out; it is still an area of great debate, one on which I am keen but which needs to be handled extremely sensitively.  Nevertheless, it must be addressed.  These are previously uncharted territories and it is planned to engage consultants to assist in translating high level objectives into key day-to-day activities and to develop and implement a coherent performance management system.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate all-party support on the need to engage expertise where it does not exist to manage the enormous programme of change involved in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  We cannot afford to play political footsie with this issue.  In fact, to get value for money and achieve our objectives for change, we need to have the best expertise available to us on a contract or consultancy basis, and I would appreciate support on that matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> The issue of numbers in the Civil Service also becomes an issue in the pursuit of efficiency.  Senator O'Kennedy spoke about this at length &mdash; it was one of the contributions I found hard to grasp and understand.  It was because numbers were increasing at a disproportionate rate that this Government took action to limit the numbers in the Civil Service by means of an embargo.  This was a temporary measure.  Yes, it was a crude unscientific measure but it is now being replaced by the agreement of target staffing levels with the individual Departments.  The key objective of <i>Delivering Better Government</i> is to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness in using resources, particularly human resources, to provide the highest quality services.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis remarked that &ldquo;there seems to be a perception that the Civil Service is removed from mainstream economic activity&rdquo;.  While this perception may exist it is certainly not the case. An effective and efficient Civil Service is one of the key determinants of national competitiveness.  We must ensure that the Civil Service and public service of this country contribute in a more competitive way to the economic and social development of this country. In fact, I see the success of both the public service and the private sector inextricably linked in a symbiotic way. The one cannot survive and thrive without the other.  It is not a them and us situation; it is only together, rather than in any confrontational or combative way, that we can achieve results.</P>
    <P>The best way of delivering services has also been raised and, in particular, <i>Delivering Better Government</i> recommends that provision be made in the general legislative framework to permit the delegation of certain tasks to executive agencies or other appropriate bodies. This is an issue which deserves, and will receive, much further attention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Delivering Better Government</i> represents an ambitious programme of reform but it is not an unrealistic one. The adoption of this radical programme for change will ultimately result in an <Col N="1322" /> Irish public service which will be geared to the achievement of the goals and objectives of this country and will strengthen and deepen the relationship between Government and the citizen.  It will ensure that the functions of Government are carried out in the most efficient manner possible and through the most appropriate channels. However, it must be stressed that change as fundamental and farreaching as that recommended in this report will not happen overnight.  We are not in the business of quick-fix solutions; we are more concerned with seeing this process through.  I have every confidence this will happen with consistent commitment across the Civil Service and, indeed, consistent all-party commitment to see the change through.  I thank the Senators for their constructive contributions.</P>

      <P>What is in this section is what is stated in the convention.  It is not open to us to amend the convention by way of an amendment to the legislation. I share the Senator's concerns about delays in settling claims.  This is a civil liability matter and such claims often go to court, not just in the case of shipping claims but for motor or fire insurance claims.  Delays in court hearings and processes may mean that people have to wait for their entitlements.</P>
      <P>I hope that with the overall review of the courts system and the manner in which claims are dealt with nowadays, where liability is clear and there is a limit to the total amount claimed, it would be paid without fuss.  There are cases in which liability is disputed and, if that happens, the claimant has to wait for the court hearings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 38 refers to a &ldquo;master&rdquo; as &ldquo;...the person having, for the time being, the command or charge of the ship;&rdquo;.  Does that cover a pilot?  In the Shannon Estuary a ship's captain may hand over to a pilot at Scattery Island to pilot the ship to Moneypoint, Tarbert or Limerick.  This can be the most dangerous part of a voyage.  Does the definition of &ldquo;master&rdquo; include the pilot who is in charge of the ship in such circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to article 7, I was anxious that we would strengthen the provision by including a time limit on claims.  Comment was made recently about protracted delays in dealing with claims, especially where loss of life or injury to persons is involved.  The convention may fix a time but it is not clear from the Bill whether there is a time limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have in mind that claims for loss of life or personal injury to passengers on a ship should be investigated and adjudicated upon within 30 or 60 days.  There can be inordinate delays in cases where there are claims arising <Col N="1326" /> from loss of life.  It might be useful to specify a time frame rather than have claims left in abeyance for months or years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say in response to the Senator's fears about delays which I share is that a fund is established with a maximum liability.  In the event of a disaster, one divides a claim into the total fund for 500 plus passengers. If there were 500 unfortunates on board a vessel which went down, the maximum liability would apply so one could pay out without any dispute.  I looked at the Senator's suggestion but it is not possible to amend this article which is part of a convention we are not entitled to amend.  It is not like other legislation to which I could accept an amendment.  I would have no problem inserting time limits because very often people are left without when matters should be settled more quickly, but unfortunately I cannot do so.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Criminal Justice Act, 1994 (Section 44) Regulations, 1996</P>
      <P>a copy of which was laid in draft before the Seanad on the 13th day of March, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to seek the approval of Seanad Éireann for the making of these regulations under section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  The purpose of the regulations is to enable drug trafficking money being imported into or exported from the State in the form of cash to be seized.  They prescribe the amount of money above which suspected <Col N="1330" /> drug trafficking cash may be seized under section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act, and their enactment will allow that section, and Part VI of the Act, to be fully implemented</P>
      <P>Section 38 empowers the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers to seize cash relating to drug trafficking which is being imported into or exported from the State provided the sum is not less than a certain amount to be prescribed under section 44.  Under these regulations I propose to prescribe that amount as £5,000.  This is an important step in the progressive implementation of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which, among other things, provides for the recovery of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious offences and creates the offence of money laundering.</P>
      <P>This important Act was introduced by my predecessor, but regulations were required to implement many of its sections.  The impression was given that once the Act was passed, its provisions were available to the Garda and the customs authorities.  Since I took office my first priority was the implementation of the anti money laundering measures contained in sections 32 and 57 of the Act.  I made a commencement order bringing sections 32 and 57 into operation with effect from May last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 32 of the Act requires financial bodies to take certain steps concerning the identification of customers in order to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering.  In particular, the section obliges a financial institution to identify any person for whom it proposes to provide an ongoing service &mdash; for example, opening a savings account &mdash; or for whom it undertakes a transaction involving a sum in excess of £10,000.  Much work had to be done to put in place the necessary procedures to enable the provision to be operated.  The other provision which I brought into effect as a priority, section 57 of the Act, provides that a financial <Col N="1331" /> body must make a report to the Garda Síochána where it suspects that money laundering is taking place in relation to its business.  This reporting requirement is a potentially important development in the law against money laundering.</P>
    <P>Since the implementation of section 57 in May last year, 199 notifications from May to December 1995 and 86 notifications from January to the end of April 1996 were made to the Garda of suspicious transactions.  It is not yet known whether all the transactions are anything other than innocent.  It could be money from inheritances, etc., but the Act is working in the sense that financial institutions are making reports to the Garda.  Each transaction is examined and if the Garda is satisfied the source of the money is drugs or other illegal activity, action will be taken in the courts.  The advantages of section 57 of the money laundering legislation are already apparent.</P>
    <P>My next priority was to give full effect to Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act, concerning the seizure of drug trafficking cash, and the draft regulations before the House will achieve this move.  However, I once again had to ensure the necessary arrangements were in place at operational level so the new powers could be used effectively.  I am satisfied that, with the establishment of the Garda national drugs unit and the development of a memorandum of understanding between the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise, the way is now clear for the co-ordinated implementation of Part VI of the Act.</P>
    <P>Drug trafficking generates large amounts of cash and supplies of illegal drugs are generally purchased in cash.  I heard some of last week's debate in the House during which Members attempted to put some ball park figures on the type of cash involved in drug trafficking.  Consignments of cash which are derived from or intended for use in <Col N="1332" /> drug trafficking are regularly moved across international borders.  Section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act gives our authorities the power to seize such consignments. With the passing of the regulations a member of the Garda Síochána or a Customs and Excise officer will now be able to seize and detain cash which is being imported into or exported from the State where the amount is of a value of £5,000 or more and where the garda or Customs and Excise officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the cash is derived from, or is intended to be used in, drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Any cash so seized can initially be detained for a period of 48 hours.  An order for the continued detention of the cash may be made by the District Court for a period up to three months and further such orders may be made for a total period of two years.  Furthermore, the seized cash may be forfeited if, on application to it, the Circuit Court is satisfied that the cash represents drug trafficking proceeds or was intended for use in drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>In prescribing the minimum amount of cash that may be seized, I have opted to set the sum at £5,000.  This is a strong measure, but I am confident that its effects will be felt by drug traffickers and not by anyone legitimately taking cash into or out of the country.  The limit of £5,000 and the terms of section 38 of the Act will ensure that this measure is properly targeted.  I aim to ensure effective action is taken by the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise in seizing cash consignments of the size associated with drug trafficking.  In electing for the amount of £5,000, I am proposing tougher measures than those in effect in the UK, for example, where the amount is fixed at £10,000.  This demonstrates the Government's determination to tackle drug trafficking and in particular to punish those who deal in drugs by depriving them of their illegal gains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> This is an important step in the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act. Most of the Act is now fully in force and a great deal of work has been done in my Department preparing the ground for the implementation of the remainder of the Act.  I will be bringing forward further measures that will bring into force the remaining parts of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which do not yet have effect.  Let me briefly outline my plans in this regard for the information of the House.</P>
    <P>I will shortly bring into operation Part V of the Act.  Part V provides that anything that would constitute a drug trafficking offence if done on land in the State will also be an offence if done on an Irish ship.  In addition, the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise officers and members of the Naval Service will be empowered to stop, board, search and detain a ship which is suspected of being used in drug trafficking, even if the ship is outside Irish territorial waters. This will form an important element in our co-operation with the international community in combating drug trafficking at sea, a problem which of its very nature demands a united and co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>I will also be greatly strengthening Ireland's role in international co-operation against crime by bringing into operation Part VII of the Criminal Justice Act.  This will enable Ireland to sign and ratify the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, a long overdue development in our criminal law and one which will enable us to play a full part in the co-operation with other countries which is so necessary in today's world.  In addition, I will be bringing regulations before this House, under Part VII, which will provide for the enforcement, by means of orders under Irish law, of orders made by foreign courts for the confiscation and forfeiture of property acquired by or as a result of drug trafficking offences or other serious crimes.  These measures <Col N="1334" /> will strengthen the hands of the law enforcement agencies in this country and abroad in dealing with the drugs menace.</P>
    <P>Tough measures must be taken to deal with the drugs problem, and the impact it has on other crime.  These regulations, in conjunction with the other developments, will send out a clear and unmistakable signal to anyone involved in drug trafficking that we mean business.  I ask the House to endorse the making of these regulations by approving the motion before it.</P>
    <P>When taking up office I immediately took out this legislation which had been passed before I entered office and realised that many of its vital sections were only enabling sections.  Although the Oireachtas had passed them, they required regulations and I set about putting those regulations in place.  I have heard certain criticisms about waiting until May of last year to implement sections 38 and 57.  I want to make it clear that when I took office there had already been an arrangement made with all the financial institutions.  They needed a period up to April to train their staff because it was going to be an offence for them if they did not make this information available through lack of knowledge or experience.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that since I took office, I implemented the sections involving this State which were immediately necessary.  This regulation involves money that might be going out of or coming in to this country.  The various elements of the legislation are being drawn together gradually so that people involved in drug trafficking cannot slip through the net.  I hope that when this regulation is in place along with the remaining regulations we will have watertight legislation to cut off drug traffickers from coming into this country. There are other methods which they use and we must continue to look at our legislation to do that but I am satisfied that, in implementing section 44, we are <Col N="1335" /> taking another step in anti-drug trafficking legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this measure.  I do not regard this as an appropriate time to have a general debate on the drugs issue because we are dealing here with a specific statutory instrument.  The Minister has made some general remarks to which I would like to respond.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been properly advised on the figure of £5,000.  Will she give some rationale on why that figure was selected as the prescribed sum? One would not like to think that, by bringing in single amounts of £4,999, drug traffickers could escape notice or liability.  Am I being unduly alarmist?  If that is the appropriate amount, it will be supported on this side of the House.  We are prepared to co-operate and assist the Government.  Fianna Fáil does not have a monopoly on concern about the drugs issue.  The Government has a genuine concern, but I do not agree with everything it does.  There are internal complications in dealing with the drugs issue but the Taoiseach said yesterday, in response to the leader of my party, that he was concerned about this problem and it was at the top of the Government's agenda.  I believe this to be the case.</P>
      <P>We do not know what prosecutions are going to take place as a result of notifications.  It would be interesting if we could monitor statistically the number of indictments or prosecutions which will arise out of these notifications because we would be able to evaluate whether the system is working. If, at the end of that period of notifications, there have been two convictions out of 199, that will be a worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of not wanting anyone to slip through the net.  Nothing should be outside our consideration.  My concern is that some solicitors use the cloak of legal representation to channel <Col N="1336" /> funds on behalf of people who may or may not be involved in drug trafficking. There are certainly a few cases.  It might not always be a case of a solicitor knowing a person is a drug trafficker, but there does come a time &mdash; they may have a client who sails in and out of some inlet in County Cork or Kerry and is at the same time ferrying large amounts of money through a client account &mdash; when a reasonable suspicion can arise.  Some solicitors in this country have a fair idea that they are acting in a legal capacity for drug traffickers.</P>
    <P>I suspect &mdash; I have not yet reached a definitive opinion on it &mdash; that this mechanism is a possible way of circumventing the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and I strongly urge the Minister to look into this matter.  It would not be enough for the Minister to say that this is a matter for the Law Society.  The society is primarily charged with the responsibility of ensuring that all the books of its solicitors are in order.  Its real concern is for the clients of the solicitors, clients' accounts, etc.  I ask the Minister to examine that issue in the light of drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>I said I would not make any general remarks about the drugs problem.  The last time we had a general debate on the matter the Minister accused me of trying to stir up the crisis by calling it as such.  I cannot claim to have been in public life as long as the Minister but I have been a member of an inner city local authority area since 1985.  This was a bad problem in the inner city in the late 1980s but the drugs situation is currently just as serious in parts of the inner city.  In parts of my own area, not a million miles from here, unfortunate drug addicts &mdash; they are the victims of the mobsters and traffickers who prey on them &mdash; are openly injecting themselves with drugs on waste ground to the knowledge of the entire community. When you go to the door of the person next door and try to explain to him that you are doing something about the <Col N="1337" /> drugs problem, you are not believed. The problem is so serious that anything we can do to alleviate the matter must be done.</P>
    <P>In another part of my constituency, somebody whom the Garda believes is involved in this trade has bought an expensive house but has no visible means of support.  The Minister discussed the matter at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. However, there is a general feeling of bewilderment among the public that these people who have no visible means of support can live in such luxurious houses.  Is the Minister entirely satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners or the Garda have the legislative ability, the resources or the manpower to get to the bottom of this matter?</P>
    <P>Several requests were made this morning for more debates on the crime situation.  People will want to know how many of these people's means are examined. How many of them are given the once over?  Some people say that even if officers of the Revenue Commissioners were to call to the drug barons' houses, they would be told that where they live was known and that they would &ldquo;get&rdquo; them.  Is there any support for people working in the Revenue Commissioners? If their houses are or are threatened to be burnt down by a drugs baron, what protection do they have? Are they indemnified by the State?  Will they get full protection from it?  Everything we have should be mobilised for this fight.  Even changing the onus of proof in the case of drug trafficking offences should deserve serious consideration. Some people might say this might be illiberal but the situation is so grave that such extreme measures may be required.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister read the piece in the <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 May concerning the speech made by the leader of Democratic Left at its Ard Fheis.  It said that: &ldquo;Democratic Left will not play any part in the erosion of civil <Col N="1338" /> liberties and we will protect the rights of those who are victims of crime with the same tenacity....  We must support local communities in their fight against drugs&rdquo;.  The tone and emphasis of this speech left me a little worried about the Democratic Left input into the law and order policy of this Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that section 44 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, will now come into effect.  It is an important part of the Act.  The fact that, as already mentioned, many of those involved in drug trafficking lead very affluent lifestyles and are able to move cash in a reasonably easy way is of some concern and must be stopped in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important things the Minister said in her speech was that tough measures must be taken to deal with the drugs problem and the impact it has on other crime.  Few people would not agree with that and not support the Minister's actions in this regard.  I congratulate the Minister for the progress she has made since she came to office in trying to tackle this problem by bringing in or preparing legislation which still has to come on the stocks and in implementing the powers available to her.  The Garda should be supported <Col N="1339" /> and be given the powers and facilities to tackle this menacing problem.</P>
    <P>Under these regulations the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers will have power to seize cash relating to drug trafficking which is being imported into or exported from the State, providing that the sum is not less than the amount of £5,000.  This is an important step in progressing the Criminal Justice Act.  Financial bodies have a responsibility and a duty to ensure they are not used by drug traffickers who abuse young people by trading in their deadly merchandise.</P>
    <P>Financial institutions now have a duty and will be required by law to report questionable transactions of over £5,000.  It is significant that 99 notifications were made between May and December last year and 86 notifications were made up to the end of April this year.  That demonstrates how effective this section of the Act can be.  There was a total of 185 notifications in 12 months before all the powers under the Act were implemented.  One must welcome that result and congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the establishment of the Garda national drugs unit.  I hope it will be effective and will be given the resources to ensure its effectiveness in combating this terrible problem.  In 1989 I put a motion before the House which emanated from the Garda Síochána.  It reflected their concern that opening the borders in Europe would have an effect on drug trafficking.  As early as 1988 it was signalled that this issue could arise with the opening of the borders.  The people who were concerned, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, were quick to indicate that this would happen and now we must tackle it.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency we will have a duty to promote European coastal drug policing arrangements.  It will be impossible for Ireland to effectively <Col N="1340" /> police the full extent of our coasts and there must be European involvement. This matter has been discussed in the European Parliament on a number of occasions and it has been championed by John Cushnahan.  This House should support the call for assistance from Europe to police our coasts, because it is not only an Irish problem but a European problem.  The number of seizures throughout Europe is growing each year, but they still reflect only about 10 per cent of the level of drug trafficking. That exposes the size of the problem which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The European drugs unit in The Hague has police liaison officers from all member states and they deal with the control of drugs and drug trafficking. Seventy seven per cent of their time is taken up with dealing with the drugs situation and the balance is consumed by dealing with money laundering.  The time and effort they spend on the money laundering problem is growing every year.  It is seen by the police in Europe as an important means of tackling the drugs problem because it means one can punish the drugs barons where it hurts most, in their pockets.  The amounts of money involved range from thousands to millions of pounds and if those sums are confiscated it will hit the barons very hard.</P>
    <P>Drugs are a European problem.  The Minister is taking action today to ensure that we deal with the money laundering problem in our jurisdiction, but it is important that it is dealt with on a European basis.  The European drugs unit investigates hundreds of companies involved in money laundering.  Compare the illegal movement of money with the illegal movement of people &mdash; it is 12 to 14 per cent in the case of illegal money while illegal movement of people amounts to 4 per cent.  The European drugs unit should be strengthened and supported and should be involved in policing the European coasts, especially the Irish coast.  In relative terms the <Col N="1341" /> Irish coast with its many inlets is very exposed.  We have already seen large seizures taking place in Cork and Clare, but the worry is how much are we seizing. Is it 10 per cent or 25 per cent?  I believe we would be lucky to seize 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of the early implementation of further sections of the Act.  When the Act was going through the Seanad we discussed its provisions in detail.  It is an effective means of trying to control the drugs problem.  The early implementation of more sections of the Act should ensure that the Garda will have more effective powers to deal with this problem which is causing havoc in young people's lives.  Senator Mulcahy selectively quoted from statements made by the leader of Democratic Left, Deputy Prionsias De Rossa.  He would have been more honest if he had quoted the full text.  Democratic Left fully supports control of the drugs problem; nobody is more supportive than that party's Deputies.  In their constituencies they can see the effect drug barons have on the ordinary people who are the victims. The Deputy should have been less selective in his quote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first paragraph of the motion states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Criminal Justice Act, 1994....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine if that date had read 1974; would we be in quite such a mess with drugs as we are at present?  It is very sad that we have taken so long to react to the serious drugs problem.  We are all to blame.  I remember attending an IMO meeting years ago and being shown small amounts of drugs by those who were involved in the drugs unit in Jervis Street, but we did not take it seriously enough.  If we had introduced legislation and regulations such as this 20 years ago <Col N="1342" /> we might not be in this terrible mess with drugs.</P>
    <P>The regulations are very important. For too long we have tackled the unimportant people in the drugs trade, the people who deal with only small amounts of money.  I was interested to hear Mr. Hynes of An Post speaking on behalf of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. He said that the direct cost of the drugs problem to Dublin businesses was about £150 million.  We are talking about huge problems and huge amounts of money and I am glad the Minister is tackling it.</P>
    <P>The sum of £5,000 is the correct figure to include in the regulations.  If somebody is carrying more than £5,000 in cash it would be nice if they could account for it.  If the Garda meet somebody travelling between the city centre and the airport with £5,000 in their possession, can they detain that person or must they wait until the person is on his or her way out of the country?  Do sections 32 and 57 of the Act cover financial institutions in the financial services sector?  Huge sums of money can be transferred very easily electronically and I do not know if those institutions are covered in the same way as building societies, banks and so forth.  Could this be a possible loophole?</P>
    <P>I was horrified to hear Senator Mulcahy's suggestion of corruption even among a small number of solicitors and that they would use client accounts to move money.  I was dismayed, but I presume he must have grounds for making the suggestion.  I hope that if he has information in that regard it will be investigated because it would be terrible to think that the legal profession, in which we have such confidence, could become so involved.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Neville, I hope that Part V is implemented as soon as possible. The Minister will be familiar with Mr. Barry Galvin, the State solicitor for Cork, who for the past ten years has highlighted the problem of the importation <Col N="1343" /> of drugs through the Cork area.  It is impossible to police this area without international co-operation because we lack the resources to do so.  During Ireland's Presidency of the EU, I hope the Minister will show our willingness to co-operate but will also request international co-operation on this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope people who are offered large sums of money as cash payment will inquire about the origin of such money. People seem to find it excusable if such money is &ldquo;hot&rdquo; because tax has not been paid on it.  However, they must inquire if that money originated in the drugs trade and, if so, realise the damage that trade is doing to people throughout the country.  No one would object if this money was obtained from the sale of property, etc.  Anyone who has dealt with drug addicts, attended the clinics in which they are treated or visited the penal institutions in which they are housed will be aware of the reality. Drug addicts make up the majority of inmates in women's prisons.  Property, goods and cash are very important but the devastation visited upon people with drug problems is incredible.  As I understand it, some payments involve major amounts of cash and I hope people will begin to question the origin of such money.  The most amazing people seem to be involved in what must now be termed the drugs &ldquo;industry&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I regret that time is not available to fully discuss the implications.  We are dealing with what can only be described as a plague or an epidemic which is undermining the core of society.  As a representative of a rural constituency I must state that, while the problems, law-lessness and vigilante actions in Dublin have horrified everyone, this problem is not confined to the capital city.  The stable, healthy and happy communities with which we were familiar in towns <Col N="1344" /> and villages are being undermined by this plague.  For this reason I support any action that will rid us of that plague and change the nature of our country.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that this matter now involves international and domestic co-ordination and co-operation.  This is very important.  However, I will begin by referring to Senator Henry's point about confiscating sums in excess of £5,000.  The world has changed since we last talked in terms of &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; money.  The reality is that money now takes the form of a message which can be transferred between financial institutions at the press of a button.  This is being done through respectable establishments and banks in Switzerland and elsewhere.  Money is being transferred across the globe by computer in the form of a message that someone has funds to invest.  Money is no longer carried through airports in bundles of £5,000 or £10,000.  In some cases it might be, but generally wealthy industrialists do not carry money with them in bags.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of fundamental issues about the financial services and offshore accounting that have become a feature of modern society. When addressing this issue, I feel like Cato in the Roman Senate who stated &ldquo;<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>&rdquo;.  I will not translate this quotation to my colleagues who have classical allusions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Numbered bank accounts which have become a feature of establishment banking throughout the world, particularly in Switzerland, are an open invitation to horrific criminals engaged in the harvesting or international distribution of illegal drugs. The economy and society of Galicia in Spain have been undermined because it is situated on the drugs trail.  What action is the international community taking to deal with this problem?  These <Col N="1345" /> people must not be permitted to continue to operate with impunity in this way.  It is time the Minister for Justice and her colleagues in Government insisted that this system be stopped.</P>
      <P>How are we to know the origin of funds invested in the most respectable banks in the world?  Such funds may have been &ldquo;earned&rdquo; off the back of oppression and suffering.  The regulations involve tackling people carrying £5,000 to or from an airport but this is not the level at which we must deal with this problem.  These people are very sophisticated.  Can the Minister propose initiatives to deal with this problem?  If not, our response will be reactionary as it has been in other areas.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to the international co-ordination.  If each country decides to treat drug addicts caught committing criminal offences &mdash; drug barons actually welcome this development &mdash; governments must effectively co-ordinate programmes at international level to place these addicts under their protection and provide a regulated and controlled supply of therapeutic drugs.  This must be done because, in the wrong hands, many drugs used for normal medical purposes can be deadly.  One of my colleagues with medical expertise recently stated that heroin is properly and effectively used for therapeutic medical treatment. Heroin becomes dangerous when it is abused.  There is a strong case for governments, through their Ministers for Health, stating very emphatically that they cannot win if they merely react to criminal drug barons.  However, governments can act together to reduce the demand by effectively regulating the source of supply of illegal drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People involved in drugs agencies in America informed me that the criminal barons involved in the distribution and harvesting of illegal drugs want governments to respond in a reactionary manner. They can control the supply of <Col N="1346" /> drugs outside the law and make millions in much the same way as the bootleggers during Prohibition in America in the 1930s.  We must begin to consider how international governments can act together.  This must be done in conjunction with my suggestion relating to financial services.  How will control of the supply of drugs be taken out of the hands of drug barons?  It is time we took the necessary steps in this regard.  I welcome co-ordination between governments but I worry that we are reacting and making commitments which will not lead to the desired changes being made.</P>
    <P>Drug barons are permitted to operate outside the law, which is what they want to do, and we react by introducing new powers and regulations.  They do not care about powers and regulations. They have their own corrupt empire, which grows daily more menacing and powerful than the democratic states we try to represent.  It is time we introduced new, progressive and effective thinking into this debate to ensure we are on top of the problem.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what Senator Neville said about how 12 to 14 per cent of money moved internationally is legal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that group in Holland would have a reasonable insight into the situation.  They are only talking about 12 to 14 per cent of the money being moved which they have been able to identify.  It is time for the governments of the world &mdash; and our European colleagues have a special responsibility in this area &mdash; to work together and look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to what I said, I welcome the Minister's domestic regulations and restrictions.  However, I do not think she indulges in the illusion that, even if this was really efficient, this island could effectively keep out this horrible plague. We can do much more in terms of co-ordination <Col N="1347" /> but I do not want to give the impression that reacting here will do it alone.</P>
    <P>The training and education of our Garda is very important.  We have an excellent college in Templemore which is internationally recognised as a prototype of the standard of academic and practical training.  However, there is great unease there at the moment about the Minister's proposals to designate the college as a Garda district.  The college is not just another Garda district in Cork or Kerry; it is a very different element.  In terms of its representation on the Garda representative body, I ask the Minister to look at that in a more enlightened way.  It is very different to the Nenagh, Thurles, Clonmel or Waterford districts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the capacity and commitment of the Garda Síochána.  We have to realise they have a very special role to play, particularly in the fight against drugs.  We will do anything we can to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who participated in this debate which, as they all said, is specifically dealing with the making of regulations under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  It is obviously not the time for a full and wide scale debate on drugs.  I have already been in this House a number of times for such a debate, and I know the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was also here recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate evolves I, as Minister for Justice, am increasingly subject to questions and comments which are more relevant to the areas of education and health.  The justice area is the end of the line for people who are already addicts and have become involved in the area of criminal justice.  That is why the Government's proposals in July 1995 put forward the need for a co-ordinated approach between all the relevant Departments.  Customs, the Revenue <Col N="1348" /> Commissioners, the Departments of Health and Education, employment policy and policies for marginalised communities all play a part in tackling the scourge of drugs.  As Minister for Justice, I am doing all I can to tackle it from my side.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of whether £5,000 is an appropriate sum. As I said, the UK has pitched the sum at £10,000, which I think is too high.  I took some soundings; business people sometimes carry sums of up to £5,000.  I feel £5,000 is a sufficiently low figure on which to question a person about why they are carrying so much money.  Nowadays, with plastic and other methods of moving money, legitimate business people do not tend to carry bags of cash in their suitcases.  However, I will keep it under review.  If £5,000 turns out to be too high or if the Garda spend their time questioning legitimate business people &mdash; although I think it is very foolish to carry £5,000 or £10,000 in cash for legitimate reasons &mdash; we will look at it again.</P>
    <P>Senators said that not all drugs money flows in this way.  However, much of it does because it is a cash business.  Drug dealers do not accept a cheque as payment for a stash of heroin.  It is very much a cash oriented business.  There is a great deal of money laundering, involving illegal business transactions, through computers.  One bank manager said to me recently that their bank lost about £5,000 in ordinary crimes, such as robberies, in 1994 but it lost hundreds of thousands of pounds in white collar crime through the electronic laundering of money through the system without any cash changing hands.</P>
    <P>Section 32 covers all bodies licensed to carry on banking business under the Central Bank Act, 1871.  It also covers all bodies authorised to carry on such business under European regulations. All financial centres are covered and must report money transactions over £10,000 under section 57 of the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Senator Mulcahy raised a relevant question to which I do not have the answer yet because I do not know how many prosecutions have arisen from the 280 notifications under the regulations which I implemented last May for the reporting by institutions of suspicious lodgments over £10,000.  However, that will become apparent in the fullness of time.  Two cases were sent forward by the DPP in 1995.  One of them collapsed because the case did not proceed to court.  In the other case, the assets were not confiscated because the person was acquitted.  However, I have no doubt that some of those 280 notifications will lead to serious investigation and, perhaps, prosecution.  It is for the DPP and the Garda Síochána to bring that to finality.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy said he was fearful some solicitors might use the cloak of legal representation to channel and launder funds for their clients.  Under section 31 anyone, including solicitors, laundering the proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence with a minimum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Therefore, solicitors cannot hide. Senator Mulcahy might have been getting to the point that solicitors <i>per se</i> are not designated as financial institutions. However, they still can be found guilty of assisting, aiding and abetting money laundering exercises.  As we see the Act operating, I will keep section 32 and section 57 under close review and scrutiny. It is a little soon to say how well it is working other than to report that there have been a number of notifications, which is a sign that it has been working.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of whether somebody driving from the airport might be stopped. Section 38 applies to cash being imported or exported.  This must be applied by the Garda and the customs in the circumstances of a case.  There must be evidence that the persons were travelling <Col N="1350" /> to or from the airport or seaport.  It is not just a case of stopping people on the basis that because they are five miles from the airport they must be going there.  Other laws cover situations where the Garda stop people with large sums of money on them where they suspect that a felony has been committed.</P>
    <P>However, there will be a common sense, practical implementation of this regulation.  As it stands now the customs have power.  If they do not examine people at the airport they can stop them on their way from the airport on the basis that they have reason to believe that they have smuggled or brought goods into the country and have not had customs duties paid on them.  It is not, therefore, just a situation of them being in the immediate curtilage of an airport or seaport; there must be some evidence that they were on their way to export or import this money.  It will depend on the circumstances. No attempt has been made to define or curtail the meaning of the words &ldquo;import&rdquo; or &ldquo;export&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These are new powers.  They will have to be watched carefully to ensure they are operating properly.  When this legislation was discussed in the Dáil and the Seanad in 1994, before it was enacted, an examination was made of these loopholes. I am now in the process of putting these regulations into place.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, the issue of the white collar transfer of assets etc. is being looked at by large businesses.  Price Waterhouse undertook a major study on a number of businesses to ascertain the extent of this fraudulent behaviour. The situation is very frightening; it is going on behind the shirts, ties, collars and good suits of what are otherwise referred to as respectable business people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be something about which Senator O'Kennedy has direct knowledge.  I do not want to accuse any bank of this.  Nevertheless, large amounts of money are being fraudulently obtained and stolen from many financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned a figure with regard to the profits from drugs.  I visited the EDU offices as recently as Tuesday morning.  I was provided with assessment by INTERPOL that the profit annually from illegal drugs is £300 billion.  This is twice as much as the legitimate profits from the pharmaceutical industry.  People in Ireland are not making £300 billion; it is a world-wide problem of gargantuan proportions. This is why each of us must play our part nationally.</P>
      <P>However, the next section of the legislation I implement will be in respect of enhanced international co-operation. For example, Part VII will provide for the enforcement, by means of orders under Irish law, of orders made by foreign courts for the confiscation and forfeiture of property acquired by or as a result of drug trafficking offences. Criminals will not, therefore, be able to hide their assets in this country once this section is operative and there is enhanced co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, under the EDU, there has been huge co-operation between liaison officers from country to country.  We are involved daily in the EDU through our two representatives there, Inspector Noel Keane, and our other representative who is an expert on computerisation. They are dealing with their colleagues on a daily basis.  Many investigations are ongoing which cross numbers of countries and, more frighteningly, which involve hundreds of companies with regard to money laundering exercises.  Where there is a suspicion that a transaction in a bank is in some way illegal it is phenomenal and frightening to note how the tentacles spread out, not only from the country concerned <Col N="1352" /> but throughout Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>This is what we are dealing with nowadays. None of us can be complacent that in any regulations we introduce we have the full answer.  However, I assure Senators that we will watch this legislation take hold and examine it to ensure that it does what we want it to do.  In this respect I will pass on to the Minister for Finance some of the points that have been made regarding exchange controls and the movement of money.  The House can be assured of the involvement of my Department in bringing in the regulations that we feel the Garda need here.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry said that this regulation should have been dated for 1974 or even 1984.  I do not believe that we as a society realised in those years just how virulent this problem of drugs could become as it progressed.  We are realising it now.  The drug trafficking legislation which will allow for seven days detention was not allowable in the 1980s.  Senators and Deputies in this House and the other House rejected that kind of legislation on the basis that it was too penal and would take away too much liberty.  However, we have sadly moved into a situation where we must have this kind of hard legislation to tackle what is a major problem.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their support in implementing these regulations.  They can be assured that I will return to the House with the remaining regulations so that we can have the whole of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sad and uncomfortable at having to raise this issue in this manner.  I only do so after exhausting every possibility of resolving the difficulties at local level.  The difficulties concern a school in Bray which operate under the aegis of the vocational education committee.  This is an excellent school with an excellent academic record.  If he looks at the files in his Department the Minister of State will find that I have made many representations on behalf of the school.  I am not, therefore, passing judgment on the teaching quality or on the quality of academic performance.  I am, however, asking that judgment be brought to bear on the manner in which reasonable complaints from constituents are being handled by this school &mdash; the name of which is known to the Minister &mdash; and also, and more specifically, by the statutory authority, the Bray vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>To give the Minister two small examples.  The first involves a man and woman who are well known to me. Their son &mdash; I will use the initial S to identify him &mdash; was attending the school.  On the first day of term he breached the school's dress code in that he wore an earring.  This was an oversight which the parents accepted as such.  They were willing to apologise for it because they believe in strong discipline and a dress code and they would wish to be associated with the school's wish to regulate the performance of its pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child removed the offending earring from his ear and handed it over to the principal, who threw it into the dustbin. When, at 5 o'clock, the child asked for the return of the earring, again apologising &mdash; I know the boy in question; he is a well reared young man &mdash;<Col N="1354" /> he was told that the earring was on its way to the dump.</P>
    <P>When the parents made further contact with the school, they were treated, in my view, in an extraordinary way; the Garda were actually called.  A formal complaint was lodged with the board of management, subsequently; with the vocational education committee and the matter has shuttled back and forth between the vocational education committee and the board of management for months.  The point which really irritates me about this particular case is that when I detailed the case to the Department of Education my correspondence was sent to the vocational education committee in Bray, where it became a matter of some mirth among vocational education committee members.  In my view, that is not the way to handle a proper complaint.</P>
    <P>In the second case, for which I can provide details, involving a Mr. and Mrs. D where after the treatment of one of their children over a period of time they had to remove their children from the school, the couple made complaints to the vocational education committee. In both cases the couples were called before the vocational education committee which looked into the cases and referred the matter back to the board of management.</P>
    <P>The issue I am raising here is that there is no proper procedure, in my view, to handle well structured complaints. I am not a person who would handle a complaint against a school, certainly not one that I believed was in any way vexatious or trivial.  However, the problem here is that there is a body of evidence &mdash; about 17 cases available to me &mdash; where complaints have not been handled properly.  These complaints have been handled in an in-house way by the board of management, on which of course the principal plays a major part, and, subsequently, in a dismissive manner, to say the least, by Bray vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> Individually, these may amount to trivial matters, but collectively there is a body of evidence here to suggest matters are not as they should be.  I ask the Minister, through the Minister of State, to encourage the vocational education committee to put in place some proper process for handling complaints.</P>
    <P>In one set of complaints a number of teachers made letters available to the Department.  Those letters were actually sent to the vocational education committee, and from the there back to the school.  In my view, that will impact on the career of those young teachers.  The letters were handed over because people believed there would be an impartial examination of a series of minor matters, which have now escalated to the point where this must be raised as an issue in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I formally ask the Minister to instruct that a member of the inspectorate meet with the vocational education committee in Bray &mdash; incidentally, I find myself uncomfortable because I have a good relationship with the vocational education committee &mdash; the chief executive officer and the parents in question and put in place a means whereby these particular complaints can be handled.</P>
    <P>I have one other request.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the representative of the National Parents' Council is treated appropriately on the vocational education committee.  A member of the secondary branch of the National Parents' Council is on the vocational education committee and, in my view, the treatment of her is absolutely reprehensible. She is kept in the dark, excluded and treated in a way which borders on the abusive, and that is not right.  Parents have a big stake in education.  This Minister and previous Ministers recognised that and were prepared to encourage vocational education committees to be representative of all sides, including <Col N="1356" /> parents, and that is not what is happening in Bray.</P>
    <P>There is a series of incidents, 17 in all. I do not want to delay the Minister or put individually trivial items before the House, but there is a body of evidence here to suggest that all is not well in the Bray vocational education committee. Certainly, these complaints, which arise from one particular college, have not been handled properly.  Parents are being humiliated; they are being treated in a way which is dismissive, and the National Parents' Council is not getting the kind of representation it should.  In effect, all of this is being handled in a very immature way which reflects badly on the vocational education committee. It will create a gulf between the vocational education committee and the parents, who, together with the children, are the most important partners in education.  I know the Minister will share my concerns on this matter, so I ask him to instruct a member of the inspectorate to go to Bray and put the matter right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should first explain that overall responsibility for the operation and administration of a vocational education committee school rests with the vocational education committee concerned, and the responsible body is Bray vocational education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaints concerning the school in question first came to the attention of my Department in November 1995 when senior officials of the Department met with the parents' representative on the committee.  The representative was advised that responsibility for the operation of the school and its day-to-day management rested with the vocational education committee and the board of management of the school, but if written information was provided on specific incidents of complaint, the matter would be taken up with the vocational <Col N="1357" /> education committee.  However, no written material was provided.</P>
    <P>In March 1996 the Minister received a letter signed by a number of parents and two former teachers at the school requesting a meeting with the Minister and requesting that certain matters be investigated.  The Minister also received representations from Senator Roche on behalf of two of the parents.  It was clear from the letters that the issues had already been raised by the parents with the vocational education committee and had been considered by the vocational education committee on a number of occasions.  The complaints related to the treatment of children and their parents by an employee of the vocational education committee, the non-payment of a book grant to a child and the general ethos and atmosphere of the school.</P>
    <P>In response to the representations from Senator Roche, the vocational education committee was requested to investigate the matters raised by him. The vocational education committee responded to the effect that the issue raised had been considered in great detail by the school's board of management and by Bray vocational education committee.  Following consideration of the reply, a further letter was sent to the vocational education committee on 26 April seeking further clarification.  In that letter the case made by the parents and the former teachers was also referred to and copies of the letters which had been received were sent to the vocational education committee for their consideration.  The vocational education committee was requested to report to the Department as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The procedure for dealing with cases in which complaints are made against a vocational education committee teacher is that the employer of the teacher is made aware of the allegations, and in this case Bray vocational education committee is the employer.  Where specific allegations are made regarding an <Col N="1358" /> employee of a vocational education committee, the vocational education committee, as the employer, has a duty of care to the children in its care and must have these allegations investigated. It is incumbent on the Minister to make the allegations known to the vocational education committee to enable it to discharge its responsibility. Where the complainants indicate that they do not want their identity known outside the Department, this wish is normally acceded to.  Nothing in any of the letters received by the Department in this case indicated that the authors wished to remain anonymous.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer has advised the Department by letter of 21 May that the matter was again considered at a special meeting of Bray vocational education committee on 19 May.  My Department is currently examining the committee's response and shall be responding to Senator Roche and the parents in due course.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very much aware of the concerns of each of the parents involved.  Department officials continue to be available to the parents to assist in the resolution of this issue.  However, the Minister is satisfied that proper procedures were followed by the Department in dealing with this matter.  I will bring the points raised by Senator Roche to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with any of the facts as presented by the Minister except that I do not believe or accept, and any impartial judgment would accord with my view, that Bray vocational education committee has handled this matter properly.  Bray vocational education committee has handled this matter in an extraordinarily dismissive manner.  That is why I have taken the extraordinary step of asking that an inspector be asked to examine the matter in Bray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People's complaints, which may be individually small, were treated in a dismissive, <Col N="1359" /> offhanded and, in my view, unacceptable way.  I know the Minister is as concerned about client service as I am.  I am concerned about my constituents and I defend their interests in the same way as the Minister defends his constituents' interests.  I ask the Minister <Col N="1360" /> to insist that an inspector examine these matters.  I thank the Minister for his time and attention.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 June 1996.</P>
