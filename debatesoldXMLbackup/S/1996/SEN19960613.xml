      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a swimming pool in Wicklow town.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to establish an independent living fund to provide self determination, responsibility and control for Irish people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Sherlock on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide adequate accommodation for 180 pupils and eight teachers at gaelscoil Tomás Dáibhis in Mallow, County Cork.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross and Senator O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Sherlock may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken until 1 o'clock.  There will be a sos until 2 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. onwards to conclude.  I suggest 20 minutes per spokesperson on item 1 and ten minutes thereafter.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Acting Leader that we have 15 minutes per speaker, after the spokespersons, in relation to the Second Stage of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  The Order of Business is agreed.</P>
      <P>In a difficult year for the food industry, I ask my colleagues in the House to go to the RDS to see the Horizons exhibition, which is displaying everything related to the food industry.  It is a tremendous shop window for the Irish food industry.  Those involved in bringing every aspect of the food industry together under the one roof for the first time should be supported and encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what the Leader of the Fianna Fáil group has said about the Horizons exhibition.  I said yesterday on the Bord Bia (Amendment) Bill that exhibitions and conferences of this nature were the way forward. They bring people to the country who see we have a green industry.  It is something we can show them on the ground.  I congratulate the Minister, An Bord Bia and everyone concerned with the initiative.  It is a fine effort and I hope it is successful in increasing our market share.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court yesterday on the Divorce referendum.  When does the Acting Leader expect that legislation to come before the House?  It should progress speedily now that the legal impediment has been removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the House over the past number of years &mdash; and I am a slow learner in that respect &mdash; that <Col N="1855" /> Ministers, when they are perceived to be doing a bad job or when there is a crisis to control, are asked to come to the House to make a statement.  For example, when there is a crisis in the beef industry, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry comes to the House.  We should look at the other side.  In that context I ask that the Minister for Finance be asked to come to the House and make a statement on the economy.  Interest rates are at a historic low level.  Jobs are coming on stream at a historic high level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach continually suggests we can get out of order on the Order of Business by not addressing questions and then suggesting the matter be addressed at a later date or somewhere else.  I noted, and I would like the Cathaoirleach's guidance on this, that many Senators are using scripted speeches.  I understand that, under Standing Orders, Members are not allowed to use scripts in the Seanad; but they may query matters, address the House or quote from notes.  I ask for direction on this.  The Seanad is being downgraded because if scripts are not passed to the newspapers, Members will not be reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader arrange a debate on funding to the National Roads Authority?  When the Leader was on this side of the House he consistently requested a <Col N="1857" /> debate.  The House has been seeking one for years.  Last October the Taoiseach said that he would direct that the Authority, its partners or agents meet the roads authorities in Northern Ireland to consider the serious gap between the two sides of the Border. The southern Border counties have been neglected by the Authority.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate as soon as possible in the House, which will include the Minister for the Environment.  I hope we can reach a satisfactory solution. Both authorities in the North of Ireland stop activities some miles from their side of the Border, as does the National Roads Authority on this side.  This results in a no go area which has been wrongly imposed.  Where does responsibility begin and end?  How is funding spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in the hope that the Government will proceed as swiftly as possible with the divorce legislation as promised.  In this respect the House will welcome the comments made this morning by Deputy Woods and Deputy Keogh.</P>
      <P>It is fair that the House pay tribute to former Member, Des Hanafin, for his behaviour in the way he conducted the opposition campaign.  Much as I fundamentally disagree with him on the issue, he behaved with impeccable fairness.  It is fitting that the House pay tribute to him at the end of a long campaign on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the generous words of Senator Magner.  It is important that in political debate both sides always be put forward.  A marvellous feature of Des Hanafin's campaign was that he was able to put his case with such dignity, given that he was genuinely committed, intellectually and in every other way, to his argument and ultimately accepted the verdict as he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be possible to make time for a debate on the national lottery?  It is almost ten years since the idea of the lottery was first mooted and put into <Col N="1858" /> operation.  There is an unease on all sides at the apparent lack of public knowledge as to where the lottery surplus funds are going.  There is a distinct lack of publication, especially of detail, as to what clubs got funding.  A joint committee of both Houses produced a report some years back which did a good service in respect of the first three years.  I understand that recently the Committee of Public Accounts obtained information.  However, there is a need for a public debate because it is time to review the way in which lottery funds have been allocated and used.  Could the Acting Leader make time at an appropriate stage for a debate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to the time suggested by Senator Wright with regard to the second speaker on item 1 on the Order Paper.  Senator Dardis, Senator Magner and Senator Roche raised the question of the divorce legislation. I welcome the decision.  I understand from remarks made by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that he intends to introduce legislation as soon as possible in the Dáil.  He has already obtained clearance from the Cabinet.  It should have a fairly speedy passage through the Dáil as there is all party agreement on it.  I hope it will be before this House as soon as possible, although I cannot pre-empt how long it will take to pass through the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I also support the remarks on former Senator Des Hanafin.  He conducted his campaign with good humour and took his defeat very gracefully yesterday.  It is the way we should all behave in what-ever conflicts we have in our political lives.  I also welcome the support of the Opposition parties on the introduction of divorce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Townsend is not a slow learner when it comes to using the Order of Business.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will have an opportunity to attend the House.  I do not know if there is any finance business before the end of the session, but if there is it would present an opportunity to discuss the good progress of the economy. <Col N="1859" /> To quote Shakespeare: &ldquo;The evil that men do lives after them, The good is oft interred with their bones.&rdquo;  This reflects the principle expressed by the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lanigan raised the issue of scripted speeches. You have advised on the position regarding Standing Orders, a Chathaoirligh, and I would bow to your wisdom in that regard.  Senator McGowan raised the question of National Roads Authority funding and Senator Roche raised the question of the national lottery. Both are worthy of debate.  It is a question of finding time before the end of the session.  I will advise the Leader of the views expressed that both these items be discussed.</P>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for primary health care services without charge for persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash;<Col N="1860" /> anti-D &mdash; or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.  The services to be provided include: general practitioner services, including prescribed drugs and medicines; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; counselling services; home help services; and home nursing services.</P>
      <P>When the possible link between the anti-D product and hepatitis C was brought to the attention of the Department of Health in February 1994 the immediate concerns were the protection of all future recipients of anti-D and the identification of any risk for any mother who had received the anti-D product in the past.  The first objective was met by the immediate introduction of a new virally inactivated anti-D product to all maternity hospitals and units.  The second objective was met by the national screening programme for anti-D recipients, launched by the Blood Transfusion Services Board (BTSB), which offered screening for hepatitis C for anti-D recipients.</P>
      <P>Some 60,316 women who received anti-D between 1970 and February 1994 have been screened under the national blood screening programme and 994 have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of whom 472 have tested positive for the virus.</P>
      <P>A targeted lookback programme was also undertaken by the BTSB to identify persons who had contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion.  Some 266 living recipients of medium/high risk donations have been traced to date under this programme.  Testing for hepatitis C antibodies has been carried out on 208 persons and 122 of these 208 are antibody positive.  Testing for hepatitis C virus has been carried out on 183 persons.  Some 73 of these persons have evidence of continuing hepatitis C infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The optional testing programme commenced in early September 1995 to trace a small number of persons who may have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion and who would not be traced under the targeted lookback programme. Some 10,439 persons have <Col N="1861" /> come forward for testing to date and 34 of these persons have been confirmed positive for hepatitis C antibodies and 19 of 21 tested, are positive for hepatitis C virus.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing a high quality health service for all persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or a blood product.  Substantial progress has already been made over the last two years in meeting the many complex and varied health care needs of those persons who have contracted hepatitis C. This has been made possible by a process of consultation between the Department of Health and Positive Action, a support group for Anti-D women and their families, Transfusion Positive, a support group for blood transfusion recipients and their families, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society.  Many of the concerns expressed by these groups in relation to future health care arrangements have been addressed.</P>
    <P>The special health care programme involves an extensive range of services in the following areas: secondary health care services, primary health care services, special research programme and a statutory monitoring body.  Secondary health care treatment for those persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion is being provided since early 1994 at special consultant staffed clinics at six designated hospitals &mdash; St James's Hospital, Dublin, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Mater Hospital, Dublin, St, Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>Specific funding has been provided in the Book of Estimates each year to ensure the consolidation and maintenance into the future of a high quality hospital in-patient and out-patient service, including prescribed medication for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product.  The secondary care element of the health care services programme includes provision for access to in-patient <Col N="1862" /> and out-patient treatment; non-payment of hospital charges; appropriate staffing levels and arrangements for staff training; equipment for hepatitis C units; anti-viral therapies and therapy initiation programmes; liver transplantation; treatment outside of Ireland where necessary; liaison between the hospital service providers; and prompt referral to clinicians for conditions associated with hepatitis C.  The treatment services are also available to children and partners who are hepatitis C positive.  The Health Act, 1970, is the statutory basis for the provision of these services.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for specific research in relation to hepatitis C, particularly in view of the fact that hepatitis C was described for the first time in 1989 and that a reliable screening test had only become available in 1991.  My colleague, Deputy Noonan, Minister for Health, has arranged with the Health Research Board for the establishment of a special programme of research on hepatitis C and has provided special funding of £100,000 to enable this programme to commence this year.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the health service as it relates to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion is responsive to the changing needs of such patients, the Minister for Health is establishing a statutory consultative council which will advise him on matters relating to hepatitis C.  The functions of the consultative council will include the monitoring of health and counselling services for persons with hepatitis C; the making of recommendations on the organisation and delivery of services for persons with hepatitis C; publication of information on hepatitis C; and liaison with the Health Research Board in relation to the special programme of hepatitis C research projects.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has circulated a draft establishment order to interested groups for their views.  Following this consultation process, amendments to the draft establishment order <Col N="1863" /> are being considered to take into account the views expressed by these groups.  The Minister will again consult with the interested groups at an early date and following such consultation will formally establish the council.  The secondary health care services, the consultative council and the research programme do not require new legislation as there is already statutory provision for these initiatives.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, is to make provision for primary health care services without charge to persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion. The primary health care services to be provided by the Bill free of charge and without a means test are general practitioner services; drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural services and dental, optical and aural appliances; counselling services in respect of hepatitis C; home help services; home nursing services; and such other services as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general practitioner services, eligible persons may attend the general practitioner of their choice for all medical conditions.  Drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances will be provided to them free of charge for all medical conditions.  The Bill also proposes that dental, ophthalmic and aural services will be provided without charge for eligible persons.  Counselling services, as described in the health care package which was published in December 1995, will be made available to eligible persons.</P>
    <P>Home help services within the meaning of section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, and home nursing services within the meaning of section 60 of the Health Act, 1970, will also be provided free of charge to persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or a blood product.  These arrangements <Col N="1864" /> will also apply to the children and partners of persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or a blood transfusion if such children and partners have also been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will also be made with each of the health boards to designate a specific officer to act as a contact points for individuals and also as a liaison officer with each of the various interest groups whose members will be availing of the services set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides at section 2 that health boards shall make available certain health services without charge to persons who have contracted hepatitis C directly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or blood transfusion.  The chief executive officer of the relevant health board will determine eligibility at his discretion.  It is envisaged that his decision will involve <i>inter alia</i>, consideration of medical opinion submitted by the applicant's treating physician and also that of the board's director of public health.  This provision is intended to allay fears of some members of Transfusion Positive who expressed concern about possible difficulties in the acquisition of past medical records and the determination of proof of contraction of hepatitis C from a blood transfusion.</P>
    <P>As I have already outlined, a range of services will be provided under the Act and preliminary discussions have already taken place with some of the relevant bodies.  Detailed negotiations cannot commence until the necessary legislation is in place.  As soon as the Bill has passed all Stages in both Houses, it is hoped that discussions with health boards and negotiations with appropriate professional groups will be finalised to ensure the services to be provided under the Act for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be available to them at an early date.  The commencement order provision in section 1 (3) will allow time to finalise the necessary arrangements <Col N="1865" /> to ensure the provision of a high quality primary health care service.  Undue delays in the regard are not anticipated.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the health care needs of these persons, the Government, as the Senators are aware, is fully committed to fair compensation for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion.  The Minister for Health established the compensation tribunal on 15 December 1995 and the closing date for receipt of applications is Monday next, 17 June.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Seanad, the total number of persons with hepatitis C who received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has up to yesterday evening received 817 applications and I have been informed by the tribunal that a substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 70 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321.  A sum of approximately £7.5 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected. Payment of an award is made within 28 days of receipt by the tribunal of notification of acceptance of an award.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently, as had been envisaged, and at this stage it has hearing dates arranged until 31 July 1996.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, will copperfasten the Government's commitment to meeting the future health care needs of persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product.  The health care services at primary and secondary care levels will meet the genuine concerns in relation to the continued provision of high quality health care into the future for those who have contracted hepatitis C.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation which will be welcomed not only <Col N="1866" /> by the House, but by many women who have contracted hepatitis C because of negligence by the State.  This Bill would not have been necessary had the Blood Transfusion Service Board not given out faulty products which resulted in people becoming infected.  The Government must introduce legislation to provide hospital, nursing and backup health care, while at the same time provide a mechanism by which people will be compensated.</P>
      <P>There are two issues of concern to the thousand or so women who have been infected.  As regards the method of compensation, we now know that the procedure or mechanism set up by the Minister is totally inadequate as far as the women are concerned.  They disagree with its makeup and they want a tribunal to be established on a statutory basis to give them the opportunity to have their cases heard and to provide them with proper compensation.  The Minister refused to do that and he has set up an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal which is in most cases ineffective.  The opportunity for fair proceedings which people expect will not be available.</P>
      <P>This Bill to provide health care is welcome, but belated.  It was only after massive protests and pressure by the groups involved, including Positive Action, and the two Opposition parties, that the Minister introduced this legislation. There are a number of issues about which I am worried, in particular the situation in relation to relatives of those who have died as a result of being infected by bad blood.  The Minister said in the other House that these people would be dealt with by the tribunal in the normal way.  I have been informed that may not be the case and that they may be treated in the same way as car crash victims and the amount of compensation might be a few thousand pounds.  That would be totally inadequate as far as those families are concerned. I would like the Minister to comment on that when replying.</P>

    <P>Many people with liver complaints were given infected blood which contributed to their death.  Their families <Col N="1867" /> are at a loss as a result of that action by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the State.  They are not sure if proper compensation will be available under the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  I am not convinced about that either and I would like the Minister to clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of who should be liable, the Minister said there was civil negligence in relation to this matter but I am not sure the public accepts such a statement.  The public would say there was criminal negligence and that people were subjected to treatment which contributed to illness and, in some cases, death.  Nobody has been brought to book, which is extraordinary.  Although we are told the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent and that the Minister cannot interfere, somebody should be made to answer.  If this occurred in the private sector, I am sure somebody would have had to answer.  Because it happened in the State sector, there seems to be a coverup, a closing of ranks and an unwillingness to take the sector on.  I believe there was criminal negligence and that the public is still not satisfied with the Government's response.</P>
    <P>I welcome the actions of the Department of Health which has responded by introducing this legislation, albeit under pressure, and setting up a compensation mechanism.  However, my party disagrees with the compensation mechanism because it was not set up on a statutory basis and it is not to the best advantage of those infected.  The groups involved have been very responsible over the past six or eight months and they have presented positive and straightforward proposals.  Had it not been for the way in which they put their case to the public and the political parties, we would not be in this situation.  I compliment the two groups involved.  A few months back there was no question that the Minister would respond positively to people who contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions.  That group seemed to had been left aside but that has now been rectified, and rightly so.  However, nothing seems to have <Col N="1868" /> been done for the relatives of people who died because of this.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives a number of ways in which infected people will have the opportunity of being dealt with by the health boards, GPs etc.  What final agreement has been reached with the general practitioners?  Is there a structure in place and an agreement reached and signed by the Minister and the GPs for the provision of treatment through the GMS?  What agreement has been reached between the Department of Health, the Minister and the health boards regarding the provision of services? We do not want to have a chief executive officer saying later that he cannot provide that service because the Minister did not provide him with adequate finance.  If we cut back on our health services, certain areas included in this Bill may only wind up as aspirations. I would like the Minister to respond to both of these questions when he replies.  The public and the people infected would also like to know that.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an implied reasoning that if somebody had a liver transplant &mdash; they would be covered for this under the legislation &mdash; it would solve everything.  That might not solve the problem.  It may be as likely that the transplanted liver would develop the same symptoms and problems as the original.  There is no guarantee that this would solve the problem.  A Government representative laid great emphasis on this &mdash; I am not saying it was the Minister &mdash; but that statement does not stand up to proper medical scrutiny and it should not be made.</P>
    <P>How these symptoms will develop over the next five, ten, 20 or more years is a grey area &mdash; we do not know what will happen down the road.  That is the reason the tribunal as constituted is inadequate.  People should have as a right the opportunity of a provisional settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>They already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not.  They have it at the discretion of the tribunal <Col N="1869" /> but not as a full right.  That is a major difference.  Everybody infected should have the right to a provisional settlement; it should be part and parcel of the compensation package.  In the event of their developing more severe symptoms, needing extra or costly treatment or becoming incapacitated, a final compensation settlement could then be agreed. However, giving a final settlement either now or in the next few months would mean there would not be a subsequent appeals system.  That is unfair and it does not at all protect the women infected.  They should have the right to accept a provisional settlement now and to negotiate their situation later to protect themselves and their families.  This is currently at the discretion of the tribunal. That is not copperfastened enough for the women involved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation in so far as it is necessary to protect people who have been infected through the State's criminal negligence, for which nobody has been charged or brought to book.  There has been a total closing of ranks by the State to protect itself and the people who delivered the service and that is not good enough.</P>
      <P>When a counselling group was set up to help the infected people, the Blood Transfusion Service Board was put in charge of it.  It was trying to limit the damage to itself.  Any counselling group established should have been independent and totally removed from that board.  It was responsible for inflicting this problem on our women.  This was an insult to those who had been infected.  That board has its own avenue to follow, to limit the damage to itself. Rather than charging the people on the board with negligence or finding them in any way responsible for what happened, they were able to retire with large golden handshakes.  Surely this was not in the best interests of fair play to these women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most serious situation.  The women involved have still not received their entitlements.  They certainly do not have a tribunal to compensate them which has been set up in a proper manner <Col N="1870" /> and with a proper statutory background. It is an <i>ad hoc</i> situation and these women are not happy with that. This is not the last we will hear about it. The courts will have a say in the matter and the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal put in place by the Government will not deliver what is necessary.  I have asked a number of questions about the health care package brought forward in this legislation and I hope the Minister will indicate the current situation on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the purpose of this Bill is to make provision for primary care services free of charge for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusions.  The nature and the appalling repercussions of this problem have been described in great detail by people who have experience of this issue and no words of mine today will help to illuminate the problem any further.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Howlin, the then Minister for Health, informed this House in February 1994 that a problem had been identified, both he and the present Minister moved commendably to respond to it.  In September 1995 the Minister announced the appointment of members of the compensation tribunal to compensate people who contracted hepatitis C from the use of the anti-D product.  At the same time the Minister for Health gave details of a package of health measures designed to ensure that the future health care needs of hepatitis C patients will continue to be met. These include hospital in-patient and out-patient services and counselling services, which will remain in place for as long as they are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Health Act, 1970, to provide for general practitioner services, without charge, for specific categories of persons suffering from hepatitis C the treatment and care they may require.  The Minister for Health also announced the funding of a special programme of research on hepatitis C, which was arranged through the Health Research Board.  A statutory consultative council was also established <Col N="1871" /> to advise the Minister on matters relating to hepatitis C.  He gave an assurance that the needs of blood transfusion and blood product recipients who have contracted hepatitis C will be reassessed on an ongoing basis to ensure necessary services are provided for them.  The Minister also initiated the look back programme, the aim of which is to identify blood donors who have tested positive for hepatitis C and who may be at risk of contracting the infection.</P>
    <P>As part of the health package the Minister provided for an optional screening programme to trace patients who may have been infected with hepatitis C from blood transfusions.  In this supplementary screening programme anyone who received blood or blood products may wish to discuss their concern with their general practitioner.  If, following a full consultation, a blood test is considered appropriate, a blood sample will be taken by the general practitioner and forwarded to the Blood Transfusion Services Board.  No fee is charged for any of these services.</P>
    <P>Persons who had multiple blood transfusions or serious surgery accompanied by transfusion prior to 1991 and who may be at risk are invited to avail of these testing programmes.  If the patient, or the general practitioner, is unsure whether a blood transfusion was given during a past procedure, information in that regard can be obtained from the appropriate hospital.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a number of the measures put in place to provide a comprehensive response to the problem. The Bill makes statutory provision for the delivery of a series of services to the victims, and in some cases their partners and children, of this tragedy.  More importantly, it puts funding and the provision of those services beyond doubt. In addition to providing for the health care needs of these people, the Government is fully committed to fair compensation for persons who contracted hepatitis C as a result of receiving a contaminated blood product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> To this end, in 1995, the Minister established a compensation tribunal as an alternative to court proceedings to provide fair compensation to such persons. I understand the tribunal is dealing with applications from persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or the virus resulting from the use of human immunoglobulin/anti-D blood transfusion or blood products within the State.  It is also dealing with the children and partners of such persons who have been diagnosed positive with hepatitis C antibodies or virus; any person responsible for the maintenance of such people who has incurred financial loss or expense as a direct result of providing such maintenance, and any dependant of such persons who have died as a result of contracting hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran misunderstands that no person is compelled to apply to the tribunal for compensation.  It is a matter for each person to decide whether he or she wishes to pursue their claim in the court or through the compensation tribunal.  I understand 17 compensation cases are before the court at present and it must be pointed out that making a claim to the tribunal does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  It is only if the claim is accepted as an award by the tribunal that the claimant is required to agree to waive any rights of action he or she may otherwise have had.  If a claimant receives an award, they have one month in which to decide to accept or reject it.</P>
    <P>An applicant has the choice of going through the tribunal or the courts.  A person is not compelled to apply to the tribunal.  I understand, following discussions between the Department of Health and interested groups, including Positive Action, that a number of changes have been made to the scheme. It was agreed during the course of the negotiations in November 1995 that the time within which a claimant could apply to the tribunal would be extended from three to six months.  This is now the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> I understand the tribunal is working well and hearing approximately 12 cases a week.  As the Minister said, since its commencement the tribunal has heard 70 cases and awards totalling approximately £7.5 million have been made.  No tribunal award has been rejected and this is a firm indication of the confidence not only of the applicants, but of the legal profession supporting the cases.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation offers numerous advantages as opposed to court proceedings.  It is speedy and informal and negligence is not required to be proved.  The right of court action by the applicant is preserved unless and until the award is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Every case is contested by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme is entirely optional.  The concept of a provisional award, which is not available in Irish law and therefore could not be available if one went through the courts, allows the claimant to return to the tribunal if it is of the view that a claimant, as a result of the hepatitis C virus, may suffer a serious consequence or consequences in the future.  This is a particularly important option for claimants, given the uncertain nature of the infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the sustained criticism of the tribunal, given that the Government has done its utmost to facilitate victims of the problem. A number of people making these criticisms are the same people who failed to support motions in this and the other House in 1989 in relation to compensation for haemophiliacs who contracted AIDS through an infected blood product.  The Minister of State was a Member of the House at that time and it was a most sad occasion for me because the motion was in my name.  It sought compensation for a finite number of people who were dying, but the Minister for Health of the day refused to accept it.  When the motion was rejected in the other House, a general election followed.  In view of the attitudes <Col N="1874" /> of certain people then, their current criticisms carry no weight with me. I fail to understand their total inconsistency on this matter.</P>
    <P>Given the criticism levelled at the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, that he misled the other House, I am thankful to Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien for publishing a letter which made it clear that the allegations against the Minister of State were without foundation. I am sure Members on both sides will agree the Minister for Health and his predecessors have acted with commendable and proper thoroughness in addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill and the other measures taken are comprehensive in that they seek to address all aspects of the problem. It is a great source of sadness that the measures to address this problem have been marred by argument about the method of compensation.  More recently these arguments have continued in efforts to extend the deadline of 17 June 1996 for claimants at the compensation tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is also a great pity that the trauma of the victims of this awful event has been added to by this uncertainty and argument.  I hope that these arguments and criticisms will come to an end and that the Bill before the House will greatly assist those who have hepatitis C and give them confidence and with the assistance of long life health care and ancillary services which the Bill provides, they will lead a happy, full and productive life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which puts in place a package of health measures for victims of hepatitis C.  The legislation is being brought forward following detailed negotiations with groups representing the people who have contracted the disease &mdash; Transfusion Positive and Positive Action. These people have been infected with a potentially life threatening virus because of the negligence of a State board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Bill gives a statutory commitment to provide <Col N="1875" /> without charge health services to people who have contracted hepatitis C.  It provides for the delivery of services to match a commitment given in February 1994 by the Coalition Government when this scandal was first uncovered to provide free health services to the victims of this tragedy.  Negotiations with the Government and the Department of Health and two years of tough campaigning by the victims have led to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought legislation before this House which reflects that agreement and gives guarantees to the victims.  The Progressive Democrats welcome this.  Originally, Transfusion Positive felt that there was a lack of clarity about who would get medical treatment and they also had difficulties in relation to obstacles that may be put in their way from receiving this treatment because of the lack of availability of their medical files.  Amendments were brought in as the Bill was going through the other House to ensure that the chief executive officer in the relevant health board would have the power to determine eligibility for the proposed services at their discretion. This was welcome because it followed discussions with representatives of Transfusion Positive who were concerned that a small number of their members would experience difficulty in acquiring their past medical records and thereby qualifying for the health benefits provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer's decision would involve consideration of medical opinion submitted by the applicant's physician and also the relevant health board's director of public health.  To become eligible for the services you do not require a determination by a court or the compensation tribunal.  Some individuals might not have a claim with the courts or the compensation tribunal, but would be eligible for the services provided under this Bill.  The amendment is welcome in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> The Bill details part of the health care agreement which the Department of Health negotiated with the victims.  It is detailed because the complexity of the health problems for the victims of hepatitis C require it.  The Bill outlines GP, hospital and other services that will be provided for the victims.  It refers to counselling services and the health care agreement allows for the establishment of a consultative council which will have a role in monitoring the services provided. All this is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his officials have taken on board the genuine concerns of the victims, but there are questions which have to be asked to clarify the health package.  Discussions have taken place, for instance, with the GP bodies regarding the services that would be provided to the victims but as the Minister of State has said, a detailed agreement has not been reached with the GP's.  It is very important, particularly when cases are being settled in the tribunal, that that is done quickly.  Preliminary discussions have taken place but it is necessary that agreement would be reached quickly.  Some negotiations have been completed with the health boards but a final agreement on their role in the provision of services has not been reached either.  It is important to reassure people who have become infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>Some of the groups representing these people are not happy with the current counselling services.  For instance, Positive Action believe that counselling is a vitally important element of the health services which the women need. Under the Bill the health boards will be asked to provide this service.  What assurances can the Minister give that each health board will provide an independent quality counselling service that will be accessible for every woman who needs it?  For instance, there is no independent counselling service available to women in Limerick, which is the Minister's constituency.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised was the promise of funding for the Health Research Board for special projects on hepatitis. <Col N="1877" /> I was pleased to hear the Minister of State tell us that the Minister for Health had arranged with the Health Research Board for the establishment of a special programme and had provided funding of £100,000 to enable the programme to commence this year.  That is welcome news.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that a monitoring body is urgently needed.  A draft establishment order was circulated to interested groups for their views, and following the consultation process, amendments were being considered to take the views being expressed by these groups into account and the Minister will consult again with these groups at an early date.  Does the Minister for Health have a date for this order which will formally establish the consultative council?</P>
    <P>The women are concerned about the services available from some hospitals. There is no consultant hepatologist in Beaumont Hospital which has one of six special anti-D units.  Members of Positive Action have gone to the clinic recently and found it closed.  This has been very upsetting as they do not know what are the future plans for the unit and fear that the services which have been provided up to now may not be available in the future.</P>
    <P>The people who have contracted hepatitis C have had to face up to a litany of facts.  The most shocking was that the Blood Transfusion Services Board knew as far back as 1976 that the main donor they used for the manufacture of anti-D was infected with hepatitis.  That has been very difficult for the victims to accept.  It is also difficult for them to have faith in the institutions of the State.  They quickly lose faith when promises to provide health services etc., for them are not kept.  It is necessary to reassure them that the services that have been provided will be available in the future and that any shortfall in these services will be made good immediately.</P>
    <P>Members of Positive Action have also reported that, despite the promises made by the Minister, they have found themselves in mixed wards when admitted <Col N="1878" /> to hospitals for biopsy procedures. In the health agreement which the Minister negotiated with Positive Action, each unit was to have a designated ward area for patients who were admitted to hospital for testing, treatment or for biopsy.  Why is this not happening in all centres?</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask if the special units have been granted the funding they requested to provide the services which were agreed by the Minister.  It is important to raise this issue as this Bill is providing these services.  We need to ensure that this funding is in place. Otherwise, it just adds to the fears and concerns of these people and none of us wants to see that.</P>
    <P>In producing the health care package, the Minister and the Department listened to the concerns of the people involved who had contracted hepatitis C.  That is to be welcomed.  However, irrespective of whatever has been said with regard to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal which was set up, the Minister was not listening fully.  I accept that he went a long way down the road in providing what the victims required.  But there were a few small measures which I believe would not have been costly to the State, could have been provided and would have given these people a tribunal they would have seen as fair and acceptable. In fairness to the groups, it must be said that they have always accepted that a tribunal was the best way to deal with their cases rather than going through the lengthy legal procedures of the courts.  It is unfortunate that a few items of concern to them could not have been adjusted by the Minister when he was setting up the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, and which he has the power to change at any time.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, when he spoke in the other House on this matter on Tuesday last.  He gave assurances on many of the issues which were of concern to women. Unfortunately, because of the whole background to this tragedy, the women do not have great confidence in the institutions of this State.  They want to <Col N="1879" /> see everything copperfastened and written into the order which set up the tribunal. I know, for instance, that the Minister on that occasion assured the other House and the women that he had been assured by the tribunal that no applicant would be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing.  He also gave assurances in the House that he had been advised by the Attorney General that the terms of any award made by the tribunal would be enforceable before the courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also informed the other House that all claimants to date who had sought a provisional award have been granted a provisional award, but that is not the point.  The women want to know that down the line no woman who wants a provisional award will be refused.  I know that anybody who has asked for one so far has been given it, but it is not given by right.  The tribunal could still refuse any person a provisional award because that decision is to be made by the tribunal; it is not a decision which is left for the individual going before the tribunal.  These assurances can be given by the Minister; but if it is not copperfastened in the tribunal, it is not fully acceptable to the victims.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the other House on Tuesday that he had been advised by the Attorney General that proceedings before the compensation tribunal will be subject to judicial review.  This is another matter which the victims believe could have been stitched into the tribunal and not stated verbally by the Minister.  They feel that the tribunal was set up by the Minister and he could have attached these guarantees.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the other House that oral evidence of the claimants had been heard in all cases by the tribunal and that the tribunal had advised the legal profession and other interested parties that claimants shall be entitled to give oral evidence.  This statement is welcome, but the parties who negotiated the tribunal on behalf of <Col N="1880" /> the victims last November were not given this guarantee by the Minister at the time.  The victims feel that all of these matters have had to be dragged out of the Government only because there have been continuous debates, Opposition motions and Adjournment Matters in this and the other House.  It is unfortunate that there is such a low level of trust&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>To be honest, that is hardly a fair comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CathyHonan" hpid="Ms Honan Ms Honan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;between the victims and the Government, which is a pity. However, it is understandable, given the circumstances in which they contracted hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>I must disagree with the contention that when it was discovered by the court in the Bridget Roe case that donor X, who caused 90 per cent of the infection, had a clinical diagnosis of infective hepatitis, this was obvious.  I must disagree. It was not obvious to me and I do not think it was obvious to many of the victims.  That was another setback to them.  It was something they discovered when the case was before the High Court and it was another shock for them.  We, fortunately, have not contracted hepatitis C and it is a different scenario to us looking at it from the outside rather than from the victim's point of view.</P>
      <P>As the tribunal is dealing with a group of people, it is difficult for some individuals to cope with all of this.  It is difficult for us to understand the effect it has on individuals, the stresses it causes and the victims' ability to deal with that stress.  There is a backlog of bitterness and disappointment among many of them and this adds to their demands.  This is why we should try to listen to them and ensure their concerns are taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the fact that the medical services which are being provided are what the women wanted, but the issue of compensation is their main concern. The fact that if they go to the tribunal they need not prove medical negligence <Col N="1881" /> in itself removes a burden of proof; but in this case the State board was clearly negligent, so it suits the State to wave proof of negligence. Otherwise, the State would probably be held liable to a greater degree of negligence.</P>
    <P>It is only because of pressure from the women and the Opposition that certain matters have been clarified.  The fact that no applicant will be compelled to have his or her case heard without agreement to the date was, as I said, clarified by the Minister the other night and it was welcomed.  The fact that oral evidence has been heard in all cases to date, that this has been confirmed by the lawyers to the tribunal and that the proceedings will be subject to judicial review are matters that are also welcome. The fact that all claimants so far who have sought a provisional award is welcome but there is no absolute right for that to happen to anybody.  Since the Minister stated in the other House on Tuesday that the hearing of cases before the tribunal will go on into next year, I cannot understand why there is an insistence on the deadline of 17 June and why the Minister cannot wait until after the court case, which will clarify the matter and show the details of what the blood bank did or did not know.  I cannot understand why this cannot be conceded.  We must remember from where the women come, the lack of trust they have in the institutions of this State and try to think about it from their perspective rather than from that of a Minister of Government who is a defendant in this particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  At the best of times, hepatitis C is a dreadful condition, but to have contacted the disease from services provided by the State must be frustrating in the extreme.  As public representatives, we must understand the hurt and despair felt by the victims, their families and friends in this case.  Any of us who worked in the health services and met people suffering from hepatitis C understand <Col N="1882" /> the stress and hurt involved. Every effort must be made to ensure that what happened in these cases does not reoccur.</P>
      <P>I must commend the work done by the representative groups of hepatitis C sufferers in keeping this issue high on the public agenda and for the positive way they have worked with the Minister for Health.  I want to see that kind of co-operation continue and I ask the Minister to make every possible effort to ensure the resolution of any remaining issues between his Department and these groups.  I am sure no Member of this House can find fault with this Bill. It seeks to confer on the victims of hepatitis C rights to which they would not otherwise have been entitled, such as the provision of full GMS services.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for bringing it to this House.</P>
      <P>This is not the only measure being taken by the Department of Health. The hepatitis C tribunal is already up and running, although it has been a source of controversy.  A case is now being made to extend the closing date for applications.  I support the concept of the tribunal and I note that none of the awards it has offered so far has been refused.  Tribunals are more flexible, personal and, perhaps more importantly, less costly than formal court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased with the way the Minister has chosen to operate this tribunal. Many women who have applied to the tribunal are keen to see the outcome of court cases currently pending.  The arrangements for the tribunal do not preclude women from doing so.  An application submitted can be withdrawn. Awards, if deemed unsatisfactory, can be turned down without affecting somebody's right to legal action. Medical evidence is not required with an application form, so there should be no reason why the 600 or so unfortunate sufferers of hepatitis C who have not yet made their applications to the tribunal should not do so.  I am satisfied that the Department, through its advertising campaign, has made every effort to <Col N="1883" /> bring the closing date for applications to people's attention.</P>
    <P>I apologise if I am not speaking to the Bill, but these matters cannot be separated as they form part of the Government's response to this tragedy.  This response has been flexible and sympathetic. A mean spirited response would have been to force these women into court where it would have been onerous and costly to prove their case.  Had the State adopted this stance it would have committed a great wrong against these women.  Such an approach would have been morally reprehensible and the Minister is to be congratulated for refusing to do that.  I hope the State continues in this vein.  While I understand the Minister's position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the closing date for applications to the tribunal, I urge him to ensure that any person who for some legitimate reason has not applied in time should be given recourse to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives the chief executive officers of the health boards powers to confer the entitlements established in this Bill on individual applicants.  I urge them to approach this problem with the same flexibility and understanding as the Government.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is no question of the Minister or the Government being unfair in their treatment or recognition of the people who suffer from hepatitis C. I have had many discussions with people who represent themselves in this regard.  However, the legal profession wants to have a say in this matter.  We heard the other day that the State is about to pay £1.4 million to solicitors who represented women in the recent equal treatment payment cases.  Under <Col N="1884" /> the previous Government, people who were legally entitled to get those payments from the Department had to get solicitors to make representations on their behalf.  It is outrageous that they will now be paid in excess of £1 million.</P>
      <P>I want to speak about the health strategy to make health boards more accountable and to improve and define management structures.  The Bill succeeds to some extent in doing that.  Am I in order to speak about such matters?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to Senator Doyle's superior knowledge in this matter.</P>
      <P>General practitioners prescribe drugs and medicines, provide dental and ophthalmic services and counsel those involved in home help.  If the State decides to provide such services, it must clearly state how they will be provided and what amount of money will be allocated to them.  So many services are being withdrawn from the health system that it is hardly worthwhile for people to have a medical card.  We are prepared to extend that service now, but I am sure general practitioners will have a big say in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it stated clearly and unambiguously in this Bill that people suffering from hepatitis C will be fully eligible?  There should not be restrictions which make it impossible to implement and we should not have to fight general practitioners. We pay a grant of £35,000 or £40,000 <Col N="1885" /> to general practitioners per annum and people are fully eligible to avail of the health services.  If the State does not want to increase the capitation grant payable to general practitioners, it should keep the number on medical cards below a certain level.  If we want to extend that service to this category of people, we should ensure there are no restrictions.  That is happening at present.</P>
    <P>We must seriously examine the paltry sum being paid to people who provide home care or home help services for people with disabilities.  The home care allowance is reasonable but the home help payment is a derisory sum for people who go far beyond the bounds of duty to provide a service.  That has to be looked at as well.  I am sure that at the end of the day everybody will be satisfied; that is only as it should be.  To suffer from hepatitis C is a tragedy. Every effort must be made to ensure that these people are adequately compensated and to provide adequate health services for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the Minister as I have spoken on this subject before.  This was a very serious episode in the lives of all those who received contaminated blood, be they the women who received anti-D serum, patients with renal disease who were infected from dialysis, or patients who were given other blood products for very serious blood diseases.  The Blood Transfusion Services Board has been criticised very strongly about what happened. It was a terrible episode for all those working in the blood bank as well as for the recipients.  The concern this episode caused for staff within the Blood Transfusion Services Board should not be underestimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health has got off lightly.  Between 1989 and 1991 the Blood Transfusion Services Board sought further funding for testing, but on reading the debates on this issue in the Official Report it seems to me that the Blood Transfusion Services Board <Col N="1886" /> was run on a very tight budget.  We cannot afford not to allow the latest steps in technology to be brought forward immediately when dealing with such services.  Although it can be argued that tests in these areas are not 100 per cent accurate when they are first introduced, is it better to bring in the test which is 80 per cent accurate immediately and possibly have to deal with false positives, rather than to have no knowledge at all?  I have a certain amount of sympathy for those working in the Blood Transfusion Services Board, particularly at that time, who sought money and received a very poor response from the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I am very glad the Department of Health has made all those who were infected with the hepatitis C virus eligible for primary health care; this is very important for them.  The dreadful thing about this condition is that the treatment is not very satisfactory.  We still do not really understand the natural history of the disease.  There has been a considerable amount of criticism about the tribunal, but at least when dealing with the tribunal people do not have to deal with the stress caused by court cases.  I am glad to be able to tell the Minister I have only had to go to court as a witness in my professional capacity, but it is important not to underestimate the stress caused by court cases, which can have a range of psychological and physical effects.</P>
    <P>It has been said that some of those who have settled their cases at the tribunal are already dead.  While two patients are dead, I can tell the House that one of them died from causes completely unrelated to hepatitis C.  It is very important not to give the impression to other sufferers that patients who have received compensation have died of hepatitis C, because it paints a particularly gloomy picture for others who are infected.  It is important to remember that people can die of other conditions even when they are infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>People ask for categorical assurances that this kind of crisis will not happen <Col N="1887" /> again.  It is impossible to give such assurances. I noticed how careful those from the blood bank were, when before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Family, not to reassure the committee that this could not happen again.  We can do our very best to ensure it does not happen again, and in this context it is important not to starve the service of money so that tests can be updated.</P>
    <P>These are biological problems and we do not have total control over them. There is already a problem with hepatitis G in Germany.  This has almost certainly been imported from the far East. These viruses may be sexually transmitted or they may be transmitted through the blood; we do not know.  No one can give categorical assurances, but they can do their absolute utmost and any new tests must be made available immediately.  We must have state of the art testing in this country.  Huge efforts have been made by Professor McCann and by Mr. Dunbar &mdash; I compliment them on the work they have done &mdash; but we can only do what is humanly possible within these areas and that is all that can be promised to the public.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that because of the greatly increased vigilance in the Blood Transfusion Services Board, a far higher proportion of those offering to donate blood are now being refused. The generosity of the Irish public is exceptional.  A friend of mine needed 25 pints of blood the other day following an operation.  Some 25 people helped that man.  He would not be here without their help and it is important to remember this.  This is an effort, not just by the Blood Transfusion Services Board, but by society in general.  When I was a young doctor I first went to work in America and I will never forget how when a patient was admitted, the first thing they were asked for was a list of their donors.  This has never had to happen in this country.  All that is necessary is to put out an appeal for donors &mdash; the specific blood group can even be mentioned &mdash; for donors to offer blood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> There has not been a drop in the number of donors coming forward but unfortunately more donors have had to be refused so as to be absolutely sure that every possible effort has been made to exclude every condition, known and unknown.  It is very difficult to exclude conditions we know nothing about at the moment.  We are trying to deal with conditions and diseases of which we do not know the natural history and for which we know there is no treatment. This is a very testing time for the medical services in this country and the efforts which have been made to try to make sure that this could not happen again should be recognised.  We should try to go forward with confidence that Irish society will continue to run a service for people who need blood which will be second to none.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister for Health has also said that during the Irish Presidency of the European Union we will make further efforts to standardise the various tests and regulations pertaining to blood and blood products within the European Union.  Ours are some of the tightest; but an overall approach would be better, because blood all over the world is much the same.  It is important to address this urgent problem systematically with the knowledge that we have to provide finance for this service if we wish to ensure that it is of the highest level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to say a few words on this issue.  I will not keep the House very long.  I speak mainly because a few people from my constituency have contacted me about it to express their concerns. I imagine that the people who discussed the matter with me are typical and that many of the people are worried because of the publicity this issue has received for the last number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having discussed it privately people seem to get their confidence back when they realise that what is going on is basically political tomfoolery.  I have every confidence in the Minister of State and the Minister in their handling of this <Col N="1889" /> matter.  They are doing a marvellous job.  It is important to put it in context for people who, through no fault of their own, are suffering from hepatitis C.  The context is simple; it is that those who are opposing and trying to blacken the efforts of the Government would do exactly the same if the Government had decided to opt for a court based procedure. They would then, rightly, say it is correct to set up a tribunal.</P>
    <P>They are playing with people's lives. Those people do not need additional worries, they have enough on their plates.  They need to feel confident that the Government is doing its utmost to help, which it is.  When you contrast the courts system, where they would get a payment and that would be the end of it, with how the tribunal is operating &mdash; where people have recourse to the tribunal again at a later date if their conditions deteriorate to such an extent that that is required &mdash; it is a fair system.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on introducing this measure.  This has been a tragic drama from beginning to end.  A huge exercise to screen people has been carried out.  Those involved deserve better treatment from Opposition parties that are trying to smear the Government. Toying with people's lives in such tragic circumstances degrades politicians.</P>

      <P>That is happening.  People who are hyping it up are doing a disservice, particularly as their parties were in power when this debacle happened.  I wish Opposition politicians would choose carefully the topics on which they go to town when they want to score against the Government, and that they would be more sensitive in their approach.  People telephoned me because they were frightened out of their wits by politicians going over the top on this issue.  However, once you have had a calm discussion with them they fully understand and enjoy some peace of mind.  The difficulty, of course, is that we cannot talk to everybody.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister last night and suggested he should recontact every one of the people involved to explain the situation once again.  He has already sent a personal letter to everybody explaining the position fully.  I suggested, however, that he might have to do so again because people are being upset by fairy stories.  I appeal to the Opposition to find some other way of crucifying the Government than by using the lives of these people.</P>
      <P>I am confident the Government and future Administrations will honour the commitments made by the Department of Health, even though the Opposition is casting doubt on the issue by claiming it has not been legislated for and that the next Minister for Health could change his or her mind.  I do not think so.  Even the irresponsible people hyping this issue would act responsibly when in Government.  They would handle the situation impeccably.</P>

People would be happier in the knowledge that no matter which Government is in power they will be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it underlines the fact that the Government is serious about looking after these people.  At enormous cost to the Government and to the people of Ireland who support it, the Bill is putting in place certain procedures through the health boards to offer services to these unfortunate people for the rest of their lives.  I commend the Government <Col N="1892" /> on its handling of the issue and for holding its nerve in difficult circumstances.  I hope Ministers will continue to deal with this matter as they have been doing.  People should have confidence that they will be looked after.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this constructive debate and who gave the Bill a general welcome.</P>
      <P>The purpose the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995 is to provide for making available, without charge, certain services to eligible persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  Eligible persons are those who have contracted the hepatitis C virus directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D, or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a concrete expression of the Government's commitment to provide a high quality health service for such individuals.  It is the product of consultation which has taken place with representative groups of various supporting areas including Positive Action, Transfusion Positive, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>
      <P>As soon as the Bill has passed all Stages in both Houses it is hoped to finalise negotiations with professional groupings representing doctors and pharmacists to put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for the delivery of health services set out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to co-operation between the Department and these groups, I trust the co-operation shown by the groups in working successfully with the Department of Health in launching the optional testing programme last autumn will carry forward into the provision of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the items that arose during the debate. Senator Finneran gave the impression that no health care services have been put in place until now.  The treatment <Col N="1893" /> for those who test positive for hepatitis C has been provided at special consultant staffed clinics at six hospitals since February 1994 free of charge, including prescribed medication.  A counselling service was also immediately put in place.  An <i>ex-gratia</i> expenses scheme was also administered by the BTSB to ensure that people could avail of services.</P>
    <P>The tribunal scheme was mentioned by a number of Senators.  Clause 4 (b) of the scheme provides that any person responsible for the maintenance of any persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C as a result of a blood product or a blood transfusion may claim.  Clause 4 (c) provides that any dependant of a person who has died as a result of contracting hepatitis C may make a claim.  Clause 8 provides that the awards of the tribunal will be calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort, in other words, the same means as would operate in a court.</P>
    <P>The funding required by health boards to meet the costs of the new primary health care services set out in the Bill will be provided.  In all cases where a claimant has requested a provisional award, the tribunal has made a provisional reward and that should be noted.  Senator Honan raised the issue of counselling.  Following the passage of the Bill, the health boards will be legally obliged to provide a counselling service and will be funded to do so.  With regard to the consultative council, the Minister for Health will consult with the interested groups again and, following those consultations, will formally establish the council.  However, I cannot give a definite date for when the council will be established.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also mentioned mixed wards.  This took place in one hospital, St. James's, when it was under particular pressure.  The hospital informed the Department that it had happened and the hospital was requested to ensure it would not happen in the future and must be mindful of the health care package at all times and comply with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 32 to 38, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to personally execute any work or labour in return for payment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  Any of the issues I am raising today arose out of consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on areas which we feel could be tidied up.  This is forward thinking and progressive legislation.  At a time when many people are worried about the protection of young people, this legislation sends a very strong and welcome signal from Government.  Any remarks I make on specific issues should be taken in that general context.  I intend to tease out some issues today in these amendments, many of which are grouped together, with a view to hearing explanations from the Minister of State on various aspects of the Bill.  I intend to retable some of them on <Col N="1895" /> Report Stage, depending on the Minister of State's replies.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (1) (b) of the Bill which deals with the contract of employment is very convoluted.  Paragraph (a) states that a contract of employment means &ldquo;a contract of service or apprenticeship&rdquo; which is clear enough.  However, paragraph (b) states it also means:</P>
    <P>Any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person, who is carrying on the business of an employment agency within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and is acting in the course of that business, to do or perform personally any work or service for a third person (whether or not the third person is party to the contract),</P>
    <P>whether the contract is express or implied or if express, whether it is oral or in writing;</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with this legislation is that it should be clearly comprehensible and easily assimilated and understood.  It is important that those whom we are trying to protect understand and know their rights.  While I know what is meant by &ldquo;whether the contract is express or implied&rdquo; or &ldquo;whether it is oral or in writing&rdquo; and all the other ifs, ands, buts, qualifications, modifications and explanations, my proposal is infinitely more practical and practicable.  I am proposing to delete that paragraph and replace it with &ldquo;any other contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to personally execute any work or labour in return for payment&rdquo;.  If the Minister of State accepts the amendment, I will bring forward a verbal amendment on Fourth Stage to unsplit the infinitive.</P>
    <P>My amendment is infinitely simpler and much easier to understand and explain than the existing paragraph. Ordinary, non-legal people need to be able to understand parts of this Bill. Ordinary employers of young people would have difficulties with that paragraph <Col N="1896" /> because it requires a great deal of rereading.  It is a long, difficult sentence with a variety of subclauses and phrases which make its comprehension quite difficult.  It is like a sentence in a difficult examination paper which is accompanied by the words &ldquo;please explain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I defy the Minister of State to analyse the sentence &ldquo;whereby an individual agrees with another person, who is carrying on the business of an employment agency within the meaning of the Employment Agency Act, 1971, and is acting in the course of that business, to do or perform personally any work or service for a third person is party to the contract, whether the contract is express or implied or if express, whether it is oral or in writing&rdquo; and to tell me at whom it is directed.  I had to go through it very carefully and separate the subclauses. I am throwing myself at the mercy of the draftsman, but is my amendment not a much simpler way of dealing with something which sounds very complex?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator O'Toole's wish for the use of clear English in legislation, and the importance of people understanding their legal rights and obligations.  That is why I have decided to repeal and re-enact sections of the 1936 and 1977 laws relating to young people so that, if someone is consulting a legal eagle on this, all the law in relation to the employment of young people will be between two covers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1897" /> I also intend to undertake an information campaign when we have the Bill signed into law and brought into effect. I discussed the information campaign the day before yesterday with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We intend talking to schools, giving information to young people and bringing in the major employers of young labour &mdash; the supermarkets, vintners, etc.  We will also, as Senator O'Toole knows because he has an amendment down on this point, legally oblige employers to display an abstract of the Act.  I will ensure the abstract is prepared in plain English so people will know exactly what is involved and employers of young people will be clear as to their legal rights and obligations.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief for parliamentary draftspersons.  I have seen worse than this Bill, where myself and three of my civil servants were incapable of understanding the draftsman in relation to another piece of legislation.  We knew what we wanted in the Bill but we were incapable of understanding what came out the other end.  This Bill seems a model of clarity compared with some I have seen coming from the draftsman's office.</P>
    <P>The effect of Senator O'Toole's amendment, I am advised, is somewhat different than simply clarifying the legal English of the paragraph.  The amendment would widen the groups of young people who would come under the legislation. For example, one of the effects would be that young people babysitting next door or for a relative would be caught by the 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock restrictions in the legislation.  That is not the intention.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in common with other employment legislation, applies first of all to straightforward employees and secondly to people who are employees of an agency &mdash; for example, temporary typists who are direct employees of the agency and work for a third party.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) extend the obligation in relation to employment, whether somebody is directly working for the agency or working <Col N="1898" /> under the direction of a third party &mdash; for example, a contract worker. Senator O'Toole's amendment would bring in a wider group of people, with many implications.  We also debated in the Dáil widening the definition of people to come under the legislation. Widening the definition involves widening the exemptions and exceptions so that common sense issues such as babysitting for a relation can continue to take place.</P>
    <P>Last week ICTU presented a report on atypical workers.  I have asked my Department to look at the issue of employment rights for atypical workers. Can we generally broaden the protection of our employment protection legislation?  It is a much bigger issue than this legislation.  I give an undertaking to the House that we will carry out that study.  We have just received the report from congress.  There are discussions going on through the social dialogue process arising from the Maastricht Treaty.  The discussions about atypical workers are about to start between employers at European level and the European Trade Union Confederation. This process, which brought us the parental leave directive, is likely to lead to a European directive on atypical work.  We are looking at that in a wider context and are having a detailed examination of that area done in the Department. It is not closing the door on people who are self-employed or quasi self-employed.  There are so many complex legal issues involved.</P>
    <P>As the Senator knows, we have time pressure and EU obligations in relation to this Bill.  I hope to revisit the area of employment law and how we can expand the definition of workers.  I hope to engage in consultations with congress and employer organisations in that regard when we have done our examination.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's full answer.  I disagree with some points, and one which causes me to rethink is the question of the interpretation of casual.  The Minister is correct to <Col N="1899" /> say this amendment widens the net and I do not deny that was part of my intention in putting it down.  It was not just the simplification issue but to ensure people would not use the legislation in order to get out of the snare.  My difficulty is they could argue through that whole maze of words that in some way the employment or the contract was not covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's and the Department's commitment to have an information campaign on this Bill and to display an abstract of the main aspects of it.  Unfortunately, information campaigns by their nature are transient &mdash; they are there for a while and then gone.  This Bill will last a long period and there will not be an information campaign in five, six or ten years' time when the Bill is still in operation.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that section 1 (b) could create a problem.  However, I welcome the Minister's commitment to discuss this and discuss the implications with the major employer's associations and organisations.  I would consider having discussions with congress myself about the Minister's point that the acceptance of my amendment might create a difficulty in relation to casual work for a neighbour or babysitting for a relative. The Minister makes an emotive point &mdash; she did it with such facility today that I am sure she has made it many times before.  It still has to be taken on board. I accept that and I will be looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one of my favourite speeches, about the time pressure. There was no time pressure.  The directive was signed in Luxembourg on 22 June 1994.  There is a rule somewhere in the heart of every Government since I was elected to this House ten years ago that no European Directive shall be enacted earlier than one week before two years has elapsed.  That is the real issue.  I have heard Ministers of the present Government argue in regard to the maternity directive that it has two years to enact it, as if it was a requirement to wait two years.  There is no time pressure except that which the Minister <Col N="1900" /> placed upon herself.  The time pressure is not something which this House can be pushed along on.  If we are unhappy we have to work on the basis we are mere nationals and that this is a mere national Parliament.  We will make changes on Report Stage, if needed, despite the embarassment to the Government of being a week or a day longer than the two years.  I am sure no one will get the Minister as far as the European Court in those couple of days. I ask the Minister to have another look at the matter and I will come back to it. I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>We had a recent discussion in this House on the Refugee Bill, where we were trying to establish the relationship between the national legislation and the Geneva Convention.  Forms of words such as this were resisted by another Department.  I welcome that clarification. I compliment the Minister and the draftsperson for bringing it through. The position of national legislation is that it is not quite subordinate, rather it is an extension of the process of implementation of the EU Directive.  I welcome this.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (4) states:</P>
      <P>In this Act a reference to a section or Schedule, is a reference to a section of, or Schedule to, this Act, unless there is an indication that a reference to any other enactment is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> This is new to me, as is section 1 (5).  I would prefer if these provisions were not included because they are of the kind which make our court proceedings far too complex.  They could not mean anything else.  Where they are not written in to other legislation, somebody may use them to claim that the provision was not understood to refer to what it clearly did refer to.  This worries me in that it almost establishes a precedent. However, there are other aspects of the Bill which are very important.</P>

If the Minister can make a declaration she can also rescind it with the same power by another order. Regulations normally allow Ministers to withdraw an order by another order. The inclusion of this power in the legislation implies that situations could arise where a Minister would be entitled to issue an order but may not be entitled to invoke, amend or withdraw an order with another order.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (6), line 36, to delete &ldquo;8&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (6) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (7), an employer may employ a child who is over the age of 14 years and who is a full-time student at an institute of secondary education pursuant to any arrangement made or approved of by the Minister for Education as part of a programme of work experience or educational programme:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1903" /> Provided that the hours of work do not exceed 8 hours in any day or 40 hours in any week.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the eight hours to seven and the 40 hours to 35.  There is an inconsistency in the Bill here.  By implication or statement, arrangements have been made for younger children and for young persons at a higher level.  The arrangements for 14 to 16 year olds appear to be the same as those for 16 to 18 year olds.  By definition, 14 to 16 year olds could be part of a course of study.  I do not understand, therefore, how the Minister of State has agreed to allow eight hours daily work for those who are also studying and are perhaps engaged in educational programmes.  It is inconsistent.</P>

Do the eight hours and 40 hours specified here include the break times which are specified in the next section?  Does eight hours mean seven hours work and one hour break time, or does it mean eight hours work with the break time additional to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator O'Toole, the Bill transposes a EU Directive which distinguishes between under 15 year olds and over 15 year olds.  When bringing in the legislation I took the opportunity to draw a different distinction between 16 year olds and over and under 16 year olds in line with the proposals to raise the school leaving age to 16 years.  There are, therefore, three categories: the 14 to 15 year olds, which is the group whose hours of work are specified in the directive, the 15 to 16 year olds and the over 16 year olds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing that 14 year olds working outside the school term can work 35 hours a week seven hours a day maximum.  They must get a three weeks <Col N="1904" /> break in the summer so that they can return to school refreshed.  The 1977 legislation, which we are repealing, provided that the older young people could work a maximum of 45 hours per week, nine hours per day.  I am reducing that to 40 hours per week, eight hours per day, in line with the directive.  We no longer have a distinction between what the 15 years olds and the 16 to 18 year olds can work because I am reducing the hours in respect of the 16 to 18 year olds.  My proposal is in line with the directive.</P>
    <P>With regard to 14 year olds, they would work only eight hours a day, or 40 hours per week where they are full-time students and are part of organised work experience or educational programmes which would have to be approved.  There may be limited circumstances &mdash; we would envisage them being limited enough &mdash; where the nature of the work experience or training programme would involve a slightly longer day or week simply because that is what is on offer or that is what the employer works to.  The chances of young people getting on these course may be jeopardised if they have difficulty meeting requirements on hours.  If it is regarded as part of their education course that somebody is placed on a work experience programme, for example in the local hairdressers, they should work the standard hours. However, this would have to be approved to ensure that young people are not exploited.  We are not talking about somebody doing a full day's school work and working 40 hours a week on top of it.  This is a situation where somebody may work for a fortnight out of school in a job placement and adhere to the normal hours of work of that employment.</P>
    <P>It is there to allow some flexibility, but the intention is to ensure that in examining what is happening we are not exploiting or overstretching the young people concerned.  That is why the regimes applying to 16 to 18 year olds and 15 year olds are the same.  We have reduced the number of hours for 16 to <Col N="1905" /> 18 year olds and I believe they are reasonable.  We protect the younger children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seven hours a day or 40 hours a week.  There are some training or work placement programmes where it would restrict opportunities for young people if one was to reduce the hours.  We want to allow for flexibility. The courses must be approved either through FAS or the Minister for Education. That gives us some leverage to ensure we have flexibility and that it is not abused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I conduct programmes where young people are sent out on work experience.  Whatever we do we must keep it clear and simple because the more I listen to this debate the more confused I get.  I am worried that we will confuse the issue further. The hours should be reduced further.</P>
      <P>Some days young children may work two hours and the next day they may work for more than the specified number of hours, depending on the type of work involved.  Flexibility is required because it is so difficult to get work for young people.  It is too difficult to measure it in terms of hours per day, but it would work out over a week.</P>
      <P>Although I know it would not work, if I had my way I would have reduced it further because there is a certain amount of exploitation of young people, particularly those who must do work experience for their leaving certificate. There is a tendency for exploitation in catering and the bar trade because they know they can get cheap labour.  This concern is creeping in because of the requirements of the vocational leaving certificate and leaving certificate applied programmes.  It concerns me greatly that there would be exploitation. At least we have some ruling because I am a little uneasy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information must go to the schools quickly for those who are dealing <Col N="1906" /> with this area because it forms a significant requirement of the leaving certificate. The school authorities do not know where they stand or what requirements are necessary for work experience programmes.  This information must be available in the public arena.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about young people and school children who are working.  There is an inconsistency which the Minister explained by saying that she has improved matters in the top band by reducing the limit to that of the middle band.  She is now a victim of her own success because we are claiming the same argument in reverse.  That is a realistic position.</P>
      <P>It seems unacceptable that people attending school, regardless of whether they are part of a training programme attaching to the school, would work adult hours.  It must be wrong to expect them to work adult hours.  In fact these hours are longer than that recommended under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  That is a slight over-statement, but the recommendation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is that the working week would be reduced to 39 hours and this goes beyond that.</P>
      <P>I would find it impossible, as a member of the executive council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and as general secretary of a teachers' trade union, to go along with the view that children on work experience programmes attaching to schools could be asked to work longer hours per week than the social partners feel is necessary for an ordinary worker.  There is an inconsistency there and it is one to which I will return.  Parents and teachers would worry about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that it is probably a theoretical argument.  I do not believe any teachers or school authorities would organise a scheme where people would have to work more hours than would be required of an adult.  Nonetheless, it gives the wrong signal if the legislation allows what would appear to be &mdash;in small letters &mdash; exploitation.  I recognise <Col N="1907" /> the Minister's point that those participating in work experience schemes or other programmes attaching to education would be able to fit in with the rota or shift system in operation. However, this can be sorted out through a longer lunch hour or break during the day.  It is not beyond the bounds of human ingenuity.</P>
    <P>I recognise the distinction the Minister made between those who are under 15, 15 to 16 year olds and over 16.  It is a valid argument and is one of the most progressive provisions in the legislation. However, I continue to worry about the number of hours that can be imposed on young people under the legislation as drafted.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the matter and to look at this inconsistency.</P>
    <P>It is fine for the Minister to say she has reduced the hours for the top band. That was worth doing but the same arguments apply to reduce the middle band.  The argument can be said to have a trickle down effect where the Minister could do precisely the same at the next level.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question whether &ldquo;hours of work&rdquo; includes the periods of rest or obligatory break periods specified in the next section.  However, I see now that I should not have asked the question because if I had been diligent enough in my study of the Bill I would have seen in the interpretation section that &ldquo;hours of work&rdquo; does not include periods of rest during which the employee is not required to be available for work.  The Minister might clarify whether &ldquo;hours of work&rdquo; includes periods during which the employee would be travelling to and from work.  Sometimes even students on work experience schemes and so on have to travel long distances to work.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Senator Mullooly.  I was so busy explaining the complicated details of the different age groups to Senator O'Toole <Col N="1908" /> that I overlooked his point.  I am delighted that he found it himself; he is a good student.  &ldquo;Hours of work&rdquo; as defined in law do not include travel times.</P>
      <P>I recognise Senator O'Toole's concern. We are trying in law to set out a framework and to set maxima.  I hope, no more than the Senator himself, that no young people would be obliged to work more than the hours laid down in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  However, Senator Ormonde made an interesting point and she is speaking from practical experience.  She said that somebody on a work experience programme may work two hours today and nine hours tomorrow.  Our directive requires that they work only eight hours.  We want to allow ourselves flexibility by providing for eight hours and 40 hours and hopefully the aggregate will be well below that.</P>
      <P>These programmes must be cleared by school, education and training authorities which provide protection.  If we were to write down in law everything that is custom, practice or the subject of negotiation and if there was an edge, we would be precluded from going over it. That is one of the reasons we try to leave flexibility.  If 14 to 16 year olds are working outside term time they are subject to the seven hours per day, or 35 hours per week rule.  During the school year their hours of work are also restricted. If part of a work experience and training programme, 15 to 16 year olds can work eight hours per day, or 40 hours per week.  Because these hours must be approved.  I hope it will allow us to balance flexibility against the need to ensure young people are not exploited.  The education authorities are always concerned that they place people in genuine work experience programmes which fit in with employers rota and rosters.  It is hard to find placements for young people which mirror the world of work, which give them genuine experience and which are nonexploitative.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (9), line 2, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, following consultation with such representatives of employers and representatives of employees as the Minister considers appropriate,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this section before I decide what to do on the next Stage. Until now we have spoken about technical and practical things and the straightforward questions of hours, interpretation and explanation.  We are now dealing with a more fundamental issue which should be of no difficulty to the Minister.  Under the Bill as it stands &ldquo;the Minister may attach to such licence or provide in such regulations such conditions as the Minister sees fit.&rdquo;  This is old fashioned and I look forward to the Minister's explanation.</P>
      <P>My simple and inoffensive amendment states that after the words &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;, we include the words &ldquo;following consultation with such representatives of employers and representatives of employees as the Minister considers appropriate,&rdquo;.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is speaking up for the rights of employers, an indication of where social partnership has gone.  We believe in the social partnership and in giving a voice to the social partners.  A chapter in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> deals with the social partnership and the importance of reaching agreement in these days of competitiveness, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the hours which a school child or a young person may work, which is of concern to us all.  The Minister is taking upon herself the authority to make decisions on the conditions attached to the narrow regulations in relation to the matters we discussed &mdash; I will not go into the details again.  It would be appropriate for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to say <Col N="1910" /> it would like teacher representatives to have a say.  It would also be appropriate for IBEC to consult with the employers to see what is or is not reasonable.</P>
    <P>What I propose is reasonable and I do not understand why it is unacceptable to the Minister.  She should do the decent and honourable thing and ask the draftspeople to read the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to make them aware this is Government policy so it may be implemented.</P>

I could understand why he should look for consultation with employers and employees in relation to other aspects of the Bill.  He refers to subsection (3) concerning the employment of a child in cultural, artistic, sports and advertising and subsection (7) on work experience.  Why is he looking for consultation with employers and employees specifically in relation to those subsections?  I would imagine 13 year olds involved in sports would be particularly good athletes and might be getting paid and that consultation would be more important with educational bodies rather than representatives of employers and employees.</P>

      <P>The Minister will confirm that section 3 (2) refers to safety, health and the development of the child. There is an abundance of legislation and directives coming from Europe at present on health and safety.  Each directive talks about co-operation between workers and employers.  There are Europe-wide committees which are representative of Governments, employers and employees and the National Health and Safety Authority is representative of employers, employees and the Minister.  At every level of health and safety there is full consultation, because it is recognised that people usually know best.  There is a requirement for a safety officer in every workplace.</P>
      <P>A Minister cocooned &mdash; despite how well informed he or she may be &mdash; will not recognise the difficulties faced by those working in asbestos lined offices in back street factories.  That would not arise in this case, but I am getting carried away with my argument.  In all aspects of health and safety there is a requirement under all EU directives of which I am aware that employers and employees are involved.  When the decent and responsible people in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions looked at the Bill, they saw the Minister had forgotten this, that the draftspeople were not made aware of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the directives emanating from Europe on health and safety and the need for consultation to involve all the social partners etc.</P>

      <P>This section deals with employment on an individual basis of children under 13 years of age in cultural, sporting, advertising or similar activities.  For example, it may involve 13 year olds as a group of extras in a film or advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 (9) says that &ldquo;the Minister may attach to such licence or provide in such regulations such conditions as the Minister sees fit.&rdquo;.  It is my intention, before drawing up &mdash; we have already regulations under the old legislation &mdash;<Col N="1912" /> models for individual licences or group regulations, to consult with both sides and with educational interests.  One of the main conditions in such licences are conditions about having a tutor who will ensure that young people will get a minimum level of schooling if, for example, they are on location in making a film, or having a chaperone or a suitable adult to supervise them if their parents cannot be there so that their educational and moral welfare etc., is properly safeguarded.  I intend to consult with both sides, particularly with the educational interests, before we decide on what will be model licences or regulations in this regard.  I give that undertaking without us having to write it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we were to do this, it could lead to inflexibility in specific cases.  Two young people are starring in a film being made in Ireland this summer.  The finance for the film only came together at a late stage and we are under a lot of time pressure in consulting.  In those situations it may not be practicable to consult on individual cases if an advertisement or film is being made or a paid sporting fixture is taking place under a time deadline.  However, I intend that the model agreement which might be adapted in individual cases will be discussed with both sides of industry, the social partners and specifically with educational interests and I give that under-taking to the House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised a more general point in regard to health, safety and welfare at work.  The laws that apply in that regard do so across the board irrespective of the age of the person concerned. Senator O'Toole is right; these regulations are enforced by our tripartite Health and Safety Authority and are drawn up in a consultative manner representing both sides of industry, which draws up detailed regulations on specific areas like building etc.  We do not intend to make young people work in asbestos sheds etc. but we have in mind specific conditions that are tied in with the belief that the schooling of these young people comes first.  There <Col N="1913" /> may be a particular need for protecting the young people concerned in the areas of supervision, chaperonage and so on if they are working on a film set.  This is the intention of this section and it would contain these kinds of conditions.  These are specific to young people and we will be discussing our model regulations and licences with the interested parties.</P>

      <P>I had thought about putting down another amendment to this section.  The Minister referred to interference with a child's education. The Bill says &ldquo;the child's attendance at school&rdquo;.  I thought it would be more appropriate if it said &ldquo;the child's education&rdquo;. I did not put this amendment down because I was not exactly sure of the impact it may have in other places. However, I am not sure if employing a tutor, which is the way this would normally be dealt with in the film industry in particular, is allowed under this provision. Employing a tutor would mean a child would not be attending school.  A broad interpretation of that may be that the child could be attending a different school with the tutor, but I still think it is too loose.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said that she intends to consult with the interested parties before putting in any agreements. However, the consultation which I am talking about could take a more restricted form.  In many areas consultation is simply prior notification to the interested parties of the Minister's intention to do something, the provision would be circulated to them in confidence and the Minister would like to hear any comments from them.  The Minister would not be held up in any way; it is not a matter of having rounds of meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to meet with the employers or trade unions on this issue.  However, the Minister's commitment, however well meant, does not carry the force of law.  Time and time again, courts and judges, if it ever came to that, would reject this. They may say the argument given here is of no use, because once the Bill is <Col N="1914" /> enacted the only people who can interpret it are not in court.  The Minister's words of explanation might be used by counsel to support the argument, but the justice would interpret these words as they are printed, published and passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that the film industry, for example, can work in the weirdest and most wonderful of places and there can be risks of all sorts. It does apply in this case.  It is not a matter of restriction; I am only using that as an example.  When replying to my argument that there should be in the legislation consultation with the trade unions and employers' organisations etc., the Minister said that this was a good idea, she agrees with it and will do it; but she will not tell me why she will not put it into the legislation.  It is not restrictive in any way.  It is still up to the Minister to decide how this consultation will take place and with whom, as she considers appropriate.  That discretion in my proposed amendment still allows the Minister to decide who would be the appropriate representatives with which to speak.  I have heard no argument from the Minister why this should not be included.</P>

      <P>It is my intention that model agreements would be discussed with all the interested parties. We will have those and use them in general circumstances.  However, it is likely that something may come up urgently &mdash; for example, in the middle of the holidays &mdash; when it would not be possible or practicable to consult with both sides of industry in advance of giving a licence.  In the entertainment world, things can change quickly &mdash; an understudy may be called on to fill in for somebody who is sick or an advertisement may have to be made in two days &mdash; and it might not be practicable to have consultations on the details of an individual licence for an individually named child in that time.  We are doing this only for that practical reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these cases we would take our model agreement, which would have <Col N="1915" /> been discussed with all parties, from the shelf and make whatever variations might be appropriate in a certain circumstance if they were warranted &mdash; they would not be in general.  If we were to go through this process for each individual licence on every advertisement, the unions and employers would not thank us for burdening them with this extra administrative chore and it may pose some practical difficulties when an urgent situation arose.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently been dealing with a reasonably urgent situation. Sometimes this is not possible if consultations are to be meaningful.  I envisage consultations involving genuine discussions, listening to and adapting our draft model agreement after discussing it with the relevant people and not having a rubber stamping exercise.  I give that undertaking to the House.  We will have genuine consultation about the model forms of licence and regulations which will apply in these cases.  The House should allow me the flexibility of acting in individual cases of urgency without having to go through a procedure included in the statute just as a rubber stamping measure.</P>

      <P>Subsection (9) provides that whenever the Minister grants a licence under subsection (2) conditions may be attached to it.  It would be in everybody's interest if the principle of consultation was included in the section because future Ministers operating under the Act may not be as enlightened or anxious to engage in consultation as the current Minister.  The principle of consultation should be included in the subsection, with perhaps a different wording from that proposed by Senator O'Toole, such as: &ldquo;following consultation with such representatives of employers or employees or other interests as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  Having listened to Senator O'Toole's point and the Minister's <Col N="1916" /> reply, I favour including the principle of consultation in the subsection.</P>

      <P>The intention is to have consultation on the model agreements. They will be taken off a shelf and applied in individual cases.  If a requirement for consultation is included in the statute, the Minister will be unduly tied every time a child acts in a film or an advertisement, particularly if there was consultation and everybody is happy with the general form of licence and regulations and the conditions which must be applied in individual cases.</P>
      <P>At present the film industry is booming and may youngsters are employed as extras in advertisements, etc.  The current system, which evolved following consultation, is working well.  I should have sufficient flexibility so the Department is not urgently looking for consultations at a time when it cannot find anybody to consult.  This matter is about practicality, not principle.  The Senator may be satisfied that the substance of what he and Senator O'Toole are seeking will be delivered.  It was delivered by previous Ministers in relation to the forms of licences given for youngsters participating in films and advertisements, etc.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) provides:</P>

    <P>The Minister may, by licence, authorise in individual cases, the employment of a child in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising activities which <Col N="1917" /> are not likely to be harmful to the safety, health or development of the child...</P>

    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, authorise the employment of children over the age of 13 years in cultural, artistic, sports or advertising activities which are not harmful to the safety, health or development of children...</P>
    <P>Why is the same formula of words not used in both subsections?</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) states: &ldquo;An employer may retain in his or her employment any child of 15 years of age who was in his or her employment immediately before the commencement of this section...&rdquo;  If a child was in the employment of somebody on an occasional basis prior to the commencement of the section, will the employer be exempt from the section's provisions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) deals with an individual licence for an individual child, while subsection (3) deals with a general licence to employ a number of children.  The licence is issued to the employer because, under subsection (1), an employer is prohibited from employing people under a particular age unless they have a licence for an under 13 year old or, by regulation, a group licence for a number of 13 year olds. More stringent conditions are attached to a group licence because it cannot be tied down as tightly as licences for individual children.  This is the reason for the distinction.</P>

Such a child might only work for one or two hours a week on an occasional basis for a particular employer.  Would that be sufficient to exempt the employer from the provisions of the section?</P>

      <P>In the normal course of events the conditions relating to the employment of children aged 15 years and over are more relaxed than those relating to children under 15 years.  In general the section deals with the employment of younger children in specific areas.  For example, in the performance area, an 18 year old cannot pretend to be a 12 year old and exemptions to the general prohibition on children working before they are 14 years of age are contained in the legislation for such cases.  This was also the case in the previous legislation.  Fifteen year olds are usually covered by the ordinary conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>The minimum age for entering employment is increased in the Bill from 15 to 16 years.  The Bill contains transitional provisions to ensure that when the Bill comes into force a 15 year old, who is lawfully working under the existing rules, is not fired.  This is the purpose of subsection (10).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (4), line 25, after &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and include Sunday&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; is included in amendment No. 8, but it also applies to amendment No. 7, because the last line <Col N="1919" /> of subsection (4) states &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I seek the support of Senator O'Sullivan on this matter.  One of the main difficulties with Ferenke many years ago related to the shift working operations of the employees.  Despite the fact that the workers had two days off every week, these days were consecutive only six times in the year and only once in the year did they fall on a Saturday and Sunday.  This led to a dissatisfied and restless workforce because the workers' body clocks and biorhythms were undermined.</P>
    <P>This legislation says &ldquo;an employer shall ensure that an employee who is a child receives, in any period of seven days, a minimum rest period of two days which shall as far as practicable be consecutive&rdquo;. We are agreed on that.  I am asking to add &ldquo;and include Sunday&rdquo; so it will now read &ldquo;as far as practicable be consecutive and include Sunday.&rdquo;  If it is not practicable it cannot be done. Similarly, Sunday should be included in the rest period in the next subsection. This recognises Sunday as being a family day and a time of focused social activity in the home.  We are talking about young people and children here. It behoves us to give every indication and signal there about where we feel children might be most comfortable or how we might best look after their interests.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is not something that can be held to the letter of the law. Somebody need only say that it is not practicable to do this, but if there is a choice on giving Sunday off to a younger person or an older person in a workplace when rosters are being organised, the bias should be towards the younger person as far as it is practicable. I could make an equal argument in reverse about a parent who would be separated from their children.  I am anticipating what the Minister of State might say to me.  It is a question of the rights of the child taking priority here. We should as far as possible include Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I published this legislation the main area of controversy and correspondence on it, apart from the broad welcome given by teachers to the thrust of it being pro-education, was from young people who felt that it was restricting their opportunities to go out and earn a few bob to buy their Reeboks, Levis and other brand name products.  My teenage daughters raised objections to the parts of the Bill which involved re-enactment of things that had been the law for the last 18 years.  We should be reasonably conscious that there is a strong move by young people to ensure we are not acting unreasonably and paternalistically with regard to them in so far as we, as adults, are trying to protect their long term welfare and education.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator O'Toole's amendment would be, for example, to cut out a lot of holiday work for young people aged 14 and 15.  That holiday work tends to be relief work in the hotel and catering industry.  People in this age group would be quite happy to work in a café on a Sunday and would regard it as an unreasonable restriction if we were to say that you cannot work in a café on a Sunday because you are under 16, whereas hanging around with their parents may be a far less desirable way of spending their time than earning a few bob on the day in question.  This amendment would be unpopular with young people.  It would be regarded as an unreasonable restriction on the kinds of jobs they can take up as supplementary work during school time.  Young people tend to work in the retail and the hotel and catering areas.  It would be regarded in holiday resorts as an unreasonable restriction on the job opportunities facing young people in this age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is a choice between allowing a parent with a four year old child to take Sunday off and allowing a rebellious teenager the opportunity of a Sunday off when the last thing they want to do is spend Sunday with their parents, I, as a parent of teenagers, would be more likely to give the parent with the young <Col N="1921" /> child the day off.  The family day is more important to them.  We have put consecutive days into section 4(4) in so far as is practicable.  This is the point the Senator made about Ferenke.  This can be tested at the end of the day if employers are not giving, for spurious reasons, the young people two consecutive days off.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be so restrictive as to say you cannot work two hours in your local café on a Sunday during term time or on Sundays during your school holidays which is when people are looking for staff.  I have sent off for drafting the Working Time Bill, which addresses the issue of Sunday working across the board.  We are looking for people who work on Sundays to receive premium time off or premium payments and that would apply to people of any age.  I am legislating on the issue of Sunday work in other areas, but an outright prohibition here would not be appropriate and would not be welcomed by the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has mischievously misinterpreted what I said.  There is no question of not allowing somebody to work on a Sunday. That is not the issue here.  A rest period is a non-working period.  The question of somebody working on a Sunday does not arise in this section unless I am misreading it.  This only applies to people who are working for seven days and it means that out of those seven they should have some time off.  What my amendment is saying is that as far as it is practicable that time should include Sunday.  That is it in its simplest form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not mean that it would not apply to somebody who was simply working at weekends.  My reading of the Bill is that this section does not apply to somebody who is merely working at weekends.  This applies to somebody who is working.  &ldquo;An employer shall ensure that an employee who is a child receives, in any period of seven days, a minimum rest period of two days which <Col N="1922" /> shall as far as is practicable be consecutive.&rdquo; That should be Sunday.  A rest period is when they are not working, so we are talking about the whole week there.  It does not apply to somebody who works on a Sunday only.  It is a little bit mischievous to give the impression that somebody cannot get hours in their local café on a Sunday.  That would not be restricted.  Somebody who is working full-time in a place should as far as is practicable have Sunday off.  The Minster of State should concede that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be an unreasonable restriction on the kind of jobs young people could take up during their summer holidays if they were by and large precluded from having Sunday included on their roster whatever about the argument about the youngsters working on a Sunday during term time.  Young people tend to get offered Sunday rosters because of the nature and types of work that they do.  Many young people would regard it as a restriction on their earning capacity if they were not able to work on Sundays and as a result this would not be an appropriate amendment.</P>
      <P>I am addressing other issues in relation to Sunday working in the Working Time Bill, which will be the first time we will have legislated for Sunday working.  That will apply to workers of all ages, but to have a restriction that applies simply to young people would be unpopular and there is no demand for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Every employer shall provide any child or young person in his or her employment with a copy of the prescribed abstract of the Act within 7 days of commencing employment with the employer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I expected, and still expect until I hear to the contrary, that the Minister will accept this particular amendment.  The Minister made a strong point some time ago about the need for an information strategy to ensure children were aware of their rights and that employers knew them also.  She said that this would be followed up by information through the schools, employers' organisations and trade unions.</P>
      <P>It seems that there is one clear test of the Minister's diligence and commitment to this area.  An information programme is surely important and, similarly, such programmes are worthy and effective for as long as they last, which would involve a particular period of time.  The information programme will not be continued in four, five or six years' time when children are still being employed.  It seems a simple and effective consolidation of the methodology to ensure we do not forget what is intended by this Bill; that the programme of information continue in perpetuity and that it no longer become a responsibility of the Minister, training agencies, educational authorities, teachers, parents, etc., to ensure young people are aware of their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> Section 12 requires employers to display an abstract of the Act in the place of employment at the entrances to the premises.  Therefore, this abstract will be printed and available.  There is no additional requirement.  All that is required is that the young person receive a copy of the abstract of the Act with his or her first pay cheque.  It is a reasonable, simple, highly effective measure which saves the State because it will not require continuing programmes of information to make people aware of their rights.  It is a matter which is in line with the spirit of the Bill and the directive.  I commend this provision to the Minister and ask her to respond reasonably by accepting this crucial amendment.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment.  A copy of the prescribed abstract of the Act should be provided to the child or young person within a reasonable period of that person taking up employment.  No matter how condensed the abstract of the Act is, it will still be pretty lengthy and will require a certain amount of time to read and absorb.  By providing a copy to the young person you are giving the young person an opportunity to consider it, read it, digest it in their own time and perhaps seek an explanation or clarification of some aspect of it with which they might have some difficulty.  This amendment has a considerable amount of merit and I join Senator O'Toole in urging the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole. Under present labour laws an employer must display the regulations in the premises.  Where an employer displays them is a matter of consequence in certain areas, but I do not think one Senator could say they have seen them displayed in business premises in the last number of years.  I have never seen them in schools but I have seen them when inspectors have come around from the Department of Labour.  The amendment would counter the effect of <Col N="1926" /> an employer putting the abstract of the Act at the back of the premises where it will not be seen by the public.</P>
      <P>The employee under the Act is a employee who has a contract.  The Minister spoke of casual labour, but casual labour does not have a contract.  Such workers get part-time work at £x per hour for a couple of days per week.  If the Minister is to introduce any regulations under the Act, the employee should be given a copy of the agreement which they are purported to have signed or made with the employer, that is, &ldquo;the person with whom the employee has entered into or for whom the employee works under... a contract&rdquo;.  I have never seen a casual worker enter into a contract with any employer.</P>

      <P>The Department will be launching an information campaign and it will not be a one off campaign because, as Senator O'Toole recognised, there are new generations of young people coming through the system.  What we have in mind is a systematic programme involving schools and the youth committee of ICTU.  I have already discussed this with the assistant general secretary of ICTU and I know ICTU is anxious to get involved in a constructive way.</P>
      <P>We are also undertaking a programme of information campaigns on existing labour legislation as well as this Bill, which will be launched on Tuesday. In that context we have been looking at imaginative new ways of communicating with people.  Senator O'Toole suggested giving people a piece of paper within a week of starting work.  There are other ways to get information across to people which are easily heard, read and digested.  On Tuesday we will start to use Teletext, which is on the Internet, to provide information on employment rights.  That is an important and constructive way of doing it.  We are also looking at ways of expanding such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abstracts of the old Acts, particularly in the 1930s, were as dry and unread as the original legislation.  This <Col N="1927" /> section deals with a prescribed abstract of the Act.  We are also looking at other forms, such as cartoons, to get the information across to people.  It might not be appropriate for ministerial prescribed abstracts, but it would be a positive way of telling people about their rights and obligations.  We will talk to the major employers of young people, such as supermarket owners, vintners and restaurant and hotel owners, about their legal obligations and how to ensure the legislation is implemented.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that &ldquo;Every employer shall display at the principal entrances to the premises .... and in such other places as an inspector may require&rdquo;.  That gives me the flexibility to expand on the type of information we provide.  We have been working on the preparation of abstracts of labour law which are similar to menu cards provided in canteens to ensure that people can understand them.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to take on board as many constructive suggestions as possible on how to promulgate this legislation to ensure that we are not just offering people bumf but that we make sure it is used.  I recently spoke to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors.  It is involved on an ongoing basis in reaching out to young people and ensuring the information gets through to them.  A range of contact points, including FÁS offices, employment exchanges, local employment services, Youthreach programmes, etc. can be used to get information across in a new and imaginative way.  Senator O'Toole's suggestion is interesting but it will tie us down to one way of doing it.  We should put our heads together and devise more imaginative ways to ensure that not only is the information given but it is received and read by young people.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator O'Toole to consider the points I have made.  I accept his point and I am trying to meet his concerns and to ensure it is not done on a onceoff basis.  We should bring together all the expertise we have to ensure that young people receive this information <Col N="1928" /> and that is not just regarded as another piece of paper.  I would like to explore imaginative ways of doing that.</P>

      <P>Imaginative new ways are important but tried, tested and effective old ways are also important. Today I asked in the Library for an Internet connection which Members could use.  That will eventually happen. Earlier this month at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I raised the fact that we should have an E-mail address.  I cannot send an E-mail to this House from outside.  Imaginative new ways sound good in theory but they do not work in practice if people cannot use them.</P>
      <P>My amendment is important because it does not preclude the imaginative new ways the Minister mentioned and with which I agree.  However, handing somebody the abstract has long-term implications. It is a continuing education and a type of monitoring operation and it is most likely to find its way into the hands of the child's or young person's parents, who will also become more informed. This amendment would create a continuous programme of information and education and it would cost only the money to print and copy the abstract of the Act.  The wording of the abstract and the inclusion of cartoons is at the Minister's discretion.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from doing what is required to make it attractive.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned where the abstract of the Act may be located. Section 12 mentions the &ldquo;principal entrances&rdquo;.  The back of the door of the principal entrance would be a great place to display it where nobody could read it.  This is a loose form of words which does not require it to be seen. One cannot say it is displayed when it cannot be seen.  I do not know how this section will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forgive me if I sound cynical &mdash; I believe that when politicians become cynical they should resign &mdash; but I place a wager with the Minister that when this Act comes into operation in the next fortnight, the number of inspectors <Col N="1929" /> required will not be appointed.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions will be fighting for their appointment this time next year and the year after.  They will be appointed with the same rapidity as all other inspectors in labour legislation, whether in the health and safety area or in other areas.  I am on the central review committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, so I know what I am talking about.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions put forward the case at every meeting for the employment of one inspector or another under the various forms of legislation.  I do not believe there is a budget in the Department for the appointment of these inspectors.  If the Minister contradicts me, I will apologise profusely and I will spread the word far and wide.  This will not pass the new embargo because there is no commitment to appoint them.</P>
    <P>This is a practical amendment which the Minister has not convinced me I should withdraw.  I might table it again on Report Stage which could lead to the slow passage of this legislation through the House.  It could also mean we would be out of Kilter with what is required by our European colleagues, which would be embarrassing in the week before we assume the EU Presidency.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to register my grave reservation in relation to section 12.  It will not work in the way it is presented if the abstract is to be displayed at the entrance to these places of work.  Some young employees or their parents may not be able to read properly and may not fully understand what would be displayed so it should be handed to the schools.  I agree with what Senator O'Toole's amendment tries to achieve but we must look at other ways of creating that link so that young people will not be exploited.  I could not accept this section as it stands.</P>

      <P>This section is an absolute nonsense.  It is nonsense to think that every employer will now display a notice at the principal entrance to his or <Col N="1930" /> her business.  Where is the principal entrance for somebody who is selling strawberries?  Children are employed to sell strawberries on the side of the road. We passed casual trading legislation here recently and only certain groups are exempt from its provisions.  Until that legislation was enacted, people who sold strawberries at the side of the road were exempt from casual trading legislation but now they are only exempt if the local authority deems them to be exempt.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain where a farmer who employs his son or daughter to do this kind of work will display a notice of the relevant provisions under the principal Act?  Will chip shops in Ballybunion put a notice inside the door as required under this legislation?  Can the Minister imagine lads going into the chip shop looking for this notice?  This is an absolute nonsense.  What has been proposed in the amendment should have been in the original Bill.  A young employee should be handed a notice or an abstract of the conditions of employment. That section as it stands is absolute nonsense.  As Senator O'Toole said, no inspectors will go out to check the doors and windows of places of employment of young people to see whether there are notices of the abstract of the employees' legislation.  When tourists come to Ireland, instead of reading the prices of whatever is on display in the shops, they will read notices of employees' rights.  This is an absolute nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused to some extent by some of the comments made by Senator Lanigan and I agree with some of them.  However, many employers have displayed regulations as they are required to do by law in places where they can be read and it would be unfair to give the impression that they do not comply with the law of the land. In the particular case of the young people who are selling strawberries &mdash; they have been selling them on our own road every day for the last couple of weeks &mdash; if the Senator takes this provision <Col N="1931" /> to its logical conclusion the notice could only be placed either on the boot of the car in which they are taken to the place where they will sell the strawberries or on the corner of the pallet on the side of the road.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the points being raised here.  Perhaps it is not practical to do so but it is important that when we bring forward legislation we do it in such a way as to help the people we want to help.  We are all on the same side as far as this issue is concerned. We want to protect those whom it is the purpose of the legislation to protect.  At the same time, we all know this legislation will not be displayed on the side of pallets or on the boots of the cars.</P>

      <P>I fully support the provision in this section that the prescribed abstract of the Act be displayed in all places of employment.  I have no objection to that; it is very desirable. However, I also support Senator O'Toole's amendment that each employee be provided with a copy of the prescribed abstract of the Act for all the reasons that have been stated here but particularly because it gives the employee an opportunity to study in his or her own time the particular abstract and also to seek clarification on any aspect of it which might not be very clear to that employee.</P>
      <P>Usually an amendment is rejected by a Minister on the basis that it is in some way flawed.  However, the Minister has not given us any reason to think that she considers this amendment to be flawed or that it would adversely impact in any way on either this section or on the Act.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the points made.  I am very anxious that the maximum information is made available in as user friendly a form as possible to the young people concerned.  I wish to respond to a couple <Col N="1932" /> of the points made.  Senator Lanigan raised the issue of the strawberry sellers. Employees who are family members would not be regarded as employees for the purposes of this legislation and the situation would not arise.  However, the Senator has raised an interesting point in relation to people who sell produce from the side of the road.</P>
      <P>Section 12, as written, repeats the provision in our existing law.  It is a straightforward re-enactment of what is in the 1977 Act.  This has been one of the most useful sections in terms of prosecutions for breaches of the Act. Sometimes, particularly if young people are colluding with an employer or are unwilling or afraid to give evidence, it becomes very difficult to engage in prosecutions but either an abstract is displayed or it is not and it has been an important way of ensuring that we are able to prosecute non-compliant employers.</P>
      <P>Most successful prosecutions have involved a conviction under this section. Unfortunately it has proved difficult to get convictions under other sections because young people may feel intimidated or be reluctant to pursue their rights or the legal duties of the employer in other ways.  That is one of the reasons we will provide another avenue of redress in this Bill through the rights commissioner at the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  We have a role for the parents and the trade unions in terms of pursuing particular grievances under the Act.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan argued to replace our existing provision with Senator O'Toole's proposal.  Senator Mullooly took a different point of view.  He wanted the maintenance of the existing provision with the addition of the amendment.  This is the right course to take.  There may be scope for looking at changing the section to deal with those who sell produce, such as strawberries, by the side of the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there should be an objective legal obligation by which it can be readily ascertained whether employers are meeting their obligations. <Col N="1933" /> If one took out what is already there and substituted Senator O'Toole's suggestion there might be a conflict of evidence between the young person and the employer as to whether the employer had handed over the abstract of the Act at the time of employment.</P>
    <P>Given the positive views on all sides of the House in terms of information, I would like to have a look at this proposal again on Report Stage.  Perhaps Senator O'Toole could reflect on the phrase &ldquo;within seven days&rdquo; because I want to have legislation which is practical and practicable.  If the employer takes on somebody and has to ascertain whether they are a young person, they will have to look for these abstracts and could run into postal delays in the Department.  We would want to examine the period.</P>
    <P>I would like to supplement a prescribed form of information with nonprescribed forms of information because it is difficult to prescribe cartoon information.  One is talking about a set of words and we will try to get it designed as best we can.  As a mother of teenagers myself, I know it is important to have something they will read.  If they get a dull bit of paper it will end up in the bin and, whatever the merits of Senator O'Toole's amendment, they will not look at it.  I want to see young people getting an abstract of the Act in a user friendly leaflet form.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;years.&rdquo; to add &ldquo;Such records shall include copies of the birth certificate of, or other satisfactory evidence of the age of, the young person or child, as the case may be and the written permission of the parent or guardian of the child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section refers to the employer keeping records.  Section 15 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>An employer shall keep, at the place where a young person or child is employed, such records as are necessary to show whether the provisions of this Act are being complied with in relation to his or her employees and such records shall be retained by the employer for at least three years.</P>
      <P>I am proposing to add to that the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such records shall include copies of the birth certificate of, or other satisfactory evidence of the age of, the young person or child, as the case may be, and the written permission of the parent or guardian of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This ties in with all the arguments and discussions we had earlier.  The question of satisfactory evidence of age becomes quite crucial at this point.  It is an issue <Col N="1935" /> which comes up in much legislation.  It arises in the Intoxicating Liquor Act where people can be prosecuted for selling certain substances to underage persons. This is more definite arrangement of contract between a young person or child and an employer who is required to satisfy himself or herself that the child or young person is suitable and able for work and that the application of the law of the land, as it then will be, is proper.</P>
    <P>This is important because of the way people are changing.  As a parent of teenagers, the Minister must have noticed that it is often difficult to establish a young person's age nowadays.  In many cases it is difficult, if not impossible, to tell the difference between a 15, 16 or 17 year old.  Speaking as a teacher I know that with make-up and manner of dress young people can appear to be older than they are.  This can lead to many difficulties.  In addition, some children develop at a faster rate than others and, thus, can look mature beyond their years.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how we can implement the Act without this amendment. Employers will have to satisfy themselves about the age of those they are employing and this is the way to prove that has been done.  It would be useful in terms of the authorisation, certification or records of somebody taking up employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with this amendment which is all about complying with the provisions of the Act.  A link with schools would also help in this regard.  I am not sure whether young people should have to have their birth certificates with them everywhere they go from the age of 14, but the employer should have to show records.  In the interest of clarity I should like the Minister to explain what is meant by &ldquo;such records as are necessary&rdquo;.  Does it mean that it will be necessary to leave one's birth certificate with the employer?</P>

      <P>I find myself at odds with my colleagues on this issue.  Perhaps that is because I have been an employer since 1956.  The only ones I can think of having possibly exploited are my children but perhaps I was exploited by my parents, too, when I worked for them.</P>
      <P>Under the Principal Act, the parent of an under age person, a 14 or 15 year old, must give permission to their child to seek a job.  This amendment, in addition, seeks the provision of a birth certificate.  If the child is looking for a job and the parents want to give them an opportunity to work, why add further difficulties for the employer by way of having to keep records?</P>
      <P>We are talking about part-time jobs during periods when an emergency might arise and an employer might need someone to work for a few weeks or months.  Those who are students and in their mid-teens are all members of the Union of Students in Ireland.  They go off to the United States and we cannot dictate how many hours they will work there during the summer.  We can be confident, though, they will work every hour God gives them to make enough money to go off to Florida or elsewhere for a fortnight's holiday before coming back to drain your pocket for the next year in college.</P>
      <P>We are talking about young people who are looking for part-time jobs. Under the Act children must get their parents' permission to work.  If the child is looking for a part-time job and the parents agree they are capable and willing to do it, why ask the employer to keep records for three or four years for someone who will be working for only a fortnight or three weeks, and for very little money?  Much of this legislation is unnecessary, as is the amendment.  In fact, the Bill is unnecessary in many respects.</P>

      <P>It is unrealistic to require birth certificates in this context. The majority of employers who employ young people will keep the records for at least a year for their tax returns and so forth.  We are providing that the parents or guardians give a letter stating the age of the child and giving permission for the child to be employed. That is sufficient information for the employer.</P>
      <P>If I give my daughter a letter stating she is the appropriate age for employment the letter will be a record to protect the employer and assure him that he is working within the rules.  I doubt that we need to provide in legislation that people must provide birth certificates for part-time work.  We can go over the top making rules and regulations and not help anybody.  Members will agree that a middle of the road approach is most appropriate.</P>

      <P>If the Minister were to accept the amendment it would not involve a great imposition on the employer.  Under section 5 an employer, before employing a young person, must require the production of a copy of the young person's birth certificate and obtain the written permission of the parents or guardians of the child.  These documents will have been produced to the employer at the time the employer was considering employing the young person.  The employer need only retain <Col N="1938" /> the documents to have the records required under this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 15 repeats the existing provisions of the 1977 Act. They are not new except in so far as the records must be kept at the place of employment.  The problem encountered in the past, addressed in section 15, was that when labour inspectors called to the place of employment the records were not on the premises.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with Senator O'Toole's proposal but its requirements are already implied in the Bill.  The employer will have to keep records at the place of employment to show they have complied with the provisions of the Bill.  Details such as the name of the young person, the date of birth, hours of work, salary details, normal working hours and the total amount of salary paid would be included in the records. They are the normal prescribed records to comply with the provisions of the Bill and the employer must keep that information on the premises.</P>
      <P>There is also an onus of proof on the employer under 15 (2).  If there is a problem or a prosecution, the onus is on the employer to prove that he or she has complied with the legislation.  The sensible way for an employer to demonstrate that is to photocopy the birth certificate and the letter of permission rather than simply noting that he or she has seen them.  Given that the burden of proof is on the employer it is implied that a prudent employer will keep those records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to senator Lanigan with interest.  I have an open mind about the amendment but I am concerned that we do not add too much legal bureaucracy instead of leaving the matter of complying with what is implied by section 15 up to the common sense of the person concerned.  This applies to all young employees between 14 and 17 years old. If a 17 year old gets a night's work in a pub, are we to provide that the employer must keep that employee's birth certificate for three years?  Perhaps we should take a more common sense <Col N="1939" /> approach.  The protections are implied in the section but if we spell it out in too much detail we might run the risk of people deciding that it is not worthwhile employing young people because the paper work is too onerous.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response has been reasonable.  I was trying to achieve a system of checks and balances.  The earlier amendment, which would allow an abstract of the Bill to be made available, would mean that people would be aware of the legislation so what I am proposing in this amendment might not be required.  The section states: &ldquo;An employer shall keep, at the place where a young person or child is employed, such records as are necessary...&rdquo; and perhaps that is sufficient.  If the abstract of the Bill was made available to young people at least they would know their rights.

It is believed in County Wicklow that money is only available for one swimming pool and that the strongest lobbies come from Arklow and Wicklow town.  After considerable thought, I believe Wicklow town has a stronger case than Arklow in this contest.  I say that without any vested interest because I do not represent either town.</P>
      <P>There is a much stronger tradition of swimming in Wicklow town than in Arklow and if a choice has to be made, they have a stronger case.  Ideally, there should be swimming pools all along the east coast, in Greystones, Bray, Wicklow town and Arklow.  However, it looks as if the Minister has to make a choice between the two towns.  I ask the Minister to opt for Wicklow town, partly because of the great tradition of swimming there which is not as strong in Arklow.  The evidence is apparent in that the swimming club in Wicklow has 396 members, 26 of whom participated in the Liffey swim in 1995, which is the blue riband of swimming in Ireland.  The Wicklow swimmers have to go to Bray, Ringsend or Glenalbyn swimming pools, which are too far away.  Arklow already has an outdoor swimming pool, which means it has some sort of facility &mdash; although, ideally, it should get a second pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a vibrant committee in Wicklow which has raised a large amount of money in a very short time.  It is indicative of the enthusiasm for a swimming pool in Wicklow town that this committee has managed to raise £117,000 in less than ten months.  That is an extraordinary achievement for a town such as Wicklow which has a small population <Col N="1942" /> which is not prosperous.  They set themselves a target of £200,000, more than half of which has been already achieved. It would be a recognition of that enthusiasm, commitment, desire and appetite for a swimming pool if the Minister granted the necessary sum.</P>
    <P>A magnificent site has already been offered to the swimming pool committee by the urban district council beside East Glendalough school.  It is perfectly positioned between the four secondary schools in Wicklow town and close to the primary schools.  It is near the railway station and would be very accessible to people from other areas.  The funds raised have come not just from Wicklow town but from surrounding areas such as Rathnew, Barndarring and Aughrim.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind that Wicklow is a rapidly expanding town where 560 houses are being built at the moment.  It is accessible to Dublin and is one of the fastest growing towns in the greater Dublin area, from which many people commute to the city.  That should be borne in mind when we realise there is no swimming pool in this town which has a great swimming tradition. There is enormous support for a pool in the town from the Chamber of Commerce and the urban district council, which has offered the site.  All the sporting clubs in Wicklow have provided facilities and raised money for this project.</P>
    <P>I am aware there are political difficulties for any Minister who has to make a choice.  However, I ask the Minister to bear in mind that Arklow already has a swimming pool and has been well treated by this Government.  It does not have the tradition of swimming which Wicklow town has.  If a choice has to be made, the Minister should bear in mind the commitment of the people of Wicklow town, as evidenced by the £117,000 they have raised, the long tradition of swimming there and the obvious support in the town for this vital recreational facility, and opt for Wicklow town rather than Arklow.</P>
    <P>I ask my fellow public representatives to come off the fence on this issue. There has been a tendency for them to <Col N="1943" /> pretend that all the towns in Wicklow will be given swimming pools and to ask the Minister to provide one this year and another next year.  It is very unlikely that will happen.  Public representatives must give leadership on issues such as this and say one town's case is better than the other's.</P>
    <P>There has been too much pussyfooting around this.  People have said they have equally good cases because they are frightened of offending one town or another.  I appeal not just to the Minister, but to public representatives and particularly those who represent Wicklow town, to say it deserves the swimming pool and should get preference over Arklow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, who is abroad on official business, has asked me to reply to Senator Ross on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Given the various demands on the public capital programme, the funds which can be made available in any year for items such as the swimming pool programme will always fall short of what would be needed to meet the demands and aspirations of the many local authorities and local groups who would wish to see pools provided in their areas.</P>
      <P>There are currently three proposals before the Department of the Environment for the provision and refurbishment of swimming pools in County Wicklow &mdash; at Arklow, Bray and Wicklow. The proposals for a new pool and leisure complex at Whitegates, Wicklow are estimated to cost £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All three proposals are at the preliminary design stage but it is clear the funds available under the swimming pool programme would not be sufficient to allow the three projects to proceed simultaneously. Accordingly, to help in the process of evaluating the current proposals, the Department of the Environment requested Wicklow County Council last year to commission a feasibility study regarding the most suitable location for a grant-aided swimming <Col N="1944" /> pool, in the context of the needs of the county as a whole.</P>
    <P>The feasibility study was carried out by a firm of environmental economists and was received in the Department last April.  It recognises the validity of the claims for the provision of pools in all three location and takes the view that the cases for the Arklow and Wicklow pools have almost equal merit.  While the report appears to favour the Arklow proposal on certain stated grounds, its findings could not be regarded as establishing a conclusive case for one project ahead of the other.  The recommendations of the study, and the basis for those recommendations, are currently being examined in the Department.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £2 million in the Department of the Environment Estimates for 1996 for the swimming pool programme.  This provision is fully committed to projects under construction or fully approved and on which work is likely to commence later in the year.  Heavy commitments are already building up for 1997.  In all the circumstances, it is not possible at this stage to say when a firm commitment to the funding of the swimming pool in Wicklow could be given.</P>
