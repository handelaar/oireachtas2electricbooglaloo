      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Glenbrohane, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Knocklong national schools in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In light of the exclusion of doctors in training from the provisions of EU Directive 93/104 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, the need for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that provision is made to regulate the extent of their working hours.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment if he will change legislation governing the compulsory acquisition of lands, to ensure that land owners are given adequate compensation for land being acquired for new road networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> I regard the matters raised by Senator Neville and Senator Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Fahey as it involves advocacy of legislation.</P>

I met women from Positive Action and the woman whose case was before the High Court yesterday.  I was devastated and very angry.  The Minister should make a statement to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has transpired that £23 million of the beef fine was caused by the failure of Department of Agriculture.  Food and Forestry officials to renew the insurance policy on the beef which was stored in Ballaghdereen in County Roscommon.

      <P>I raised this on a number of occasions.  Some time ago I raised a matter on the Adjournment regarding a child who is profoundly deaf and who cannot have an operation on his ear because the Department of Education has failed to provide transport for the child to be brought to school.  I raise this on the Order of Business because I want a response from the Minister for Education. When I raised it before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is more appropriate for a motion on the Adjournment or Private Members' business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised it on the Adjournment on 5 December 1995 following <Col N="1885" /> a suggestion from the Leader of the House.  On that occasion the Minister for Education indicated that she would respond but to date we have received no response.  The difficulty in this case is that the child, who is profoundly deaf, has not attended national school yet.  There is a more serious problem, however.  The child is due to undergo an operation in Belfast but the hospital and surgeon involved will not carry out the operation unless the child is attending school so that the child can be monitored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to seek a response from the Minister for Education.  It is only fair that we should receive one.  I do not see why a four year old child should be denied not only an operation but also his constitutional right to attend national school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have sought a debate on the efficiency audit group report.  We have also asked a number of times to see the report. This week we received the report of the implementation group so we should have an early debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>Last week I sought a debate on worldwide aid.  Since I made that request <i>The Irish Times</i> devoted a full page to the matter and, in my opinion, gave a misleading picture of what is happening to our aid personnel in El Salvador.  It appears to have been a historical rather than an up to date report.  It is now more urgent that we have a debate on the implications of aid as a political weapon, where Irish aid goes and what use is made of it in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister for Education is restored to full health, I reiterate my request that she come to the House to discuss our concerns about the examinations, and particularly the <Col N="1886" /> problem with English examinations, that occurred in Dundalk.  There is concern on the part of parents that this matter and the problem with art examinations have not been cleared up.  We are approaching examination time again and this concern still exists.</P>
      <P>The Minister should come to the Seanad and clarify the position so that we can convey that information to our constituents.  Not all parents read the newspapers and when we receive information from the Minister it is easier for us to allay such fears.  I ask the Leader to forward my request to the Minister and, hopefully, soon after Easter she will make a statement about these matters to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a 20 minute period for questions after Professor Dooge has spoken.  The length of each question will be limited to a time fixed by the Cathaoirleach, which will be two or three minutes, so that there will be questions rather than orations. The time for questions was agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday.  The Cathaoirleach will indicate the length of time and that may be dictated by the number of people who want to ask questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wright raised two points which are worth considering.  I will be happy to have an early debate on tourism and, following the election of Senator McAughtry, I will be even happier to have a debate on the horse racing industry after Easter.  There is a great depth of expertise in this House on the horse racing industry and that <Col N="1887" /> expertise should be put at the disposal of the Irish people.  There will be a debate on the horse racing industry shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>I share and appreciate the concern of Senator Henry, Senator Honan and Senator Finneran about the issue they raised.  They will appreciate that it would be out of order for me to ask the Minister for Health to come to the Seanad and speak on an issue that is currently before the courts; it would be improper on his part and out of order.  I cannot accede to their request although I appreciate their concern and the gravity of the matter.  Perhaps it can be debated when the court case is over.  It is not quite fair to say that we are reading about it in the newspapers for the first time.  The matter was first discovered in the courts so there was no question of anybody by-passing the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran and Senator Mullooly raised the issue of the deaf child. Obviously this is a serious case and I will try to raise it with the Minister.  The Senator could raise it again next week on the Adjournment but I will see what I can do on behalf of the House to get an answer.  Senator Finneran also referred to the beef fine.  That took place under a different Administration but I will convey the Senator's concern to the Minister.  While yesterday was a bad day for this country, we should also appreciate that a good deal of good work was done by the Government and Commissioner Flynn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to reduce the fine. That should be put on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan sought a debate on defence.  I had arranged for such a debate next week but, unfortunately, the Government meeting has been changed from Tuesday to Wednesday and the Minister for Defence must attend.  However, there will be an early debate on the recently published report. The debate on the White Paper on foreign <Col N="1888" /> policy will give the Senator every opportunity to explore the aid issue.  It might be worthwhile to note that the debate will be ongoing and will give Members the freedom to address the major issues in that document.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde asked about examinations. It is not my job to make life difficult for Ministers so I cannot offer the Senator any help in that regard.  Perhaps the Senator could approach the matter through Private Members' business or Adjournment Matters.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this important legislation today in the Seanad.  I apologise for my inability to be here earlier due to the fact that I had to attend the Order of Business in the other House.</P>
      <P>This legislation is important because its essential purpose is to protect and improve the living standards of the 800,000 people and their 700,000 dependants who are in receipt of weekly social welfare payments.  This year's Bill goes further than that.  The public perception of the annual Social Welfare Bill can vary a great deal.  Some see it, for example, as a technical piece of legislation which does no more than give effect to the general increases in rates of payment announced in the budget.  Others see it as a statement of my Department's work programme for the year.  Neither perception is accurate as far as this year's Bill is concerned. The 1996 Bill gives legislative effect to the improvements in the rates of payment announced in the budget last January, but it also goes much further than that.  It is a genuinely reforming Bill, introducing fundamental and far-reaching changes into the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for two new payments &mdash; the disability allowance and the one parent family allowance. The new disability allowance to be administered by my Department is a replacement for the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance, currently administered by the health boards.  The new one parent family payment will amalgamate the existing lone parent's allowance and the deserted wife's benefit and will remove the concept of desertion from the social welfare system.  This year's Bill also provides for radical reform of unemployment assistance, <Col N="1890" /> which will make it more attractive for people to avail of part time work opportunities, and for an independent appeals system for people whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down by enabling them to make a further appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>By the same token the Bill should not be viewed in isolation but against the background of an ongoing work programme within the Department of Social Welfare.  As Senators know, the social welfare system has been developed and adapted over several decades and has served this country well.  It is now a large and complex system which provides a vast range of payments and services to our society.  The level of expenditure by my Department serves to demonstrate this point well.  I have already mentioned that weekly payments are provided to approximately 800,000 persons, in turn benefiting almost 1.5 million persons when adult and child dependants are taken into account.  In addition, £2.9 million a day is spent on payments to elderly and retired people; £3 million a day is spent on payments to unemployed people; £1.4 million a day is spent on the sick and disabled; and £3.6 million a day is spent on family income support, including widows, widowers, lone parents, carers, families getting child benefit, families at work on low pay and other miscellaneous allowances.</P>
    <P>There is unquestionably a need to reform and streamline this system and to enable it to interact more effectively with other services such as health and employment.  It must be acknowledged also that this level of reform cannot be achieved overnight.  The Bill before this House goes some distance along the right road, but it will take time to complete the journey.  It is in this context that I refer briefly to some of the other ongoing initiatives in the social welfare area as it is important that this House and the public should have a greater awareness of the wider picture.</P>
    <P>The Government has committed itself to the development of a major national <Col N="1891" /> antipoverty strategy.  A high level interdepartmental committee is now working on drawing up the strategy in consultation with, and including participation by, those affected by poverty.  This is the first time that an Irish Government has committed itself to set out an across the board national strategy designed to address all aspects of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, last year piloted the establishment of the Commission on the Family, which is examining the needs and priorities of families today and which will recommend how they can be strengthened and supported for the future.  The commission will make an interim report to Government through the Minister for Social Welfare by October of this year and will produce a final report by June 1997.</P>
    <P>The work of the expert group on integration of the tax and social welfare systems is now being finalised and I expect that its report will be published by the middle of this year.  This report will provide valuable guidance on the steps required to restructure the taxation and social welfare systems.  My Department is also preparing a discussion document on social insurance and the PRSI system which will be published shortly and which will provide a focus for debate on this crucial aspect of the social welfare system.  The ESRI has been commissioned to review the minimum adequate income rates that were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on security for the elderly has been published and last week the Minister announced that he had secured Government approval for a £6.5 million package of new measures to improve security for the elderly.  This will bring the total expenditure in this area to £8 million this year.  Among the wide range of measures approved are the extension of the budget tax relief measure, at an additional cost of £5 million, to include relatives who install security systems in <Col N="1892" /> the homes of elderly people living alone, and an additional £2 million in grants which will be made available this year by my Department to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment.  I believe that these measures will prove effective in bringing about tangible improvements in the security of elderly people and, equally important, in easing the widespread fear that the recent attacks have engendered among them.</P>
    <P>All of these initiatives are underway in parallel with the day-to-day work of my Department.  The House will appreciate that it is not possible to reflect all of this reforming work in the Bill.  As I mentioned earlier, however, the Bill contains a number of significant measures and I will now outline its provisions on a section by section basis.</P>
    <P>The usual provisions relating to the short title, construction and definitions are contained in sections 1 and 2.  The general increase of 3 per cent in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance payments, payable from early to mid-June 1996, is provided for in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  Section 4 also provides for the special increases of £5 per week in the carer's allowance and the new living alone allowance of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes provision for the further substantial increase in the monthly rate of child benefit announced in the budget.  With effect from 1 September 1996, child benefit will increase by £2 per child per month.  This means that the monthly payment will now amount to £29 for the first two children and to £34 for the third and subsequent children.  Senators will recall the very substantial increases in child benefit introduced last year, which reflected our desire to provide real support for families and to channel resources to those in greatest danger of suffering from poverty. Over the last two years we have provided increases of 45 per cent in respect of the first two children and 36 per cent in respect of other children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> Section 5 also provides for the increase, from £200 to £500, in the grant payable on the birth of twins.  It further provides for the introduction of a new grant of £500 payable in respect of twins on reaching four and 12 years of age. This new grant will be effective from 1 January 1996 and has been widely welcomed. It recognises the substantial additional costs for the parents of twins which arise especially at birth and at the relevant ages.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for an increase of £10 in the income limits applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement from mid-June, 1996.  The effect of this change is that most current recipients of FIS will receive an increase of £6 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out to remove what has been widely perceived to be one of the greatest disincentives to taking up work opportunities, the immediate loss of child dependant allowances on taking up employment.  This section provides for the continued payment of increases for dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people in receipt of such increases at the full rate who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks. This is a practical measure which will help significantly to ease the transition from unemployment to employment.</P>
    <P>A primary focus of the budget was on ensuring that the social welfare system was work and worker friendly.  A crucial element of the package of measures contained in the budget related to PRSI reform.  The necessary legislative provisions required to give effect to these reforms are contained in sections 8 to 12 of the Bill.  These changes will come into effect on 6 April 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a number of significant changes affecting both employees and employers.  These include an increase of £30 in the 'PRSI Free Allowance' for employees insured at class A.  The effect of this change is that these employees will not be liable for PRSI in respect of the first £80 of weekly earnings; an increase in the ceiling <Col N="1894" /> up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employees from £21,500 to £22,300 per annum; the reduction in the lower rate of employers PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent; the reduction in the main rate of employers PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent; an increase from £231 to £250 in the amount of weekly earnings below which the new reduced rate employers contribution of 8.5 per cent will apply; and an increase of £1,000 &mdash; from £25,800 per annum to £26,800 per annum &mdash; in the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 9 caters for self employed people.  In the first instance, it provides for the existing PRSI free allowance to be increased from £10 to £20 per week, or £1,040 over a full year.  Second, it provides for a reduction in the minimum social insurance contribution payable by the self-employed from £230 to £215 per annum.  Third, it provides for an increase in the annual income ceiling, from £21,500 to £22,300, up to which PRSI contributions are payable by self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for an increase, from £520 to £1,040, in the amount of reckonable income in respect of which optional contributions are not payable by share fishermen under the optional social insurance scheme.  Section 11 provides for a reduction, from £230 to £215, in the annual rate of voluntary PRSI contributions payable by a person who ceases to be a self-employed contributor and subsequently becomes a voluntary contributor.</P>
    <P>The extension of class A insurance to community employment workers, currently insurable for the purposes of occupational injuries benefit only, is provided for in section 12.  This extension will affect community employment workers in two ways.  Those commencing work on a community employment scheme on or after 6 April 1996 will be compulsorily insurable at the class A PRSI rate.  Those who are already participating in community employment on 6 April 1996 will be given the option of either paying class A PRSI or of continuing <Col N="1895" /> with their existing class J PRSI which gives cover for occupational injuries benefit only.  The circumstances in which existing community employment participants may elect to pay class A PRSI will be provided for in regulations but with the proviso that a further change of mind will not be allowed for the duration of participation in community employment.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of community employment workers will be exempt from paying the increased employer contribution arising from this extension and they will continue to be liable for their contribution of 0.5 per cent in respect of occupational injuries benefit.  Workers participating in the pilot part-time jobs opportunities scheme, administered by the Conference of Religious of Ireland, will be treated in the same way as community employment workers for the purposes of this section.  Section 12 also includes provision for regulatory powers to modify the social insurance status of Telecom Éireann employees so as to enable their reduced PRSI status to be maintained in the event of Telecom Éireann forming a strategic alliance.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that this Bill provides for the introduction of two new payments.  The first, the disability allowance, is catered for in sections 13 to 16.  This new social assistance payment will replace the disabled person's maintenance allowance which hitherto has been administered by the health boards.  It represents a major step forward in our provision for people who are unable to return to work due to illness or who have disabilities.</P>
    <P>A notable feature of the new payment arises from a commitment given by the Minister for Social Welfare last year. Under the existing arrangements a lower rate equivalent to half the rate appropriate to a married couple applies when both members of a couple are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Under the new arrangements for disability allowance, however, qualified couples will receive two personal <Col N="1896" /> rates of disability allowance rather than the lower rate.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out the eligibility criteria for receipt of disability allowance, outlines the basis on which means will be assessed, provides for the weekly rate of the allowance and for increases in respect of adult and child dependants. A number of transitional provisions are required to effect the transfer of existing recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance onto the new disability allowance scheme.  These are contained in section 14.</P>
    <P>Section 15 makes the necessary amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, arising from the establishment of the new scheme. This section also makes appropriate provision for the inclusion of disability allowance in the system of continuing payments for six weeks after the death of the recipient and provides for a number of other consequential technical amendments to legislation.  Section 16 is a standard measure providing that the new allowance will be brought into force by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>The second of the new payments which are being introduced under this legislation is the one-parent family payment. This new payment will replace and enhance the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.  It is envisaged that it will come into effect from the start of next year.</P>
    <P>The new payment has two main objectives.  In the first instance, it will remove the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; from the social welfare system.  Second, it will ensure equality of treatment for men and women in the area of lone parenthood. The necessary legislative changes required to facilitate the introduction of the new payment are contained in sections 17 to 21.</P>
    <P>Section 17 sets out the conditions of entitlement for the new payment.  These are broadly similar to those applying currently to the lone parent's allowance scheme.  It makes provision for improved earnings disregards for lone parents in employment or self-employment and for a change in the method of <Col N="1897" /> assessing the value of capital.  In the case of persons who have applied for, or who are already in receipt of, the lone parent's allowance, this section provides for their transfer to the new scheme and ensures that their entitlements will not be reduced by virtue of that transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 17 also provides regulatory powers to exempt a social welfare recipient from the obligation to transfer to the Department of Social Welfare or the health board any payments they receive from a liable relative.  These powers are being taken as a consequence of the new arrangements being introduced for lone parents whereby a proportion of maintenance payments can be retained towards their housing costs.</P>
    <P>Section 18 ensures that the position of women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance or prisoner's wife's allowance is protected. Similar protection is extended to women who have applied for any of these schemes and whose applications have not been finalised prior to the introduction of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife's benefit scheme will be discontinued for new claimants once the new uniform payment for lone parents is introduced.  Special transitional arrangements are being made, however, for women who by virtue of being aged under 40 lose entitlement to this benefit because they no longer have a child dependant and who would otherwise have re-qualified for benefit under the existing arrangements on reaching 40 years of age.  Section 18 provides that the entitlements of women aged 38 and under 40 on the introduction of the new arrangements, who would otherwise have re-qualified for deserted wife's benefit on reaching 40 years of age, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the appropriate amendments to the social welfare legislation consequent on the introduction of the new one parent family payment. Section 20 provides for the definition of a qualified parent for the purposes of the payment to include a parent who would otherwise be a qualified <Col N="1898" /> parent but for the fact that his or her marriage has been dissolved. Section 21 is a standard measure which provides that the arrangements in respect of the introduction of the one parent family payment will be brought into effect by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the fundamental reform in the manner in which earnings from unemployment are assessed for unemployment assistance purposes.  The existing arrangements are extremely complex and frequently act as a disincentive to people faced with an opportunity to avail of part-time or casual work opportunities.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the work of the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  While that work had not been completed prior to the 1996 budget, it was nonetheless in a position to make a number of valuable recommendations which we were able to take on board in drawing up the budget proposals.  The reform of unemployment assistance contained in section 22 is the direct result of one such recommendation.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislative provisions, unemployment assistance is payable in respect of a day of unemployment provided the person is unemployed for at least three days in a period of six consecutive days.  As a result, someone who works for four or more days in a period of six consecutive days loses entitlement to unemployment assistance for the remaining days in that period.  Furthermore, unemployment assistance paid for days of unemployment in the period of six consecutive days is reduced where earnings from days worked exceed a certain threshold or disregard.  This disregard amounts to one sixth of the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to the person's family circumstances plus £15 for each day worked.</P>
    <P>Any earnings in excess of the disregard are assessed as means and are deducted from the appropriate rate of unemployment assistance.  The resulting amount &mdash; the weekly rate less means <Col N="1899" />&mdash; is then divided by six to give the daily rate of unemployment assistance.  It is this daily rate which is then payable in respect of each day of unemployment in the six day period.</P>
    <P>That brief summary of the existing arrangements serves to underline the complexity of the system.  We are now setting out to make the system more user friendly.  The new arrangements will provide that unemployment assistance will be payable in respect of a week of unemployment rather than in respect of a day of unemployment as at present; a week of unemployment will be defined as any three days of unemployment in a period of six consecutive days; unemployment assistance will be payable at the weekly rate &mdash; in other words it will be paid in respect of both days of employment and unemployment in the week of unemployment &mdash; and earnings will be assessed at 60 per cent. for claimants with children.  For claimants without children, a daily disregard of £10 will be applied for each day worked and earnings in excess of this amount will be assessed at 60 per cent. This daily disregard will protect people without dependent children from losses which they would otherwise suffer.</P>
    <P>The impact of these changes is substantial on two grounds.  First, by greatly simplifying the existing arrangements, unemployment assistance recipients will be in a better position to assess readily the effect on their net income of undertaking part-time work.  Secondly, the new arrangements provide a significant improvement in net income for those who take up such work.  To take one example, a married recipient of unemployment assistance, with an adult dependant and three dependent children, who earns £90 for three days work will now be better off by £9.50 per week. If that person earns £60 for the three days work, he or she will better of by more than £27 per week.</P>
    <P>Section 22 also provides that unemployment assistance at the higher longterm rate will be payable to claimants <Col N="1900" /> who, immediately before claiming UA, were in receipt of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 23 makes provision for two amendments to the rules governing the means test for unemployment assistance and the pre-retirement allowance.  First, it provides that allowances in respect of accommodation provided for a child, paid by a health board under the supported lodgings scheme, will be disregarded in the assessment of means. Secondly, it provides that a specified amount, which will be set initially at £2,000, received under the rural environment protection scheme, will be disregarded in the assessment of means for the purposes of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 24 is to incorporate into primary legislation provisions relating to homemakers, made under regulations in 1994, which enable contribution years spent working in the home on a full time basis caring for a child or an incapacitated person to be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of the old age contributory pension.  This section also increases from six to 12 years the qualifying age for a child under this scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 24 will also remove an anomaly in the existing provisions whereby the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker cannot, in practice, be disregarded since the person involved is required to be a homemaker for the entire contribution year in order to benefit under this provision.  The amendment provides for regulatory powers to award credited contributions in the contribution year in which a person first becomes or ceases to be a homemaker and to prescribe the time and manner of making applications to be considered as a homemaker.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 25 arise from the proposed discontinuance of the deserted wife's benefit scheme &mdash; to the extent that it affects women without children &mdash; and the deserted wife's allowance scheme.  It provides for an extension of the pre-retirement allowance <Col N="1901" /> scheme to separated men and women aged 55 years and over who have not had an attachment to the labour force within a specified preceding period.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that a person who is entitled to a <i>pro-rata</i> old age contributory or reciprocal pension, an EU pension, or a pension under a reciprocal agreement, will be entitled to receive whichever is the higher.  A technical amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, arising from regulatory changes made in April 1995 providing for the extension of full social insurance to new entrants to the public service, is also catered for in section 26.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the survivor's pension to be renamed as widow's or widower's (contributory) pension.  It also provides that a widow or widower will remain entitled to a pension at the rate which would otherwise have been payable had they not remarried.  At present, in the case where a widow or widower remarries and where the second spouse dies, it is possible that the widow or widower may, on reapplying for a pension, fail to satisfy the contribution conditions or qualify for a pension at a lower rate than that payable before remarriage.  The pension position of these people will now be protected under legislation.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, giving effect to the commitment that no spouse would lose out in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements on becoming divorced. A corresponding provision is made in section 28 as a result of the renaming of the survivor's pension to the widow's or widower's contributory pension.  Section 29 provides that the provisions of sections 5 to 28 will be brought into force by way of commencement orders.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with specific responsibility for customer relations I am particularly pleased that the Bill makes provision for an independent appeals system for people whose claims for supplementary welfare allowance have been turned down by the health boards.  The absence of an independent <Col N="1902" /> appeals system has been the subject of sustained criticism for some time past by Oireachtas Members, other public representatives and interest groups.  The Ombudsman has also expressed concern about the adequacy of the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides for regulatory powers to give effect to these new arrangements whereby claimants of supplementary welfare allowance who are dissatisfied with the outcome of an appeal to the health board against an adverse decision may make a further appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  Section 31 provides for regulatory powers to specify the procedures to be followed on appeals decisions relating to claims for both social welfare payments generally and for supplementary welfare allowance.  Regulations to be made under these powers will provide that all such decisions and determinations will have to be given to claimants in writing and will have to set out the reason or reasons for an adverse decision.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the existing provisions relating to revised decisions by deciding officers, appeals officers and officers of the health board in the case of supplementary welfare allowance is contained in section 32.  This relates to cases where a new fact comes to light resulting in a revised decision being made which reduces a person's entitlement. The deciding officer will now have discretion to decide that the reduction in entitlement should only take effect from a current date where, for example, he or she concludes that the person concerned could not reasonably have been expected to know the relevance of the fact.  The purpose of section 33 is to provide an immediate avenue of appeal to the social welfare tribunal &mdash; without first having to appeal the deciding officer's decision to the chief appeals officer &mdash; to people who are disqualified from receiving unemployment payments by virtue of their participation in a trade dispute.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous measures which I will <Col N="1903" /> outline in brief.  Section 34 provides for an amendment to section 261 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, relating to the award of expenses to representatives of appellants at oral hearings.  The practice at present, by agreement with the Incorporated Law Society, is that expenses of £30 are awarded to solicitors and to other professional witnesses in respect of attendance at an oral hearing.  This practice has been the subject of a successful challenge in the High Court.  Accordingly, the current legislation is being amended to provide that costs incurred by a person in relation to any matter referred to an appeals officer will not be awarded but that expenses will continue to be paid as at present.  This section is modelled on the legislative provisions applying to the Employment Appeals Tribunal which similarly does not award costs.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is designed to deal with the specific problems facing people moving from short-term payments, such as unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit to old age pension.  Under the existing provisions, these short-term payments are only payable up to date on which the person reaches age 66, whereas the payments of old age pensions do not commence until the next following Friday. Section 35 provides regulatory powers under which the short-term payment may be continued until the date on which payment of the pension commences. This will ensure that there is no gap between the two payments.</P>
    <P>My Department is also currently implementing a new computer system known as the integrated short-term payment system.  The purpose of the new system is to improve service delivery for claimants of short-term payments.  This system will encompass the making of supplementary welfare allowance payments, a function which, under existing legislation, is vested in the health boards.  The regulatory powers required to enable supplementary welfare allowance payments to be made by my <Col N="1904" /> Department are provided for in section 36.  It is important to note here that entitlement to these SWA payments will continue to be determined by the health boards as at present.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for a number of amendments to the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to improve the provisions relating to the assessment of means for social assistance payments.  These include, for example, a prescribed amount of earnings in respect of employment of a rehabilitative nature which will be disregarded in the assessment of means for social assistance purposes; provision is being made for the deduction of child minding earnings before the 50 per cent disregard of remaining earnings is applied in the case of lone parents; the disregard of allowances paid by a health board in respect of accommodation provided for children under the supported lodgings scheme in the assessment of means for social assistance payments other than unemployment assistance, which is being provided for separately in section 23; and the disregard of payments up to a prescribed amount awarded by the tribunal in hepatitis C cases.</P>
    <P>Last year's Social Welfare Act provided an extension of child dependant allowances, where appropriate, up to age 22 where they were in full time education. This year, section 38 provides for a further extension of that age to the end of the academic year after their 22nd birthday.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation an increase of disablement pension, known as the constant attendance allowance, is payable where the degree of disablement is assessed as 100 per cent and the claimant is so incapacitated as to require someone to attend to his or her personal needs.  Section 39 provides regulatory powers for the payment of the constant attendance allowance in cases where the degree of disablement is assessed at less than 100 per cent.  The amount of the increase payable in such circumstances will be less than the amount payable where the degree of disablement is <Col N="1905" /> assessed at 100 per cent and the rate may vary in relation to the degree of disablement.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that fees payable to the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of an audit of the accounts of the social insurance fund will be borne directly by the fund.  This amendment arises because the Comptroller and Auditor General is now legally entitled to charge an audit fee.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 41 is to extend, from two to six years, the period within which legal proceedings may be brought against the estate of a deceased person for the recovery of over-payments of social assistance.  Under the household budgeting scheme operated by my Department certain social welfare recipients can opt to have deductions made from their payments and paid over to specified bodies, such as the ESB and local authorities.  In response to requests from existing participants, section 42 extends the scope of the scheme to include bodies not currently covered.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is a technical amendment designed to update a reference in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to section 9 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which has been replaced by section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.  Section 44 provides for an amendment to the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986, under which the period within which the board of the agency is required to submit each three year strategic plan may be extended, by not more than six months, by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Section 45 and 46 provide for an increase from £178 to £188 in the amount of weekly earnings below which employees are exempt from liability for the health contributions and the employment and training levy.  The corresponding annual income exemption level for self-employed people is being increased from £9,250 to £9,730.  These changes are being made at the request of the Department of Health and the <Col N="1906" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment and will take effect from 6 April 1996.</P>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill is wide ranging and innovative.  By providing for increases in weekly rates of payment which are in excess of the projected inflation rate for the year, it will improve the living standards of people dependent on social welfare.  It will simplify many aspects of the very complex social welfare system and remove disincentives to employment which currently exist.  It will also consolidate the pro-work, pro-worker and pro-family policy directions which this Government has fostered since coming into office.  It is the most far-reaching and important social legislation presented to this House for many years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>A year has gone by and another Social Welfare Bill is before the House.  I thought the Minister got off to a great start with his introduction to the Bill but when he announced that it introduces fundamental and far-reaching changes in the social welfare system I began to question the whole thrust of his delivery.  I have spoken on three Social Welfare Bills, both while in Government and in Opposition, and at times I despair when I look at the structure of the country's social welfare system. If we are to be serious about far-reaching implications which favour work, the worker and the family, tinkering around with the structure of the present system will never achieve it. Any Member of this House, the other House or anybody at the coalface of the problems associated with our communities knows that as long as we are stuck with the present rigid structure we will never achieve social solidarity and a proper incentive for people to find work.  We can talk about minimal reductions in PRSI, minimal increases in child dependence allowance or in general social welfare payments, but the basic fact of the matter is that there is no incentive for people on social welfare to take up low paid work.  We have <Col N="1907" /> reduced the rate of PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent and have reduced it further at the lower level, but this is just tinkering with the basic problems.</P>
      <P>The different agencies, including Combat Poverty, which have been set up to analyse the problems of poverty, suggest we are not moving in the right direction at present because if the social welfare system was successful, there would not be the present huge array of social problems.  At present, 800,000 benefit directly from social welfare payments each week and another 700,000 benefit indirectly through adult or child dependency allowances.  This shows how important the social welfare system is to 1.5 million people in this country but we have done nothing in the last 20 years to move with the changing and evolving society.</P>
      <P>If you look at the number of women who are trying to leave the household to find work, you can see we have done nothing to address the area of childcare. A woman who is trying to find employment to bolster the household income cannot take up low paid work at present because she is probably worse off by the time she has paid for childminding facilities.  This must be acknowledged in the social welfare and taxation systems and all the other employment agencies would suggest that.  However, we have done nothing.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State suggested here that the changes are far-reaching and fundamental and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, stated in the other House that it was a radical Bill.  I am confused by what they mean by far-reaching and radical.  If these are major changes, we should just drop the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; and say it is just a change.  We should acknowledge that it is just a change in the right direction as it is far from being radical.  By the time we leave this House, if we will have at least acknowledged that the present structure of the social welfare system seems to be going in the same direction it did previously, we will have accomplished something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> I listened to the debate in the other House and have spoken to people who are involved at the coalface with the problems in society.  They will tell the Minister straight out, as he is well aware, that because of the present confining rigid structure at the Department of Social Welfare and in Government thinking on the matter we will never achieve what we are trying to do.  We spend £4 billion per year on people who are deprived socially or marginalised, yet we have done nothing major to advance their plight.  I am not one to be irresponsible and I welcome most of the provisions of this Bill because that is the way the system is structured at present. I implore the Minister to acknowledge this time next year, if he is still Minister, that we are not going in the direction to which society is evolving.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare and Leader of Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa, acknowledged that last year's 2.5 per cent increase was a paltry sum; that is as I described it.  Indeed, most of the agencies involved in dealing with social problems and working with the communities at large would have suggested it was a minimal increase and an insult to people who are still well below the levels recommended in commissions which were set up to analyse poverty. This year he gave a 3 per cent increase. All I can say is that I welcome the increase, but again it is a slow movement towards addressing poverty.</P>
    <P>The St. Vincent de Paul report states that many pensioners, in particular those who rely on State pensions for their means of support, have probably only one coat, one per of shoes and live on a minimal nutritional diet.  These are elderly people about which we are to be concerned as a nation with a social conscience. To give them a 3 per cent increase after a 2.5 per cent increase last year would suggest we are not as interested and concerned as we would like to think we are.  We can talk about it all day long.  There is an old saying: put your money where your mouth is, and we have not done that on this occasion either.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> We welcome the child dependence provision.  It is a move in the right direction. It puts money directly into areas where we know poverty exists as it is a direct payment to a person with a dependent child.  The problem, however, is that the system does not make direct payments in areas where there is no dependent child in households, that is, to old age pensioners and people who are living alone with no dependent adult or child.  These are the people for which the budget and this Social Welfare Bill have done little to address.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Minister for Social Welfare set up a taskforce on security for the elderly.  I am not sure when this taskforce was commissioned but I presume it was created rather rapidly when the Minister realised that his acknowledgement of a tax allowance for elderly people to install security alarms was berated by the public, the Opposition and everybody who deals with the elderly. The Minister thought he was doing something of major importance to alleviate the suffering and fear among the elderly by giving such a tax allowance when most of these people do not have an income other than from their State pensions.  I welcome the taskforce and some of its provisions, but we do not need to set up taskforces and commissions to point out what is an obvious problem &mdash; that people who have only a State pension are not receiving adequate sums of money.  The onus is now on the voluntary bodies to come up with different ideas on how to secure the elderly in their homes.</P>
    <P>There are positive aspects to this taskforce report but, on examination of the statistics, of the 408,000 people aged 65 and over, 60,000 people are in the tax net, 15,000 people are in the tax net and living alone and 100,000 receive a living alone allowance from the Department of Social Welfare.  This suggests the vast majority of people aged 65 or over would not have benefited from this famous tax relief for the installation of a security alarm.  First, they would not have the means to come up with that <Col N="1910" /> sort of money and, second, they would have no taxable income to avail of the allowance.</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan's contributions encourage me.</P>
      <P>We now find the 3 per cent increase does not do enough for the elderly.  If the Minister is still in Government next year, he should at least acknowledge this and do something about it.  I am not trying to score political points on this issue but it must be acknowledged.  It is not good enough for a Minister to sit smugly behind PR machines, set up task forces on the elderly and make promises and then present a Bill that gives a minimal 3 per cent increase when the commissions set up to monitor poverty have stated many times that people on old age pensions are not receiving adequate amounts of money.</P>
      <P>Encouraging people to work is an age old problem.  People would rather stay at home for fear of losing their medical card, rent differential or other State handouts.  This is a big problem.  In Cork North-Central, or any other large urban constituency with a large social welfare dependency, people will openly say that it does not pay them to seek low paid employment because they will lose their entitlements and almost immediately enter the tax net.  While I welcome the few changes made to child benefit, they are not enough.  This Bill is not far-reaching enough and will not revolutionise the social welfare system.  It is only tinkering with the problem and juggling a few figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> Not enough was done to deal with the problem of young people being forced to leave their homes.  Far too often we have heard about a young person having to leave their home to qualify for unemployment benefit or rent allowance.  If this Bill is to be pro-family, that measure must be discouraged to ensure that people stay at home and are not forced to leave because of financial necessity.</P>
    <P>If we are to be serious about low paid workers, we must examine our child care system.  The Nordic countries have a successful child care policy and operate State créches.  If we at least encouraged people to work by giving them tax allowance for child care facilities, it would bring that area out of the black economy.  It would also encourage people to set up créches, which creates employment, and would allow people to avail of those facilities.</P>
    <P>We talk about encouraging people to leave their homes and work.  However, the biggest obstacles to women &mdash; the Commission on the Status of Women and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights have acknowledged this &mdash; entering the workplace are that they cannot afford current child care facilities and do not have the expertise currently required, because they were minding their children, to advance their education.  That area must be examined.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of every person to highlight this issue, but little has been done about it and it does come under the Minister's auspices.  Nobody is trying to evolve our society from its present standard and advance every-body's case.  I will be tabling several amendments on Committee Stage to highlight some of the inadequacies and anomalies &mdash; all of which the Minister stated had been cleared &mdash; in the Bill which the Minister said was revolutionary and far-reaching.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the levels of increases.  I do not understand why the Minister is only giving a 3 per cent increase across the board.  While I realise he must find the money from <Col N="1912" /> somewhere, this will victimise a person without a child or adult dependant. However, the Minister bolsters people's incomes with increases in adult and child dependant allowances.  The Government is reneging on these people.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive Committee Stage debate.  The two sections of our community who are suffering most are women in the home and old age pensioners.  Women seeking employment or trying to further their education have received nothing from this Bill. The Minister has always tried to answer any questions I raised on Committee Stage and I hope he will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The increase in child benefits to £29 for each of the first two children and £34 for each child thereafter is welcome. They are direct and immediate payments to poverty stricken people.  The increase in child benefit for twins to £500 is also innovative and welcome. However, these are only PR issues as opposed to tackling the real problems. While there are not many twins in our country, this measure was announced in a blaze of glory.  We still welcome it. The provision giving twins another £500 when they reach 12 years of age is also welcome because it acknowledges that there is an extra burden on rearing two children.  One must allow for these issues.</P>
    <P>However, this Bill is far from revolutionary and describing it as far-reaching is a farce.  It only tinkers with a rigid social welfare system that must change to cater for our evolving society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the largest Social Welfare Bills that has come before us for some time.  Senator Kelleher is correct when he says there is a need for further examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly impressed with the thinking behind what can be achieved by this Bill.  For many years we have discussed the structure of the Department of Social Welfare and the money it consumes. It may be one of our biggest <Col N="1913" /> expenses, although the Estimate for the Department of Education could be higher.  We are spending approximately £4.4 billion a year, or over £12 million a day, on social welfare payments.  Is that money going to the people who need it most or could it be used in a better way to create a higher standard of living?  I felt we could have done better in many areas.</P>
    <P>I am happy that we are at last discussing something positive, particularly in section 22.  Members of this and the other House and relevant bodies have made recommendations to create initiatives to help people on social welfare to find work.  I was one of the Senators who pushed hard for this over the years.  Deputy Woods, in particular, had a constructive attitude to rationalisation of the social welfare system.  We say the system has been rationalised, but I must ask if we are really trying to rationalise it or create the best system. I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Arguments could be made about the methods of payment, whether there are too many types of payments or too many payments paid in advance or a week behind.  Why can we not further simplify the system?  I admit there was a time when there were 36 different types of payments to children.  It has been reduced to six or eight because we argued there were too many.  That represents a simplification of the system, but the number of payments is increasing all the time.  Unfortunately, there are over 1.2 million people who are dependent on our social welfare, which is supported by approximately 3.2 million people.  That is a sad reflection on us and it is sad that we cannot create a better system.  Senator Kelleher made that point, but one must ask how we can change it.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is concerned with changing the system.  I compliment the Minister and the Department officials on that. Section 22 provides that if people go to work, we are prepared to assist them. We did that with the supplementary allowance for people in low paid work. <Col N="1914" /> Unfortunately, I do not agree with the way the system works.  I have always maintained, even with other Ministers, that if one is giving an extra benefit it should be given directly.  Why should people pay PRSI and get a payment the following morning?  Why should an employer or employee pay PRSI and have somebody else get it back through another system the following morning? That is not simplifying the system; it confuses the system.  I am not saying the system is wrong.  The idea of the system is good but it is implemented wrongly.</P>
    <P>Disability allowance is coming back from the health boards and that is long overdue.  There was no reason why health boards should decide those applications. Their decisions were not always in the best interests of the claimants. That payment is now being brought into the welfare system, meaning that the money which will not be paid out by the Department of Health this year will be paid out by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We must continue the debate as to how we can create a better system to enable people to do something for themselves.  A 43 per cent increase in child welfare allowance over two years is very good.  This recognition of the family was overdue.  For many years Governments concentrated on individuals. We now recognise that the family must be kept together and we are making this payment.  The increase was not considered by other Governments.  A mother can now point to the benefit she gets for each child, which is £29 per month for the first two children with an increase for subsequent children.  That is not a small allowance and it goes directly to the mother every month.  Up to some time ago the children's allowance was given to the husband, but we changed that.</P>
    <P>The welfare system requires radical changes.  We should be constructive and say where we think those radical changes should be and where we think the money could be better spent.  That is why I mention section 22.  It is opening up the system and creating an <Col N="1915" /> opportunity for us to say we will assist with our money.  We must eliminate the black economy in our society; we cannot deny that it exists.  It is a sad reflection that we are spending £12 million a day and we cannot get on top of the black economy.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is a step in the right direction. We made changes in the last three years, but on a smaller scale.  We should do more to rationalise the system.  I have always maintained that a person going to work should have a work identification card, which they could get from their local exchange or barracks. Unfortunately, one could not mention identification cards for many years. Now, because of Deputy Woods and others, every 17 year old is issued with a card bearing their PRSI number.  That is a recognition that each person is ready to work and has a PRSI number.</P>
    <P>Every person in the nation now gets that plastic card.  My own sons and daughters have cards with their PRSI numbers even though they are still at school.  I am not saying they will get work easily but it is a recognition of their situation.  We should go further if we want to eliminate the black economy. Senator Kelleher mentioned that employees can lose benefits.  I have argued for many years that if a person wants to work for two days they will lose all benefits.</P>
    <P>Would somebody explain the difference between unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit?  Can we not simplify it?  Why can everybody not get the same benefit?  There should be no difference between assistance and benefit. The Department will say that one person is entitled to the benefit while the other person is entitled to assistance because he did not make the necessary payments.  This should not be the case, particularly as regards unemployment payments.  We should simplify this as we have done in other areas.</P>
    <P>Section 22 opens up new avenues and creates opportunities, which is welcome. An adult with an adult dependant and three dependent children who is in <Col N="1916" /> receipt of unemployment assistance and earns £90 for three days work will now be better off by £9.50 per week.  If this person earned £60 for the three days work, he or she would be better off by more than £27 per week.  In other words, if one earns less, one can be better off by £27 per week while if one earns more, one will be better off by only £9.50 per week.  Where is the initiative there?  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>If a person earns £90 for three days work and is on unemployment assistance, he or she is better off by £9.50 at the end of the week, or £3 a day.  There is no logic in working for £3 a day.  The Department is giving the impression that a person is getting £90 but he or she will only be £3.50 a day better off.  If the person earns £60 for the three days work, he or she will be better off by £27 per week, or £9 a day, even though he or she is getting less money from the employer.  Who are we assisting?  Are we assisting the employee or the employer?  Are we telling this person that they should lose the three days benefit?  Can we not simplify the system and tell people that if they earn £50 per week they will retain their benefits?</P>
    <P>In other areas we give a supplementary benefit to a wife because her husband is in a low paid job.  Section 22 is trying to create a new scheme, but we are actually embarrassing the person who wants to work for £3 a day extra.  I want them to get £90.  If he is earning £90 let us take a percentage of his unemployment assistance.  I do not want to create a situation where the State should constantly be saying in the Social Welfare Bill that it always wants to assist.  I want the person to get a full week's wages and I do not want the State to be involved at all.</P>
    <P>While the section is particularly conscious of what it is trying to create, that part of the Minister's speech is questionable because it is only worth an extra £3 a day to go to work.  However, if you are getting £60 or £90 for three days' work it is worth £9 a day to go to work, in which case you would be much better <Col N="1917" /> off.  It creates a situation where the employer is being told not to pay a worker so much.  I do not want the workforce to be used by employers who do not want to pay.  The Minister should not allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Young people are in an unfortunate position.  I took part in a debate on the Committee on the Family concerning young people who have to leave home because they are not entitled to unemployment benefits.  We are now paying up to £25 if people have been means tested.  We have to be very conscious of this area even though changes have been made by Ministers over the last few years.  Too many of our young people are leaving home because they do not get benefits, and it is costing us more indirectly in supplementary rent allowances.  If the Departments of the Environment, Health and Social Welfare do not realise that this is happening they must have their eyes closed.  I do not say such things lightly.</P>
    <P>As a member of Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, and a former member of the Southern Health Board, I am conscious of the amount of money now being paid to young people.  Not more than a month ago, we received a report stating that over 5,000 people aged 18 to 21 years are receiving an average rent allowance of £60 per week each.  I know students receive different payments, but these people have been assessed by the Department of Health, the health board and the local authority as being entitled to accommodation. The only way one can receive the supplementary rent allowance is by being assessed.</P>
    <P>The total rent allowance bill increased from £30 million in 1993 to £44 million in 1994 and to approximately £60 million 1995.  Rather than paying £60 a week to landlords for private accommodation for each of the 5,000 young people, it would be better to give them a home assistance or unemployment allowance to stay at home where they would be better protected and looked after.  They should not be left alone at the age of 18 to 21 because <Col N="1918" /> we are not prepared to assist them.  This is disgraceful.  The figure of £60 million for rent allowances will increase this year to approximately £70 million, an increase of over 50 per cent in three years.</P>
    <P>Why do we not recognise that young people have to leave home &mdash; even if their parents are well off &mdash; because they do not get assistance or recognition from the State?  It would be better to let young people stay at home, give them some money to assist them to seek work, and do part-time work as covered by section 22.  That would be better than spending more and more money on accommodation for young people living away from home.  There is no logic in paying each person £60 to £80 a week rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher mentioned child care facilities for people who wish to enter the workforce.  I make no apology for saying that the mother is the best person to mind the child.  That is obvious.  There is no doubt that she is the backbone of society.  Of course the mother should be in the workplace, but the most important thing for a child is to have the mother in the workplace at home.  The mother at home should be paid by the State.  We have provided for children, for people on home allowances and, after much pressure in both Houses of the Oireachtas, for carers who look after the elderly.  We should, however, recognise the right of mothers to payment in the home.  I am not saying they should stay at home but if they are prepared to do so they should receive a monthly payment.  What is wrong with recognising their work?  They are doing an excellent and important job.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many mothers have to work because there are fewer jobs for male workers.  More and more women like to work, even on a part-time basis, and that is good for them.  It broadens their minds and they are comfortable with getting out of the house for a few hours every day.  We should recognise the importance of the family in society. The proof of that was in the last referendum on divorce.  The 50/50 vote on <Col N="1919" /> that issue proved that there is great recognition for our children and for the family.  We should not be afraid to stand up and say that not enough is being done for mothers looking after their families at home.  Mothers say that not alone do they look after children but that their husbands are the biggest children of all.  Perhaps they are right.</P>
    <P>Should we have direct payments for mothers to stay at home until their children reach a certain age and can be minded by others?  Why not give tax benefits?  Perhaps there are areas other than crèches where tax benefits should be given sooner.  Unless we give such tax benefits it may not be feasible for a person to go to work.  I do not for a moment want to undermine the idea of women in the workplace because their participation in the workforce has broadened women's minds.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill is a good one but the welfare bill is getting bigger and bigger.  The welfare structure is becoming increasingly expensive.  In addition, as the Minister said, it is increasingly becoming part of the general system, given the level of expenditure on it; perhaps we should consider amalgamating PRSI and PAYE.  Why not?  Why is it that if one earns £40,000, one only pays PRSI on the first £26,000, but one pays it in full if one earns under £9,000?  The rich are being made richer while more is being taken from the poor.  People are asked to do work for £3 extra a day in assistance.  A sum of £12 million is spent every day and perhaps £4 million a day could be saved if the system was reorganised and the people who really needed assistance received it.  This is the reason the black economy is doing so well.  The system is working against people who want to take up employment.</P>
    <P>As Senator Kelleher and others said, and as I said many times, a monster has been created.  People become trapped in the structure and if they get £5 too much, they are forced outside it.  This must be stopped and the people who want to help themselves should be <Col N="1920" /> looked after.  However, given the system which exists, perhaps we have reached the stage where the Department of Social Welfare does not have the right to do this and the Department should give the Minister for Enterprise and Employment a certain amount of money for job creation.</P>
    <P>Under the current system the Minister, the Minister of State and other Ministers want to help matters, but they cannot greatly assist in creating a situation where fewer people are receiving social welfare.  For example, £350 million is spent on FÁS schemes.  Are they succeeding?  Who is getting that money? Perhaps a certain amount of money could be taken under section 22 and tied in with some of the funds devoted to FÁS schemes to create a much better system.  Money is not being used correctly by all the Departments to create a better society.  The structures are established in such a way that the Bill must take a certain approach.  The system is becoming increasingly large and complex, but people then say that those who deserve help most are not receiving it from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the people who should be getting more are not receiving it.  I am very conscious of elderly people living alone.  Some are well cared for with the living alone allowance and the fuel allowance, which has been increased again this year.  We cannot do too much to ensure the elderly are looked after, but perhaps in some areas this is done in such a way that people are encouraged to live alone.  Perhaps a society of people living alone is being created, because if one is not living alone one does not receive benefits.  A husband and wife who are over 65 or 66 years of age do not receive the same benefits as a person living alone.  The elderly are recognised as individuals and they receive benefits if they live alone, such as free electricity and a free television licence.  However, it is as cheap to give these to a couple as to individuals.  The money they receive is relevant to the <Col N="1921" /> single amount a person living alone receives.</P>
    <P>It does not happen any more since the introduction of equality legislation, but up to four years ago a couple received proportionately much less money than a person living alone.  It was reckoned that two could live together more cheaply than one alone.  This is probably correct, but do people who worked all their lives and paid social welfare contributions before PRSI was introduced in the early 1970s receive enough recognition? Do they receive enough and are people taxed too early?</P>
    <P>Many aspects need to be changed and people should do better in some areas. I am glad children will do better as a result of the Bill and its predecessor. The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, is largely responsible for this.  Other Ministers considered it, but no recognition was given to children for far too long. The moneys in the Department of Social Welfare should be used in a better way to create more opportunities under section 22.  While that section is worthwhile, perhaps it should be examined to see whether more can be done with it.  More could be done if it is opened up, but this aspect can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the following matter many times previously, both in the House and at parliamentary party meetings, and I ask the Minister to consider it.  The system under which PRSI and PAYE are two separate payments should be abolished and a single payment should be taken from every employee.  This should not be a percentage of earnings, but rather a fixed amount.  This would ensure that those who are less well off and earning less money pay much less.  It should not be the case that somebody earning over £26,000 does not pay any more PRSI.  If a person is making that much money, he or she should be in a position to pay more.  There is no reason why they should not pay PRSI on amounts over £26,000 while a person earning £6,000, <Col N="1922" /> £8,000 or £9,000 &mdash; £160 a week &mdash; pays PRSI on the full amount.  These matters should be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement.  The Department of Social Welfare has been blessed by the amount of energy put into it by the current and previous Ministers.  This must also be a source of great relief to the departmental officials.  It was previously one of the most complicated Departments in the State but its procedures have been greatly simplified.  This is of benefit, not just to social welfare recipients, but also those working in the Department.  It must have been most unsatisfactory in the past trying to explain the inexplicable to people applying for benefits.  It must be recognised that huge improvements have been made.</P>
      <P>Training in the Department obviously has been of a high level because I rarely receive complaints these days from people about the way their queries were handled by departmental officers.  This is a joy and one of the reasons I was asked, when I first came into the Seanad, by the forum for people with disabilities to request the transfer of the disabled persons allowance from the Department of Health, where it was administered by the various health boards, to the Department of Social Welfare.  They stressed that they felt they would be treated more justly by the Department of Social Welfare and I am delighted this area has been taken over by the Department.  In the past it depended on how the health boards decided to administer the scheme and differences existed.</P>
      <P>Last year I said the family income supplement should be paid to those with part-time jobs and in job sharing arrangements.  I hope progress will be made in this area soon because women who are lone parents must carefully juggle the problems of running a family on their own while at the same time trying to bring in more finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These imaginative changes, which will cost the State nothing, are most welcome. This is an excellent Bill and it is <Col N="1923" /> very good to see time spent in the home being recognised for the first time.  The word &ldquo;homemaker&rdquo; is used in section 24, which is the first time I have seen it used in a Social Welfare Bill.  I agree with much of what Senator Cregan said about the need to seriously consider payment for those working full time within the home.  We recognise this within the Constitution, but that is as far as it goes.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ask the Minister for Finance to consider the possibility of making child care and elder care allowances tax free?  This would avoid in many cases, particularly in regard to elder care, people having to give up jobs to care for someone who cannot be left alone all day.  If they could receive an allowance for someone to mind this person while they were at work, it would create employment.  People involved in care of the elderly told the Joint Committee on Women's Rights what a serious problem it is.  One woman said she thought she had given up work for three months but ended up giving it up for eight years.  She then found she was virtually unemployable and had great difficulties in re-entering the workforce.</P>
    <P>Children grow up, but what may seem a short term illness with an old person may turn into a very long-term problem. Will the Minister point out to the Minister for Finance that that end of the care spectrum should be looked at first as it would create employment and save on carers' allowances?  I hope there will be some progress in that area next year. The child care area is also very important, but at least it is more predictable. The really serious aspect of elder care is that it is so unpredictable.  It is an area in which the State would not incur a huge financial loss; in fact, there would probably be a gain because people would be brought into the workforce and others would not have to give up highly paid jobs in which they pay a great deal of tax.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan and Senator Kelleher discussed the worthwhile changes in section 22 very comprehensively.  Everything <Col N="1924" /> possible must be done to encourage people to take up employment.  One of the main problems I heard about when discussing these situations with unemployed people who had been offered employment of uncertain duration was the loss of the medical card. These areas are very important and must be supported.  It is good to see imaginative changes in those areas.</P>
    <P>The current employment situation is dreadful because many people do not know how long they will be in employment. I do not know how anyone can take out a 20 year mortgage nowadays because they have no idea if they will still be employed in 18 months time.  We must constantly look at the changing pattern of employment.  Most of it is very undesirable but we have very little control over it.  This does not just apply to people in short term jobs in the building trade, depending on the vagaries of the weather.  People employed in major companies are also seriously affected, perhaps due to international changes.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the provisions in section 17 for one parent families.  It is good to see so much stress being put on this area because everyone recognises it is far more difficult to bring up children on one's own than with two parents.  One parent families have been very generously and wisely dealt with in this section.  The more problems we can prevent developing in these areas and the more stress we can relieve the better. The shaping of our society depends on how our children are brought up and the education of the child within the family is most important.  Anything which makes it easier for people to maintain as stable a family situation as possible, despite the loss of one parent, is most important.  I greatly welcome the change of emphasis in this area.  A few years ago widows were lucky to get any consideration, never mind prisoners' wives, deserted wives and single mothers.  It is now recognised that single parents have to bring up the next generation on their own and we as a society are bound to make more of a contribution to these parents.  There has not <Col N="1925" /> just been a financial change but also an enormous change in attitude.</P>
    <P>A State old age pension and its associated benefits are of far greater value to many people than private pensions. When push comes to shove &mdash; not that I am that old but I can speak from my experience of dealing with elderly people &mdash; the State has done far more for many people than private pension funds or the VHI would have.  Many people thought my criticisms during the debate on the VHI were rather unkind, because we have all been relieved to have our medical bills paid by the VHI. However, an allowance of £10 towards physiotherapy costing £30 is quite outside the reach of many old people, who must rely on the State facility which is provided for free.  The amount of VHI aid for nursing care would not pay a fifth of the cost of a nurse.  Such elderly people would be sunk without State care because, although they are within the private sector, they cannot afford to pay the excess.</P>
    <P>Could the Department look further at trying to include more people receiving private pension schemes which have the same monetary value as the State old age pension &mdash; they are not a huge number &mdash; within its benefits?  Small things matter when one is old, such as receiving a free television licence if one is in receipt of a State pension.  It would be terrific if such small benefits could be extended to such people and I doubt it would cost an enormous amount of money.  I am not asking for these benefits to be extended to every old person because some people receive enormous pensions from large corporations &mdash; almost as much as they earned &mdash; but only to those whose private pensions are equivalent in value to the State pension &mdash; for example, those who are entitled to medical cards but not to smaller benefits such as free telephone rental. Those who can get medical cards, for example, are still unable to get small things such as free telephone rental.</P>
    <P>Small benefits could be introduced year by year.  I like to give a target so the Minister could start next year with <Col N="1926" /> the television licence or, if he prefers, with the telephone allowance, although that would cost a little more.  He can introduce a provision whereby people in private pension schemes, which yield much the same income as the State scheme, would be entitled to some of the fringe benefits available to those within the State scheme.  I finish my contribution with that small request.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill and I am sure most Members of the House will welcome it.  The different thrust in how we approach social welfare in this country is to be welcomed.  I visited Romania last week and when I told the Romanians about our social welfare system their faces went quite ashen.  They asked who was paying and I pointed out that we pay 48 per cent tax, which made their faces go even more ashen. However, by treating those who are most vulnerable in our society in as generous a manner possible we have created a more equitable society and a society in which I prefer to live.  It is a system which benefits the country.  I warmly welcome the Bill and applaud those who were involved in its formulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his involvement in producing important and innovative legislation.  The annual Social Welfare Bill is one of the most important Bills discussed in this House.  Its provisions impact directly on the living standards of a significant proportion of our citizens. Consequently, it is important that we discuss the Bill thoroughly and I look forward to the forthcoming debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, one would like to comment on all measures in the Bill and highlight other measures which have not but should have been included.  Unfortunately, that is not possible.  Time restraints are a factor but the most significant problem is the complexity of the code.  I note that the Minister intends to transfer responsibility for the administration of the disabled persons maintenance allowance from the Department of Health.  I have encountered this <Col N="1927" /> problem on many occasions in my weekly clinics and this is a welcome move.  It will make a major difference to the recipients of this allowance.  The new payment is to be known as the disability allowance.</P>
    <P>There was no logic to the system whereby social welfare functions were carried out by health boards ultimately responsible to the Department of Health.  I look forward to when the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is also administered by the Department of Social Welfare and I hope the Bill's provision to enable people to appeal supplementary welfare decisions to the social welfare appeals office is a step in this direction.  It is imperative that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the Department of Social Welfare in the near future.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the completion of such a transfer, the code remains too complicated.  In a recent report to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported that he had identified 42 different means tests.  While I accept that in some circumstances different means tests should apply, the existence of 42 such schemes is clearly unnecessary.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that matter. It is hardly surprising that both the providers and users of the system find it difficult to navigate.  Recent years have seen social welfare advice centres becoming an industry in themselves. The computations of the Department of Social Welfare are always a source of major concern to the unfortunate recipients of payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a start in this Bill towards the development of a more coherent and understandable system. However, he would be the first to admit that much work needs to be done.  Comprehensive reform will take a number of years.  The performance of Fianna Fáil in this regard is complex.  Having presided over the Department for seven years uninterrupted, they more than <Col N="1928" /> anybody else were in a position to effect fundamental reform in this area. However, now that they are in Opposition they expect the current Minister to effect the same change in less than a year and a half.  This confusion does not merely apply in the area of social welfare. Despite having also spent seven years in control of the Department of Justice they now expect the current Minister to legislate for their failures in that period.</P>
    <P>This Social Welfare Bill provides for a general increase of 3 per cent in social welfare payments.  On budget day the Minister for Finance expected an annual rate of inflation of 2.25 per cent.  Since then reports have suggested that this year's figure may well be lower.  One way or another, this year's increase in social welfare payments is substantially ahead of inflation.  In addition to increases in general payments, the Minister has also increased child benefit by £2.  This represents an increase of £9 in only two years.  The Minister is to be congratulated.  Child benefit has increased by almost 85 per cent since my party entered Government in 1992.  This money is paid directly to women and it represents one of Government's best achievements in recent years.  This is particularly the case when compared to the performance of the Fianna Fáil/PD Government which in its last year in office did not deem it necessary to increase child benefit at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in qualification requirements for unemployment assistance.  These changes are an important aspect of the Bill.  Part-time work is growing in our economy and throughout the European Union.  While there is a need for full-time jobs, the growth in part-time employment facilitates the entry into the labour market of people who otherwise have been precluded from entering it.  In particular, part-time work often facilitates women with parental responsibilities.  It is appropriate that, rather than trying to buck this trend, we make the best possible use of it and these measures go a long way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> There are other welcome measures in the Bill to tackle unemployment.  These measures are aimed at tackling poverty traps by targeting tax reform at the lower paid.  The increase in the PRSI disregard from £50 to £80 should have an immediate impact for low paid workers.  This complements the reduction in the lower rate of employers' PRSI from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent and the reduction of the main rate from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent. While the latter is not significant, businesses will also benefit from the reduction of the corporation tax rate on the first £50,000 of profits from 38 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>These measures are aimed at reducing the cost to employers of taking on new labour.  They are part of the pro-employment package announced in the budget and contained in this Bill.  The Bill will give effect to a number of measures to tackle long-term unemployment. The retention of child dependant allowances for a 13 week period after a long-term unemployed person takes up work is particularly beneficial, especially as those involved will also be able to retain their medical card entitlement. This is a good Bill for jobs.  The loss of these benefits was one of the greatest deterrents for a person taking up employment.  The retention of the medical card will have a major effect on the return of the long-term unemployed to employment.</P>
    <P>Other worthwhile provisions in the Bill include the introduction of the one parent family allowance to replace the existing lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.  This provision is important in so far as it eliminates the discrimination against men in this area. Section 24 confirms the Minister's commitment to the family.  This section calculates the time spent at home caring for children for the purposes of determining eligibility for the old age contributory pension.  This commitment is confirmed by the increase in the income limits for qualification for family income supplement.  I welcome the recent attempts to increase the number <Col N="1930" /> of people who avail of this scheme.  I also welcome the substantial increase in the carer's allowance which brings it into line with the recommended amount proposed by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.  Many people in receipt of carer's allowance have expressed their delight at this increase.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in bringing social welfare payments into line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  In 1986 some payments were only 64 per cent of the recommended amount, but now there are none under 92 per cent.  I hope the Minister ensures that all payments are at this level as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in section 27 in relation to the widow's and widower's pensions.  I have had representations from constituents who are unhappy about the title of survivors' pensions. The Minister is correct to make this technical change.  It is a progressive step to ensure that a widow's or widower's contributory pension is protected in the event of a second marriage.  I draw the Minister's attention to a case where a woman neglected to apply for a survivor's pension until three years after the death of her husband.  As a result, she was entitled to only six months' retrospective payment.  This is nonsensical, particularly when the Department would have been prepared to pay the full amount of money had she applied in time.  This woman lost approximately £10,000 as a result.  She is being penalised for the trauma of her bereavement and that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill.  In an age when social rights are being questioned in Europe, it is good that the Government is expanding rights and entitlements and promoting social cohesion.  This will be a fundamental issue during the next general election and I am confident the public will support the Government's stance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister to the <Col N="1931" /> House.  The living alone allowance should have been increased.  In the budget the Minister for Finance attempted to address the security issue for those living alone.  However, giving a tax free allowance to people who are not in the tax net is of no benefit to them.  This matter was then referred to the task force on security for the elderly which published a report stating that a dependant could claim the allowance. However, that does not address the problem for those living alone.  The only way to help them is to increase the living alone allowance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity for people who apply for supplementary welfare allowance but who are not satisfied with the reply to appeal the decision.  I am disappointed that provision was not made for an independent appeals system for medical cards.  Appeals are currently dealt with by health board officials and by people who made the initial decision.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter and to ensure a more equitable system of appeal for someone who is refused a medical card.</P>
      <P>Section 12 attempts to change PRSI insurance, but I am afraid that could be unconstitutional.  The Minister is attempting to apply public service PRSI rates to private employment.  This provision was included to accommodate a possible new shareholder in Telecom Éireann.  It seems that the lower rate of PRSI will apply, although it will be a private company which will become a partner in Telecom Éireann.  I do not understand why we should accommodate an outside company by giving them such concessions.  If it becomes a partner in the public service, it, not the Government or the taxpayers, should compensate the workers.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this important legislation because it affects 1.5 million people who are in receipt of social welfare payments from this State.  This year the Government will spend in excess of £4 billion on social welfare.  We must <Col N="1932" /> ensure that the recipients get the best possible deal and that the taxpayers are also satisfied with the return they get for their taxation.</P>
      <P>Each year we have this opportunity to discuss social welfare issues.  We must look at the challenges posed by the large numbers on social welfare and the scale of poverty in our society today. We hear so much about the country's great growth rates one would think we had a wealthy economy.  However, we also have substantial numbers of unemployed which is causing a huge demand for social welfare payments.  We must examine the unemployment issue.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees that our tax and social welfare systems must be integrated. The Government has set up a committee, under the chairmanship of Donal Nevin, to look at this.  At what stage is its deliberations?  When will it be reporting its findings to the Oireachtas?  It is an issue we must address quickly.</P>
      <P>The taxation system is very anti-work. High rates of personal taxation are discouraging people from moving into paid employment.  In addition, the high rates of employers PRSI are discouraging employers from creating jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann, it is my privilege and honour to welcome Professor James Dooge to the House today, for he comes among us not only as a former Member and esteemed friend of this House but also as a distinguished office holder of the House itself, being Leas-Chathaoirleach from 1965 to 1973, Cathaoirleach from 1973 to 1977 and Leader of the House from 1983 to 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among his many distinctions and honours in academic and political life, Professor Dooge was particularly honoured <Col N="1933" /> in 1981 by the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, as a senatorial member of his Government in the prestigious role of Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, we can only muse on what might have been, had the uncertainties of political life not denied him the opportunity of carrying out the onerous responsibilities of this important international portfolio.  Suffice to say that for those of us who have worked with him, we have come to know the depth and breadth of his learning, his wisdom and integrity, his renown as teacher and mentor and his innate graciousness and goodwill.</P>
    <P>Such is his academic and political acumen that it was inevitable that Professor Dooge should be invited in 1984 to chair the Committee on Institutions which came to bear his name, the Dooge Committee. This committee was an <i>ad hoc</i> group of personal representatives of the heads of Government which the European Council agreed to establish at its Fontainbleau Summit in June 1984.  Its task was to examine the possibility of institutional reform of the European Communities and one of its key suggestions was that a special intergovernmental conference be established to consider its ideas and construct a reform package from all reports and initiatives delivered over the previous few years. As Members will know, the conference prepared the way for the Single European Act and the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>In the intervening years, Professor Dooge maintained his interest in and commitment to European union.  Today, a major part of his work is with the Institute of European Affairs, an independent self-governing body which promotes the advancement and spread of knowledge on the process of European integration and, in particular, on the role and contribution of Ireland within Europe.  The institute's main aim is to provide objective analysis of the key political, economic, social and cultural issues for those charged with representing Irish views within European policy making structures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> The Maastricht Treaty provided for an intergovernmental conference in 1996 to examine certain provisions of that treaty; other significant items were added to the agenda by subsequent European Councils.  In that context, and to facilitate the process of discussion on the questions the 1996 conference will face, the Institute of European Affairs has produced a report, under the chairmanship of Professor Dooge, on the issues, options and implications of further European Union evolution.</P>
    <P>As Members will know, this is a historic occasion for Seanad Éireann because it is the first occasion on which the House has invited one of Ireland's own distinguished citizens to address it. By accepting the invitation to address us today on matters of the gravest import for the future of the European Union, Professor Dooge renews his affectionate association with Seanad Éireann and I now invite him to address the House.</P>

      <P>Is cúis onóir domsa bheith arís sa seomra álainn seo agus mé a labhairt arís ós comhair an tSeanaid. Is dócha gur Oisín i ndiaidh na Féinne atá i gceist ach tá áthas orm go bhfuil dream beag do mo shean-cháirdí anseo. Níl na Fianna go léir caillte fós don Oisísín seo.</P>
      <P>I am glad to talk to Members about what I consider to be one of the most important problems facing our country, that is, our future in Europe and the future of Europe itself.  I am also happy to be here because this occasion represents an opening out of the procedures of the Seanad and an indication that it is not, as many people say moribund and a thing of the past.  In adopting this procedure, which it is operating for the first time today, it is showing a flexibility which is and always has been inherent in it.  The Seanad has played a critical role at many times in the history of this country, standing above the more factional arguments of political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to talk to Members about the report prepared by the Institute of European Affairs on the intergovernmental conference.  This report is timely <Col N="1935" /> because that conference will be formally launched tomorrow in Turin and will shortly settle down to its important work.  I would like to speak to you about the nature of the Institute.  It is, as is stated on the covers of all its reports, a permanent forum for the identification and development of Irish strategic policy responses to the continuing process of European integration.  Its work is based on objective analysis of the problems involved, not of advocacy of any particular view point.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable institution which represents all economic sectors.  It has excellent close relationships with the relevant Departments and it draws on people from all walks of life and &mdash; it is obvious since I chaired this project &mdash; on retired politicians as well as many eminent retired civil servants.  In the few years since its foundation, it has filled a void in Irish public life &mdash; I use the words &ldquo;public life&rdquo; in the broadest sense.  It should be a matter of gratification to Members of this House that the inspiration and leadership for that came from Brendan Halligan, a former Member.  He also acted as project leader on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I will hark back to being a professor by saying this is the report but there is no written or oral examination on it.  It is terrible to hold up a report before such a busy group of people.  I want to put the report in context and to assure the House that an introductory shorter version will be launched next Tuesday, which I am sure Members will manage to get through.</P>
    <P>Why did we spend two years producing such a report?  It is part of the process of integration.  We were admitted to Europe in 1973 on the second attempt having been vetoed, with our neighbouring island, on an earlier occasion. Critical turning points were the Single European Act, 1987, and the Maastricht Treaty and the associated referenda. We see a massive confusion when we look back to the Maastricht debate.  The debate never became concerned with the fundamental issues or thought of the <Col N="1936" /> long-term future.  Perhaps that was all right then but God help us if we try to do this again because we will find ourselves in a morass.</P>
    <P>During the Maastricht process we saw, not only in this country but throughout Europe, what amounted to a revolt &mdash; not in the physical sense &mdash; by the electorate against what it perceived as an element of secrecy and elitism as regards proposals made and the manner in which they were arrived at. Following the conclusion of that process, the Institute of European Affairs asked how it could prevent this from happening again.  We decided there was a duty on us to contribute as far as we could to ensuring that we would be better prepared when we reach the end of this Intergovernmental Conference which is now starting and the debate and decisions which will ensue.  In this regard, as with so much else, there is a demand for openness and accountability which must be met.  We have no option. Politicians cannot afford to wait until the bugle blows for the referendum campaign.  If they follow that course, they will find themselves in considerable difficulty.  We must start the job of communication among the policy making and the political community and among the public.  There is much ground to be regained.</P>
    <P>When the Institute decided something needed to be done, work was being arrived out on a number of projects, including studies on economic and monetary union, social issues in European, enlargement and the problems of security.  However, it was decided that there should be an overarching project which would bring in specialised results from these projects and try to put together the essential things &mdash; the issues, the options and the implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to Members to know how that project was carried out. Some 18 contributors, whose names are listed in the report, drafted chapters in early 1994.  In 1994 and 1995 a series of different discussions took place.  First, there were discussions among the contributors <Col N="1937" /> and members of the executive bureau of the project who were guiding the process.  As a result, a degree of synthesis took place between the individual chapters.  This report is noteworthy in that, unlike other reports by the Institute which have a number of contributors, the authors names do not appear on the chapters which they first wrote.  Everything has been synthesised into a unit.  They are recognised in the report as a group, not as individuals.</P>
    <P>The report was circulated to relevant Departments and there was a free exchange of comment and discussion with them.  It was also circulated to the working groups of the other project groups of the Institute of European Affairs and to a number of extremely senior retired civil servants.  It was discussed on a number of occasions with the Brussels group of the Institute of European Affairs which had all the inside knowledge as 95 per cent of these people work for the institutions of the European Union.</P>
    <P>In May 1995 a draft report was prepared to coincide with the meeting of the Reflection Group which was the first informal discussion at which the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, represented this country.  Following on that and further discussions, this large report in my hand appeared in December last.  It amounts to 262 pages and it is not easy reading.  We attempted to produce a report in which all the issues, options and implications could be found.  Dermot Scott of the Parliament Office in Dublin has, in his private capacity, produced a shorter report which I received only this morning.  It will be launched next Tuesday and arrangements will be made to provide Senators with copies.  It is written in a more popular way.  Senators will be glad to know it contains a glossary at the back which will help them through some of the jargon.  For those who want to contribute to this question of raising the whole standard of debate about Europe, this is an excellent starting point.  If Senators are interested in any of the <Col N="1938" /> individual topics to greater depth, there are about 25 chapters in the large report.  The report is intended as a background reference work.</P>
    <P>There is, as I have said before, a need to communicate the essential points to the public and to encourage a rational debate.  What is likely to be the attitude of members of the public to it?  Possibly, they will shrug their shoulders and say &ldquo;Europe, again; we have only just finished talking about that&rdquo;.  Other matters are more important than Europe.  Problems such as unemployment are much more important than the question of European Monetary Union.  The questions of drugs and crime are much more important than the question of whether there should be a third pillar to the European Union.  I am more worried about how to pay my mortgage next month than as to any of these developments. These are the internal issues that worry people nowadays.  What I want to put to the House this afternoon, and what is backed up by the report, is that an essential element in a long-term solution to many of these problems lies in working within a European context and according to principles that are here in the report.</P>
    <P>There are also external issue such as incidents which people see on their televisions and which concern them greatly. There is the whole question of these problems which come from the outside but affect our lives.  There is the question of the growth of the global economy, the industrial competition from the tigers of the Far East.  There is the external factor of all this talk about enlargement.  Will our agriculture industry falter when the CAP must take care of Poland in addition to our own counties? There is the question of what we saw happening in Rwanda and in Yugoslavia. I am suggesting that these concerns are all tied in with the question of the future of Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to outline what I think will be some of the main topics of such a debate.  Essentially, what are the main issues?  If you ask yourself that, you can turn to chapter five of this report which <Col N="1939" /> contains a summary of ten issues.  Let me outline them quickly: &ldquo;the future of the European Union and its relationship with the rest of the continent, that is, what is Europe when we talk of Europe in the sense of the Union?  The balance to be struck between shared sovereignty and the traditional intergovern-mentalism that we have seen in the past, where Governments come together to co-ordinate not to share; the common tasks to be pursued under shared sovereignty and traditional intergovernmentalism. The institutions and the voting procedures through which they are to be achieved; the impact of enlargement on the institutions, common policies and budgetary requirements; the extent to which differences in political will and economic capacity can be reconciled; the relationship between the member states in view of the differences in size, development and national interest; the identification of building blocks for deeper integration or strengthened co-operation; the need to respect subsidiarity, efficiency, transferability, accountability; and, finally, the overriding necessity of securing democratic consent for the already established goal of ever closer union between the peoples of Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we come to tackle these issues, what must we decide?  What are the issues which will be quarrelled about at the Intergovernmental Conference which is about to be launched?  On the question of what is the appropriate overall speed, there will be differences.  When people were considering the options in preparing their chapters, we took the analogy of a motor car.  We asked them to consider the following; what would happen to Europe if things were to go into reverse?  What would happen if the whole thing remained in neutral?  What would happen if we went into first gear, only consolidated Maastricht and did virtually nothing else; and all the way up to going into overdrive towards the final step of a federal Europe?  When we look at all those stages and ask what era we are in at present, if we say &ldquo;Right, consolidate <Col N="1940" /> Maastricht&rdquo; we are remaining in neutral with the handbrake on.  That might seem a very safe position until you realise the car is parked on a steep hill and, in fact, the attempt to remain in neutral with the handbrake on will roll the car to the bottom of the hill eventually.  The handbrake will not be able to take the strain forever.</P>
    <P>What is the appropriate speed?  Here, choices must be made.  It seems that the position of this country and, hopefully, the general position which will be reached is not one of going into overdrive towards a federal union, not one of going into reverse as the Government of a neighbouring island may desire, not one of being in neutral but one of starting off, getting into first gear and, as one always does, getting rather quickly into second gear.  Somewhere between second and third gear appears to be the appropriate speed from now on.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk emerging about variable commitment which we must think about carefully.  It is an intermediate stage between national action, to which going into reverse might give rise, and the supernational integration of going into overdrive.  Here the question of opting out arises.  Britain has already opted out of the Maastricht social chapter. Are we going to find ourselves with a mass of opt-outs?  This is, indeed, a problem.  Can we maintain the Europe we set out to build and have this mass of opt-outs?  Other people will say that variable commitment is difficult.  What we want is variable speed.  Here, again, we must be careful to distinguish what these terms mean.  With variable speed, there is a common objective, but we do not all travel towards it at the same time.  The variable commitment is saying we are going to stay out and, as we see it now, we are going to stay out for all time.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to talk about the issues in more detail in a short address such as this.  However, I want to deal briefly with each of what are called the three pillars.  Pillar I is concerned with questions on which we have already achieved substantial agreement <Col N="1941" /> and which are ruled by Community competence and largely by qualified majority voting.  Is Pillar I relevant to the problems I mentioned earlier which concern so many of our citizens? What can we say to a person whose chief worry is paying the mortgage on his or her house?  Will economic and monetary union make any difference to this?</P>
    <P>There are many estimates as to what will happen if we join economic and monetary union but it so happens that this is one of the problems that can be alleviated by economic and monetary union.  We all know there is a great gap between the rate a bank pays on a deposit and the rate at which it lends money.  Do we all realise that the gap in Ireland is several times greater than the gap in Germany?  A country, the stability of whose currency is recognised throughout the world market, does not have to pay a risk premium.  That risk premium is paid by the ordinary borrower, whether for starting a small industry or paying a mortgage on a house.  It has been estimated that economic and monetary union could reduce real interest rates by 2 per cent.  That that would mean £50 a month off the average mortgage in this country and normal calculations indicate that it could mean 30,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The problem is what happens if we want to go in and Britain wants to stay out.  That is something we must face solidly. We must follow immediately economic policies which will benefit this country, whether we are in the position of being in the economic and monetary union alongside Britain &mdash; and that is not ruled out when decision time comes &mdash; or in the economic and monetary union with Britain outside.  Thanks be to God we are already following such policies.  The policies we have been following in recent years are valid in this situation.</P>
    <P>There are dangers.  Britain outside using a competitive devaluation could be extremely dangerous.  We have seen that before and we know it.  Senators may have read in yesterday's newspapers about a meeting between the <Col N="1942" /> Ministers for Finance of France and Germany.  They are already discussing how to control members outside the core group of the economic and monetary union who attempt to gain benefit in such ways.  This problem can and will be met.  Meanwhile, we must make our own preparations.</P>
    <P>There is an area of difficulty for Ireland in a common security policy but we must realise that there are several elements of security policy.  We are already committed since 1981 to the political and economic aspects of security. This was then codified in the Single European Act.  We must distinguish between the options now being considered. The question of a common foreign and security policy will cover aspects of security policy in regard to peacekeeping, which we have already done under the United Nations, and the question of peacekeeping in the future under the direct auspices of the European Union.  This is one step.  A common defence policy in which there would be agreement and co-ordination of national policies leading to a common defence policy is a second step.  A common defence is a third and critical step. It is not in question at the moment but it would be wrong to say it will never be a matter for decision.  This is a complex problem and we must approach it calmly.  There is no opportunity to discuss it in detail today.</P>
    <P>The third pillar is Justice and Home Affairs and it is a question of co-ordinating policies in these areas.  I mentioned people's concerns about drugs and crime.  There is already a high degree of co-ordination internally in regard to the drugs trade and crime. What is concerned here is closer co-ordination and a movement forward. There are other areas where there is already co-ordination which tends to be more obstructive than helpful.  On the questions of asylum, external borders and the immigration of non-EU citizens, we are already tied to the UK and that is a problem.  We broke the link with sterling many years ago because we felt strong enough to do so.  We have to <Col N="1943" /> decide whether we are going to be bound by British ideas of asylum and what type of immigrant we will allow or by European ideas on asylum and immigrants. Will the type of asylum seeker be decided in Westminister or in concert in Europe?</P>
    <P>There is a need for debate and it should be based on real issues and facts. Senators are well placed to play a key role.  They are in touch with the public &mdash; sometimes they feel they are too much in touch with the public and they would like a little peace.  They have access to expert information.  I want to say, on behalf of the Institute of European Affairs, that the resources of that Institute are available to the Seanad, to groups of Senators or to individual Senators.  If Members of this House are prepared to undertake that task, they will be performing a notable public duty and former Senators, such as myself, will be proud of them.</P>

There has been no debate in the House of the Oireachtas or elsewhere on the matters raised by the professor which will be important in the coming months.  It is difficult to encapsulate all the points he raised, but the public would like further information on the 2 per cent decrease in interest rates.</P>

      <P>That aspect would get the best response.  A number of items must be discussed and, given that the White paper on Foreign Policy was launched this week, it is opportune that the House begins the debate.  I thank Professor Dooge and the institute for their work.</P>
      <P>Professor Dooge drew a major distinction between European attitudes towards asylum seekers and immigration and Britain's attitude at present. He said there should be co-ordination in the context of the European attitude rather than the British attitude and I ask him to comment further on that aspect. It is opportune to consider these matters, including the opt-out clause regarding economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>At this time Europe is trying to dissociate itself from the problems of Britain in relation to beef.  If Ireland has a major problem in the future, will we be forced to look to Britain for help, given that national rather than European problems will arise?  It is disgusting that everybody is jumping on a bandwagon to dissociate themselves from Britain in relation to its difficulties. Britain might have dealt with these differently in the past and I ask professor Dooge to comment on how such problems could be overcome in the future.</P>

      <P>My question is simple, but it may require a lengthy answer.  In the course of his address, professor Dooge couched part of his comments in terms of Ireland breaking away from England's way of doing things and adopting a more European approach or practices.  Can Ireland bring anything distinctive to this debate?</P>

      <P>The old Seanad.  I welcome the professor back to the House. His analysis of this matter is very much in line with his informed contributions in the House over many years.  Europe now is very different from the Europe which was launched initially.  This involved the internal cohesion of six countries and subsequently involved nine countries as a result of external fear.  Internal political cohesion is an important part of Europe, but that degree of cohesion is not as evident now.  An external threat or fear does not bring about the same level of internal cohesion and to what extent have Professor Dooge and the institute, which I also congratulate, reflected on that aspect?  How firm is the foundation on which to build in comparison to 15 years ago?</P>
      <P>Countries, notably the UK, which have the greatest reluctance in moving towards economic and monetary union might have no reluctance at all in relation to other pillars, such as the second pillar.  They will try to switch the debate towards the second pillar without trying to reach the level of economic, monetary and even political integration which is required as part of the entire process.  To what extent has Professor Dooge considered this aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure to what extent consideration has been given to Europe and the world.  When I was Minister for Foreign Affairs in the 1970s, there was a development co-operation programme for what are now the Asean countries. These have emerged as the key dynamic element in world economic development. The world has changed totally in the last 20 years.  Do Professor Dooge's reflections take account of the fact that <Col N="1946" /> the core dynamic in the world economy has shifted from the time when developing groups received help from us, but they could now switch the tables on us and provide a certain degree of economic relief?</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to hear the distinctive voice of Professor Dooge in the House again.  I had the pleasure of serving under him and I remember the courteous and fair minded way he ran the House.  It is a pleasure to have him back in the Seanad and I am sure all sides agree.  I also join in the tribute to former Senator, Mr. Brendan Halligan.  Whatever about Professor Dooge's and Mr. Halligan's party affiliations, they became the first Europeans in the sense that they were able to bury party differences and consider Europe.</P>
      <P>I wish to pose the question which was also posed by Senator Lanigan.  There is an old saying that we are all brothers until it comes to overtime.  There was a clear indication from certain EU members that it was Britain's problem and it was on its own.  Narrow national interests took over immediately, not just within the EU, but also within the UK. Overnight Scotland and Wales wanted to be independent in relation to beef. Where is the vision in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Dooge said the Seanad is in touch with ordinary people, but they do not see a vision in terms of Europe. They see a Europe incapable of preventing the slaughter of men, women and children within its boundaries.  On and within the borders of Europe they see deprivation and in some cases almost starvation, but the massive edifice cannot respond.  These important issues must be considered.  Young people, not just in Ireland but all over Europe, will not be led into an expanded Community by the incentive of 2 per cent off their mortgages.  They are bigger than that and they have proved to their elders that they are more <Col N="1947" /> concerned about the environment, how we live with each other and the way we allow each other to live.  At this stage, I do not see the leaders in Europe providing vision.</P>

      <P>I encourage Members to participate in the IEA.  They should be aware that it operates under the Chatham House rule &mdash; things said at IEA meetings are in confidence.  Thankfully in this case, journalists and politicians have honoured those rules and they have not been breached.  It is important that a body with such intellectual excellence in a non partisan independent way exists.</P>
      <P>My questions relate to two areas, one of which was touched on briefly.  Professor Dooge was careful to be non-partisan and independent in his comments. He mentioned the opt-out clause, but I am worried about European Monetary Union and the implications for Ireland if sterling decides to remain outside. The other is to do with enlargement, which involves the broadening and deepening of the Union.  How will we cope with the deepening in terms of the institutional framework bearing up? Will we have to sacrifice our Commissioner or have a Parliament of 2,000 members? How does Professor Dooge see developments in that regard?  Is it consistent to argue that we will have broadening and deepening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Professor Dooge.  Discussions such as this are a good idea.  I want to deal with four issues &mdash; the Western European Union, the question of integration, the problems of expansion and of Germany's facing in a different direction, so to speak.</P>
      <P>The Western European Union is assigned an extraordinary role in the common foreign and security policy. The Western European Union emerged from a failure of the European defence community arrangements in the 1950s. Can this body be taken seriously?  It has a weak institutional framework and a peculiar chequered history.  Would it not be more honest for Europe to go back to the original European defence community proposals?</P>
      <P>On integration, I fear the widening of the Community is inconsistent with the concept of deepening.  Although it may be politically incorrect, we have to ask if it is time to close the door to achieve what the founding fathers first intended &mdash; a deeper political, economic and monetary co-operation &mdash; before we go further.  Expansion to a 27 member Union will raise fundamental difficulties for the size, shape and composition of the Commission, the size of the Parliament, the Council and the Court.  The institutional impact of further expansion has not been addressed properly.</P>
      <P>In recent times, particularly since reunification.  Germany seems more interested in expansion to the east for the sake of it.  Poland and Hungary would be a useful buffer for Germany.</P>

I compliment the IEA for furnishing us with documentation and advising us of issues of interest to Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to European Monetary Union, Professor Dooge said the country will follow economic policies which are to this country's advantage, and I agree with that view.  Furthermore, he said if the British remain outside of European Monetary Union and continue to use their competitive devaluation advantage to the disadvantage to other member states that it could be dealt with.  How can it be dealt with successfully? The exclusion from the social chapter in the Maastricht Treaty was not successfully managed.  We have suffered as a result of exclusion while Britain has benefited.</P>
      <P>Professor Dooge mentioned that the defence element of the common foreign and security policy will be difficult to address in the future.  Does he believe there is a need for European co-ordination in relation to European peacekeeping? Does he believe the UN mandate in the former Yugoslavia could have worked without the support of the Western European Union and NATO? Does he agree there is a need in the long-term for a European co-ordinated defence policy independent of the Western European Union and NATO?</P>

A poll was taken in Great Britain which showed that 75 per cent were against monetary union and the single currency. How can we get over that difficulty, given that Britain is our major trading partner?</P>
      <P>I read recently that if we joined the single currency our interest rates could fall by 2 per cent.  That would be of advantage to mortgage holders.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, among others, adverted to the 2 per cent decrease in mortgage rates which I mentioned as one estimate and also as evidence that there is a link between what happens in Europe and what happens here, even when we do not see the link in the beginning.  The important point is not the detail of how much the figure is.  In making that comment I wanted to highlight not what the decrease would be here but the cardinal fact that the gap between lending and borrowing rates is substantially higher in Germany than here.  By going our own way, without taking advantage of the stability of the Deutsche Mark, we are penalising ourselves. We must realise there is a distinct advantage in going into an economic and monetary union which will inherit the stability of the Deutsche <Col N="1952" /> Mark and be tied to it.  It would have been impossible for this State when it was founded to be independent of sterling, even if it wanted to as a gesture of independence.  We would probably not have survived economically in the twenties and thirties if we had followed that path, but we later became strong enough to do it.  This is the essential point.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question which came up several times, we must balance this advantage against the problems which will arise if we go into this system and Britain does not.  We must begin debating what we will do, because we know a number of industries and economic sectors in Ireland depend largely on Britain &mdash; as was stated, 30 per cent of our exports go there.  There is a general advantage to the community here in going into the system and a disadvantage to certain individuals if Britain does not follow.  What should we do as a community and a democracy?  We should devise methods to spread the load, so that if we do find ourselves in this position &mdash; and it is not certain that we will &mdash; those immediately affected will not have to carry all the burden.  It is not beyond the wit of experts in this area to come up with such a scheme. That is why we want the debate to start early &mdash; we want ideas to emerge on points like this so they can be explained to and accepted by the public.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy mentioned the internal cohesion of the original six member states, which broke down and was restored at the time of the Single European Act.  During the <i>ad hoc</i> committee hearings on that Act, I managed to increase the six cohesive states to seven and we eventually dragged along the other three.  That cohesion has been diluted again since then.  This is a problem and it ties in with Senator Magner's point about vision, which is an essential matter.  I have been guilty of some distortion in my address in not dealing with that point and concentrating on detail, <Col N="1953" /> because without the vision the whole thing is a failure.  When we look at the political leaders of Europe today, we do not see the same vision which motivated the founding fathers.  I thank God that Chancellor Kohl is there to remind us from time to time that this is a common project based on a vision.  He has said he will be the last real European to be Chancellor of Germany.  We should take advantage of the opportunities which exist while a man with a vision of Europe is head of this powerful state. We may have to make tough bargains, but we should make the best ones we can at this propitious time.  Circumstances might not be so helpful in five or ten years time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also said that an external threat was lacking.  That is true in that there is not the same external threat but such threats do exist, which must make us think carefully as Europeans. There is a threat of instability on our borders &mdash; the Cold War is no more but nationalism and sectarianism are erupting and have wrought havoc in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the opt-out clause and worries about economic and monetary union, which is a real problem.  He also said we should concentrate on deepening rather than widening economic and monetary union because of the dilution which might occur here, and this is another reason to go ahead.  The Intergovernmental Conference process is looking at the position, allowing first for the necessary deepening and, on that basis, widening. So from that point of view it is true. There are real questions about what the effect will be on our Commissioner, our representation and voting strength at the Council and our representation in Parliament.  My opinion is that only one of these is vital &mdash; our seat at the Commission table.  If we lose that, we might as well get out.  Why should we submit to a common approach and to qualified majority voting at the Council where our vote, while it may be part of a winning <Col N="1954" /> coalition from time to time, is trivial by itself?  We should submit because the structure of Europe is based on the role of the Commission and the sole right of initiative.  We may not have many votes, but one cannot vote on an issue unless it comes forward through an initiative.  The Commission is the guardian of the Union and of what remains of the original vision and what we supplement it with.  The Commission is the key and our seat at its table is worth any number of Parliament seats and any voting sacrifice in the Council.  If we lose in that regard, even people as enthusiastic as I am will lose hope about Ireland's role in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock referred to the question of subsidiarity and raised a very important point.  We are good at claiming subsidiarity in Brussels and stating that it is a sacred principle which must be defended.  Do we believe in this principle, however, when a situation of opposition arises between county councils and the Custom House?  Those with the power to determine policies and make key decisions suddenly lose their enthusiasm for subsidiarity in such circumstances. Before I served as a Member of this House, I was a member of a county council and fought for the independence of the County of Dublin against the City of Dublin which was attempting to walk all over us.</P>

    <P>Senator Roche raised the question of the Western European Union.  As he stated, the Western European Union became quite weak at one point but was somewhat revived during the struggle between those who favoured a stronger European element in NATO and those who favoured strong trans-Atlantic ties. I would never support Irish membership of the Western European Union as it is currently constituted because it retains nuclear capability and can call on automatic common defence, which is intolerable in my opinion.  Putting new command <Col N="1955" /> structures in place with regard to peacekeeping is a different matter.  We had to request intervention from the Western European Union and the NATO command structure in the former Yugoslavia because we could not deal with the situation ourselves.  The reality was that we could either request their assistance or do nothing.  It was preferable that they were called in to help.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the question of the opt-out clause from the Social Chapter and the fact that it is doing great harm to Ireland.  I am not sure this is correct.  The British Government insisted on opting out but many of the large industries in Britain follow the Social Chapter on a voluntary basis.  It is worth considering this very interesting phenomenon.  Many British firms believe that the Social Chapter is the correct route to follow and that it will create a loyal and productive workforce. I would not despair of a change of viewpoint in that regard.  It can be stated that the opt-out clause gives a temporary manufacturing advantage.  However, the way to cure it is not to return to Britain's level because we would then be compared with the Far East in terms of competitive disadvantage.  I am not too pessimistic about this issue.</P>
    <P>The question of public awareness, which is vitally important, was also referred to and could be discussed by the Seanad.  Perhaps a resolution regarding television information campaigns, etc., might be tabled.  I am aware that the Leader of the House feels that many demands are made on the time available for allocation to such debates. A discussion of this issue might prove worthwhile.  I am sad that Senator Doyle is worried about his pension. However, I think I dealt with points he raised in relation to economic and monetary union and Chancellor Kohl.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the issue of the recognition of diplomas, an issue which has been going on for quite some time.  We in Ireland suffer from being within the shadow of the United <Col N="1956" /> Kingdom and outside the main tradition of educational structures at higher levels on the continent of Europe.  This problem has been encountered in many areas and professions.  The only answer lies in a combination of continuous agitation and patience.  I believe the problem will be solved in the long term.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with all the points that Members raised.  However, I hope my main address and replies to subsequent questions will encourage Members of the Seanad to treat this important issue in a serious manner. Again I must state how glad I am to have returned to this House.  I assure Members that, having retired from public life on three occasions, the decision is final.</P>

      <P>In the earlier part of this debate I referred to personal taxation and its affects on employment.  There are no fewer than five sets of taxes imposed on employment in Ireland. How can this make sense in a country with one of the highest levels of unemployment in Europe?</P>
      <P>On budget day I saw a television programme during which various people were interviewed.  Recipients of social welfare payments were asked if the budget had in any way encouraged them to return to paid employment.  It is a peculiar situation that anyone could be better off by not entering employment and remaining on social welfare.  With current rates of payment, I do not accept that social welfare claimants have any form of luxurious lifestyle.  It is ludicrous, however, that people must be asked what the Government must do to encourage them to enter employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes introduced in the budget that relate to people living in local authority houses and those with medical cards.  However it is a farce that people have to consider whether or not it is worth their while to go out to work. I am not saying this is the fault of the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Minister for Finance should be looking at our taxation system.  I hope, when this report comes from committee, the issue of the integration of tax and social welfare will be addressed.</P>

    <P>Yesterday morning I listened to a Mr. <Col N="1958" /> Niall McElwee who was on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  He works in the Regional Technical College Waterford and he is involved with people who are training to be child care workers, working in the social services area looking after disadvantaged children, children who have problems or children who are in care. He said that he had been working with a group of 25 young people between the ages of 11 and 18 in Cork and that only one of those 25 had any concept of getting a job to earn his living.  They felt that there were many other ways of obtaining money, starting with social welfare.</P>
    <P>This is very frightening for us as a society.  It is disturbing that in many local authority housing estates, up to 80 per cent of people are dependent on social welfare and young children grow up with no role model, as they do not see people going out to work.  The levels of social welfare we are paying are not high enough, yet we are paying out £4 billion per year.  The only way we can tackle the grinding poverty faced by many of these communities is to increase the levels of employment, to enable people to get jobs so more people are paying into the Exchequer and fewer people are dependent on it. Only in that way can we look after as we would wish the people who are genuinely dependent on the State.  We must care in a better way for the elderly, for younger people and for those who cannot look after themselves.  I cannot see how to do this without improving the levels of employment.</P>
    <P>Pensions are also the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  At present old age pensions cost the State almost £1 billion per year, which is very considerable.  This figure will obviously increase sharply as the number of elderly in our population rises.  The importance of the pension issue is highlighted by the changing demography of this country.  This country is ageing and the elderly as a percentage of the total <Col N="1959" /> population will increase significantly over the next 20 years.  This will put an increased burden on our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>There have been huge improvements in our health services and in living standards generally and this means that people are now living much longer.  It is estimated, for instance, that average life expectancy has increased by 15 years for Irish men since 1926 and by 20 years for women over the same period.  This trend will continue, therefore there will be a substantial increase in the number of elderly people of pensionable age and people depending on the Department of Social Welfare for pensions.  The 1991 census showed that there were 403,000 aged 65 years or over and on the basis of projections published by the Central Statistics Office this figure is set to surge upwards in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office has estimated that within ten years the 65+ age cohort will have increased by 43,000. That would put the total number of over 65s in Ireland at 446,000, or 12.5 per cent of the population within the next ten years.  If we look forward to the next 20 years, the picture is even more dramatic. In 20 years' time it is estimated that the number of over 65s in Ireland will have risen to almost 700,000 and will account for 19 per cent of the total population.  This will have a huge impact on the economy and it is vital that we plan now to lessen the impact on our social welfare system.</P>
    <P>It is also very important, in the light of these trends, that all working people make provision for pensions for themselves. Otherwise the pressure on the State old age pension system will be almost unbearable.  It is very disturbing that a very large portion of the working population is not covered by any form of occupational pension.  We need to take account of the changes that are taking place, the number of people who will be over 65, the number of people <Col N="1960" /> looking to the State for pensions and how these pensions can be funded.  We should encourage people who are self employed to contribute to their own pensions so they will not be a burden on the State.  At the moment the self employed can only pay 15 per cent of their net relevant earnings into a pension every year.  Whether or not this will enable them to provide for themselves in their old age should be looked at.</P>
    <P>When pensions were introduced for everybody in April 1988 and the PRSI system was extended, people who were aged 56 or over at that stage were not eligible for a State pension and they had to make contributions.  I know there was provision for refund of these contributions but some sort of <i>pro rata</i> pension could have been worked out for them.  The number of people involved is reducing but they were not fairly treated.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about women and the social welfare system.  The Commission on the Status of Women, of which I was a member, made recommendations that we should get away from the term &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; and change it to &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo;.  Many men get social welfare benefits and they also get payment for their spouse or partner.  It is not acceptable that these people should be looked on as dependants.  The impression is given to these women that they are dependent on their husbands or partners. Changes that were recommended by the commission to change this term to &ldquo;qualified partner&rdquo; should be considered. A splitting of the social welfare payments could be made between the two people.</P>
    <P>Women are not treated equally to men when it comes to signing on the live register.  Many women who are available and looking for work do not sign on the live register because they are not entitled to any payment.  The number of women who are looking for work is underestimated because of this.  I welcome the improvements in child <Col N="1961" /> dependant payments, particularly for women who are working in the home. This is the way forward.  I will not say that I am happy with them because I am sure nobody in this House is happy with what we have at the moment, but I appreciate the difficulties the Minister has in raising more than the £4 billion his Department already spends.  Increasing child dependant allowance as much as possible is the way to pay women who remain in the home and who devote much of their lives to looking after children.</P>
    <P>I also agree with other Senators that child care expenses and expenses for care of the elderly could be made tax allowable.  I know we should be lobbying the Minister for Finance on this important issue.  Women tend to be the carers, and it is the women who usually give up work to look after an elderly relative or else decide to stay at home to look after younger children.  If they go out to work, we should look at tax allowances for elder care or for child care.  By taking on care of an elderly relative, many woman remove this burden from the State.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare is one of the biggest Departments in the public service, employing some 4,500 people.  Reform of the Department and the administrative system was talked about some years ago.  To this end, a social welfare services office was mooted.  This office would be separate from the core secretariat of the Department and would be responsible for delivering payments and services to the public &mdash; 90 per cent of the staff of the Department of Social Welfare are involved in such activities. Several years later, however, the social welfare services office does not exist as an independent executive agency with its own management structure.  Would not effectiveness and efficiency in the public service be improved by moving in this direction?</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed improvements. All of us would like to see those <Col N="1962" /> who are genuinely dependent on social welfare receiving more.  We want to reduce the number of people dependent on social welfare, as 1.5 million people is a very substantial number.  If we could increase the number in employment, who would contribute to the State's tax income, we would be in a position to better care for those who are dependent on the State.  Reducing taxes and increasing employment is the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, aptly described as reforming legislation. It is the first time since I became a public representative there has been any real focus on the issues.  Heretofore, there were changes here and there but nothing of any significance.  This legislation will have great impact, not immediately but in the future.</P>
      <P>There has been a general increase in the rates of payment.  In 1995 the increase granted in social welfare was equivalent to that granted the previous year &mdash; it was a lesser amount but because payment was brought forward it had the same effect.  The Opposition engaged in huge negative propaganda about it which we had to contend with every day.  Provision has been made for a further substantial increase in the monthly rate of child benefit which will amount to £29 for the first two children and £34 for third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that the rates of pay for so many people in employment are so low that they have to depend on family income supplement; the amount paid is in excess of £20 million.  It is a good scheme which is being strengthened.  I applaud that because people must be given every encouragement to return to work.  The provision for continued payment of increases for dependent children for up to 13 weeks to people who return to work, having been unemployed for 12 months is very commendable <Col N="1963" /> and gives people an incentive to return to work.</P>
    <P>Section 9 refers to the means of assessing self employed people for unemployment assistance.  Carpenters, masons and so on cannot go on to building sites without a C2 certificate.  If they have a C2 certificate and earn £15,000, for example, and apply for unemployment assistance the next year, that income is held against them.  That is wrong and needs to be radically changed.  One has to convince the social welfare community officer that person must be provided for.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that &ldquo;section 13 sets out the eligibility criteria for receipt of disability allowance, outlines the basis on which means will be assessed, provides for the weekly rate of the allowance and for increases&rdquo;.  I take it that refers to what was previously known as the disabled person's maintenance allowance being transferred to social welfare.  There was a major anomaly in the social welfare code, which I presume was changed as the result of a High Court judgment, where both spouses deemed to be disabled persons were not paid the equal rates.</P>
    <P>One parent families are a new phenomenon.  We encounter them every other day when looking after the interests of people seeking to be rehoused.  In my town and other towns in the north Cork area we have had to emphasise that all housing schemes must have a fair percentage of small housing to cater for such families.  I need to further study the section on deserted wife's benefit.  I know it will be made easier for a deserted wife to qualify as it will not be so difficult to prove desertion.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to improve the appeals system for people dependent on SWA. The current situation is appalling.  The standard letter people receive indicates a name to whom a person can appeal. People in the north Cork area &mdash; which <Col N="1964" /> is as big as County Limerick &mdash; are told to appeal to a person in Cork city and that is unreasonable.  Will the new system be implemented as quickly as possible? People should be informed about how it system works.  It is only just for any applicant for SWA or any other benefit to have easier access.  It is easier for people in the cities to appeal than it is for those in rural areas.  People with such needs have to be dealt with sympathetically.</P>
    <P>When the tax relief for installation of security systems for old people was first announced there was a great deal of scepticism about it.  It was said that such pensioners do not have a tax liability. However, a relative can claim relief for installing such systems and that is good. A sum of £2 million is being made available in grants to voluntary groups for the installation of security equipment. There have been great initiatives by voluntary groups in latter years but they lack co-ordination.  Community welfare officers should better co-ordinate such efforts.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide a better standard of living, with the emphasis on getting people out of the poverty trap.  FÁS is to be involved in encouraging the development of special schemes to enhance security for the elderly.  I must admit my experience with FÁS over the years has not been great but it seems the organisation needs to be reorganised.</P>
    <P>The Bill is commendable and will have a great effect on the standard of living of people who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's budget is the latest in a series of family friendly budgets. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that the increase in child benefit is welcome.  The recognition that a family with twins has greater expenses than families with single children is also welcome.  Implicit in the recognition of the high costs incurred by families with twins is a recognition that there are <Col N="1965" /> times when a family comes under greater financial stress than usual.  Perhaps in future budgets the Minister will take that into account in the context of families who do not have twins.  When a child is four years old and about to start school the family incurs expense.  That is also the case when a child reaches the age for First Communion and when the child is entering second level education. These times can cause crises in families. However, there is no doubt that child benefit benefits more families and more women than is recognised.</P>
      <P>The increase in family income supplement is welcome.  Perhaps next year the Minister will implement one of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family that family income supplement be made available to the families of small farmers and business and self employed people with limited means.  The family income supplement encourages people to go to work rather than depend on social welfare. It is of great benefit to many families but could be extended to the farming and small business community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to transfer the disabled person's maintenance allowance, which will be known as the disability allowance, to the Department of Social Welfare.  It was idiotic to have one payment made by the Department of Social Welfare while a comparative payment was made by the health boards.  I hope the Minister will take account of the special needs of carers who are looking after more than one person.  Somebody who takes care of one elderly relative has a grave responsibility but greater recognition should be given to somebody taking care of two and, in some cases, three elderly people.  Another matter of concern is where there is more than one handicapped child in a family and the situation of the parents in such cases should be looked at sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Social Welfare Bill and it follows a number of good Social Welfare <Col N="1966" /> Bills which have improved the social welfare situation each year.  I do not believe that 1.5 million people are dependent on social welfare.  There might be 1.5 million people in receipt of social welfare but not all of them are dependent on it.  That statistic is false.  I compliment the Government on demonstrating a caring attitude towards those who cannot provide for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and welcome for the Bill.  People often talk about the complexity of the social welfare system but public representatives are in a better position than most to have first hand knowledge of the workings of the system.  The contributions on this Bill have been indicative of a wealth of knowledge as a result of dealing with social welfare queries.  It is always interesting to listen to people who have dealt directly with the system and know it intimately.  I will deal with as many queries as possible during the debate but some might have to be referred for written replies.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher said that not enough is being done for the elderly within the community.  I support the view that we should give special attention to the elderly and this Bill and other measures announced in the budget do exactly that.  The general increase in rates provided for in the Bill represents an increase in real terms.  The contributory pension is being increased to 110 per cent of the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Pensions were discussed on a number of occasions during the debate and, while everybody would like to see more being paid, we should acknowledge the increase that has been achieved.  It is indicative of the work being done by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the living alone allowance is being increased from £4.80 to £6 per week.  Entitlement to free telephone <Col N="1967" /> rental allowance is being extended by increasing the age limits that apply to dependent children from 15 years to 18 years.  We also recently announced the implementation of a series of measures following the report of the task force on security for the elderly but these measures cost money.  We readily recognise the need to make extra provisions but must also bear in mind the cost of such provisions.  The extension of tax relief measures for relatives who install security systems in the homes of the elderly living alone will cost £5 million. There will also be grants from the Department, amounting to £2 million, to voluntary groups to support the installation of security equipment.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelleher welcomed the changes in PRSI but criticised them on the basis that they did not go far enough.  He might be interested to know that the cost of these changes in the current year is £121 million which, taken with the changes introduced last year, gives rise to an overall cost of £270 million. In contrast, the costs provided for by the previous Government in 1994 were just £63 million.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too severe on Cork men, but Senator Cregan also raised the issue of PRSI and he appeared to suggest it should be abolished. The State has financial commitments to the social insurance fund arising from the acquired rights built up by contributors over the years.  These commitments will have to be met in the future.</P>
    <P>Contributors have legitimate expectations based on their having made the compulsory contributions required of them.  This requires a commitment from the Government to maintain and develop the social insurance system and build up the fund rather than allow social insurance income to be reduced. The social insurance system is fundamentally different from the taxation system because it provides prescribed <Col N="1968" /> benefits to individuals and their families based on the contributions they have paid under the rules of the system.  The taxation system, on the other hand, is a general revenue raising mechanism which exists to make funds available to the Government for application to all the purposes determined by society through the democratic process.  That is a roundabout way of saying that, regardless of the amount paid, income tax does not entitle one to anything afterwards, but prescribed payments to the social insurance fund provide for one's entitlements currently and at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is a broad range of entitlements to which people become entitled by virtue of being a voluntary contributor or a PAYE contributor.  The investment made at any age by employees is colossal in terms of providing for their future.  They do not provide for their future in terms of taxation.  However, another Minister has responsibility for that area and I do not wish to make his job any more difficult than it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the social insurance system provides a mechanism for making social welfare provisions which are separate from the general taxation system, it gives an assurance and comfort to workers which could not be matched by an alternative which was integrated in a general taxation system. Senator Henry mentioned this during her contribution.  In addition, the entitlements provided by such an alternative system would be influenced by wider Exchequer considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelleher also suggested that the new grant for twins was nothing but a PR exercise.  I believe it is more than that; I am sorry that such pessimism exists in Cork and that this allowance is regarded this way.  I hope this pessimism <Col N="1969" /> does not extend outside the boundaries of Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 1,900 children will benefit from this proposal each year.  I assure Senator Kelleher that their parents will not regard this as a PR exercise.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan referred to the fact that the incentive for people on unemployment assistance to take up employment decreases as the level of earnings from employment increases.  The Senator misunderstood the examples I gave to illustrate the benefits of the improvements we are introducing.  As unemployment assistance is a means tested payment, it is inevitable that when income goes beyond a certain level the rate of payment must reduce. The Senator's point suggests that the less work people do the more money they will be paid.  However, one must look at this from the point of view of the individual who is dependent on social welfare payments.  As work increases, the support will decrease and there is nothing wrong with that.  If this is viewed with other measures, such as FIS, there is little support for the argument that it is more profitable to stay out of the workforce than to go back into it.  Provisions in last and this year's budgets prove that the reverse is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the example that a person earning £60 over three days would be better off by £27 per week compared <Col N="1970" /> with the present arrangements and that a person earning £90 over three days would be better off by £9.50 per week compared with the present arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is £3 per day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not the amounts of unemployment assistance they will receive, but the increases in unemployment assistance they will receive under the Bill.  The following examples will illustrate the benefits arising from the proposed arrangements.  A married person with two dependent children who earns £25 for one day's work will receive £111.40 a week compared with £105.40 at present.  This represents an increase of £6 per week.  If he or she earns £25 a day for two days' work, they will receive £94.60 under the new arrangements compared with £84.30 at present.  This represents an increase of £12.10 per week.  If they earn £25 a day for three days' work, they will receive £81.40 a week compared with £63.20 at present.  This represents an increase of £18.20 per week.</P>
      <P>A further positive feature of the new arrangements is that they address the main criticisms of the unemployment assistance scheme &mdash; the situation under the present arrangements whereby a person who gets work for one hour a day loses entitlement to unemployment assistance for that day.  This will no longer be the case under the new arrangements as a person will have an underlying entitlement to the full week's unemployment assistance if they have not been employed for four days or more in that week.  This may sound a little complicated but when it is applied it will become clearer.  There have always been gaps in the system and this measure proposes to plug one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am almost reluctant to respond to comments by Senator Henry because my reply is so positive she may consider it necessary to set an even higher target <Col N="1971" /> for me next year.  Despite what Senator Kelleher said earlier, I hope the Government will still be in office this time next year and that I will be able to come to the House.  I am sure the people will be reassured to hear that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Kelleher could get a nomination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an undertaking to Senator Henry during the debate on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995, that I would examine the possibility of extending family income supplement to job sharers.  I am glad to tell the Senator that this examination has been completed and that FIS will be extended to job sharers from early June.  It is not provided for in the Bill but it will be provided for later on.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry also referred to elderly people who have an occupational pension above the limit for qualifying for a social welfare pension.  She proposed that such people should be entitled to some free schemes, such as free telephone rental or free electricity allowance.  I am sure the Senator will be pleased to hear that from July next occupational pensioners with a weekly means up to the rates of old age contributory pension plus £30 will be entitled to all free schemes.  I do not suggest that Senators should add to the shopping list when the Social Welfare Bill is published.  However, it is reassuring to know that Members, the Minister for Social Welfare and myself are at one on these issues.  We might not always be able to make the progress we would like to, but our objective is to go as far as possible to meet legitimate requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members said that it does not pay an unemployed person to take up employment.  We are introducing a series of measures this year to address the problems in this area.  These include the payment of child dependant allowance up to 13 weeks where the <Col N="1972" /> person takes up employment which is expected to last at least four weeks; the increase of £10 in the earning thresholds for FIS, which means an increase of £6 per week; a reduction from six to three months in the minimum period for which the employment is expected to last to qualify for FIS; and the retention of the medical card on taking up employment.</P>
    <P>Other positive aspects of the Social Welfare Bill are the pro-employer and pro-employee measures.  It is not true that there are no incentives in this area. Distinct and specifically targeted incentives are included to encourage the unemployed into the workforce, while at the same time allowing them to decide for themselves if it is safe to make the transition from an unemployed status to an employed one.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran questioned the constitutionality of section 12.  The Bill was referred to the Attorney General for his advice and the provision has been included according to the recommendations received.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly raised the point that a carer could care for one or more people. This issue has been raised on a number of occasions. It is more severe on one carer who must care for two, three or four disabled or elderly people in the household.  There is provision under the supplementary welfare code for the health boards to provide exceptional means payments in such cases.  Individual health boards may apply different rules but if they wish to operate within the guidelines they should not make anybody feel excluded or marginalised as a result of caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan mentioned the Social Welfare Services Office, set up in 1986. It has an efficient management structure and is headed by an efficient director general.  The Senator inquired when the integration group is likely to report.  I have specific responsibility for this group.  It was hoped to have its report <Col N="1973" /> available earlier this year but this was not possible as the work involved is intricate and tedious.  The group is to be congratulated for sticking to the job with dedication and enthusiasm for so long and I thank it for its work.  It is expected the report will be available later in the year but it depends on matters outside our control.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry and Honan referred to pension funds.  This subject is close to my heart.  With regard to the worry about the provision of resources to pay pensions, when I was 15 years old I was told by the time I would be the age I am now, there would not be money to pay pensions.  However, the soothsayers were wrong.  There is still plenty of resources to meet pension requirements and there will be in future.  Ongoing provision is being made.  However, there is a need to monitor the situation carefully to ensure there is no diminution in the availability of resources, given demographic trends.</P>
    <P>I am not sure it is a great idea to rely entirely on private pension funds.  Some European states favour this, but a more caring society would opt for a balance between private and public pensions.  I would like more co-operation between the private and public sectors in this area and greater benefit would be achieved by this.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock asked about qualification for unemployment assistance of people on C2s who have been unemployed in the previous year.  This is an awkward issue.  It has been raised time and again and there is no simple solution to it.  I am sure all public representative on occasions have had to run the gauntlet of the system, particularly where it involves spouses with families who had been in reasonably lucrative employment in the year ended the previous 5 April and now find themselves out of work through no fault of their own.  Such people can find themselves in dire circumstances.  They are assessed on their incomes at the end of the previous <Col N="1974" /> tax year.  We all know that such incomes are of no benefit to people in the current year because they are already spent.  I fought this on several occasions, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.  There is now a general recognition in the appeals system of the need to address this problem.</P>
    <P>Other points were raised but I do not have time to deal with them because I do not want to further delay the House. I will do my best to refer to them on Committee Stage.  I compliment Members for their constructive submissions and suggestions and for their knowledge of the social welfare code, which is an essential ingredient for a discussion on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise the need for the appointment of a remedial teacher for the primary schools in Glenbrohane, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Knocklong, County Limerick.  There are 93, 86, 82, and 120 pupils respectively in these schools.  Of the 381 pupils, approximately 11 need remedial assistance. Their names were forwarded to the <Col N="1975" /> Department of Education in May 1995. The tests set to ascertain their circumstances were the Marino word recognition, the MICRA-T reading test and the SIGMA-T mathematics test.  The results, which included an evaluation of each child's ability in relation to age, were forwarded to the Department.</P>
      <P>Some of the pupils had to tranfer outside their school areas for remedial help.  Thus, parents are forced to pay for private tuition for them.  One child is attending a special class at Mitchelstown. Each day her father drives her to and from this school, which is ten miles from their home.  He has done this for three years.  Children are remaining in lower classes despite their age.  Two girls remained in third and fourth classes although they are shown on the class roll as being in fifth and sixth classes. There is extreme concern about this and it is seen as disgraceful discrimination. The schools involved have a total of 14 teachers but other groups of schools in the area with fewer teachers have the services of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>We should treat all children equally. Children in small rural schools should have the same facilities and opportunities as those in large urban areas. However, the children in Glenbrohane, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Knocklong national schools requiring remedial help are being deprived of it.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  The situation should be corrected and a remedial teacher should be appointed for the next school year in these areas.  When a child undergoes remedial teaching, it is important he or she gets help at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of education of the disadvantaged must be addressed at primary level and it is important that the identification of problems is made at an early stage in a child's school life.  Children who are unable to cope with school must be professionally assisted.  The inability of schools to cope with these <Col N="1976" /> children must also be addressed.  Children with problems in the schools to which I have referred do not have a remedial teacher and are being discriminated against by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Under-achievement in school is not unique; it exists in all communities. With the exceptional pressures placed on children to perform, it is essential that remedial teaching is available to all who require it.  Learning difficulty is viewed as the gap between attainment of the pupils and their potential. Remedial teaching aims at closing the gap by providing additional, specialised teaching on an individual or group basis. In the schools under discussion, there are children in need of this assistance and until it is available, the education system has failed them.</P>
    <P>The absence of the remedial teacher is clearly identified in the transition of pupils from primary to secondary schools.  Such pupils experience extreme difficulties.  Many do not complete their secondary education.  Children who need remedial teaching and do not receive it are more likely to find themselves among the long-term unemployed because of the failure in the education system to provide a remedial service which would enable them to reach their potential.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue with a view to appointing remedial teachers for the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  It gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education, to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education is not in a position at present to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector.  As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter, in the first instance, for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with <Col N="1977" /> remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
    <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under-achievement in primary schools.  Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1995, an additional 55 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 223 schools benefited from this allocation. This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,188.</P>
    <P>Of the 3,203 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,285 now have the services of remedial teachers, either on a full-time or a shared basis.  Of the 147 ordinary national schools in County Limerick, 113 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or a shared basis.  This includes ten schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 87 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Limerick currently have access to a remedial service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has indicated to the House her intention to review needs in this area and to consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources. When she is in a position to further extend the remedial service, Glenbrohane, Knockadea, Ballylanders and Knocklong national schools will receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when the Minister for Education took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access. It is a matter of regret to the Minister that it is not possible at present to meet the needs of all pupils for remedial <Col N="1978" /> teaching as, unfortunately, she does not have unlimited resources.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is aware, doctors in training are one of the three groups of workers excluded from the provisions of EU Directive 93/104 on working hours, the others being fishermen and oil rig workers.  The reason doctors in training, who are land based, have been included with two sea based groups is too complex to explain here. However, I ask the Minister to introduce national regulations to limit the amount of time in which doctors in training can work in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>This EU directive applies to the area of health and safety.  The time spent working is not only of concern to the doctors themselves, it is also fundamentally of concern to the patients.  Doctors in training are generally considered to be those who have completed their basic or undergraduate medical training and are preparing for a recognised higher medical qualification.  Most are working towards some specialist status but some are undertaking the specific training in hospitals for general practice and they need to gain the necessary experience to obtain specialisation in this field.</P>
      <P>The duration of their training is not defined in this country but it usually continues here or abroad until they have got a consultant post.  The imbalance between the number of doctors in training and the number of consultant posts and the resultant bottleneck was one of the reasons for the establishment of the Tierney group which produced its report on medical manpower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 30 per cent of the doctors in this country could be described as doctors in training; they are doctors on whom the general running of the hospital service depends.  Many of them come from abroad; in some of our hospitals we must rely on staff 80 per cent of whom <Col N="1979" /> come from abroad.  Without their service commitment our hospitals could not function.  It is also important to remember that these are training posts. The Minister mentioned this in the Doolin Lecture.  He discussed the fact that lack of structured education in some hospitals has meant that many of our best young doctors go abroad, with many of them not returning.</P>
    <P>The junior doctors' relationships with patients, even when they are well supervised by senior doctors, is paramount to the welfare of patients.  At nights and weekends, the brunt of cover must often go to those who have been on duty without any break that day.  Indeed, they often return to duty the next day without any sleep.  Having worked myself as a junior doctor at a time when, through lack of staff, our hours on call were appalling, I have little sympathy with those who take the view that because they did it in their day, junior doctors should continue to do it today.</P>
    <P>Working hours should not be so extended that patient care is adversely affected.  The life and health of the young doctor is also important.  We are lucky in that we could introduce national regulations because all our doctors are covered by much the same contracts.  I do not suggest that specific hours are desirable at this stage because the Minister has many aspects to consider. However, they should be short enough to allow doctors not just to lead a normal life, but also to have time for study and to attend courses which are part of their training, as well as long enough on duty for them to get the necessary practical experience.</P>
    <P>Above all, action should be taken immediately because there is also a risk to the life and health of patients.  It should not be increased by having them cared for by over-tired doctors.  In some of the most serious cases that have occurred in the UK, some of which have been fatal, the hours worked by junior <Col N="1980" /> doctors before the disaster occurred were horrific.  Some were on duty for 36 hours without any sleep.</P>
    <P>Monitoring of whatever regulations the Minister introduces is also essential because young doctors are in a semiapprenticeship role.  They are in a weak position to refuse additional workloads imposed on them by seniors who may be important in their futures for progressing their careers in this country.  In a small country such as this, bad feeling regarding lack of co-operation in one area can be known very easily, even though it may be in the best interests of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>It can be difficult to calculate hours of work because of the &ldquo;on call&rdquo; system but it is not impossible to devise a plan. We already have a 65 hour week in place.  Various levels could be placed on the &ldquo;on call&rdquo;, for example, by deciding if one was at home it was worth less than if one was in the hospital, etc.  In this way the hours could be worked out.</P>
    <P>It is not only the recent Tierney report on medical manpower which will influence the number of junior doctors, their career structures and the hours they work.  The proposed radical changes being considered by the Medical Council and the medical schools as regards medical training, make action in the area of limitation of hours of work even more urgent.  If the intern year is incorporated into the undergraduate programme a service gap will result.  We may need more front line cover by consultants, much of which is secretarial and carried out by interns but which would be better carried out by those with experience in that field.  The recent fracas in the accident and emergency department in University College Hospital, Galway, showed that unrealistic rostering routinely leaves services understaffed, so administration must be urgently looked at as well.</P>
    <P>While there will be a cost to putting a legal limit on the hours a doctor in training may work, the cost of not changing <Col N="1981" /> them may be even more serious because doctors who work excessive hours are likely to be involved in medical accidents. The risk to patients from over-tiredness in doctors could become a factor in claims for compensation for professional negligence and action should be taken long before this is the primary reason for so doing.  The health and welfare of doctors in training should be reason enough.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this important issue.  I would like to set out the background to the exclusion of non-consultant hospital doctors from the terms of the directive. Ireland's interests in the negotiations leading to the adoption of this directive were handled by the Department of Enterprise and Employment and prior to the establishment of that Department by the Department of Labour.  The Department of Health was consulted on a regular basis but was not directly represented in the process at European level.  The Department of Health's position was that the inclusion of non-consultant hospital doctors would pose a considerable difficulty for the existing system of post-graduate medical training and for the provision of health services in this country.</P>
      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors work a basic 39 hour week but are liable to be rostered to work up to an average of 65 hours per week, for which they are paid overtime for hours in excess of 39 hours.  These arrangements were implemented following a Labour Court recommendation and consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation which represents the interests of non-consultant hospital doctors.  This involved the creation of 400 additional non-consultant posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a 48 hour limit on the working week for non-consultant hospital doctor poses two major concerns. Primarily, it is incompatible with <Col N="1982" /> the existing system of postgraduate medical training which requires doctors in training to acquire experience in different aspects of the branch of medicine which they are pursuing.  This system is quite different from training systems in mainland Europe where training is more structured and formal as well as of shorter duration.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the introduction of a 48 working week would involve the creation of additional non-consultant doctor posts.  A study group comprised of nominees from the Department of Health, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board found that the ratio of non-consultant hospital doctors to consultants is already undesirably high.  Any further increase in this ratio would have adverse implications for patient care, for the efficient operation of hospital services and for the future career prospects of doctors in training.  The whole issue of the medical career structure is at present under scrutiny following the publication of the findings of the study group.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission, following on the adoption of the directive on working hours which excluded non-consultant hospital doctors from its remit, commissioned a report from COSHAPE Limited to examine the working hours of doctors in training in EU member states and non-EU states of the European Economic Area Agreement.  One of the conclusions of this report was that, although the weekly hours worked by doctors in training are highly variable it was reasonable to conclude that these routinely exceed 55 hours a week in ten of the 18 countries that supplied information.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission, having consulted with health service and junior hospital doctor representatives as well as representatives of member states, is now considering the introduction of a specific working time directive for junior hospital doctors following receipt of <Col N="1983" /> the COSHAPE report.  The Commission's proposals in this regard are awaited.  An important point to bear in mind is that non-consultant hospital doctors are only one of a number of groups alluded to by the Senator excluded from the terms of the working time directive.</P>
    <P>In relation to the level of hours worked by non-consultant hospital doctors, our primary concern must be that patient care is delivered in a satisfactory and safe manner.  Obviously, the physical and mental state of those delivering that care can have an impact on the quality of the care delivered.  I am satisfied that the 65 hour week, which was implemented on an agreed basis between the hospital managements, consultants and NCHDs, provides <Col N="1984" /> a satisfactory basis for the delivery of good quality care.  However, I am concerned at reports that some of the rosters agreed to in 1989 are not being adhered to.  To some extent, this is inevitable from time to time given the demands that are sometimes made on hospital services.</P>
    <P>A mechanism to address this issue has been agreed by the Department of Health, health service employer representatives and the Irish Medical Organisation representing non-consultant hospital doctors.  The first stage of this mechanism to record all hours claimed by non-consultant hospital doctors was introduced in July of last year.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 April 1996.</P>
