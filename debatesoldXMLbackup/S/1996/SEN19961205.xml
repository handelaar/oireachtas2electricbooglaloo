      <P>I have to inform the House that a letter dated 3 December 1996 has been received from the Secretary to the Government regarding the resignation of a Member of the Government, the appointment of a Member of the Government and the allocation of a Government Department. The letter will be set out in the usual manner in the Journal of the House and, consequent on this announcement, it will also be printed in the Official Report of Debates.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to endorse the work of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the prosecution of rape as a war crime.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to guarantee that beef prices will be maintained or improved in the spring of 1997 thereby ensuring that farmers who winter fatten cattle will not be disadvantaged financially.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Henry's and Senator Finneran's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Kiely may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is item 1.  I thank the Opposition for agreeing to take all <Col N="979" /> stages of this Bill today.  I propose that there be 20 minutes per speaker and that, when Second Stage concludes, there will be a sos of half an hour before the remaining stages are taken; or, if Second Stage finishes close to 1 p.m., we will take the normal sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>People have asked for this Bill for many years and we are taking all stages because it is important that it be put on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  The Leader has already sent out the notice of next week's business but, if he does not do so today, perhaps he could soon outline what the Government intends taking in the House over the next three weeks and when this session will end.  The Leader has been asked about the Credit Union Bill on a regular basis but all Senators are receiving correspondence about the need for this legislation to be brought before us as quickly as possible.  Finally, will we deal with the Universities Bill before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Wright's point about the Credit Union Bill.  There is much interest in it and I wish to ensure there is enough time both to consider and discuss it, because it is complicated.  We should know as soon as possible the date on which we will be taking the Bill.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could clarify the position not only on the Universities Bill but on the other legislation promised for the education sector.  We need to know the Minister's plans and roughly when she intends bringing forward legislation.  It was reported in yesterday's newspapers that she would publish an education Bill in the next fortnight but I am not sure which Bill that is.  Will that legislation be published and brought forward before the Universities Bill is brought to a conclusion?  What is the exact thinking on those Bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was indicated previously that the Credit Union Bill would be published before Christmas and there is much concern among the credit unions about the time it is taking to come before us.  When will it be published and when it is, how long will it take before it comes to the House?</P>
      <P>Now might be an appropriate time to debate Northern Ireland in the hope that a ceasefire on a permanent basis can be restored before Christmas.  We must condemn actions by any group whereby people are intimidated going to church and I am pleased to hear that the Mayor of Ballymena has condemned this also.  One of the most basic civil rights is to be allowed worship in freedom.  Intimidation of those attending church services cannot be tolerated and we should say so quite explicitly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your election as I did not have <Col N="980" /> the chance to do so yet.  I thought it was a Southern matter so I let everyone else offer their congratulations first.  I am delighted to see you in the Chair.</P>
      <P>I join in Senator Dardis' request to have a debate on Northern Ireland because since I had the honour to join this Chamber I have been disappointed at how few opportunities there have been to discuss it.  For myself it is the first item on the agenda although there are many other problems; the Government is going through a period similar to what Manchester United went through.  When the Government gets over that, I hope the Leader will find an opportunity to discuss Northern Ireland.  The Leader of the Opposition spoke about Northern Ireland in the Dáil yesterday and I had much to say about his contribution.  The role of this State in regard to Northern Ireland needs to be examined; some lateral thinking is needed.  The Republic of Ireland arrogates to itself the right to tell us what to do in the North.  We do not get an opportunity to tell you what to do in the Republic of Ireland which is what I want.  However, yesterday's debate was excellent.  Will the Leader organise a debate on Northern Ireland as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a debate on a number of issues related to fishing.  The issue in which I am most interested is the 40 per cent cutback in fishing boats and quotas; another is the review that was published on safety at sea and, also, salmon fishing restrictions which will badly affect people in the west of Ireland a great deal, especially small fishermen.  The Bill dealing with farm salmon will be introduced shortly.  Will the Leader enlighten me further on that Bill?  When will fishing issues be debated in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on Northern Ireland.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in Northern Ireland at present.  It is understood that there are intensive discussions in progress but we do not know where they will lead.  I strongly support Senator Dardis' comment on allowing people the freedom to go to churches without being hindered.  I cannot understand how people can do what they are doing.  Church leaders have spoken out and should continue to do so until such time as this stops.  I heard David Ervine on the radio this morning saying that there are unfortunately plenty of people in Northern Ireland with stupidity in their heads and hate in their hearts.  There is an onus on politicians and, equally so, on church leaders to speak out on these issues until they cease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House indicated yesterday that he would be willing to make time available to discuss the issue of ethics in politics and he is to be applauded for that.  During that debate I suggest that the establishment of a <Col N="981" /> standing House committee on ethics be discussed; there should be one in each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In the same context, will the Leader suggest to his ministerial colleagues the appointment of a public ethics commissioner, a high ranking, independent public official at High Court level who would have the right and responsibility to investigate allegations of ethical impropriety and to report publicly thereon?  The time has come for the appointment of a public official with at least the same standing as, for example, the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>When will the Employment Equality Bill and the equal status legislation be introduced?  The proposed equal status legislation ran into difficulties on how owners of premises should be able to exclude persons.  This is important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader impress upon the Minister for Education the importance of providing funding in next year's Estimates, which will be introduced next Monday, for the new community school in Dunmore, County Galway and for a six room extension which is badly needed for Gort community school, County Galway?  The conditions under which Dunmore community operates causes great problems for children and teachers on wet days.  Gort community school was built for 700 students and there are now 784.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I suggest when Senators are in Northern Ireland that they make it known to those they meet that they strongly disapprove of what is happening there.  I was in Lisburn and Belfast last Friday and people feel isolated.  They believe that people in the South do not notice these activities, which are totally sectarian and against civil rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on the National Roads Authority was asked for some time ago and the Leader said that it should take place before Christmas.  It is important that the operations of the NRA are discussed because its strategic importance to our road system.  It is adopting a system with a Dublin west axis, Dublin northwest axis, and a Dublin south-west axis and has cut out the south-east.</P>
      <P>When will there be a debate on the mid term review of spending under the five year plan?  The dogs in the street are discussing this matter. Experts have been appointed by the Government to visit regional and local authorities.  It has not been debated in this House.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator McAughtry has introduced a new element into the Northern Ireland issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prime Minister of Israel was in the country yesterday.  He met leaders of various parties and the Government, but not the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or either House of the Oireachtas.  I want a debate in the near future on foreign affairs which will specifically include the current impasse in the Middle East.  Wherever one looks, there are problems in the world but there has not been a comprehensive discussion on foreign affairs in this House for some time.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs meets on a regular basis but the reportage of it is minimal and the Government still has not allowed funding to publish its proceedings.  Will the Leader approach the Minister for Finance to provide such funding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate early in the new session on tourism?  I have sought a discussion on this matter for some time.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade stated last night that plenty of funding is available for tourism development through grants and soft loans.  This must be the best kept secret in the history of the State because, other than a few large players, people in my area do not know about the grants and soft loans that are available for tourism development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter must be clarified so people in the industry understand the position. I have appealed to the Leader for some time to arrange a debate on this issue.  I hope such a discussion will take place before the start of the tourism season.  People should be told funding is available.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible.  This matter has become more urgent given the Minister's statement which nobody in the industry understands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Roche raised the important issue of the possibility of the appointment of an ethics commissioner and a standing committee to examine the enforcement of legislation in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is not the best time, given the media hysteria at present, but directors of standards have been appointed in other Parliaments.  A review of the Constitution is <Col N="983" /> currently under way and it might be opportune to examine whether a mechanism other than the Ethics in Public Office Act should be put in place. Some Parliaments do not have legislation but resolutions which have evolved over time and which can be made regularly.  This is much more efficient than introducing legislation every ten to 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Government will publish the Estimates on Monday and the House should have an opportunity to discuss them.  I am sure the other House will debate them and this House should also have an opportunity to examine them.  It may not have any responsibility in the matter but it should have an opportunity to express its view on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of important issues were raised.  Senator Wright and Senator Dardis raised the Credit Union Bill.  This major legislation contains 188 sections and runs to 400 pages.  It will be published either in the last few days of 1996 or at the beginning of January. People will have a month to examine it in detail before the debate commences.  It will be introduced at the beginning of the next session. It is almost ready and I am happy that it will be published soon because it is major legislation.  It is also useful that the various interested parties will have a couple of weeks in which to examine this complex Bill before it comes to either House.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright asked about the Universities Bill.  It is wending its way slowly through Second Stage in the other House.  Apparently, many Opposition Deputies feel the need to say a great deal about it.  This is welcome but it is proceeding slowly.  My best guess is that it will probably finish Second Stage in the Lower House late this session and then go into committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will come to this House before the end of February.  I look forward to the debate on the Bill when it comes before this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Wright also asked about the legislation the House will deal with this session; this will also answer Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Calnan's query.  Item 2 on today's Order of Paper is a fisheries Bill and I am glad to point out that it is another Seanad Bill.  The debate will commence on 12 December but it will not be rushed because there is a wealth of expertise on fishery matters in the House.  The Dublin Docklands Bill will also be taken this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill may or may not conclude this session and the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (Amendment) Bill will be taken next week.  The Adoption (No. 2) Bill will probably not be taken this session.  I hope the Freedom of Information <Col N="984" /> Bill will begin its life in this session.  It will be published before Christmas and I am happy to tell Senator Roche that it is a Seanad Bill.  This is partly a reflection on the Senator's great work in this area earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>The House will sit until Friday, 20 December when the Appropriation Bill will be taken.  This will give Senator Daly an opportunity to consider the financial and economic matters.  The House will sit all day on 20 December if the Senator wishes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised legislation relating to the education sector.  I understand the Bill relating to boards of management is almost complete and will be published soon.  However, it will not be taken in this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis raised Northern Ireland.  I support the views expressed by all sides on the unacceptable and barbaric harassment in Ballymena at present.  Senator O'Sullivan repeated Mr. Ervine's words this morning about people with stupidity in their heads and hate in their hearts and that sums it up.  As Senator Henry noted, it must be incomprehensible to people looking in from outside that such a situation can prevail today.  The courage of the priest and people in the estate in Ballymena should be commended, as should the outspoken statements of the other church leaders.  I would like to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland, but I am not sure it is possible between now and the end of the session.  However, I will consider it.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche made an important contribution and his points are worthy of consideration.  The issues of the possible establishment of an ethics committee or the appointment of an ethics commissioner are important and should be debated calmly and openly.  It is in the interest of the overwhelming majority of Members of both Houses that mechanisms are in place in that regard.  This would assure people that, as I know to be true after 15 years in politics, the overwhelming majority of politicians are decent, hardworking people who are dedicated to their constituents and political parties and to the concept of public service.  The idea that we are trying to hide something is wrong.  We have nothing to hide and I have no difficulty with whatever proposal emerges to assure people that the position is as I described it.  I thank Senator Roche for his proposals and I will discuss the matter later with him to examine if progress can be made on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche also raised the Employment Equality Bill.  This will come to the House early in the next session.  It has almost completed its progress through the other House.  I expect that the Equal Status Bill will be published in February.  Senator McDonagh made an eloquent case for the schools at Dunmore and Gort.  I will pass on his comments to the Minister.  Senator Lanigan, in the course of an omnibus <Col N="985" /> contribution, mentioned the National Roads Authority.  There probably will not be time to discuss it in this session, but if it is possible I will arrange a debate.  I am not sure what dogs the Senator meets on the street but I have met few who are barking about the mid-term review of the five year Government plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the form of the birth certificate.  The existing format for the birth certificate is over 150 years old.  It is set out in an annex to the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863.  It records the father's occupation but ignores that of the mother, it records the father's address but not that of the mother and it asks for the mother's &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo;.  The child's surname is not shown, giving rise to a widespread assumption that the child automatically takes its father's surname.</P>
      <P>This format reflects the social attitudes of the era in which it was drawn up.  It is designed for a society in which virtually all births took place within marriage; women did not normally work outside the home; parents did not have separate addresses; women had a &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo; and a &ldquo;married name&rdquo; and children were assumed to take the name of their father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> This format is an anachronism in the late 20th century.  It is ill suited to the diversity of modern society and to the enhanced status of women within that society.  For example, many mothers work outside the home nowadays.  One fifth of all births take place outside marriage and it is not uncommon for the father and mother to have different addresses.  Many women choose to change their name on marriage, as do some men, but this cannot be taken for granted.  Women and men may change their name by other means, for example, by deed-poll.  It can no longer be assumed that a child will be given its father's name.  In some cases, the child will be given its mother's surname.  In others, the child will be given the surname of both parents.</P>
    <P>The birth certificate which we have inherited from the mid-19th century is clearly discriminatory and out of step with modern society.  It has been the subject of mounting criticism in recent years.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women highlighted this issue and recommended that amending legislation be brought forward.  Many people have written or spoken to me about their outrage and frustration at having their child's birth recorded in this way.  I can appreciate how some parents find this format offensive and are insulted by the requirement to comply with such antiquated legislation.</P>
    <P>Shortly after its establishment my Department assumed responsibility for a comprehensive review of the legislation governing the registration of births, deaths and marriages.  This review involves examination of a large volume of legislation, much of which dates from the mid-19th century, and the analysis of complex issues. It was clear from the outset that this review would take some considerable time to complete.  It was equally clear that there was a pressing need for a stillbirths register to bring Ireland into line with other EU countries and to provide an appropriate focus for the real grief of those affected.  I decided, therefore, to bring forward legislation to provide for a register of stillbirths as a matter of priority.  The Stillbirths Registration Bill was, as Senators will be aware, enacted in early 1994 with all-party support.</P>
    <P>Work on the general review of the registration legislation is ongoing but it will be some time before it is completed.  As I have indicated, the form of the birth certificate is generally acknowledged to be outmoded and discriminatory and has been the subject of increasing criticism in recent years.  The measures needed to amend its format are relatively brief and simple.  Therefore, I decided that this change should not await finalisation of the general review but should be the subject of a separate Bill.  I am committed to progressing the general review, which is likely to result in extensive changes to the registration legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 1 and the Schedule are the key elements of the Bill.  I will deal with these together as they are closely related.  Section 1 <Col N="987" /> provides that a new format of register entry, as detailed in the Schedule, is to apply to births registered or re-registered after the commencement date.  While the Bill makes no reference to the birth certificate <i>per se</i>, it must automatically reflect the details of the register entry.</P>
    <P>The new format set out in the Schedule is gender neutral.  It is similar to the form of the stillbirth certificate.  The new certificate will show the mother's occupation as well as that of the father.  It will show the mother's address as well as that of the father.  There will no longer be a reference to a &ldquo;maiden name&rdquo;.  Instead, any former names of both mother and father will be recorded.  These will include any changes of name on marriage, by deed-poll or by any other means.</P>
    <P>Unlike the existing birth certificate, the new certificate will show the child's surname.  The absence of a surname on the existing birth certificate leads many people to believe that a child automatically takes the father's surname. This is not in fact the case as surnames are acquired by reputation and usage and there is no legal requirement or presumption that a child must take its father's name.  However, in order to nail that myth and in keeping with the recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women it has been decided to include the child's surname in the new format.</P>
    <P>The surname registered for the child can be that of either mother or father or both, as provided in section 1(3).  A different surname can be registered if either parent requests this and if the Registrar General considers that the circumstances so warrant.  This facility is intended to cover unusual circumstances where the restriction of the choice of surname would create difficulties.  It is not envisaged that this would arise frequently.</P>
    <P>The new format will, as I have said, apply to registrations and re-registrations which are effected after the commencement date.  There are two types of re-registration.  Under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, the parents of a child legitimated by the parents' marriage are required to have the child's birth re-registered.  The second type of re-registration was introduced by the Status of Children Act, 1987.  If the parents of a child are not married to each other and the child's father is not shown in the original register entry this type of re-registration can be used to show the father's identity.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, in the case of a re-registration of a birth which has already been registered in the new format, the surname of the child on re-registration remains unchanged.  The requirement to re-register under the Legitimacy Act, 1931, is waived if, as a consequence of the change in format, the new entry would duplicate the previous entry relating to that child.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is a straightforward provision which allows the Registrar General to prescribe various forms for use for the purposes of this Act.  Section <Col N="988" /> 3 is a technical provision which is necessary to effect a change in the format of the birth certificate.  It allows the Registrar General to determine how and when register books are to be surrendered by registrars and new ones supplied. Existing legislation is extremely prescriptive about such matters and does not permit the surrender of incomplete register books.  The introduction of a new format of entry in the births register necessarily entails the opening of new register books.  Without the flexibility provided for in this section, it would not be possible to alter the format of the birth certificate.</P>
    <P>Section 4 repeals the existing form of the entry in the births register &mdash; form A in the annex to the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863.  Sections 5 and 6 contain miscellaneous amendments and repeals of forms consequential on the change of format of the birth certificate. Section 7 contains standard provisions dealing with the short title, citation, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make exaggerated claims about this Bill.  It is a short Bill the main thrust of which is to replace one set of particulars with another.  The Bill is important because it has the potential to affect every future mother or father of a child.  The form in which the particulars of a birth are recorded at present could be described, at best, as quaint and, at worst, as offensive to women.  By changing this format, we do much more than substitute one piece of paper for another.  We put in place a certificate which is appropriate to our society and to the status of women.  The Bill thereby gives effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>This measure has been sought for a considerable time and I am pleased to introduce it.  Senators of all political persuasions will recognise the need for this change and will contribute constructively to the debate on the matter.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for initiating another Bill in the Seanad.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it addresses the inconsistencies in the format of the present birth certificate.  The removal of gender inequalities from birth certificates is more than a cosmetic exercise.  The assumptions made in the present format on the surname of the person whose birth is being registered and the relationship and employment status of the parents are extremely prejudicial.  They not only give rise to a stereotyping of both parental roles but they could also cause legal problems for the person involved. With the welcome and successful passage of the Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, this legislation is all the more timely and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people take the details of their birth for granted but I know how important they can be.  I am regularly in contact with people who are suffering because there is inadequate information in their birth records or because they are being <Col N="989" /> refused access to that information.  The proposed new certificate will address these issues in terms the lay person can understand, but without being overly politically correct.  As the Minister said, the Bill gives effect to one of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I hope it heralds similar action to give effect to the many other measures recommended in that report.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be of significant benefit to future generations who will have access to a properly documented and concise summary of the circumstances of their birth.  Despite its simplicity, this basic information is of inestimable value.  Great care must be taken in its collection, collation and dissemination.  This is an area where the much vaunted openness and transparency is long overdue.  The General Register Office is badly under-resourced.  There are long queues and no privacy when sensitive matters are under discussion.  Perhaps the Minister might outline his future plans for that office.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary.  However, the Minister could take this opportunity to also address other issues relating to the registration of births.  I am always fascinated that much of the legislation we discuss under the umbrella of equality and law reform has many inequalities.  In this case, we are trying to remove gender inequalities from birth certificates, yet one category of people, of which I am a member, is discriminated against to the extent that it is not allowed access to its birth records.  This is an ideal opportunity to address this discrimination and remove a glaring inequality.</P>
    <P>I tabled what I thought was an appropriate amendment but I have been informed it will be ruled out of order.  Perhaps the Minister could advise me in this regard.  I am willing to be flexible provided we can achieve the desired result.  We debated this matter in the House before and the majority of Members expressed their support for change.  Today we will have an opportunity to turn those words into deeds.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that my amendment is out of order because it seeks to give anyone whose birth has been registered an opportunity to secure a copy of their birth certificate.  I have been told this information is available to anybody who has details of their birth.  If that is the case, the information I have been given is wrong.  My understanding is that if a person goes to Joyce House in Dublin with the details of their birth, they will get the information required.  However, if they are truthful and state they are adopted, they will not be given access to their birth records.  My understanding is that those who are adopted will be referred to the adopted persons register, as happened in my case and in numerous cases brought to my attention.  It is not possible for somebody to admit they are adopted and then to look for information on their birth, which is anybody's right.  If that is the case, my amendment should be accepted because it is not <Col N="990" /> an adopted person's right to get that type of information.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed that my amendment is more appropriate to adoption legislation.  This seems to copperfasten my view that adopted people are not entitled to their birth certificates. I do not have much faith in the Minister who is currently bringing the Adoption (No. 2) Bill through the Houses.  On numerous occasions I requested that similar amendments should be accepted in adoption legislation, but that did not happen.  I ask the Minister for his assistance in this matter.</P>
    <P>Wheras I welcome the changes outlined in the Schedule, one item omitted from the new birth certificate is column 11 which states: &ldquo;baptismal name, if added after registration of birth, and date&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is the case.  I hope we have not become so politically correct that it is now unacceptable to refer to a church ceremony on a birth certificate. I will accept its omission only if it is no longer required.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions in this legislation, which are long overdue, were recommended by the Second Commission on the Status of Women. What is the position if a mother wants to name the father of a child born outside marriage?  Is it necessary to provide proof of parentage?  Because this is an important document for the people concerned, how do we ensure that the information given is correct?  We may introduce legislation in the future so that absent fathers provide for their children, therefore, we need to ensure the father named on the birth certificate is the birth father of the child.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister for initiating it in this House.  I ask him to consider the only issue not addressed in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this important legislation which gives mothers and fathers equal rights when registering the births of their children.  This right has been sought by the Council for the Status of Women and in bringing this legislation before the House the Minister is anxious to progress matters to ensure equality for both parents.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 and 1880 as being quaint, which they are.  However, in fairness to those who drafted them, they have stood the test of time well.  I have had occasion to trace such records and the level of information they contain has been of tremendous assistance over the years to people researching their ancestry.  People who travel from America, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and other countries to research birth, marriage and death certificates find they are of great assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the staff of our public records offices around the country, including the Customs House, local authorities and health boards, who deal with the registration of births, marriages and <Col N="991" /> deaths.  Ireland has an accurate system for tracing such important aspects of people's lives.  In my area of County Offaly the registration staff have, in some cases, been able to trace births and deaths back 50 years before official records began.  It is a great asset for any country to have such accurate information.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures that both parents' names will now be recorded on birth certificates.  In the past, many mothers were upset about this aspect and felt their names should be on birth certificates. Most parents will be happy that the new birth certificate will show the full names of both fathers and mothers.  It will also show the occupations of both parents which is a welcome move.  Where re-registration takes place the surname of the child remains unchanged.</P>
    <P>I wish to pursue the question that Senator McGennis raised with the Minister as I wish to be accurate in quoting him regarding proof of paternity.  When the Minister replies I hope he will be able to provide details on this point.  It is essential to have accurate information along those lines.  I can foresee difficulties if inaccurate names are registered, so how can one make certain that the information supplied is accurate? I presume there is no method for dealing with a case where the father is unknown or where the mother is not forthcoming in registering a father's name.  Does the Minister have any views on that and how does he believe this can be dealt with?</P>
    <P>I know of one or two cases where the father claims paternity of the child but because the relationship has deteriorated the mother may not agree to have the father's name recorded.  I have been in touch with different Departments concerning such cases and I received much help and co-operation.  However, it causes great difficulty when a father wishes to have his name recorded on the birth certificate but the mother does not agree.  This can cause difficulty in hospitals, where 98 per cent of births now occur, if antagonism develops.  While I cannot give the Minister any guidance on this point, a temporary birth certificate could be provided while further inquiries are made about the child's parentage. This would be an alternative to issuing a full and final birth certificate immediately.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing not only this Bill but several others which have been of great importance, including the Still Births Bill.  I also congratulate the Minister's officials on the energy they have put into such legislation.  They may be small Bills which do not appear to be of great importance in the life of the State but they can be so to many people.  One of the most important things we have to do in the House is to see whether we can make small improvements for people, and if we can we should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> I would never denigrate a father's contribution to the procreation of a child but when one thinks of the nine months of pregnancy, plus an average eight hours duration for a first delivery and two hours for second and subsequent deliveries, it is nice to see mothers getting a little more mention on the birth certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Mothers were always rather short changed on the old birth certificates.  Changes in the registration of the child's surname are important because a number of families, even before this provision, have tried to keep the mother's surname within the child's name for emotional or other reasons.  It is good that it is now stated clearly on the registration form that this is perfectly acceptable and possible.</P>
      <P>It is wise that the Minister has decided to include the mother's occupation on the birth certificate.  This is not just because we all like to have whatever career we follow in life noted down as being of equal importance to that of our spouse or the father of the child, but it is also important from a socio-economic viewpoint.  So many assessments of health care, with which I am concerned, are made on this basis.  It can be relevant to know the socio-economic position of the mother as well as the father because, as we have seen in so many sad surveys, those in lower socio-economic groups have less chance of achieving a long and healthy life.  This provision will be important in examining many areas within the life of the nation.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McGennis once again on her advocacy of a better deal for adopted persons and I know she will do anything she can to facilitate such people in acquiring information on their parentage.  While the setting up of a confidential register of adoptions does not come within the Minister's responsiblities, I hope he will encourage its establishment.  Nowadays, many people are trying to find out about their backgrounds and parentage.  I hope the Minister will use his influence to deal with Senator McGennis's concerns which are widespread.  I congratulate him on the energy displayed by his Department in bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it forms part of a series of measures to bring legislation of this kind into the latter half of the 20th century. The preceding Act came into operation in 1863. The Bill was recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used the term &ldquo;quaint&rdquo; as the best description of the old format of certificates. However, I would not use as polite a word as &ldquo;quaint&rdquo;.  When I first realised the title of my occupation was not required on my children's birth certificates and their father's address was the only one to be recorded, I did not believe it quaint; I was extremely insulted.  Many women feel that way when they obtain their children's <Col N="993" /> birth certificates.  When women give birth they are not concerned with points of law; they are more interested in mundane and practical physical matters.  When one reads the child's birth certificate at a later date, however, it is shocking to realise that the mother is not treated with equality.  I fully endorse the Minister's decision to update the legislation but I am surprised previous Governments did not do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he will consider the overall legislation in respect of the registration of births, deaths and marriages and that his Department will carry out a comprehensive review in that regard.  I recently looked at my marriage certificate on which I am described as a &ldquo;spinster&rdquo;.  Women are not particularly happy with the use of such language in this day and age and I hope it will be reconsidered.  My husband is described on the certificate as a &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; which does not seem to have the same connotation as the term &ldquo;spinster&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Mrs. McGennis Mrs. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is somewhat of an imbalance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will examine the use of language when considering the overall legislation.  The detail of the Bill makes sense and, as the Minister stated, it is gender neutral.  In light of the situations in which people now live, it is practical that a father's address is not assumed to be that of a mother. This should be reflected on the register.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator McGennis on the points she continues to raise in respect of adopted children.  There is a strong case to be made for the establishment of a confidential register.  I do not know if this is the Minister's direct responsibility but I know he also feels strongly about it.  I have met adopted persons who encountered specific problems with regard to the issues raised by Senator McGennis.  In instances where medical problems occur, there is a strong case for people being aware of their genetic history.  It is often for this reason that people seek further information.  On many occasions people are asked to produce their birth certificates and, if possible, arrangements should be made for the provision of additional information.  I support what Senator McGennis is attempting to achieve in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an important milestone, although it may not be as significant as other legislation introduced by the Minister.  It is important that women and children are given equality and, for that reason too, I welcome the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on its introduction.  It is a technical measure.  One of the problems I have is that the Minister is introducing separate legislation to deal with particular issues.  While that is a welcome <Col N="994" /> development, I believe the review will identify the need for major changes which will require the introduction of new legislation.  It might have been better had the Minister waited for the findings of the review and introduced compact rather than piecemeal legislation.  In so far as it goes, however, I support the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Registrar General, on the questions which may arise in respect of decisions he might make, will a mechanism be put in place to appeal such decisions and the way in which the office will operate?  The office operates well throughout the regions, however, I have always been interested to know the identity of the Registrar General, the nature of his powers and functions and whether people can appeal his decisions.  Does the Bill make provision in this regard?  As the Bill is a technical measure it is hard to identify where changes are being made without access to the basic legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the position relating to section 6, which proposes the amendment of the Defence and Garda Síochána Acts?  There must be a technical reason for this and perhaps the Minister will provide an explanation in that regard.  I am surprised changes to Defence legislation are incorporated in the Bill but I am sure there is a genuine reason for that.</P>
      <P>The Bill is desirable and welcome but I wonder whether it will become difficult to identify certain people in the future.  One of my relatives, who lives overseas, recently applied for an Irish passport but was obliged to go through the formality of obtaining a birth certificate and the mother's birth and marriage certificates to establish nationality.  I am concerned that the new arrangements will make it more difficult for people living abroad, who apply for Irish passports, to trace their relatives.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the Bill proposes any changes to long and short certificates and baptismal certificates?  I could never explain the difference between them to my constituents.  Are there any proposals to rationalise such certificates and introduce a single form so that people will know what is acceptable? The Minister is aware that, in some circumstances, long certificates are required while, in others, the short form suffices.  I am not sure that the Bill makes provision to change that or whether it is intended to do so.  I compliment the Minster for introducing the Bill which will update the legislation and bring 19th century procedures into the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  There is very little one can say when one is the final speaker on a short Bill.  Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of marriages and stated that women dislike being called &ldquo;spinsters&rdquo;.  In my former occupation I wrote down &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; or &ldquo;spinster&rdquo;, &ldquo;widow&rdquo; or &ldquo;widower&rdquo; because they were the only terms available under the legislation for classifying marital status.  A number of women took exception to this, arguing <Col N="995" /> they were not spinsters.  I had to explain to them that was their position prior to the marriage ceremony.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is extraordinary that the surname of the child was not included on the previous certificate.  That will be rectified by this Bill which will remove any discrimination in relation to the registration of births.</P>
      <P>I have always found it difficult to understand why the father's occupation was entered on the birth certificate.  We will now have both the father's and the mother's occupation shown. However, if both of them are unemployed and this is quite common these days, does the child have to live with a certificate which classifies its parents as unemployed for the rest of its life?  Will the Minister indicate if this can be amended at a future date?</P>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the issue of the short certificate.  This is an important point because many people accept the short certificate having regard to the cost of the long certificate. Certificates are costly and perhaps the Minister would tell the House how much a long certificate costs?  I am anxious that the short certificate be available because there are times when people cannot afford the long one.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister shed some light on section 1(3) where a surname other than that of the parents can be used if both parents request it.  Is the consent of the third person required before his or her name can appear on the certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has provoked a wide ranging and positive debate and I am grateful to Senators for their constructive and co-operative approach. The Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act, 1863, introduced a system of civil registration of births and deaths which came into operation in January 1864.  I have a copy of the first entry in the births register for Dublin south city.  It shows that a child named Stephan was born on 10 January 1864 to Thomas Boylan, a cooper, whose address is given as 2 St. James's Terrace, and to Ann Boylan whose maiden name was Mara.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the format since that birth was recorded.  Despite all the changes in society in the past 130 years the birth certificate of a child born today is the same as that of the child born in 1864.  Senators will agree a change in that format is long overdue.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people rightly react with disbelief and outrage when they discover their child's birth must be registered in this format.  It does not lessen their annoyance when they are informed this is a statutory requirement and the relevant Act is more than 130 years old.  The particulars recorded in the Register of Births should reflect the realities of our society and the position of women in that society.  The birth certificate we have at present is discriminatory and outmoded. <Col N="996" /> The certificate which will be put in place by this Bill is gender neutral and recognises the diversity of modern life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis raised the question of people who have been adopted obtaining their birth certificates.  The Senator tabled an amendment and I am sorry it has been disallowed.  However, every person has the right to obtain an official copy of anybody's birth certificate provided they have the necessary data to identify the birth concerned.  This information is probably not yet on computer and that is part of the problem which will be included in the overall review.  I assure Senators that I appreciate the need for a review of the entire registration system of births, marriages and deaths.  However, I caution Senators that it is an extensive operation which will take some time to complete. It is extraordinarily complex and involves quite a number of statutes, most of which date from the last century.  I could have left the main thrust of this Bill until that review was completed but I decided this matter was of such importance that it warranted special attention, particularly since we have already addressed the form of the birth certificate in the Stillbirths Registration Bill.  The form we are using here is based on that Bill.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the problem raised by Senator McGennis and I sympathise with her. However, it is more an issue of identifying and obtaining the necessary information that would enable the birth to be identified.  That is a separate matter which falls under the adoption legislation procedures which are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Senator McGennis also raised the question of paragraph 11 and the recording of baptismal details.  These details are a church matter; they are not a State matter.  We have made provision in the form for that kind of situation.  We do not call it the baptismal name, but the second last item in the schedule to the Bill provides for the forename of the child if added after the registration of birth.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, sets out the procedures involved when an unmarried mother registers the birth of a child.  Section 49 of that Act stipulates that the registrar will enter the father's name at the joint request of the mother and the person acknowledging himself as the father of the child or at the request of the mother on production of a statutory declaration in the prescribed form by the other person acknowledging himself to be the father.  The details are set out in Part 9 to which I refer the Senators interested in that subject.  This Bill will not alter that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly raised section 6 where different forms are prescribed for defence and Garda personnel.  These are now being standardised and the same form will be used in all registration, whether arising under the normal births registration legislation or under the Defence or Garda system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Senator Doyle raised the question of occupation.  The record of the person's occupation is important socio-economic data and can be useful for tracing a person who may seek a particular certificate.  I am not sure that where the person is unemployed this necessarily means his or her profession may not be stated.  For example, if a person is a plumber he may be unemployed but is still a plumber.  I do not see that the fact that the person is unemployed in any way precludes him from stating his occupation on that form.  I may be wrong about that.  A plumber is a plumber whether he happens to have work as a plumber at that time.  I know on some occasions one does see the description &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; entered but I am not sure that is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about long and short birth certificates.  The long certificate is an exact copy of the entry in the register of births and is needed for instance, to obtain a passport.  It is not necessary for other purposes and the shorter form, derived from the details in the register suffices.  This form can be varied by regulation and any necessary adjustment will be made by the Minister of Health.  The short form is adequate, for example in legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly inquired about the Registrar General.  The Secretary of the Department of Health is <i>ex-officio</i> the Registrar General.  There is no statutory provision for appeals on his decisions.  The normal procedure of judicial review of his decisions is availed of on occasion. Whether an appeals procedure should be provided for is an interesting question.  This will be examined as part of the overall review of the entire registration system.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the questions raised by Senators.  If there are more specific questions, they can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by one of my officials that the regulations provide that if the person is unemployed, it must be stated on the registration form.  I will examine this in the context of the overall review as I have doubts about it.</P>

If I know someone's name and date of birth I can get his birth certificate.  I can get anybody's birth certificate provided I can identify it.  I can open the register of births and say I want copies of certain certificates, as long as I am prepared to pay the fee.  There is no restriction.

If I walk in and ask for a copy of my birth certificate, which I have done, I can get it but only if I trick the unfortunate official behind the counter.  If I walk into the registry of births, marriages and deaths, tell the official I am adopted and ask for a copy of my birth certificate, the official will send me to a different section where I will receive my certificate of adoption. Correspondence I have received from different groups suggests that if a person tells officials at the registry of births, marriages and deaths he or she is adopted that person will be told he or she is not eligible to receive a copy of his or her birth certificate.  However, I accept that what I want to achieve is not achievable here.</P>

Could the <Col N="1000" /> Minister clarify for me whether this re-registration is simply to do with the legislation the Minister mentioned about legitimacy and status of children or is it now possible for any aggrieved mother to re-register her children's birth in the new format?

In regard to birth certificates &mdash; I do not want to discuss marriage or death certificates as we are not involved with those here &mdash; re-registration arises in two circumstances.  It arises under legitimation legislation or to name the father under the status of children legislation. Those are the only two cases where re-registration comes into play.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The marriage ceremony which the priest conducts is also a church ceremony.  The names recorded on the marriage certificate will be those names which are given.  Whether those names tally exactly with what happens to be on the birth certificate is a separate issue.  The person's name is the name that person is known by.  Church forms have no relevance to the State system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to begin a debate about marriage certificates as we are dealing with birth certificates here.  The priest is given the names of the couple he is marrying.  He may take that from the birth or the baptismal certificate. Whatever names are given will find their way in due course onto the State marriage certificate. The names on that person's official birth certificate may or may not be different.  The end result of that can be that a person's birth certificate shows a different name from that on their marriage certificate.  It is a not a desirable situation but it may happen.</P>

      <P>The registrar should be a person other than the secretary of a Department.  In addition, there should be an office of the registrar under the Minister's jurisdiction.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter today.  I also congratulate him and his Department on the write up it received in the weekend section of the <i>Financial Times</i> on 30 November.  A commentator, Joe Rogeley, referred to the remark Douglas Hurd made when he was British Foreign Secretary that the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs punched above its weight, which I gather is a very good thing to say in boxing terms.  Very kind words were said about the Department in the <i>Financial Times.</i>  I am raising this matter in view of the fact that the Department is taken so seriously and that we hold the EU Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was well established by the United Nations Security Council that rape and the detention of women for the purposes of rape occurred on a massive scale in the former Yugoslavia.  It was organised systematically and used as an instrument of war.  These violations were perpetrated in three broad categories: first, <Col N="1004" /> soldiers entering villages and towns as part of the war and raping the female inhabitants during the course of the conquering of that village or town &mdash; it is in this context that houses were established where women were kept as a sexual resource for soldiers, often of high rank; second, soldiers acting under orders to rape women as part of the war strategy &mdash; this particularly occurred against Muslim women; and three, the setting up of rape camps where hundreds of women were kept in inhuman conditions solely or mainly as sexual fodder for soldiers.  When the conflict was in full swing limited information was available to the rest of the world about what was happening to these women.  However, since then an amazing amount of information has come out.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State is aware, members of the Lawyers' International Forum for Women's Human Rights visited Ireland this week.  It is a compliment to this country that they said they realised we took the complaints made to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia very seriously.  They were most anxious we would use the end of our Presidency of the European Union to press for justice for the women who were raped during the atrocities in that country in recent years.  We showed our commitment in a practical way by training counsellors for these victims in the rape crisis centre in Dublin and by sending representatives from the centre to Bosnia to set up centres there.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia came into being in response to the enormity of the human rights violations in the region.  Its stated aim was to put an end to such crimes and to bring to justice the persons responsible.  For the first time, rape was to be prosecuted as a war crime and soldiers would not enjoy immunity.  The prosecutor's office has stated its commitment to public recognition of the role of sexual violence against women during the war in Bosnia.  The new chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, has emphasised this will also apply to the Rwanda trials.</P>
    <P>However, as the Minister of State knows, progress on prosecuting those who raped the women of the former Yugoslavia is non existent. Nobody has been arrested, never mind charged. The lack of progress is appalling.  Many of the alleged rapists live side by side with the victims. Many of the men hold positions of power in local government.</P>
    <P>I have information here on many of those men. I will not read out the names but it is horrific that those who are apparently being sought for these crimes were described in information supplied at the end of November as &ldquo;frequents Express restaurant in Prijedor&rdquo;, &ldquo;commanded an HVO brigade in Vitez in 1993 and is still there&rdquo;, &ldquo;chief of police in Foca&rdquo;, &ldquo;seen by a journalist at a Foca café while French soldiers from IFOR were <Col N="1005" /> nearby&rdquo;, &ldquo;interviewed in his apartment in Bijeljina&rdquo;, &ldquo;works as a labour inspector for the federation government at a desk in the town hall in Vitez&rdquo;, &ldquo;said to have connections with special police in Ljubia&rdquo;, &ldquo;numerous reports have him living in Zagreb&rdquo; and a journalist said at an IFOR press briefing that he knew the address of such a man.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of these reports and can imagine how appalling it must be for those women to have seen those men but nothing happens.</P>
    <P>Despite the obvious presence of these men, women would be prepared to testify against them but there is totally inadequate protection for them as witnesses.  Provision exists for various forms of protection but the anonymity of witnesses is not guaranteed.  The women are not just fearful for themselves but also for their families.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has addressed this to a certain extent by adopting procedures which avoid the worse manifestations of rape trials in some national legal systems.  For instance, there is no requirement for corroboration, the use of a woman's previous sexual history as evidence is prohibited and there is an assumption against the use of consent as a defence.  The tribunal has recognised that rape demands special trial procedures.  During the proceedings against Dusko Tadic, the court recognised that &ldquo;rape and sexual assault often have particularly devastating consequences which in certain circumstances have a permanent and detrimental effect on the victim&rdquo;.  It said this gave grounds for &ldquo;limited rights of due process and more lenient rules of evidence&rdquo;.  The tribunal should proceed accordingly in these cases.</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of the lack of progress is that the women see the men they accuse of raping them leading normal lives, even though there are warrants out for their arrest.  These war criminals frequent well known restaurants, sometimes with soldiers from IFOR nearby. Some of these men now have bodyguards and no attempt is being made to arrest them.  They are in their original residences and places of work.  I have details of many of these people.</P>
    <P>The Presidency of the EU will now pass to the Netherlands and I feel sure that country will also promote the prosecution of these crimes. However, the lack of practical progress to date leaves one wondering whether the women involved would not be better to look for justice by another route.  The Dayton Agreement has been set up in such a way that all the major UN human rights conventions apply immediately to the former Yugoslavia through the European Convention on Human Rights.  Legal resource centres have been set up in Bosnia with money given by the UN High Commission on Refugees. When they are eventually re-instated, these <Col N="1006" /> resource centres could progress the cases of the women within Bosnia.  In view of the special position of Bosnia under the Dayton agreement, should we encourage women to use the facilities there, such as the international ombudsperson office?  Those who feel their human rights have been violated may complain to that office.  A human rights court with European judges is due to be set up in Bosnia but this has not happened yet.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State for advice because I know he takes the tribunal seriously and any efforts we can make during our Presidency are of great importance.  I will be glad to hear his views on this matter.</P>

We must do everything in our power as public representative and Ministers to pursue it and use every influence we can to achieve the objectives Senator Henry has so eloquently put on the record.  We should be frightened by these terrible events &mdash; degradation of horrendous proportions has taken place in the countries.  One ten year sentence for war crimes was handed down recently but much more needs to be done.</P>
      <P>I reaffirm the Government's commitment to and endorsement of the work of the international tribunal in bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes, including rape, which is now classified as a war crime, in the former Yugoslavia.  Not only must justice be done, minimum standards of accountability must be set if a repetition of barbarities of the kind that took place there is to be avoided.  If the states which formerly made up Yugoslavia expect to join the European family of democratic nations they must put in place procedures to surrender those indicted so that they can be put on trial by the tribunal.  If that does not happen, it may be necessary for the tribunal to try people <i>in absentia</i>, as happened to former members of the Nazi regime, so that we can continue to press for these people to serve whatever sentences the tribunal might decide to hand down.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly supported the establishment of the international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993.  The tribunal, which was established by UN Security Council Resolution No. 827 of 25 May 1993, was a direct response of the international community to the mass murder, indiscriminate slaughter and rape which took place in the former Yugoslavia in the period following 1991.  To date, 74 indictments have been handed down by the tribunal and one person has already been sentenced, as I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dayton Agreement clearly obliges all competent authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina to <Col N="1007" /> comply and co-operate with the orders of the international criminal tribunal &mdash; it is specifically stated in the Annex on constitutional arrangements for Bosnia-Herzegovina that this should happen.  Also, under the Constitution, any person who has been indicted by the tribunal is prohibited from holding public office or standing for election.</P>
    <P>In line with its broad approach on this issue, the Government has supported efforts to ensure the effectiveness of the work of the tribunal.  For example, when agreement could not be reached initially at the UN on its financing, Ireland was one of a small number of countries which made a voluntary contribution of £15,000 in 1994 to its upkeep.  Following agreement at the UN General Assembly on its financing, Ireland has to date paid its assessed contributions in full and on time. Recently, Ireland made a further voluntary contribution of US$100,000 to the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Yesterday there was a meeting of the peace implementation council in London, attended by the Tánaiste and myself.  As holders of the European Presidency and on behalf of Ireland, we made it clear that we strongly supported the work of the tribunal.  The tribunal had an observer at the meeting where there was strong support for advancing its work in any way possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation within Ireland of the provisions of the UN Security Council Resolution relating to the tribunal, my Department is maintaining close contact with the Department of Justice, which has the primary responsibility for any steps which may be necessary.  I assure Senators that the Irish Government will do everything in its power to pursue the issue Senator Henry has so clearly illustrated.  The concerns she expressed are shared by the Government and our EU partners.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties is that we do not have available to us either a police force or an army with the capacity to go in, arrest the people concerned, and take them to another jurisdiction for trial.  We, therefore, depend on the cooperation of the former Yugoslav states.  As I said, we may have to resort to trying these people <i>in absentia</i>, as happened to former Nazi offenders and, I think, in Nuremberg.  Many of the former Yugoslav states are seeking to develop relations with the Council of Europe and the EU.  If they expect to be accepted into the democratic family of European states, we expect that they will co-operate fully in making indicted persons available to stand trial.  No one is guilty until they are tried and have an opportunity to defend themselves, so I do not understand why these states should have any difficulty producing indicted persons for trial. If these people are innocent, they have nothing <Col N="1008" /> to fear because the tribunal operates under rules of justice which are clear and in no doubt.  I assure the Senator that we will raise this issue in any way we can, either through our Presidency or in the normal way through the EU.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. While it is flattering it is also worrying that those involved in these cases feel that Ireland is one of the countries taking the matter seriously.  The Minister said that all our European partners say they are taking this seriously but many people hope that the smaller European countries such as ourselves maintain the initiative in this matter.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to alarm the public but I raise this matter because of a number of articles, radio programmes and a television programme which highlighted MRSA, generally known as the &ldquo;superbug&rdquo;, in hospitals in Ireland and England.  I want to establish how prevalent the bug is in our hospitals and if it is an issue that has been or is being dealt with by the Department of Health.  Has the Department carried out any survey or investigations or had discussions with those in charge of hospitals?  My understanding is that the bug is not treatable with existing antibiotics.  There is a view that it may be in our hospitals but they are not prepared to admit it because they are not in a position to treat it and they would not want the public to know that such a situation prevailed.  However, the public should know.  In the past information was withheld from the public.  It is now becoming more apparent that information on BSE and CJD was available many years ago before the public knew about it.  The public did not know about hepatitis C until late in the day.</P>
      <P>The media has brought this issue into the public domain.  The Department of Health and the Minister have a duty and responsibility to explain to the public the circumstances and prevalence of MRSA in hospitals.  The public has become sceptical about Departments and Government.  If the bug exists in our hospitals, I do not want to see a cover up; I want information provided to the public.  I have no doubt the Minister is aware of this but I have not read any statements or publications from the Department of the Health on this matter and it is time we had them.  I hope the Minister will give a broad statement of the facts on MRSA, or the &ldquo;superbug&rdquo; as it is known in our hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for sharing his time and I congratulate him for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a short contribution in support of the case the Senator has put forward.  As he pointed out, MRSA has received considerable publicity in the media, particularly on radio, in recent weeks.  This publicity, combined with the experiences outlined by various listeners who called to the radio programme, has raised considerable fears among the general public as regards the risks of infection for hospital patients.  It is important for the public, the patients and their relatives that these fears are allayed.  There is a great deal of stress and worry associated with hospitalisation and this can be further exacerbated by fears of infection.</P>
      <P>I understand that Ireland is one of the few EU countries which has not put in place a national surveillance unit to monitor the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals and that only a minority of hospitals have an infection control officer or nurse or specially designated infection unit.  Was there a recommendation some time ago from a Department of Health committee that such a national surveillance unit be established?  Will the Minister outline what data the Department has on the incidence of MRSA in hospitals and to what extent the existence of this problem in hospitals is an obstacle to the delivery of services? It would be helpful if we knew what steps are proposed by the Department to ascertain the full extent of this problem in hospitals and what safeguards it proposes to put in place to mitigate the problem.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and for providing this opportunity to discuss the measures which have been put in place by my Department to control and reduce the prevalence of methicillin-resistant <i>staphylococcus aureus</i> or MRSA on a nationwide basis.  The emergence worldwide of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria over the last 20 years, has become one of the most serious threats to the control and successful treatment of infection. MRSA is the commonest of these bacteria encountered in this country and the development of measures to ensure its control has been a major priority both for individual hospitals and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been anxious to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to control and reduce the prevalence of MRSA.  In September 1993 a committee comprising representatives from the Department of Health, consultant microbiologists, specialists in public health <Col N="1010" /> medicine, general practice and the Infection Control Nurses Association was established to identify the extent to which MRSA was a problem in the Irish health system and to establish priorities for its control.  A national survey of the prevalence of MRSA was carried out to assess the extent of the problem and the committee also recommended a comprehensive set of guidelines covering procedures for the management of MRSA in acute hospitals and other health care settings.  The committee also produced guidelines and information for patients and health care staff.</P>
    <P>These national guidelines were endorsed by a wide range of professional bodies involved in the control of MRSA and I was happy to publish the guidelines last year.  The guidelines have been widely circulated throughout the country giving invaluable advice on preventing the spread of MRSA.  These guidelines are an important step in promoting awareness of MRSA and the measures for its control and will ensure an even safer environment for the care of the sick both in the hospital and community.</P>
    <P>While the survey already carried out serves as an important baseline for assessing the effectiveness of the guidelines, I am also committed to ensuring that future trends in the prevalence of MRSA continue to be closely monitored.  The establishment of a national disease surveillance unit is currently being considered and the faculties of pathology and public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland have submitted to the Department of Health a consensus proposal drawn up by a group representing the various professional organisations with a particular interest in the area.  This proposal envisages a national surveillance mechanism which would build on the reporting systems which have been developed in some regions, and which would assist in the control of all communicable diseases, including hospital acquired infections such as MRSA.</P>
    <P>Hospital acquired infection, including MRSA, is a potential indicator of quality of care and I would like to reassure Senators of my continuing commitment to addressing this issue in the context of my Department's strategy for effective health care in the 1990s &mdash;&ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;&mdash; which has emphasised quality of service as one of its key principles.  Much has already been achieved to address the challenges presented by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA.  I am confident that widespread awareness of the guidelines for its control and the development of surveillance systems will prove to be valuable weapons in the fight to make our hospitals as safe as possible an environment for the care of the sick.</P>

      <P>The problem is that I am as <Col N="1011" /> much in the dark after the Minister's statement as I was before I came into the House.  We still do not have the information.  I do not know how many people or hospitals are involved and that is the great worry among the public.  It is a matter <Col N="1012" /> that cannot be left as it is.  We want more information and the Department should provide it.</P>
