	<P Just="Left">I have notice from Senator David Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to intervene at the highest level of the United Nations on behalf of the Roma refugees in Kosovo in the village of Zikovac whose lives are being threatened by toxic waste deposits.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to address the backlog of applications, from people who have recently lost their jobs, for social welfare supports in County Donegal, which has left many of them without any social welfare supports for periods up to and over two months.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to give the up-to-date position on funding that was made available some years ago for the refurbishment of the community swimming pool in Dunmanway, County Cork, and if he will advise whether this funding is still available.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to examine the potential to link PRSI contributions in the UK with those made in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Doherty and O&rsquo;Donovan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Today there are some pertinent questions on the minds of people as they heard in recent weeks and at the weekend about the spending of taxpayers&rsquo; money on excessive and luxury items such as in regard to F&Aacute;S.  The question that is on people&rsquo;s lips is how many other State agencies are in the same position and what was the Government&rsquo;s role in all of that?</P>
        <P>We see those items being referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, but where was the Government oversight on F&Aacute;S with its budget of &euro;1 billion per year, &euro;10 billion in the past ten years?  That raises serious questions about the competence of Government to oversee the many agencies under its control.  It is disquieting because what we are seeing, essentially, is frontline services being cut back and the scrapping of the cervical cancer vaccine programme.  Six women&rsquo;s lives could have been saved with just travel expenses alone that have been spent by F&Aacute;S.  It is not necessarily about focusing on one man; this is about accountability from State agencies and the role of Government and Ministers in managing those agencies.  It seems they have taken their eye off the ball regarding accountability, transparency and the management of these organisations.  We are being told the cutbacks are necessary, yet we see this amount of waste.  This is why Fine Gael has focused so much on the issue of reform and obtaining value for money.  This is as pertinent today as it ever has been given the exposure in recent days of excessive spending.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to debate this topic?  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in order that we can have a real debate in the House on the topic of the day and on the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal.  My colleague, Senator Shane Ross, has done excellent work on the issue.</P>
        <P>In the past three or four weeks, I have asked constantly for a debate on the economy.  The House will have to vote on this from now on.  The Leader promised three or four weeks ago that there would be no problem with having such a debate and that we should have one regularly.  I also called for a debate on education, including the aspects of education touched on by the budget.  Other issues require to be debated, including the equality structures of the State and how the measures in this regard are implemented.  These issues need to be addressed.  The Leader committed to doing so and I ask him to deliver in this regard.</P>
        <P>Since I became a Member, every Government has produced legislation in reaction to some major news item of the day.  A Fine Gael Government introduced legislation to criminalise people who allow their horses to wander and Fianna F&aacute;il introduced legislation to criminalise people who take out in public certain breeds of dogs without a muzzle, all in response to newspaper articles.  The closest equivalent we have had recently is the legislation on pistols and pistol shooting.  People with handguns in this country must surmount a most intense set of barriers in order to be allowed obtain a pistol licence.  They do not shoot animals or birds but at targets and they are reasonable, sensible and secure people.  No evidence has ever been presented showing that legally held  handguns have ever been used in crimes.  There is plenty of evidence to suggest that legally held shotguns have been stolen regularly from their owners and used in crimes.  The introduction of the legislation on handguns is simply a reactionary move.  It is not fair on those who are involved in a sport that does no harm to anybody, who are absolutely secure, sensible and dependable and who take every single step to ensure they <Col N="363"/>act carefully and in line with the law of the land.  They are in constant contact with the security people and the Garda in this regard.  I ask the Government to rethink the introduction of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Are Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the rest of us wasting our breath asking the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy?  We keep doing so but, as a child might say, &ldquo;It keeps not happening.&rdquo;  Is there any point in our seeking it?  Will the Leader address this, thus saving ourselves the trouble on the Order of Business of seeking a debate on the economy, about which everybody is talking?  I have just come from addressing a group of school students on the south side of the city.  They all want to talk about the economy and the recession and what Governments and politicians are doing about it, yet we cannot have a debate thereon in the House.  We were supposed to have a rolling debate.  What is a rolling debate?  In any event, it is what we were promised two or three weeks ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is rolling yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It certainly has not started rolling yet.  Are we to have such a debate in the House or should we just give up on the idea?</P>
        <P>Tomorrow the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are to announce a programme of significant public sector reform.  I welcome this and ask the Leader to arrange a debate on it.  I welcome the programme for two reasons, the first of which is that no reasonable person could object to a serious programme of reform in the public sector.  The second reason I welcome it is that I hope it will put an end to the phony debate on the public service.  Very often, including in this House, people make statements about the public service that are long on rhetoric and short on specifics.  This will give us the opportunity and will provide the context for Members on both sides of the House to explain what they mean by public service reform.  Public service reform is a fantastic phrase, like motherhood and apple pie.  What do people mean by it?  Where do they wish to see the cuts and the redundancies?  Do they wish to see redundancies?</P>
        <P>We might consider any particular service that is provided for the people.  In this House, Members are constantly calling for improvements and expansions to services and opposing the abolition of different agencies and services.  As politicians, we must face up to the fact that if staff numbers are reduced efficiencies can, of course, be brought about and it is good that such might be done.  However, very often, when staff is reduced the service is reduced.  It is not as simple as that but that is very often the outcome.  Fewer staff means a service that is not as good for the public.  Let us face up to that and let us all, on both sides of the House, face up to the fact that it is not good enough to come in here and make rhetorical snipes at the public service and public servants without being specific, by which I mean giving examples.</P>
        <P>I welcome another aspect of the announcement that apparently will be made tomorrow, namely, that the Government feels it must take time to see which posts can be amalgamated, which ones should be abolished and, as a consequence, which services must be removed.  It will take time.  In the event of such a debate, I call on all my colleagues to be specific about what they mean, to be clear and to face up to the fact that if staff numbers are reduced very often service is lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with what Senator White said.  We need a debate about the public service and about the specifics.  I do not necessarily agree with him that more means better.  What we must prove is that one can have a better service with fewer numbers.  We should be able to get that.  Nor do I agree with Senator White that the House has had umpteen calls for an economics debate.  There have been umpteen economics debates.  Just because <Col N="364"/>Senator White has not been present for them does not mean they do not happen.  They have happened time and again.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, there is a convention in this House, as was pointed out to me, in respect of referring to people who are or are not in the House at any particular time.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley is wrong.  When there are debates on the economy and on financial matters, I am here, and I have contributed to them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Today marks the beginning of 16 days of focus on violence against women, which are intended to highlight what happens internationally.  An Irish plan was launched today on work towards the elimination of female genital mutilation.  A good conference took place this morning on dealing with this issue.  It is important that we discuss, particularly in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the issue of domestic violence and I call for a debate on this matter.  It is unfortunate that only in times like this, when there are to be 16 days of concentration on violence against women, the question of domestic violence and gender-based violence against women gets a focus.  I would not like this period to go without having it marked by a debate in the Seanad on domestic violence in general and all gender-based violence against women.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the economy.  As regards the decision by Dublin City Council to increase rates, the Lord Mayor of Dublin has adopted the Fianna F&aacute;il Party mantra of calling on people to be patriotic when the Republic&rsquo;s VAT rate is being increased by 0.5% while the rate in the North is being decreased by 2.5%.  A bottle of whiskey is already &euro;14 cheaper in the North.  People are trying to spread their money as far as possible and cannot be blamed for seeking best value and the best return for their money.  The Government is failing dramatically to reduce prices and to encourage businesses, especially smaller enterprises.  Statistics published in recent days reveal the extent of job losses in the small business sector.  I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate with the Minister to discuss this serious issue.</P>
        <P>I also call on Fianna F&aacute;il led councils not to increase commercial rates.  Like the Leader, I am elected to represent the whole country.  I ask him to show leadership in this area because he is aware of the importance of the issue.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comments on the serious issue of violence in the home.  One in six Irish women has been abused by a current or former partner.  It is shocking that this abuse takes place behind closed doors and that women must suffer in this manner without recourse, especially in rural areas where people find it much more difficult to report this serious crime.  I call for an urgent debate on the matter in the House with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  As with other Senators, I have asked without success for a number of Ministers to come before the House.  Contrary to what Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s believes, I have been present for debates.</P>
        <P>A serious road traffic accident took place on a particularly bad regional road in County Westmeath this morning.  I extend my sympathy to the poor, unfortunate family of the lady who lost her life in the incident.  The Oireachtas must take a decision to upgrade the road in question, which has been an issue for a long time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The upgrading of roads is a matter for local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am appealing to the Leader, my County Westmeath colleague, Senator Cassidy. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>On the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald, I have no doubt the issue of expenses in F&Aacute;S will be dealt with in a professional and accountable manner and a report will issue in due course, which is exactly what should happen.  However it is also important that we do not allow this case to misrepresent or distract from the wonderful work F&Aacute;S has done.  There is not a part of the county which has not benefited in some manner from its work.  Thousands of people would be willing to attest that F&Aacute;S training gave them access to lucrative careers.  Every time a factory closes the first port of call locally is to request that <Col N="366"/>F&Aacute;S fill the gap.  The organisation retrains people, helps raise morale and has availed of many opportunities to assist and sustain local amenities. </P>
        <P>I have often heard that F&Aacute;S staff, from the top of the organisation to the bottom, are pragmatic and that F&Aacute;S is less bureaucratic than other bodies.  We have, through F&Aacute;S, given communities ownership of hundreds of thousands of projects.  One can see the organisation&rsquo;s mark wherever one goes in Ireland and we need it more than ever.  With significant unemployment coming down the track, retraining and lifting of morale will be necessary.  I hope the current debate does not have the effect of demoralising staff at F&Aacute;S before all the facts are available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy, which is well overdue.  I am not anything of an economist, but even I am concerned when there are reports in the newspapers to the effect that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is to approach some banking friends with a view to a dig-out and that these include J. C. Flowers, Carlyle and so on, with their associations to the Bush family, Mr. bin Laden&rsquo;s close relatives and so on.  If these people are to come in and do a Tony O&rsquo;Reilly on it, as he did with Eircom, the Irish taxpayer should be given a shot at it.  If they are going to be able to get in and out within five years and make enormous profits, why do we not do it?  That would be a useful employment of the pension funds.  We should make a profit out of our own industry and kick the banks, if that is needed. </P>
        <P>I also believe that we need a debate on the economy.  As a simple person, I am astonished at the way matters are being managed.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer is reducing VAT while simultaneously we are putting it up.  To add what Margaret Thatcher would have called the triple whammy, Dublin Corporation is shoving 3.5% on to the rates for businesses in central Dublin.  That should make a happy Christmas for everybody.  I notice there is a secular Christmas tree &mdash; there is no sign of a crib &mdash; sponsored by the Dublin City Centre Business Association.  I doubt if its members will have such a happy Christmas, as might have been envisaged.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Labr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in regard to F&Aacute;S.  The reports are disturbing and at a time of severe economic retrenchment it is provocative and aggravating to see the apparently exotic lifestyle of some of these people at the top of F&Aacute;S.  I was not very impressed by the performance of the chief executive, although of course he was in a corner.  He seemed to be trying to maintain two contradictory positions at the same time.  He said one needed to go first class in order to arrive fresh at meetings.  Then he said he did not cost the taxpayer any money because he had downgraded himself, not to economy class but to business class, in order to bring his wife with him at no extra cost to the taxpayer.  He may have arrived comforted by the presence of his spouse, but I doubt whether he was as fresh as he might have been had he travelled solo in first class.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>She would have kept him up all night. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On the other hand, I am among those, as suggested by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who would pay tribute to F&Aacute;S on the basis of my personal experience.  Now is the time, when it is under pressure, to stand up for the foot soldiers in F&Aacute;S.  I have direct personal experience of them and I am not suggesting that anybody here, including my friend, Senator Ross, has impugned them in any sense.  He was very scrupulous about not doing that.  At the James Joyce centre, some years ago, for example, we had a series of F&Aacute;S and community employment schemes.  That was during a period of intense unemployment, up to 80% in my area of the city.  Some 27 young people from that area, thanks to F&Aacute;S, went on to full-time <Col N="367"/>paid employment.  At the moment we have a very distinguished Joycean scholar.  I am not sure whether I am allowed to name him.  Before the Cathaoirleach intervenes I shall just say that his name is Dr. James Quinn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer not.  I do not think the topic of Joycean scholars is relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a real scholar, a PhD, the translator of Fernando Pessoa, a world authority not just on Joyce but on Pessoa, who has made these links between Ireland and Portugal.  Thank God we got him and we would not have done so without F&Aacute;S.  It is absolutely appropriate that excessive lifestyles be examined. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I heard somebody say &mdash; there was a chorus of approval &mdash; that half of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s budget, equivalent to &euro;500 million, should be knocked off.  That seems to be a swingeing cut, particularly as we have abolished the Combat Poverty Agency and mutilated the Equality Authority.  Everything that supports people in a recession is being attacked.  For God&rsquo;s sake do not destroy the body that is supposed to look after people who are coming out of employment.  Reform it and make it efficient, but do not put it out of business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, is on a trade mission this week.  I would be interested in a debate on the economy of Ulster.  We often call for a Northern debate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has a great chance of getting that. </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McFadden talked about a &euro;14 difference in the price of whiskey.  That is one of the keystones of a topic that is very important.  We have had debates on alcohol and I have asked for all-Ireland policies on the pricing of alcohol, which is one matter in which there should be a disparity when we as an island have a problem with alcohol abuse which needs to be addressed.  An all-Ireland approach to issues such as the pricing of alcohol is very important.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There have always been exchanges in terms of people from one side of the Border going to the other.  However, I draw attention to the changes in VAT and exchange rates.  I ask that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, look at the Border areas.  If one is far enough away from the Border there is no impact but in an area such as where I live, where Border towns are closer than larger towns in the county, many businesses have been put under pressure and we should find ways of stimulating the economy in these areas.</P>
        <P>There was an issue with the water quality of bottled water recently.  The food authority did not release its report and therefore all businesses involved in bottling water were tarred with the potential brush of having contaminated water.  One company disclosed that it had a very good record with the quality of its water.  Why would someone who has evidence of contamination not give that information to consumers in the interests of other businesses that are doing things by the book?</P>
        <P>This is linked to the issue of obesity levels.  I again ask that we fast-track the issue of labelling, not only of food products, which are improving in content, but also liquids.  The amount of information on calorie, salt and sugar content in alcohol and soft drinks products is very limited.  We need to look at that in the context of the obesity study released today.</P>
        <P>Regarding F&Aacute;S, as previous speakers said, the budget in place for what F&Aacute;S does best, training those who need to be retrained, must remain the single focus.  Investigations need to <Col N="368"/>be done but the money needs to go where it is best spent, and it is being well spent on very good training programmes.  We will need more and more training in the future, particularly in the coming months and we should not be distracted by what might or might not be proven as a result of reports.  The focus must remain on retraining.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s statement on hand guns.  It is not clear what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is proposing.  He has intimated some restrictions on legally held hand guns and it would be useful if he came into the House and explained precisely what he proposes to do in this area.  The use of hand guns and pistol shooting is a big sport in this country.  It is a distraction and is intended as such by the Minister to focus on the issue of legal hand guns rather than illegal hand guns and the lack of control in confronting gangland crime.  </P>
        <P>On the issue of value for money in Government expenditure, there are lines in the budget of every Department on value for money reviews.  It was formerly known as the expenditure review initiative.  At various times as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen emphasised the issue of value for money.  In a seminal speech I alluded to last week he said that we must have full acceptance of the need to ensure every euro is well spent.  However, when dealing with the head of F&Aacute;S, Mr. Roddy Molloy, who is from Birr in Offaly and is personally known to the Taoiseach, we tear up the rule book and suggest everything is all right, and the Taoiseach says we do not go there.  As is evident from his interview, Mr. Molloy is out of touch when it comes to value for money and use of Government funds.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach, in his unequivocal support, is also out of touch.  On the subject of friends of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach, when we introduced the emergency legislation to deal with the bank crisis, it was emphatically stated by the Minister for Finance and the Government that the issue of the recapitalisation of banks did not arise.  Then it was subject to analysis and it was suggested that when we made a deep dive into the banks, we would know more.  Then, when friends came with a scheme, facilitated by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, it was all urgent, emergency, secret meetings and rumours in the media, with no clear indication to this House or the other as to what is going on.</P>

That is a question for the Leader.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to celebrate two bits of good news this week.  First, I congratulate the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, on showing great courage in calling for a suspension of the current national agreement, which we cannot afford.  Second, I welcome the Government decision to set up what has been wrongly called &ldquo;an bord snip&rdquo;.  It should be called &ldquo;an bord snas&rdquo;.  I do not believe in root and branch and slash and burn reform of the public sector.  We need a bord snas, a polished public service, a lean, mean fighting machine in the great tradition of our public service of the 1930s and 1940s.</P>
        <P>Many here will remember the great short story by Sean O&rsquo;Faolain, <i>The Fur Coat</i>.  In the story, set in the 1930s, the wife of the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister &mdash; it could have been a Fine Gael Minister; it is difficult to tell in the story &mdash; wanted a fur coat for the cold winter and now her husband was a Minister he had the money for it.  She went to Grafton Street for the coat, but came back without it because when she thought of the hard times and what people had to do for Ireland and of those who died for Ireland, she could not take the fur coat.</P>
        <P>We need this old, frugal, wooden boots revolutionary kind of austerity back in our public service at every level, political and otherwise.  I concur with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in his call to be careful when doing the slash and burn.  Senator Ross rightly revealed the bad or down side of public service.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has rightly revealed the good side of the public service.  It is difficult to know how to distinguish between those who deliver a day&rsquo;s work and those who do not, but that is what I hope the new task force will do.  It must make that distinction and for that reason I am glad it has a timeframe and that it is not rushing in and seeking immediate reforms.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, there are clearly some reforms that could be introduced immediately.  The leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, has identified one.  There could be a pause on the national wage agreement.  We cannot afford to pay it.  There could also be a pause on some of the more blatant wastage of public money.  However, anyone who goes to a F&Aacute;S training centre, as I do every January, and walks into the great machine shops and sees local young men and women at the machines, could not doubt that here is a positive, productive and valuable side of the public service.  It is such a productive service that I hope this new force, which I intend to call &ldquo;an bord snas&rdquo;, will find out.  It should promote and reward those who really are public servants and should ask the others to take early retirement.  I will take Senator Alex White&rsquo;s question.  While I do not wish to see anyone losing his or her job, nor do I wish to see people not doing a full day&rsquo;s work.  Such people should be offered early retirement and no more people should be taken into positions in which there is no real work for them to do.</P>

	<P>I am glad that Senators Harris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Norris and others brought up the issue of F&Aacute;S and emphasised that a large number of people and projects in F&Aacute;S are eminently laudable.  The problem is there is an extraordinary disconnect or chasm of difference between those who work on the ground in F&Aacute;S and those at the top who are helping themselves to the most exorbitant largesse, which is completely unjustified.</P>

	<P>This distinction ought to be made.  However, I have been unable to make such a distinction in this House at any length for some time, although I repeatedly have asked for debates on F&Aacute;S here.  While I repeatedly have been given assurances that they will happen, they repeatedly have failed to appear or be granted.</P>
        <P>Particularly in light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement last night, F&Aacute;S, certainly in respect of those at its top, continues to be a protected political species, which is a dangerous position for any semi-State agency to be in.  I deeply regret the Taoiseach&rsquo;s premature decision to defend the chief executive before the Committee of Public Accounts or any other body entrusted with examining F&Aacute;S has made a judgment in this regard.  Fine Gael now has decided to examined this issue seriously, which I welcome.  However, there has been a reluctance for a long time to examine F&Aacute;S and one must ask why.  It is not just a political sacred cow as one will find it to be highly politicised in a party political way.  This is deeply regrettable and it must stop.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The board must be moved on and the social partners and political nominees must be removed.  It must be made into, as Senator Harris stated, a really good lean machine that works in the public service.  At present, it is a bloated sacred cow that must be thinned down.</P>
        <P>I ask one relevant question of the Leader.  Can Members have a debate on F&Aacute;S?  Had Members such a debate when I requested it before the summer, this House would be taking the lead on this issue.  However, as usual Members are following from behind.  If Members have a debate now, it will be too late.</P>
        <P>Members should consider one matter which is of concern to me.  For years, it was not simply the Irish taxpayer who was funding F&Aacute;S to the extent of &euro;1 billion in what constituted unexplained money.  For years, European funds also propped up F&Aacute;S.  Could we consider asking the European Commission whether it would be interested in examining whether those funds were being used properly?  There is a deep issue, in that abusing our own funds is one thing but abusing European funds as well in some ways has far more wide-ranging implications for the nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the debate, if we get it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made in the House today for a number of debates, particularly in respect of F&Aacute;S.  Such a debate must be the widest type possible, particularly as we are entering a time in which there will be increasing job losses and a need to retrain many members of our society.  Members must ask whether F&Aacute;S, as currently structured, is in a position to do so.  Where stand community employment schemes or schemes such as the job initiative?  I worked as a ground level operative with F&Aacute;S for a number of years.</P>
        <P>That said, if Members have the opportunity of having such a debate, which will depend on the availability of the T&aacute;naiste, they cannot avoid the debate on how public money is being expended properly.  I have no fear that the money is being spent properly in community training workshops and community employment schemes.  However, one is learning on a daily basis of an almost bacchanalian looseness regarding public expenditure in the higher echelons of a State agency.  It demands a response from the House in terms of a debate.  Senator Ross is correct in highlighting that other bodies are examining the issue, but we should have a debate.  Since the Committee of Public Accounts is a select committee of the D&aacute;il due to its powers of compellability, Senators, who cannot be members of it, have a responsibility to highlight inconsistencies.</P>
<Col N="371"/>
        <P>I do not share Senator Ross&rsquo;s concern about the European Social Fund.  I am convinced it has been spent efficiently and properly audited in respect of community employment schemes and training workshops.  That said, the stories coming out on a near daily basis demand a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s call for a debate on public sector reform.  Tomorrow&rsquo;s report would be a useful stepping stone for such a debate, but it must be placed in context.  It is not only a matter of cost efficiency in the public sector.  The other side of the coin is the question of whether the public sector is the best it can be, given available resources.  If we approach the issue from both perspectives, many unanswered questions will emerge.  I look forward to the report&rsquo;s publication.</P>

	<P>I agree with those who have raised the need for a debate on F&Aacute;S.  I concur with Senators Fitzgerald, Ross and others on this side.  I accept the points made by many of those on the Government side regarding the importance of the work done by F&Aacute;S, but it seems as if an apology is being made to the effect that, since F&Aacute;S does good and necessary work, questionable practices in the spending of public money are acceptable.</P>
        <P>Community employment schemes operating throughout the country do tremendous work and the apprenticeships run by F&Aacute;S are valuable, but they account for less than half of the body&rsquo;s annual budget.  We are entitled to ask where the other &euro;700 million is being spent.</P>

	<P>The message being conveyed is that, since F&Aacute;S is doing good work, we should not ask questions.  Serious questions have been raised concerning accountability and the money afforded top executives in particular.  We should have a debate as soon as possible.  While Senator Ross has been calling for such for a long time, so has Deputy Varadkar.  My beloved colleague, Deputy Hogan, sought a debate on F&Aacute;S when he was our spokesman on enterprise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised by media reports today to the effect that the PAC has been experiencing difficulties in accessing some of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s accounts on top executives&rsquo; travel expenses.  It is a disgrace.  The House should have a full and frank discussion of the matter as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White, who raised a significant problem for people on the Opposition benches.  Frequently, the Leader agrees with us when we call for specific debates, but they are never held.  Is the Leader finding it difficult to arrange for members of the Cabinet to attend the House to address statements?  Two Bills will be before the House this week, but there would be ample opportunity for statements on major issues.  Since our all-night session on the bank assurance scheme, the Minister for Finance has not appeared in the House.  We should hold a discussion on the recapitalisation of the banks and the Minister should attend it.  We have not debated education with the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, since the budget cuts.  While the Leader probably agrees, is there a difficulty in arranging for some of the people in question to attend the Chamber to address thorny issues?  We should discuss them as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issues of social partnership and the national wage agreement, which relate to F&Aacute;S, given that its board and the boards of many organisations are based on social partnership.</P>
<Col N="372"/>
        <P>From a Fine Gael perspective and in political terms, it may be difficult to raise this matter, but most people, even those within the public service, admit that we cannot afford the new national wage agreement.  We have reached the point in the economic development of the country where we will be obliged to conduct a serious reform of the public service.  In the past, I referred to a number of reforms that should take place.  The obvious and primary example in this regard is the health service.  Particular economies should have been achieved as a result of the amalgamation of the old health boards into the HSE.  However, these never came about.  There are examples within other Departments and in other areas where such economies must be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>We should debate this matter.  As far as I am aware, the House has not discussed the new national wage agreement since it was arrived at by the social partners.  The Seanad would be a suitable forum in which to debate that agreement.</P>

        <P>On the issue of handguns, Senator Regan was somewhat disingenuous in his comments with regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The force did a wonderful job in the context of Operation Anvil and showed great determination to deal with the issue of illegally held handguns.</P>

	<P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Fachtna Murphy and his colleagues on their success in coping with the difficult task they undertook when carrying out Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Harris&rsquo;s comments in respect of Senator Regan&rsquo;s remarks on the financial institutions.  I put it to Senator Regan that the financial markets have completely changed in the weeks since the Government introduced the initial bail-out for the banks.  Before making any further remarks similar to those he made earlier, perhaps the Senator should discuss these matters with those employed by the financial institutions in order to ensure that what he says is correct.  What he stated was completely off the wall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Regan engaged in taking something of a cheap shot at a former Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon handed down an interesting judgment in a case where the HSE and the Information Commissioner challenged each other on matters relating to disclosures under the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  The sections in respect of which these challenges were made are section 26, which relates to exemptions in respect of matters of confidence,  and section 28, which relates to exemptions with regard to personal information.  Will the Leader seek clarification on the impact of the judgment to which I refer and on whether there might be a need to review the terms of the 1997 Act.</P>
        <P>There was yet another fatality earlier today as a result of a road traffic accident.  Last weekend a number of people were killed on the roads.  In certain other countries motorists are obliged to change the tyres on their vehicles at this time of year as a result of changing weather conditions.  Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Transport two issues which I believe to be factors in road accidents?  I refer to the condition of tyres on motor vehicles and to driver <Col N="373"/>fatigue.  Will the Leader inquire of the Minister the promotional campaigns that might be undertaken to highlight these matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader indicate why the House has not engaged in debates on the economy, on the increase in unemployment or on the cutbacks in education that were announced in the budget?  I was asked questions on two of those three matters by 15 year old students of a school which I visited yesterday as part of the Oireachtas education programme.  Perhaps the Leader will explain the reasons the Ministers have not come into the House.</P>
        <P>I have great respect for Senator Harris, who is a man I admire greatly.  However, I am a little tired of people criticising Senator Regan who today asked a fundamental question which I too wish to put to the Leader, namely, does he and Members opposite believe it is correct that the former Taoiseach is interfering in Government business at a time that is most critical to the banking sector?  Is that correct?  Is the former Taoiseach trying to be former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in driving from the back seat?</P>

	<P>I have asked three pertinent questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the crisis facing us nationally and internationally, every Member of the Oireachtas is obliged to assist in any way he or she can.  If that happens to be a former Taoiseach, all the better.  I know that all the Members on this side of the House, and all those whom I know and am friendly with on the opposite side of the House, are doing and will do everything they can to ensure we overcome the many challenges facing us.  I am not <Col N="374"/>aware that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is assisting the Government in that matter, but if he is, I welcome that.  </P>
        <P>I ask that the Leader provide for an urgent debate on the seven Border counties.  As I am sure many people are aware, there are significant difficulties in that area from a retail perspective.  Thousands of people are employed in the Irish indigenous retail sector throughout those counties.  I have grave concerns in regard to the number of people crossing the Border, granted to get value for money.  We must do all we can to ensure they get value for money this side of the Border.  In this regard &mdash; I do not know whether this is appropriate but I will ask anyway &mdash; will the Leader, on behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, issue a letter to all multiples, whether of the UK or otherwise, with outlets in both jurisdictions, namely, on the southern and the northern sides of the Border, requesting that they ensure their prices, notwithstanding the currency differential, are at least comparable.</P>
        <P>It was recently stated by a UK multiple that the Irish are prepared to pay more, but we are not.  As a House of the Oireachtas, we should write to all UK and Irish multiples with outlets on both sides of the Border stating that we expect them to at least ensure their prices are comparable, notwithstanding VAT and currency differences.  In that regard, I ask that the Leader bring to the urgent attention of the Minister for Finance and, if necessary, the Taoiseach the announcement this morning in the UK regarding a further reduction in its VAT levels.  This is an enormous issue in terms of Border counties, in particular in regard to people going there to purchase alcohol, which they will.</P>
        <P>I am aware it is against European law to do so, but we should be promoting Irish products with a buy Irish campaign and asking people to support their local sheriff.  I accept we have an obligation to ensure our retailers give the best possible value for money, but we also have a responsibility to be patriotic and to look after our own.  While we cannot, as a Government or an Oireachtas, put up banners saying &ldquo;Give a job, buy Irish&rdquo; as occurred in the 1980s, there is nothing to stop us as individuals encouraging it, and I certainly will do so.</P>
        <P>I conclude by doing what I have promised to do each week until I get something other than a rhetorical reply.  I refer to the discrimination against the people of the north-west region.  I have again watched the well-produced advertisement on the television promoting BreastCheck for everybody except the people of the north west.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Harris suggested we should be more positive.  One particular piece of news in today&rsquo;s newspapers is very positive and full of opportunity, which is that Dublin has been selected to host the European city of science meeting in 2012.  This will be a great opportunity.  I know something about the chief scientific adviser to the Government who chaired a committee that put this together.  Dublin beat a number of other cities, including Vienna.  I want the Government to support this wholeheartedly, as it has done up to now.  However, under the constraints of what could happen in the years ahead, it might just weaken that support.  This is a great opportunity for Ireland, not just in the tourists that will come for the event in 2012, but also in allowing us to build our economy in the future on science and technology.  We have never had an opportunity like this for the world to focus attention on this case.  The professionalism of the team that won this event for Ireland needs to be supported.</P>
        <P>Another opportunity is represented by the report that 900 deaths a year in Ireland could be avoided if we ate less salt, which is a dramatic figure about which the Government can do something.  We can publicise that if people want to live longer and avoid high blood pressure and heart attacks, they should reduce their salt intake.  The figure given was that a reduction of half a teaspoon of salt in each person&rsquo;s daily diet would save 900 lives.  One company in the food business decided to reduce the amount of salt in the bread it sold in Britain and it worked very well.  It did the same in the Czech Republic and because the Czech people had not been educated by their government at the time, the people poured salt onto the bread and ended up using more salt rather than less.  Through education we can save lives.  It is the job of the Government and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to draw people&rsquo;s attention to this.  It is an opportunity to save lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in calling for a debate on the economy.  In particular I agree with my fellow Ulster Senator, Senator Keaveney, who wants to discuss the economy of Ulster.  I am concerned mainly with the three southern counties of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal along with the three other Border counties mentioned by Senator MacSharry.  Businesses in these six counties are suffering badly.  It is time for the Minister for Finance to come to the House to outline not only his plans for the national economy but also the plans he has in mind for the six Border counties.  It is time to consider positive discrimination in taxation for these six counties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, McFadden, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Norris, Regan, Harris, Ross, Boyle, John Paul Phelan, Buttimer, Callely, MacSharry and Wilson expressed their strong views on the difficulties being experienced and called for an urgent debate on the economy.  I intend to inform the House tomorrow morning when this debate will take place.  It will be next week and I need to finalise the day.  It will be an all-day debate and I look forward to all Members of the House making their contributions.  It is long overdue, as has been said by colleagues.  I have been endeavouring to have it take place.  Now that the Finance Bill has been published there is no reason it should not proceed.</P>
        <P>Issues have been highlighted in the House today regarding F&Aacute;S and the good work that has taken place down through the years.  That work has been exemplary to say the least of it and all our communities have benefited greatly from it.  I know the T&aacute;naiste is committed to ensuring value for money from F&Aacute;S by maximising the use of our scarce resources in the current challenging economic and employment circumstances.  It is for that reason that, following concerns highlighted in a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General into the procurement practices of F&Aacute;S, the T&aacute;naiste has requested that the Comptroller and Auditor General report <Col N="376"/>further on the effectiveness of the management and control systems across the F&Aacute;S organisation in general.  The purpose of the examination, as we all know, is to examine and report on the activities of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s corporate affairs since 2000 and to ensure the necessary public procurement procedures exist to prevent or detect irregularities and wrongdoing.</P>
        <P>In addition, the T&aacute;naiste has begun a review of the effectiveness and efficiencies of the labour market programmes, including those provided by F&Aacute;S.  A steering group managing this review includes officials from the Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs, and Education and Science, F&Aacute;S and Skillnets, and will be supported by Forf&aacute;s.  It is expected that this review will be completed in mid-2009.</P>
        <P>I understand the Committee of Public Accounts is due to resume its examination of F&Aacute;S this week in the context of the original report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has been requested by Senator Ross and others that we should discuss F&Aacute;S in the House, including its achievements, responsibilities and future prospects from now to 2020.  As has been mentioned on many occasions, it receives funding of &euro;1 billion a year, &euro;20 million per week, which is a huge sum of money.  The challenges facing F&Aacute;S are the woes of the world and the challenges facing the nation to upskill and reskill our workforce, especially all those unfortunate to lose employment in the past 12 months or longer.  As a Government, a nation and as the two Houses of Parliament, I know we will be forthcoming in giving F&Aacute;S all the support we can.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is there to reassure the House regarding any difficulties being experienced.  As mentioned today the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by the eminent Member, Deputy Allen, of Fine Gael, will show true transparency in order that we can get the best value for money we possibly can.  When our backs were to the wall in the 1980s, F&Aacute;S rallied to the call in glowing terms.  It formed the backbone of our communities and gave the men and women of Ireland at the time a reason to get out of bed in the morning and have something to look forward to by having a little work in which to participate while retraining and upskilling.  I wish it well in its future deliberations and the challenges it will need to face in coming years.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, Wilson and MacSharry were all concerned about their areas.  As my parish is the last parish in Leinster on the Ulster border, I certainly know the challenges facing them.  It is not all one way.  We have cheaper petrol and diesel and have been getting our fair share of people coming across the Border to fill up their tanks and avail of the low prices on our side of the Border.  We are in a time when everyone is watching his or her spending.  People should support their own communities by purchasing in their own communities, particularly in the villages, to the best possible extent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I know, having chaired the committee which reviewed the grocery order review, and as Senator Coghlan, the deputy leader of Fine Gael in the Seanad, who served on that committee and who is present, knows, along with many other colleagues, an island nation experiences difficulties in bringing in produce, whether by air or by sea.  Prices are slightly cheaper in the multiple stores in the North than they are in the South.  Anyone who is licensed to trade in these territories know that the North&rsquo;s licensing area is taken as the UK, which has a market of 60 million people.  In equating that to the licensing market of 4.5 million people in the South, differences come into play.  The manufacturing costs of the products on the shelves is a little lower in the North because it has the licensing area of a market of 60 million people in the UK.</P>
        <P>It is a trying time for anyone with a family business.  We recommend that everyone support them in any way possible.  It comes down to simple matters.  Collections and fund-raising take place in parishes and people automatically go to the local store or local shopkeeper for money for these.  Those shopkeepers are the backbone of communities so why, therefore, should we <Col N="377"/>not support them and thereby support communities?  One can travel miles from one&rsquo;s local area to go shopping but one will not get support for one&rsquo;s fund-raising efforts there.  All these matters are important to communities and community life in general.  Long may community life continue as we have known it down through the years on this beautiful island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Malley and McFadden called for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend for a debate on domestic violence, for which I have no difficulty in setting aside time.  Senators McFadden and Callely expressed strong views on road safety.  I sympathise and send our condolences to the family of those involved in the shocking accident that took place on the Cummerstown Road in my area this morning.  I know the road well.  The accident involving the unfortunate family occurred just outside the village of Collinstown.  The motor vehicle turned over and the mother of four was killed instantly and her four children were in the vehicle with her.  It is an appalling tragedy especially coming up to Christmas but it is an appalling tragedy to happen at any time.  I send our condolences to the family on their loss following the shocking tragedy that took place this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney referred to the obesity study report and said that products should be properly labelled in terms of the information content, details of which she pointed out to the House.  I have no difficulty in arranging for a debate on this matter at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan called for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline his proposals on the matter of legally held guns, and this matter was also raised by Senator Callely.  I know the strong views of the Minister on this matter.  I will pass the views of the Senators on to the Minister and, if a debate on it is required, I have no difficulty allocating time for one.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan asked if I had a difficulty in getting Ministers to attend the House.  As the Deputy will know, the Minister, Deputy Smith, came to this House just hours before he departed for the United States last week.  We had a lengthy debate, sought as a matter of urgency, to which Members on all sides of the House contributed.  I have no difficulty in getting Ministers to come to address the House.  It is only a matter of it fitting in with their diaries.  Any Whip or leader of the groups would know that this is the norm for running the business of both Houses.</P>
        <P>I can pass on the views of Senator Callely in regard to matters pertaining to Mr. Justice McMahon.  Senator MacSharry expressed his strongly held views on the roll-out of BreastCheck and he must be commended on his determination to address the plight of the people of the north west.  I will again pass on his strong views to the Minister, as I do every week.  It is to be hoped that it will not be too long until that is put right and the people in the north west get their entitlement to that service.  It is urgently needed and I fully support the Senator in his call for its provision.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn advised the House that if we reduced our intake of salt, it could save up to approximately 900 lives per year in Ireland.  This is an alarming statistic that does not cross one&rsquo;s mind.  I thank the Senator for informing the House of that and will pass his views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the city council and everyone associated with the winning team who secured that Dublin city will be the European city of science for 2012.  This will present a marvellous opportunity for us to show our European colleagues our past achievements and how seriously we take science and technology, research and development and everything that goes with it because the future employment of our young generation is based around the importance of science and technology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to present this Bill in the Seanad.  I value the support of this House for the role played by the Government in international efforts to end the use of cluster munitions.  The principal purpose of the Bill is to provide in domestic law for the obligations the State will assume under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  As the House will be aware, the convention was adopted by consensus at the conclusion of the Dublin diplomatic conference on cluster munitions last May at Croke Park.  It will be opened for signature at a ceremony in Oslo on 3 December and will enter into force six months after 30 states have ratified it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to promoting the earliest possible entry into force of the convention and, as a demonstration of that commitment, we have prioritised the early passage of the Bill such that Ireland will be in a position both to sign and ratify the convention next week.  The programme for Government commits us to campaign for a complete ban on cluster munitions.  This priority is also shared by all Members of this House.  Senators are aware of the loss of life and limb due to these horrendous weapons and have expressed previously their support for action to bring an end to this scourge.</P>
<Col N="381"/>
        <P>The successful conclusion of negotiations on the Convention on Cluster Munitions under Irish chairmanship represents one of the most significant contributions to the development of international humanitarian law in recent years.  International humanitarian law is the branch of the law concerned with the conduct of armed conflict.  Once an armed conflict begins, international humanitarian law applies to limit its effects.  Without it, the barbarism and brutality of armed conflict would be without restriction.  International humanitarian law limits the right of the parties to an armed conflict in their choice of methods and means of warfare.  It also requires them to spare those who do not, or can no longer, take a direct part in hostilities, thereby protecting civilians in addition to captured and incapacitated combatants, from the effects of conflict.</P>
        <P>The basic rule<b> </b>of international humanitarian law in the protection of the civilian population in times of armed conflict is that the parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives.  The rule permits them to direct their operations against combatants and military targets only.  Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited.</P>
        <P>Where a weapon is incapable of distinguishing between civilian and combatant or where it is prone to use in such a manner that the effect is similar, it will tend to violate this general basic rule.  It has been found, however, that just as with anti-personnel mines, the general rule has not been sufficient in itself to prevent the atrocious humanitarian consequences arising from the use of cluster munitions.  A number of states continued to insist that it was possible to observe the basic rule and still use cluster munitions.  For Ireland and our partners in the Oslo process, and for the many like-minded countries that joined us, it was clear that a new instrument of international humanitarian law dealing specifically with cluster munitions was essential.</P>
        <P>Historically, cluster bombs have had significant humanitarian consequences in every conflict in which they have been used, and they have repeatedly caused excessive harm to civilians.  Among the first uses of cluster munitions was an attack on Grimsby during the Second World War, where many civilians were killed and injured by munitions that had not exploded upon impact.  The weapons subsequently formed part of NATO arsenals during the Cold War.  They were used on an enormous scale during the Vietnam war, with Laos, which was not even a declared participant in that war, becoming the most affected country in the world.  In excess of 260 million submunitions were dropped during that conflict and, at its end, it was estimated that 80 million of them were left unexploded.  They continue to cause civilian casualties, restrict access to land and impede social and economic development in that country.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions were also used extensively during the conflict in Kosovo.  Almost 235,000 submunitions were dropped across the region against a range of mobile and static targets during the NATO campaign in 1999.  Human Rights Watch has documented 75 civilian deaths and injuries as a direct result of cluster munitions during the bombing campaign.  They continued to affect civilians there even after hostilities had ceased.  To date, at least 152 post-conflict casualties are estimated to have been caused by unexploded bomblets.  In 2002 Landmine Action published detailed case studies of social and economic impacts resulting from cluster munitions contamination in western Kosovo.  These case studies highlighted issues such as the abandonment of traditional pastoral practices due to contamination of high summer pastures; extensive contamination that made agricultural subsistence doubtful, and hampered infrastructure renovation which, in turn, acted as a barrier to the return of displaced populations.</P>
        <P>The high failure rate, large numbers of submunitions and an extremely wide strike pattern means that even a single cluster munitions strike in or near an agricultural area can pose a significant long-term, socio-economic and physical threat to the population.  Reports by the <Col N="382"/>Iraq Landmine Impact Survey in 2006 revealed that in some areas of southern Iraq, 100% of agricultural land and 95% of pasture land was inaccessible due to explosive remnants of war, a high proportion of which were cluster bomb submunitions.  Due to desperation, necessity and the long time it takes to clear affected areas, many people take the conscious risk to return to their land before it has been cleared.  All too often, this results in the most tragic of consequences.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Lebanon war offers a substantial example of the destruction and devastation that the widespread use of cluster munitions can cause.  Some four million submunitions were fired into South Lebanon by Israel.  This left around one million unexploded individual submunitions in the area.  Areas contaminated included agricultural land and water and power infrastructure.   The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that in large areas of southern Lebanon at least 25% of the cultivated area was contaminated by unexploded cluster submunitions.  By December 2007, 217 civilians in Lebanon had been killed or injured by unexploded ordnance, almost all by submunitions.</P>
        <P>Most recently, it has been reported that both sides in the Russian-Georgian conflict engaged in the use of cluster munitions.  It is our hope that even states which do not immediately become party to the new convention will nonetheless be inhibited from using cluster munitions by the stigmatisation effect of widespread adherence by others.  The initial denials of use by both sides &mdash; despite clear evidence to the contrary &mdash; suggest that there is already a stigma attached to these weapons.</P>
        <P>In the light of the absence of progress in the Geneva forum offered by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and inspired by the process which led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, Norway convened a meeting in Oslo in February 2007 of countries that were ready to explore ways to address the issue of cluster munitions in a determined and effective manner.  Ireland was among the 46 states, including some cluster munition users and-or producers such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which committed themselves in the Oslo declaration to complete an international treaty by the end of 2008 to, &ldquo;prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Oslo Process, as it became known, was driven forward by a core group of like-minded countries comprising Norway, Ireland, Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand and Peru, and was characterised by a strong partnership between governments, international organisations and civil society.  From the outset, there was a strong humanitarian focus to ensure that any agreement reached would address adequately the numerous relief and development issues that are left in the wake of the use of cluster munitions.  The attitude taken was that this was not a classic disarmament negotiation, where both sides face each other in an atmosphere of mutual distrust, but rather a humanitarian one in which there was general agreement and commitment to our objective.  How best to achieve this had still to be established.  I am pleased to say this spirit of collaboration prevailed throughout and contributed to the excellent outcome.</P>
        <P>Significantly, at the second international conference of the Oslo Process in Lima, in May 2007, the composition of the process began to evolve and expand, with 68 countries represented.  Many were developing states from Latin America, Africa and Asia, including many states affected by cluster munitions.  An enduring feature of the Oslo Process would be the increasingly widespread participation from developing and affected states.</P>
        <P>Momentum for the Oslo Process continued to grow exponentially and the third international conference in Vienna in December 2007 was attended by 138 countries.  The core group dis<Col N="383"/>cussion text tabled at the conference resulted in collective indications of support for a strong treaty that would focus not only on a widespread ban on cluster munitions but also on support for victim assistance and co-operation.  The discussions also identified a number of potentially contentious issues, including the definition of cluster munitions and the so-called &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo; issue of military co-operation with states not party to a future treaty.  Far from derailing the Oslo Process, these difficulties served to encourage us to redouble our efforts in order to achieve a successful outcome to the penultimate conference in Wellington in February 2008.  Wellington was an extremely important stage in the process because the anticipated final declaration was intended to act as a basis on which formal treaty negotiations could be held in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Although the conference saw some tense and even difficult exchanges, much was achieved.  The draft convention text was discussed in detail.  While major differences remained on key issues of scope and definitions, and on interoperability and transition periods, prospective solutions for many less contentious issues were identified.  The Irish delegation worked extremely hard to encourage support for the Wellington declaration and by the conclusion of the conference there was an overwhelming endorsement by 82 states to associate themselves with the text.  Japan and South Africa, neither of which had signed up to Oslo, also endorsed the declaration and committed to attend the Dublin conference.  Commitment to the Wellington declaration was, in effect, the entry ticket to the Dublin conference, and many more states committed themselves in the run-up to Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Dublin diplomatic conference was attended by 127 states, with 107 attending as participants and 20 as observers.  A large number of international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations also attended as observers.  Many significant differences required to be resolved on key issues such as definitions, any possible period of transition to a ban, and future military co-operation, including in UN-mandated missions, with states not party to the convention.  However, following two weeks of intense work, and building on the preparatory discussions held at the earlier meetings, the conference adopted, by consensus, the text of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of this ground-breaking convention are as follows. There is now a comprehensive prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions, and on assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in behaviour prohibited to a state party under the convention.  The definition of a cluster munition under the convention is comprehensive and will lead to the prohibition of all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The convention prohibits all types of cluster munitions that have ever been used in an armed conflict.  Furthermore, following proposals made by the Irish delegation, the convention also prohibits explosive bomblets that are specifically designed to be dispersed or released from dispensers affixed to aircraft, in the same way as it does cluster munitions proper.  This is an extremely important provision which closes potential loopholes created by new technologies.  The convention provides that a state party&rsquo;s stockpiles of cluster munitions must be destroyed within eight years of the convention&rsquo;s entry into force for that state party.  This period may, under exceptional circumstances, be extended.</P>
        <P>In view of the fact that some states may not have facilities suitable for destroying stockpiled cluster munitions, the transfer of cluster munitions to another state party for the purpose of destruction is permitted.  In addition, the retention or acquisition of a limited number of cluster munitions and explosive submunitions for training purposes, as well as their transfer to another state party for such purposes, is permitted.  The number of submunitions retained or acquired shall not exceed the minimum absolutely necessary and there is an obligation to report on the numbers retained or acquired and the use made of them.</P>
<Col N="384"/>
        <P>Cluster munition remnants in areas under the jurisdiction or control of a state party are to be cleared and destroyed within ten years of the convention&rsquo;s entry into force for that state party, or within ten years of the end of active hostilities in cases where such remnants arise after such entry into force.  Provision is made for the extension of this deadline where circumstances warrant it.</P>
        <P>An important feature of the convention is the onus it puts on state parties that have used cluster munitions against other state parties to assist in the clearance of cluster munition remnants.  They are strongly encouraged to provide technical, financial, material or human resource assistance to the latter state party, as well as providing the precise locations of any strike.</P>
        <P>This element of the convention, as the International Committee of the Red Cross has stated, establishes a broader norm that those who engage in armed conflict can no longer walk away from the long-term consequences of the munitions they use, leaving the burden to devastated local communities.  The convention includes comprehensive provisions on assistance by state parties to cluster munition victims in areas under their jurisdiction or control.  They should adequately provide age and gender sensitive assistance, including medical care, rehabilitation and psychological support, as well as provide for social and economic inclusion.</P>
        <P>Article 6 of the convention includes detailed provisions regarding international co-operation and assistance.  This will be most relevant to the obligations regarding stockpile destruction, clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and victim assistance.  The article also stipulates that states in a position to do so shall provide technical, material and financial assistance to state parties affected by cluster munitions.  Furthermore, a state party may seek assistance from the international community, including state parties, the UN and NGOs, in developing a national action plan.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the convention in regard to victim assistance have been acknowledged as setting a new benchmark in this area.  Irish Aid is urgently examining how best to integrate this aspect into its funding and co-operation activities.  Ireland is fully committed to support for victim assistance.  A case in point is our dedication to the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel land mines.  In 2007 alone, we provided funding for 11 affected countries, including &euro;1 million for integrated mine clearance projects in Laos.</P>
        <P>The convention lays down detailed obligations regarding annual reporting by state parties on the implementation of their obligations.  It also provides for meetings between the state parties.  The first meeting must be convened within one year of the entry into force of the convention with subsequent meetings to be convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations annually until the first review conference.</P>
        <P>Taking account of the fact that, at least initially, not all states will be party to the convention and that some states not party may wish to continue to use cluster munitions, provision is made in Article 21 for state parties to engage in military co-operation and operations with states not party to the convention that might engage in activities prohibited to a state party.  This provision specifically does not authorise a state party to develop, produce or otherwise acquire cluster munitions, to itself stockpile or transfer cluster munitions, to itself use cluster munitions or to expressly request the use of cluster munitions in cases where the choice of munitions used is within its exclusive control.  When considering this article it should be noted that each state party is obliged to encourage states not party to the convention to become party to it and, where it engages in military co-operation or operations as referred to above, to notify the states concerned of its obligations under the convention, promote the norms established by the convention and make its best efforts to discourage states not party to the convention from using cluster munitions.</P>
<Col N="385"/>
        <P>Ireland believes that the prohibition on cluster munitions contained in the convention will become established as a new norm of international humanitarian law.  This will happen when states begin to feel obliged to behave in accordance with it, irrespective of whether they are parties to it.  It has happened already, very successfully, in the case of the anti-personnel mine ban convention.  We hope the Convention on Cluster Munitions will have a similar effect.  It would be difficult to over-estimate the importance of this convention and the positive impact it will have for present and future generations of civilians caught up in zones of conflict.  With the ground breaking provisions for victim assistance and clearance of contaminated areas, it represents a major advance in international humanitarian law.  At the conclusion of the Dublin conference, the International Committee of the Red Cross delivered a statement stressing its humanitarian significance in which it observed:</P>
        <P LI="1">The implementation of this treaty will undoubtedly allow many children in future conflict zones the chance to grow up to be adults.  It will also afford their parents the chance to feed those children from the harvests of lands not contaminated with cluster munitions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The statement went on to note:</P>
        <P LI="1">In adopting this Convention [we] have put in place the last essential element in an international legal regime to address the effects of weapons that can&rsquo;t stop killing .... we now have the tools to prevent or remedy the often tragic consequences for civilians of all explosive munitions used in armed conflicts.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, addressed the opening of the conference by video message and at the conclusion expressed his delight that the strong calls to address the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions had been answered.  He described the convention as a new international standard that would enhance the protection of civilians, strengthen human rights and improve prospects for development.  He also confirmed that he would accept depository functions and pledged the support and assistance of the entire United Nations system to state parties in implementing their treaty obligations.</P>
        <P>On 30 October, the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution brought forward by Ireland, which provides the mandate for the UN Secretary General to perform the administrative functions conferred on him by the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</P>
        <P>The convention will be opened for signature in Oslo next week and will enter into force six months after the deposit of the 30th instrument of ratification.  Given our involvement with the Oslo process and our leadership throughout, the Government considers it imperative for Ireland to be in a position to both sign and ratify the convention on 3 December.  This would be in keeping with our record on the anti-personnel mine ban convention, where Ireland was one of only three states which signed and ratified on the first day.  To be best placed to sign and ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions the Government is seeking to enact this Bill within a very tight timeframe.  Early enactment will ensure the State is in a position to meet its obligations from the moment of the convention&rsquo;s entry into force.  It was with this aim in mind that, as soon as the convention was adopted on 30 May, the relevant Departments began work on preparing the Bill.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to create offences in respect of the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention or transfer of cluster munitions and explosive bomblets as required under the convention.  We are also taking this opportunity to make similar provision for anti-personnel mines in order further to implement the anti-personnel mine ban convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 1997.  The current law on anti-personnel mines is <Col N="386"/>set out in the Explosives (Land Mines) Order 1996, which was made under the Explosives Act 1875.  This order is likely to be revoked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon enactment of new explosives legislation and the consequent repeal of the 1875 Act and we wish to avoid a legal vacuum.</P>
        <P>Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and provides for its commencement.  Section 2 provides for the interpretation of key terms as defined in both conventions and other relevant terms.  Many of the terms defined for the purposes of the Bill have been the subject of agreement in the negotiation of the two conventions and their reproduction in the domestic laws of state parties is necessary to ensure that their obligations are observed in a consistent manner among them.  This is especially true for the definitions of a cluster munition, an explosive bomblet and an anti-personnel mine.  If different states were to define key terms in their domestic laws in different ways, co-operation between the parties to the conventions would become extremely complex and problematic and would inevitably frustrate coherent implementation of the convention.</P>
        <P>Sections 3 and 4 are standard provisions for the laying of orders and expenses.  Section 5 allows the Minister to declare by order which states are parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  This is necessary for the purposes of co-operation with those states under section 7 of the Bill.  A similar provision enabling the Minister to declare by order the states parties to the anti-personnel mine ban convention is made in section 8.</P>
        <P>Section 6 makes it a criminal offence, with certain exceptions set out in section 7, to use, develop, produce, acquire, possess, retain or transfer a cluster munition or an explosive bomblet.  It will also be an offence to assist, encourage or induce the commission of such an offence.  Any such act committed outside the State on board an Irish ship or aircraft or by a member of the Defence Forces will also be an offence.  Section 6 gives effect to the requirement under Article 9 of the convention to take all appropriate measures to implement the convention, including the imposition of penal sanctions to prevent and suppress any prohibited activity.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions, section 7 permits certain acts that might otherwise be offences under section 6, namely, retention or acquisition of a limited number of cluster munitions or explosive bomblets for development of and training in detection, clearance and destruction of these munitions, or for the development of counter-measures.  This is in accordance with Article 3 of the convention.  It also provides for their possession in the context of criminal investigations or proceedings and their transfer to the Defence Forces or another state party for the purposes of their destruction.</P>
        <P>Provision is also made to enable the Defence Forces to participate in United Nations mandated peacekeeping forces with a state or states that may not be party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions,in accordance with Article 21 of that convention.  This is the so-called &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo; provision of the convention, which was the most difficult issue to resolve in the negotiations at Croke Park.  Agreement was reached on Article 21 only at the last moment.  Section 7(4) of the Bill will ensure that future participation by the Defence Forces in UN mandated peacekeeping operations will be consistent with the convention.  Its purpose is to ensure that no member of the Defence Forces, while serving abroad with military personnel of states that are not party to the convention, such as in a UN peacekeeping mission, may find himself or herself criminally liable for an inadvertent, unintended or unavoidable act that might otherwise be an offence.  The Bill makes clear that under no circumstances may he or she expressly request the use of cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>It is very unlikely that section 7(4) of the Bill will ever be invoked.  It is important to recall that Article 21 obliges every state party to the convention to work to promote universal adher<Col N="387"/>ence to it and the Government will continue to urge all states to become parties to the convention.  Our preference in considering future contributions to peacekeeping missions naturally will be to join with states that are parties to the convention and in these circumstances the question of interoperability with states not party will not arise.  Even were we to find ourselves as members of a peacekeeping mission that included the armed forces of a state that is not party to the convention, every effort will be made in the elaboration of codes of conduct, rules of engagement, caveats and similar agreements prepared for the mission to ensure there is no prospect of cluster munitions playing any role.  It is highly unlikely therefore that section 7(4) will ever apply but I think all Members would agree on the importance of ensuring that no member of the Defence Forces should ever face prosecution for simply carrying out his or her duty as a member of a peacekeeping mission.</P>
        <P>Section 9 makes the use, development, production, acquisition, possession, retention or transfer of an anti-personnel mine an offence, in accordance with Article 9 of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention.  Certain exceptions are permitted, in accordance with the convention, and these are provided for in section 10.</P>
        <P>As the House may be aware, I introduced a new Part 4 of the Bill by way of amendment on Committee Stage covering sections 11 to 15, inclusive.  That new part puts in place a clear legislative framework providing that any statutory investment mandate is qualified by a requirement to exclude investments in the manufacturers of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines.  Part 4 sets down the requirement to avoid initial investments of public moneys directly or indirectly in manufacturers of prohibited munitions.  It also sets out clear requirements and guidelines for dealing with circumstances where such investments occur despite best efforts to avoid them.</P>
        <P>Section 17 provides for penalties to be imposed upon summary conviction and conviction on indictment of an offence under sections 6, relating to cluster munitions, and 9, relating to anti-personnel mines.  The maximum penalty for conviction on indictment is ten years imprisonment or a fine of &euro;1,000,000, or both.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides for liability of a body corporate and is a standard provision to ensure that bodies corporate do not avoid responsibility for conduct prohibited to individuals.  Section 19 allows for the forfeiture of items to the State and is necessary to ensure that a cluster munition, explosive bomblet or anti-personnel mine seized during the investigation of a suspected offence is not returned to a claimant under the Police (Property) Act 1897 but is sent for destruction.  Subsection 2 allows the court to recover from the offender the cost of destroying cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines following a successful prosecution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The texts of the two conventions are set out for ease of reference in the Schedules to the Bill.  This  comprehensive  legislation  was  drawn  up  in  consultation with  the National Committee on International Humanitarian Law, which was established in advance of the diplomatic conference.  My Department has also consulted closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which intends to publish a model law for the implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I must reiterate that it is an absolute priority for Ireland to be in a position to both sign and ratify the convention in Oslo on 3 December and this legislation will facilitate that objective. I very much appreciate the co-operation and support of this House in what I am sure all here agree is a very important humanitarian endeavour.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comprehensive contribution.  I welcome the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill <Col N="388"/>2008, which is before the House today and acknowledge that my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Billy Timmins, introduced a similar Bill earlier in the year.  The Bill before us, after amendment in the other House, contains many of the objectives that were in Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Bill.  This House also had a very informative and constructive debate on this issue earlier in the year.  I am glad that many of the issues raised in the Seanad are also covered in the Bill. </P>
        <P>The Bill contains reference to two similar but very different types of weaponry, cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines.  Both are similar in impact but subject to different international conventions.  The Convention on Cluster Munitions was signed in Dublin in 2008 and the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines was signed in Oslo in 1997.  It is significant, as regards avoiding confusion over the two conventions and other treaties and declarations that preceded them, that the two categories are dealt with separately in this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cluster munitions are one of the most controversial and despicable weapons to be used in modern warfare.  They are designed  not to target soldiers or armies but areas of land.  Large numbers of unexploded cluster munitions may litter an area, like landmines, for many years after a war has ended.  It is often farmland owned by the poorest, in war-torn countries that is left littered with cluster munitions, many the size of coke tins, some bright in colour that attract and kill innocent children in many instances.  Today, more than 30 countries produce cluster munitions and up to 20 use them.  The first cluster bombs to be used were of German manufacture and dropped during the Second World War, as mentioned by the Minister.  As recently as 1999, the US, Britain and the Netherlands used them in Kosovo.  The footprint of a single cluster bomb can be as large as a sportsfield.  The fragments of exploding submunitions travel unguided at high velocity and often miss their mark, hitting nearby civilian objects in many instances.</P>
        <P>The first thing that struck Deputy Timmins when he arrived in the Lebanon to serve with the Irish Army in the 1980s was the number of young children with missing limbs &mdash; one leg, no legs, one arm or no arms.  Most of these injuries were caused by bomblets from cluster munitions.  He says that seeing that first-hand leaves an indelible impact on an individual.  It is a dreadful statistic that some 98% of cluster munition casualties are civilians, killed and injured while returning home in the aftermath of conflict or going about their daily work.</P>
        <P>In southern Lebanon almost 90% of the land used for farming and grazing is contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions.  It is estimated that for more than 400 million living in affected areas, cluster munitions turn their homes and communities into <i>de facto</i> minefields.  It is shocking to think that in Vietnam, more than 300 people are still being killed each year as a result of cluster munitions.  In Kosovo they were used by NATO, removing the need for the deployment of troops on the ground.  People continue to die in Kosovo each year as a result of the 1,400 cluster bombs dropped there.  Some of the American cluster bombs dropped were bright yellow in colour and visually appealing to children.  The BBC in a programme stated that these bomblets contained an incendiary device, shrapnel and armour-piercing explosive that could pierce steel 25 cm thick.</P>
        <P>The Minister has outlined many other areas where cluster munitions were used to devastating effect and I shall not repeat the facts and statistics he outlined.  I shall deal with the process that, hopefully, will rid the world of these dreadful weapons.  We should be proud that Ireland was part of the Oslo process &mdash; a series of global conferences on cluster munitions that began in Oslo in February 2007.  The core group of countries, as they were known, included Ireland, Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and Peru.  The Dublin convention, held in Croke Park in May 2008, was the completion of the process.  The signing conference will take place next week, on 3 December, in Oslo.</P>
<Col N="389"/>
        <P Just="Left">Let us hope this international agreement will bring an end to the use of cluster munitions and secure adequate provision for care and rehabilitation of survivors, as well as the clearance of all contaminated areas.  If these aims are achieved our work today will have been worthwhile.  The Oslo process will prove to be a beacon of light for all the nations who have to contend with the results of cluster munitions on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Anti-personnel mines are activated by pressure, trip-wire or remote detonation and they kill or disable their victims.  Like cluster munitions, fragmentation mines can cause injury from up to 200 metres away and kill at closer distances.  The fragments in these mines are metal or glass.  The mine ban treaty, sometimes referred to as the Ottawa Convention or the Oslo treaty, was signed in 1997 and is the most comprehensive international instrument to rid the world of the scourge of anti-personnel mines.  It deals with everything from mine use, production and trade to victim assistance, mine clearance and stockpile destruction.  Ireland formally singed the mine ban treaty on 3 December 1997.  It is regrettable that states not party to that treaty include China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Russia and the United States.  Until some or all of these countries sign up to this treaty the effectiveness of it will not be as robust and as binding as we would all wish.</P>
        <P>On the question of investing in companies listed as being involved in the production of cluster munitions, it was deeply regrettable that the National Pensions Reserve Fund invested in some of these companies but they moved swiftly when this was highlighted to end any investment of pension money in companies linked to the manufacture of cluster munitions.  I am delighted that Part 4, section 11 of the Bill covers investment of public moneys in munitions companies.  The penalties and miscellaneous provisions are also included in Part 5.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  It contains most of the provisions provided for in Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s Bill.  It is necessary legislation in an area where Ireland has played a proud role and I wish the Minister well when he signs and ratifies the convention in Oslo next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and wish him well in his role as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for Overseas Development Aid.  I also thank the Minister for his comprehensive presentation and outlining in detail the different aspects of the Bill.  </P>
        <P>The Bill is the result of one of the greatest contributions Ireland has made to international human rights and diplomacy since our country took its place on the world stage.  When Ireland hosted more than 130 countries at the cluster munitions conference in Croke Park last May, few could have predicted the giant leap that would be taken to remove the scourge of one of the deadliest weapons the world has developed.  In two short weeks Ireland convinced an unprecedented number of countries to help confine cluster bombs to the bin of history.  The convention agreed in Dublin, which will be signed by states in Oslo next week, represents the first step in removing weapons that have caused decades of misery and continue to harm people today.</P>
        <P>In the diplomatic and political language of this Bill we can easily forget the countless lives that have been affected.  In Croke Park the victims of cluster bombs were given a key role and voice.  Victims, non-governmental organisations and others were invited to the conference and were there to be heard and lobby for change.  Their messages and stories, documented in the media worldwide, were key in securing a successful outcome.  Whenever talks were deadlocked their stories were the spur to drive countries on.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions are small bombs, often the size of a tennis ball, which are dropped when a larger missile explodes in midair.  They can litter a wide area and lie undiscovered long after a conflict is over.  Frequently the long-forgotten bomblets are picked up by a child, farm <Col N="390"/>labourer, hill walker or people who are passing and the results are devastating.  In extreme cases they can be fatal and for many more they cause the loss of a limb or disfigurement.  Some child victims of cluster bombs are injured by devices dropped in wars waged before they were born.</P>
        <P>The International Committee of the Red Cross stated that we must stand by these victims to ban these landmines forever so that children can run free in the fields and go to school, and parents can till their land and draw water from their wells without fear of being blown up by cluster bombs or landmines.  It is because of their stories that we should support this Bill.  These bombs have left us nothing but a legacy of misery and suffering.  The path of destruction they have caused stretches from Grimsby in England during  the Second World War to Vietnam, Laos, Lebanon and, if reports are to be believed, as recently as last August, Georgia.  They are indiscriminate, no one is safe and the danger often lingers for decades.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the centre of the convention agreed at Croke Park is an immediate and unconditional ban on all cluster munitions which cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  Each state signing up to the convention undertakes to never, in any circumstances, use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions.  It is a wide-ranging international agreement.  The convention has a number of important aspects.  The definition of a cluster munition is comprehensive and the agreement is clear that stockpiles of bombs must be destroyed.  There are also clear provisions on assistance for victims.  I would like to see work progress in this area so we can ensure the maximum level of support is given to those whose lives have been devastated by bombs.</P>
        <P>Ireland has spearheaded the international effort to outlaw these horrible weapons and is the vanguard of international efforts to rid the planet of them.  I am assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we are working even now to bring more countries around to our way of thinking and to join the international ban.  The reaction has been very positive and although it is not possible to say how many governments will be represented at Oslo the signs are very encouraging.</P>
        <P>What has been achieved to date has been remarkable but there are challenges ahead.  There are still countries that remain to be convinced to take the leap to join the worldwide ban.  They have yet to be convinced that cluster bombs are an unnecessary evil which must be permanently removed.  Ireland must remain at the forefront of the efforts to convince these countries to come on-side.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern and the many officials in his Department, as well as those in Irish embassies across the globe who worked tirelessly to bring us to this stage.</P>
        <P>The Minister was present at the opening and the successful conclusion of the conference at Croke Park, while officials of the Department were on hand at all times to ensure the event was a success.  Even as we debate the issue, the lobbying continues to ensure that as many countries as possible stand by the commitment they gave in Dublin and sign up to the convention in Oslo.  Given the lead role we have taken, it is imperative Ireland is represented in Oslo on 3 December to become one of the first countries to sign the cluster munitions convention.  Therefore, I encourage all my colleagues to support this important Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, to the House and welcome the introduction of this timely Bill.  While it is not perfect, it is good legislation.  I propose to put some of my reservations about the Bill on the record, but to begin I congratulate those civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs who worked so hard to achieve what they thought was the best achievable.  I witnessed their hard work at close range through the various meetings that took place here of the Cluster Munitions Coalition, the various recep<Col N="391"/>tions, conferences and so on.  They may be right that they got the best achievable, but I believe in a council of excellence and in raising the bar all the time.  This approach worked with the previous landmines legislation, where we were lobbied by the Clinton administration to permit loopholes in the legislation.  However, we stood out against that.  It would have been preferable if we could have done the same with this legislation.  Therefore, I have reservations and will put down some amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. </P>
        <P>It is a remarkable achievement to get this far.  These are filthy weapons and they are not something that is far from us.  It was not just in Grimsby in the closing days of the war that these weapons were used, they were a product of the Nazi war machine, but, extraordinarily, they were used recently by NATO and approximately 250,000 were dropped on Kosovo.  I regard that as an unacceptable use, because these weapons have no precise military application.  They are a weapon of terror and nothing else.  They have never once achieved a specific military objective.  They are for use against the civilian population to create terror, to maim and injure civilians, particularly children and women working in the fields, and to render agricultural land unusable.  They are both a terror and an economic weapon.  I agree with the Minister they are weapons of barbarism and brutality and we will be well shot of them.  We have reason to be proud that Dublin will enter history as having been the focus of the intense diplomatic effort that has led to the treaty that will be signed in Oslo.  I am happy this Bill will be facilitated in order to allow Ireland to sign the international convention.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue on a number of previous occasions and am glad to say we managed to pass, unanimously, a motion on cluster munitions that was discussed here, having been given the special facility of Government time, on 6 March this year.  Previously, I and Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who is extremely active in this area, put through a similar motion, that was also unanimously adopted, in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, spoke in this House with great passion on this issue, because he had come across victims of this kind of atrocity, as did I in the Middle East.  I also remember going, as many of Dublin&rsquo;s citizens did, to a remarkable exhibition of photographs which told the horrible, human story of what happens to people who innocently pick up these kinds of munitions.</P>
        <P>I compliment Pax Christi Ireland, in particular, Tony D&rsquo;Costa, on the work it has done.  I know the Minister does not agree with this because I saw his article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> today.  It is a pity he selected Mr. D&rsquo;Costa by name to reprimand.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am very disappointed at efforts to diminish this major achievement for Irish foreign policy.  Tony D&rsquo;Costa is out of step with the vast majority of people actively campaigning on this issue.  The Cluster Munition Coalition, the umbrella body for more than 250 NGOs, views the convention as the most significant treaty of its kind since the ban on anti-personnel landmines in 1997.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister is wrong in one sense.  Of course the coalition welcomed it.  However, I was involved in the campaign and in all the discussions and I can tell the House, incontrovertibly, that the coalition was disappointed.  It wanted exactly what Tony D&rsquo;Costa wanted and its members said that to me.  I was at every meeting and the members of the coalition said again and again, &ldquo;we want these things banned.&rdquo;  They were against the definition that exempts landmines under a capacity of ten droplets, ten smaller munitions.  At one of the meetings I asked why we were including the interoperability clause.  I know the diplomatic reason for it and can understand and sympathise with it.  I do not criticise the civil servants in our diplomatic corps who took that line.  However, we should have taken a principled and moral stance on this.</P>
<Col N="392"/>
        <P>In the recent debate in the D&aacute;il, my friend and colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, made the same point.  That reassures me because if there is one person in the Oireachtas who knows his way around international treaties and conventions and the way these matters are handled diplomatically, it is he.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">In 2006 and 2007, Belgium and Austria had followed such a path in the preparation of domestic legislation.  [In other words, they went for the stars and upped the ante beyond what was in the treaty.]  This is a rather long way of stating a point of view that I hold, which is that one should always use one&rsquo;s domestic legislation, given the activist achievement Ireland can point to, to go beyond the minimum required in the convention.  In that way, one is continually raising the bar.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I used the phrase &ldquo;upping the ante&rdquo; and he used the phrase &ldquo;raising the bar&rdquo;.  We did this before on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  Therefore, it is not against the ethos of the Department to take such a view and approach the matter in that way.</P>
        <P>The exemption clause is one of the clauses to which I object, to which Tony D&rsquo;Costa objected and to which the people in the Cluster Munition Coalition objected, although, of course, they accept the goodwill of the Department and the fact that it did what it saw as the best achievable in the circumstances.  Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill exempts munitions with the following characteristics, each munition contains fewer than ten explosive submunitions; each explosive sub-munition weighs more than 4 kg &mdash; they weigh between four and 20 kg, and they are outlawed when they reach 20 kg; each explosive sub-munition is designed to detect and engage a single target object; each explosive sub-munition is equipped with an electronic self-destruction mechanism; and each explosive sub-munition is equipped with an electronic self-deactivating feature.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is nonsense that the Bill accepts these munitions as long as they are below a certain standard.  They are totally unacceptable.  We know, for example, that they cannot detect and engage with a single object with any certainty.  If one fires one that contains nine and one of those nine hits the target, what happens to the other eight?  Where do they go?  We know the self-destruct mechanism does not work most of the time as we have had plenty of experience of that and of the manner in which they are cynically used.  Take, for example, the last days of the war in Lebanon, when Israel dropped 4 million cluster bombs, despite the fact that the conflict was over.  The diplomatic moves had been made and Israel knew there would be no fighting, yet it dropped 4 million cluster bombs to terrorise the civilian population.</P>
        <P>Most of the time the electronic self-destruct mechanism does not work.  If it does, what happens if it lands in a civilian area and blows up?  We know the most evil thing about these is that it is often children who pick them up.  Each explosive sub-munition is equipped with an electronic self-deactivating feature.  It is for these reasons I am against these provisions.</P>
      
        <P>It is a pity we could not have gone further than the treaty in our domestic legislation.  I do not believe this would have legally inhibited us from signing something that was slightly weaker.  It was a pity for that reason and I will table some amendments.  Just as in the case of the landmines convention, where Ireland resisted such loopholes, we have given in and have allowed such loopholes to exist.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  He sets out, quite rightly, the basic international humanitarian law that one must distinguish between civilians and armed combatants and so on.  However, he goes on to refer to a scenario &ldquo;where a weapon is incapable of distinguishing between civilian and combatant&rdquo;.  Can the Minister of State provide an instance of a weapon that is capable of so doing?  I never have come across one as they do not exist and no weapon <Col N="393"/>is capable of so distinguishing.  Moreover, the Minister of State should not mention smart bombs.  One heard all about them during the blitz on Baghdad and it all turned out to be a tissue of lies.  There is no such instrument that can distinguish between a civilian and a military target.</P>
        <P>Although the Minister mentioned a number of states, it is a pity he did not name and shame them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, may not be aware that Senator Leyden makes a habit of employing the war cry, &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo;.  Why not name and shame such states, even if they are our allies?</P>
        <P>In a speech that was good in a number of respects and which provided Members with a wide-ranging historical background to the matter, the Minister spoke about the definition of a cluster munition under the convention and stated it is comprehensive.  I have just given reasons I do not consider this to be the case because it exempts certain objects that clearly are cluster munitions.  Nine components constitute a cluster and yet this legislation permits them.  The Minister then spoke of the &ldquo;retention or acquisition of a limited number of cluster munitions and explosive submunitions for training purposes&rdquo;.  I seek further explanations in this regard.  What are these training purposes and what is their point?  If they are for the purpose of giving people access to techniques of mine clearance, that is fine.  However, if they are to continue with military exercises, then it most definitely is not fine.</P>
        <P>The Minister also noted:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he convention includes comprehensive provisions on assistance by state parties to cluster munition victims in areas under their jurisdiction or control.  They should adequately provide age and gender-sensitive assistance [and so on].</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is splendid and such assistance for victims was something for which Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I were fighting.  However, those who manufacture the bombs should pay.  I do not believe it is right to bomb the crap out of people and then expect them to pay, if Members will excuse the expression.  I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s pardon as it just slipped out.  Why should they?  I am sure Senator Boyle will agree the polluter should pay.  Is that not the principle?  The countries that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make one further point.  It is absolutely appalling to think that Ireland would consider engaging in military exercise of either an aggressive or defensive kind with people who may well use such weapons during the course of that military operation.  We must not do so as it is the wink and snigger and gives them moral permission.  It is so queasily ambiguous that I am 100% against it.</P>
        <P>I started on a positive note, although I made some criticisms.  The Government should lay off Tony D&rsquo;Costa who is a very decent man without whom we might not be in this position.  However, I wish to end on a congratulatory note.  On 6 March this year, I listed a number of the companies with which Ireland, probably accidentally or unintentionally, had invested sums of money through the pensions fund.  I brought this matter to the attention of the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  He was horrified and pushed in the direction of ethical investment.  I welcome its copperfastening in this Bill and our hands will be much cleaner after its passage.  However, they could have been snow white.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a significant Bill and at a time when we live in a world full of economic and environmental crises, the ability to consider legislation that has consequences towards bringing about a safer world, however far it goes down that particular road, should be <Col N="394"/>welcomed by all Members.  This Bill recalls the proud role played by previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Governments in trying to inform and persuade the international arena regarding better moral standards in the conduct of international affairs.  It is not going too far to compare it to the role performed by the then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, in respect of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  It also is worth remarking that in that work, while he did not bring an end to nuclear weapons, he informed the beginning of a debate that such weapons were morally repugnant.  Sadly, that debate still is ongoing.  Likewise, this Bill and this international treaty will not bring an immediate end to the use of an odious class of weapons.  However, it starts that process and the role played by the Government in this regard, including officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the current Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, must be acknowledged in the debate.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Norris, I wish to concentrate on a particular aspect of the Bill, namely, the provisions on non-investment in companies engaged in the practice of producing cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines.  Sections 11 to 15, inclusive, put in place in Irish law for the first time principles of ethical investment in the spending of public money.  I class this as being one of the Bill&rsquo;s more important aspects.  As a Member of the other House, I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to have the principles of ethical investment adopted as formal Government policy and in particular to have those principles included as part of the terms of reference of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  As the latter is not mentioned specifically in this Bill, perhaps this can be considered on Committee and Report Stages.  However, the sense of the Bill pertains to any level of Government spending in this regard.  It even would cover the point made by Senator Norris in that I cannot discern how, were we to spend money engaging in defence activities with other countries that use such weapons, this would be compatible with sections 11 to 15, inclusive, of the Bill.  The legislation makes a clear statement of intent regarding the spending of public moneys that is in any way related to the use of cluster bombs and anti-personnel weapons.  Moreover, these principles should be expanded into wider legislation.  While such legislation would not be dealt with directly by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance, which I presume has been consulted about these provisions, could examine the wider ethical context of how public moneys are invested.  When one begins to so do, one begins to add more weight to the conviction one expresses in international organisations and during the framing of international agreements.</P>
        <P>It is somewhat unusual, because of the active involvement of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs in this Bill, that Members are ratifying legislation for an international agreement so quickly.  However, circumstances demand they do as Ireland has been a forerunner in bringing about this agreement and has hosted a conference in Croke Park.  The necessity to be among the first countries to ratify and sign this convention is something in which Members should take a great deal of pride.  However, it also is fair to put down a marker that Ireland does not always tend to do this in respect of international agreements.  Perhaps the process involved in publishing this Bill and bringing it through both Houses of the Oireachtas could be put in place as a new standard or a new set of goalposts for Members to play with to ensure that wherever and whenever they can implement international treaties of this type, they so do as quickly as possible.  Ireland&rsquo;s record in this regard is not always the best and I could cite environmental agreements in particular.</P>
        <P>There are a number of exemptions in the Bill that Senator Norris rightly has pointed out.  We could take the moral high ground and produce a Bill outlining Ireland&rsquo;s opinion that these weapons should never be used from tomorrow on, but it likely would be an empty, rhetorical and moral statement.</P>
<Col N="395"/>
        <P>We have produced an international treaty through the efforts of Government officials.  The next step is to ensure the agreement goes further and a timetable is put in place to eliminate these odious weapons once and for all.  The moral credit earned by Government officials by being part of the process from the beginning will make that elimination inevitable.  Everyone should take pride in this and legislators should recognise what is a great achievement for Irish diplomacy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having already passed through the Lower House, the changes that need to be made to the Bill are narrow in nature.  The overall principle of the Bill is widely accepted in the Houses and the body public.  On these grounds, I would not only welcome the expeditious passage of the Bill, but also encourage those involved in the process to ensure that another treaty on these and other odious weapons of destruction can be brought about through the lessons learned and experience gained by Government officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Like Senator Boyle and others, I support the swift passage of the Bill through both Houses.  I commend the efforts of Deputies and Senators on their efforts to ensure the Bill passes as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>This is important legislation because it ensures that Ireland plays a large part in the global effort to eradicate the use of cluster bombs and anti-personnel mines.  As well as providing the necessary legislative framework in advance of next month&rsquo;s Oslo conference, the Bill makes an important statement to the peoples of the world about what our nation and the world believes is acceptable in times of war.  The use of cluster munitions in modern military offensive operations is indefensible.  Small, bright and attractive to children at play, unexploded bomblets have been responsible for killing and maiming countless innocent lives.</P>
        <P>The issue has been ignored for too long.  It is a shame that it took scenes of mass carnage in countries such as Lebanon for the world to unite and act.  The Red Cross estimates that more than 250 million cluster munitions were dropped in the 1960s and 1970s.  A UN report indicates that, during the conflict in Lebanon, up to 1 million cluster munitions failed to explode upon impact.  Consequently, approximately 40 million sq. m of land is contaminated.</P>
        <P>I witnessed the impact of cluster bombs and other unexploded munitions on a civilian population when I was in Khe Sanh on the Ho Chi Minh trail in Vietnam where the Americans had a base.  Children are still losing their lives to the many unexploded munitions there.  The threat is present for many people across the world.  Vietnam is one of our programme countries and the Minister of State, who has visited it, has presumably seen what I am referring to.  It is important that the issue be tackled.</P>
        <P>The Bill and, more importantly, next month&rsquo;s treaty signing will add an unambiguous and overdue chapter to what constitutes acceptable behaviour during times of war.  I commend the Government, the Minister of State and everyone involved in the endorsement of the convention on cluster bomb munitions some months ago.  The strength of the treaty lies in its drafting and language.  It specifically prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions.  It states that signatories in possession of cluster munitions should have them destroyed.  It is important to point out that, as we speak, approximately 107 countries are enacting legislation similar to the Bill before the House.  It is a victory for diplomacy and proof that negotiation and international consensus remain the best vehicles to effect change.</P>
        <P>I regret that China, Russia and India did not attend the May conference.  It is unfortunate that they do not intend to sign the Oslo treaty.  Their shameful inaction flies in the face of the <Col N="396"/>opinions of the peoples and the nations of the world, but I hold out great hope that the incoming US Administration will reverse America&rsquo;s policy and sign up.  It is encouraging that the conference was attended by Senator Patrick Leahy, who indicated that the Obama Administration, if elected, would add the US to the list of signatories.  Barack Obama, who is now president-elect, voted in the Senate for a Bill on the restriction of America&rsquo;s use of cluster munitions.  However, it is important to note that Senator Clinton, the presumptive Secretary of State, voted against the same measure.</P>
        <P>I hope that the tide of collective opinion and moral pressure will encourage those countries that do not intend to sign the treaty to do so or to adhere to the spirit of its contents.  I commend the provision in section 21 of the Bill, which recommends that Ireland encourage non-signatories to accept, approve or accede to the treaty.  Given that Ireland is seen as an honest broker on the international stage, I welcome this provision.</P>
        <P>The section that prohibits the use of public money or State-funded investments in munition companies states, &ldquo;Nothing in any enactment that authorises the investment of public moneys shall be taken to authorise any investment, direct or indirect, in a munitions company.&rdquo;  That the State should refrain from investing in such companies should go without saying, but the revelation that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has connections with some of the companies in question means that a provision prohibiting the practice is welcome and necessary.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the Bill will be approved by the House, I commend the bipartisan efforts to ensure it will be enacted as soon as possible and I look forward to the treaty signing in Oslo next month, which will represent an important milestone in the protection of civilians during wartime.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach anocht and I compliment him on his good work in overseas aid.  He has displayed a tremendous grasp of and feel for his area of responsibility.  We all support his humanitarian efforts.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss a fine example of international humanitarian law.  As the Minister of State mentioned, it sets us a new benchmark.  It is good news, although we might not see it in tomorrow&rsquo;s headlines or it might not be the first item on news programmes on television.  Obviously, the situation would be reversed were it bad news.  This is a pity, as the Bill is an indication of Ireland&rsquo;s role in this area.  As Senator Hannigan stated, we can be proud of the respect and regard in which Ireland is held for initiating and playing a part in many humanitarian issues.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State clearly outlined how the basic rule of international humanitarian law is the protection of civilians, particularly in times of armed conflict.  While a clear distinction must be made between combatants and civilians, it is not always done.  The rule permits people to direct operations against combatants and military objectives only and prohibits indiscriminate attacks.  Where a weapon is incapable of distinguishing between civilians and combatants, as in the case of cluster munitions and landmines, it violates the rule.  It is good that we have taken the initiative.</P>
        <P>There are many areas across the globe where conflicts took place in the past and where people, generally children, are suffering the consequences of indiscriminate military activity such as that to which I refer.  In the past two years, my wife and I spent a week&rsquo;s holiday in Japan and took a 900-mile detour in order to visit Hiroshima.  We were shocked by what we saw.  Unfortunately, immediately after the Second World War, the Japanese moved to eradicate the evidence of the attack on Hiroshima because there was an element of national shame attached to what happened.  They did, however, preserve that iconic public building with which everyone is familiar from photographs in books and on postcards.  There is also a very good <Col N="397"/>museum at that location.  When one realises that more than 250,000 were killed when Hiroshima was bombed and that so many were affected subsequently, one comes to the conclusion that it was an extremely appalling and unjustified attack on innocent people.  Nagasaki was the subject of a similar attack under a week later.  There is much evidence that indiscriminate attacks took place during the Second World War.</P>
        <P>I watched a recent television programme on the Korean War.  During that conflict, many innocent civilians were killed.  Other Members referred to the Vietnam War.  As the Minister indicated, Laos was most affected by the use of cluster munitions during that war, even though it was not party to the conflict.  The Vietnam War gave rise to much revulsion across the globe, including in America where many student and other public campaigns opposing the war took place.  More than 260 million cluster munitions were dropped during this conflict.  Apparently 80 million of these did not explode and they continue to cause civilian casualties.</P>
        <P>The Balkans were affected by the use of cluster munitions, as was Iraq.  Up to 100% of significant land areas in the latter are inaccessible because they were peppered with such munitions.  The conflict in the Lebanon lasted approximately two decades.  Even though it was brought to an end in 2007, some 217 people have since been killed as a result of accidents involving cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which adjudicates on the atrocities committed by war criminals against civilians in conflicts that took place in the past two decades.  That court was established in order to bring people to account but also to act as a deterrent to those involved in conflicts from indiscriminately injuring or killing civilians.  It is a pity that not all countries recognise the court.  A notable example in this regard is the US.  This is a sad reflection on the US because the latter was party to many of the conflicts to which I refer.  President-elect Barack Obama&rsquo;s new administration, which will include Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State, is determined to restore confidence in the US.  The latter is a world leader in so many ways but it should also be a world leader in observing human rights during periods of conflict.  One of the actions President-elect Obama could take would be to bring the US under the remit of the International Court of Justice.</P>
        <P>The Bill will allow Ireland&rsquo;s representatives to travel to Oslo on 3 December to sign the convention.  Only two of the 95 countries that will sign the convention, namely, Ireland and Norway, will already have ratified it in legislation.  That is as it should be, particularly when one considers that the Convention on Cluster Munitions was brought into being at the diplomatic conference that took place in Croke Park in Dublin last May.</P>
        <P>I note the sensible exclusions that have been made in the provisions of the Bill.  There is an onus on signatories to the convention to play their part in encouraging those countries that are not party to it to sign up.  I hope that in time all major countries and all those who may be involved in future conflicts will adhere to what is an extremely desirable instrument.  The convention is a credit to the country and to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who spearheaded the campaign to have it introduced, and to the current Minister, Deputy Martin, for pursuing it.  This highlights the positive aspect of politics and the type of change we can bring about, in Ireland and globally, through our collective and individual efforts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming before the House earlier and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, who is now present.  Like Senator Norris and others, I congratulate the Department on the tremendous work it has done in bringing this matter to the point at which it currently stands.</P>
<Col N="398"/>
        <P>This is an extremely important debate.  Ignorance can be a great thing at times.  I am completely ignorant as to what are landmines, cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines.  The same probably goes for the majority of people in Ireland.  We are so lucky we have no experience of these items.  I presume the only individuals in the country who might have knowledge of them are members of the Defence Forces and perhaps a handful of other individuals.  If one of these devices was placed in front of me, I would not have a clue with regard to what it was or what destruction it could do.  However, I took the opportunity to investigate these munitions and the damage they can cause.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions are weapons deployed from the air by aircraft including fighters, bombers and helicopters.  These weapons open in mid-air and scatter dozens or hundreds of smaller submunitions to the ground.  Cluster munitions can be also deployed by being launched from artillery, rocket and missile systems on the ground.  Submunitions released by air-dropped cluster bombs are most often called &ldquo;bomblets&rdquo;, while those delivered from the ground are usually referred to as &ldquo;grenades.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions are among the most controversial weapons used in modern warfare.  They are what are known as area effect weapons and are designed not to target soldiers or armies but rather areas of land.  The theory behind them is simple.  They can be deployed from the air to remove an area of land from use by an enemy.  Such an area of land will be left unsafe to travel through due to bomb craters and the possibility of unexploded ordnance.  In practice, the tactical benefit they may produce is more than outweighed by the negative connotations attaching to them.  Large quantities of unexploded cluster munitions may, like landmines, litter an area when a war has ended.  It is often farmland owned by the poorest people in war-torn countries that is left covered with these munitions, many of which are the size of Coke cans and can cause the mass deaths of men, women and children.</P>
        <P>The damage that can be done by cluster munitions is horrific.  The footprint of a single cluster bomb can be as large as a football pitch.  Fragments of exploded submunitions travel at high velocity.  When they strike they set off people pressure waves within the body, which do horrific damage to soft tissue and organs.  Even a single fragment can rupture the spleen or cause the intestines to explode.  If a victim survives the accident, he or she may suffer from a variety of injuries including the loss of limbs, burns, puncture wounds, ruptured eardrums and blindness.  As already stated, the majority of people in Ireland can count themselves lucky not to ever have come across munitions of this nature.</P>
        <P>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State in regard to particular areas of the Bill.  Section 17 provides for penalties to be imposed upon summary conviction and conviction on indictment of an offence under section 6 and that the maximum penalty for conviction on indictment is ten years imprisonment or a fine of &euro;1 million or both.  Will this provision apply where a person leaves a cluster bomb or grenade under a car, as has happened in Dublin during the past couple of years?  Will such offence be covered by this provision?  I believe it should and that it might encourage people to think twice about their actions in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that provision is made in the Bill for the use of cluster bombs in practice by the Defence Force and others, thus requiring a certain amount of cluster bombs to be manufactured.  Should we not be seeking a total ban on cluster bombs given the damage they do?  While we are endeavouring to do so through this Bill we are on the other hand stating they may be produced in some form for training and other purposes.  There is a little ambiguity in this regard.  We should be seeking to introduce a total ban on cluster bombs given the damage they do.</P>
<Col N="399"/>
        <P>I am sure the people who manufacture cluster bombs must produce a particular amount as per their manufacturing process.  Obviously, many of them will be put out of business as a result of this convention brought into place by many countries.  Will these manufacturers be bought out or paid off?  How is this aspect of the matter being dealt with?  I believe this is an important issue given the significant amount of this type of armoury which manufacturers will have to dispose of one way or the other, perhaps to countries not signed up to the convention.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position in regard to the manufacturing process in terms of how it is to be down-sized.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who welcomed me to the House.  I join Senators Burke, Ormonde and others in sending our compliments and praise to all those involved in the production of this international agreement, in particular officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs who were involved in the drafting, redrafting and detailed negotiation of this international agreement, which is a victory for the diplomatic and negotiating skills of our officials.  It enhances Ireland&rsquo;s reputation once again as an honest broker on the international stage and a country able to take a lead in these areas and to bring with it the vast majority of countries, in an inclusive manner, to produce an effective convention that meets overall agreement.  I share in the praise expressed to all those involved in the process.</P>
        <P>Senators raised a number of issues, with which I will deal later.  I thank them for their contributions to this debate which were, as always, interesting and constructive.  We will, prior to the taking of Committee and Remaining Stages of this Bill, reflect carefully on all the comments made this afternoon.  I know all of us share the common objective of ensuring the timely passage of this important Bill to enable the earliest possible ratification by Ireland of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As indicated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Bill provides in domestic law for the obligations the State will assume under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, CCM.  Achieving a comprehensive international prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions was an important objective of the programme for Government.  It has been met early in the lifetime of the Government and it is, I believe, fair to say that the Oslo process and the Convention on Cluster Munitions exceeded the early levels of ambition of what could be achieved internationally on this issue.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, the convention, which was adopted by consensus at the conclusion of the Dublin Diplomatic Conference at Croke Park last May, will be opened for signature at a ceremony in Oslo on 3 December.  It will enter into force six months following its ratification by 30 states.  The successful conclusion of negotiations on the CCM under Irish chairmanship represents one of the most significant contributions to the development of international humanitarian law in recent years and a major achievement in Irish foreign policy.  As the Minister emphasised, the Government is anxious to develop further this excellent work by being in a position to sign and ratify the convention at the ceremony in Oslo next week.   The enactment of the Bill facilitates this and will clearly demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to promoting its earliest possible entry into force.</P>
        <P>As Senators will know, the convention is the result of a common endeavour by governments and civil society and is an example of what can be achieved where these actors pool resources in pursuit of a shared objective.  It is the result of widely-shared concerns at the unacceptable harm caused to civilians by cluster munitions at the time of their use &mdash; due to their wide-area effects &mdash; and following conflicts, when unexploded submunitions remain as a lethal hazard to civilian populations seeking to return to their homes, farms and places of employment.  In recognition of the appalling humanitarian consequences that cluster munition use has had in <Col N="400"/>the past, the 107 states that participated in the diplomatic conference in Dublin in May reached agreement on a very robust new instrument of international humanitarian law.</P>
        <P>The Convention on Cluster Munitions establishes a comprehensive prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions.  &ldquo;Cluster munitions&rdquo; are defined for the purposes of the convention and the definition is reproduced, as it must be, in the Bill.  Weapons systems with certain characteristics, which do not create indiscriminate area effects and the risks posed by unexploded submunitions, have been excluded from the definition and thus from the operative provisions of the convention that apply to cluster munitions.  &ldquo;Explosive bomblets&rdquo; that are specifically designed to be dispersed or released from dispensers affixed to aircraft are subject to the same prohibitions as cluster munitions.  These very robust definitions enable the convention effectively to prohibit all cluster munitions ever used in armed conflict.  Moreover, the incorporation of the same agreed definitions into the domestic laws of all states-parties ensures consistency of implementation of the convention and enables those states to continue to co-operate with each other, in particular in peacekeeping missions, in accordance with its terms and its agreed standards.</P>
        <P>In addition to the convention&rsquo;s comprehensive ban, its provisions on clearance of unexploded and hazardous cluster munition remnants and on assistance to the victims of cluster munitions, including their families, are a source of particular satisfaction to the Government.  These provisions have been acknowledged as having set a new benchmark in international humanitarian law and the Government will integrate into our development assistance funding and co-operation activities the commitments we undertake pursuant to the convention .</P>
        <P>Perhaps most important, however, is the onus the convention places on those who have caused the damage to assist in the clearance of cluster munitions remnants.  They are strongly encouraged to provide as much assistance as possible, including financial and material aid, to the affected country.  This ensures that countries that engage in the use of these weapons will no longer be able to walk away from the indiscriminate damage they cause.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators, particularly Senator Norris, indicated they would table amendments on Committee Stage, which is their right.  However, a number of amendments were tabled on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il that sought to change what is meant, for the purposes of the Bill, by the terms &ldquo;cluster munition&rdquo; and &ldquo;anti-personnel mines&rdquo;.  These changes would have the effect of broadening the scope of the legislation by prohibiting the use of weapons that are not prohibited by the two conventions concerned.  The Government has not accepted these amendments for a number of reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Mine would be the same amendments basically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government takes the view that we cannot renegotiate the conventions after negotiations have been concluded.  Senator Hannigan made the point that in the coming months all 107 countries will be engaged in the same process as we are engaged in here and will introduce the convention&rsquo;s provisions into their domestic law in a uniform way.  We chaired these negotiations and have an obligation to ensure that the provisions we negotiated are introduced into our law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the legislation be identical in every single country? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That would certainly be the intention.  The people may have different views on the definitions reached.  However, those definitions have been reached by consensus as I indicated before Senator Norris came in.  That was the product of much negotiation and <Col N="401"/>the use of great diplomatic skills by our officials.  That is what we need to deal with and that is why we are implementing it in this way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Minister of State for missing those few sentences.  I needed to take an urgent telephone call.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreement on definitions in both cases was very difficult to secure.  If individual countries then go back home and legislate for different types of weapon systems, it inevitably raises the question of why we sought international agreement in the first place.  Different countries implementing different standards in their domestic laws will frustrate the implementation of the international standard which is the subject of a convention that we all endeavoured to secure.  Moreover, if one country bans a weapon system that is permitted under the relevant convention, it will not be able to work with a country that has not taken this course of action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be great.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be extremely harmful to efforts to assemble international peacekeeping forces under UN mandate.  It would certainly affect the participation of Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces in such operations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Splendid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the practical effects of such amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Excellent.  I will push those amendments with renewed vigour.  I thank the Minister of State for his help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We will certainly deal with those amendments and will be able to deal with them in greater detail.  We welcome amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to reject the idea that the Convention on Cluster Munitions contains loopholes, as some would seem to suggest.  The definition of a cluster munition agreed in the negotiations is a comprehensive one that meets the objective set by the Oslo process of banning all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  A number of systems that do not meet the criterion of causing unacceptable harm to civilians were excluded from the definition of &ldquo;cluster munitions&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What is acceptable harm to civilians?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>These exclusions are replicated in the Bill before us.  The definition in the convention, which is the definition in the Bill, enables us effectively to prohibit all cluster munitions that have ever been used in armed conflict.  I draw the attention of the House to a statement made earlier this month in Geneva by Dr. Philip Spoerri, director for international law and co-operation within the International Committee of the Red Cross, an international organisation that has been intensively involved in dealing with this issue for decades.  It has been at the vanguard in promoting this sort of international convention.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted in Dublin, which the ICRC strongly supports, provides an effective response to the cluster munitions problem.  It meets the ICRC&rsquo;s call for the prohibition of unreliable and inaccurate cluster munitions.  We urge all States to sign this Convention in Oslo and to ratify and implement its provisions as a matter <Col N="402"/>of priority.  In our view, the comprehensive approach taken in this Convention will finally put an end to the long-term suffering among civilian populations that cluster munitions cause.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the considered view of the international body that has been at the vanguard regarding this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke asked a technical question about the placing of a device beneath a car.  If it meets the definition of a cluster munition within the definitions section of the Bill and if it amounts to an action as set out in section 7 or section 9, that person will be charged with an offence under this Act.</P>
        <P>Regarding manufacturers, stockpiles must be destroyed within ten years under the convention.  Cluster munitions can only be transferred in small quantities for training purposes to states that are also parties to the convention.  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts on cluster munitions have not ended with the successful completion of the Dublin conference.  In the run-up to the signature in Oslo, much work has been carried out to encourage as many governments as possible to sign the convention and to promote awareness of it, as many Senators have requested.  Three regional conferences have been held in Sofia, Kampala and Laos, with more to come, aimed at encouraging states to sign and ratify the convention.  Ireland, as one of the core group, has been highly active at these conferences, presenting papers and lobbying governments.  We organised a large event on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly last month to promote the convention.  The reaction has been very positive and international momentum for signature in Oslo continues to grow.  This is a clear and tangible sign that Ireland as a small nation but with a very distinguished history on the international stage is capable of taking the lead on issues such as this one.</P>
        <P>The Oslo process was successful because of the hard work of Ireland and the other core group members, UN organisations, the International Committee for the Red Cross and numerous NGOs.  In particular, the hard work of the Cluster Munition Coalition, including more than 20 Irish NGOs, was vital in creating awareness of the humanitarian consequences of cluster munition use.  Ireland and other key actors intend to begin work immediately after the signing ceremony to ensure that momentum for the convention is maintained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the key issues we have already started to consider are the lessons we have learned from the implementation of the 1997 anti-personnel mine ban treaty and how they might be applied to implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  Ireland will also work to support any actions that will need to be carried out in the run-up to the first meeting of state parties, which must be convened within one year of the entry into force of the convention.</P>
        <P>I again thank Members of this House for their, as usual, constructive contributions on this matter, their suggestions and the amendments that have been signalled.  Those amendments will be considered very closely in advance of Committee State to ensure the Bill is given full, proper and complete consideration so that when it is enacted it will represent the best endeavours of the Lower House and this, the Upper House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister of State is in the House.  I am sure he will be interested in what I have to say on this significant matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 18 November, only a week ago, I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee on Human Rights at which a presentation was given by Mr. Polansky, head of mission, Kosovo Roma Refugee Foundation.  He told an unimaginable story about the establishment of death camps in Europe.  These were established not by the Nazis at the end of the Second World War but by the United Nations allied with a group called Action by Churches Working Together.  I do not wish to impugn the Christian religion or even these people who may have been well intentioned in the beginning, but what they did was absolutely incomprehensible.  They built what effectively is a death camp on one of the most polluted tailing stands from lead mines that exist throughout Europe &mdash; a toxic slag-heap of 100 million tonnes of lead waste.</P>
        <P>To date 77 people have died in the camps.  More than 50 women have aborted because of the lead poisoning.  One mother and her child died in childbirth.  Two of her surviving nine children were found to have the highest levels of lead pollution in their blood in medical history.  Medical experts from Germany and the United States visited the camps and have said that every single child conceived or born within these camps will have irreversible brain damage.  Articles appeared in the international press, in the <i>International Herald </i>Tribune and <i>Bild Zeitung, </i>the German newspaper which took eight children to Germany for medical treatment, and the body scans taken showed that the children had damaged organs and irreversible brain damage.</P>
        <P>I will outline what happened.  Ironically, on Bloomsday, 16 June 1999, the gypsies living in the Kosovo area, of whom there are approximately 130,000, were attacked by Albanian nationalists and driven out.  More than 100,000 fled, 14,000 were left and some of them took refuge in a Serbian school house and were subsequently rehoused by the UN on these tailing ponds.  Protests were made at the time but they were told they would be there for only 45 days.  They are there nine years later.</P>
        <P>The reason given was a legalistic one.  The UN had signed contracts with local contractors so it was a case of to hell with the health of these people, they are expendable, they are only gypsies.  This was a group who had already been targeted by the Nazis.</P>
        <P>The United Nations health office for Mitrovica was asked by the UN administrator, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, who is now the French Foreign Minister, to do a medical survey of Mitrovica because so many UN personnel and French soldiers had been affected by the lead poisoning.  He concluded that the entire city of Mitrovica was subject to lead poisoning and all its citizens had some degree of it.  They were evacuated, but the gypsies remained.  Instead of doing what various reports suggested should be done, namely, that the camps should be closed, they simply opened a jogging track, which they call the &ldquo;alley of health&rdquo;.  This kind of lead poisoning is singly contracted through the lungs, through breathing in, yet they have this alley of health.  It is like the safe havens we were told about, a complete abuse of language, as is the alley of health.</P>
        <P>With the assistance of the Action by Churches Working Together and the UN, they cut off the food supplies and then cut off the water supply.  The people were drinking water from the <Col N="404"/>tailing ponds and scavenging in heavily polluted rubbish tips.  How Christian was that and how much was that in the line of the work of the United Nations?</P>
        <P>In summer 2004 a special investigation was undertaken after a girl of four years of age died of lead poisoning.  Blood samples showed that many of the children had lead levels higher than the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s analyser could register.  They were off the scale.  Nothing like that had been seen before.  If lead levels are above 40 mg/dl of blood, irreversible brain damage occurs &mdash; it usually begins at the level of 10 mg/dl of blood &mdash; but these people had levels of 120 mg/dl of blood.</P>
        <P>The United Nations then decided to study the problem.  First, there was the legalistic approach, then the UN was out of its tree as far as medical knowledge is concerned and then it decided to undertake a study.  The UN moved the people to a new camp, supposedly lead free, called Osterode.  This was even worse.  The UN spent &euro;500,000 refurbishing the camp.  It cemented over the ground and declared it lead free.  The poisoning comes from the air so cementing the ground is no use whatever.  Inevitably the people became more infected.</P>
        <P>Then the UN  tried tinkering with the people&rsquo;s diet.  Dietary changes in the case of lead poisoning only affect 20% maximum and only then when they have been removed from the source of the contamination, but the UN did not do that.  It carried out another study complete with some medical blood tests and so on, the findings of which it refused to share either with the gypsies or with international organisations.  Random blood tests of 105 children in April 2008 showed staggering results.  For many of the children living in the alleged lead free camp of Osterode, their lead levels had doubled since moving from the one that was now recognised to be polluted.  In other words, the situation had become significantly worse.</P>
        <P>A report was then completed by the USAID/Mercy Corp project.  It called for the resettlement of 50 of the 120 families in the camps.  There was no immediate medical solution and no proper evacuation &mdash; evacuation was not mentioned.  The author had not even visited the camps.  He did not know what he was talking about.  Yet having spent &euro;500,000, on the nonsensical refurbishment of an earlier death camp, they now spent &euro;2.4 million on useless interventions.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the legalistic futile approach of the authorities there and their seeking studies and reports, the findings of which they ignored.  There is a compensation system under the UN rules, but the United Nations lawyers have steadfastly fought against the compensation claims.  They have refused to co-operate with lawyers representing the gypsies.  They have made no attempt to do so.  The UN does not deny responsibility but it simply refuses to comply with its own ethical standards.</P>
        <P>In 2005 the Society for Threatened Peoples, the largest NGO in Germany after the Red Cross, brought the leading German expert on toxic poisoning, Dr. Klaus Runow, to the camp.  The UN tried to ban him but he managed to get 60 hair samples.  They were sent to a well-known laboratory in the city of Chicago.  The results showed that most of the children had the highest level of lead pollution in their blood in medical history and all of them had toxic levels of poisoning of 36 other heavy metals as well.</P>
        <P>I will end by outlining something that happened in the past few months.  Mr. Paul Polansky gave this account:</P>
        <P LI="1">A few months ago another Gypsy baby died in Osterode.  It was one month old and had been born with a large head, swollen belly and miniature legs.  It woke at six in the morning, vomiting, and died twenty minutes later in hospital.  Lead poisoning is a hideous and painful death for children.  Four-year-old Jenita Mehmeti was attending the camp kindergarten when <Col N="405"/>her teacher noticed she was losing her memory and finding it hard to walk.  Jenita was sent back to her barracks where for the next three months she vomited several times a day, before becoming paralysed and dying.</P>
        <P>When her two year old sister came down with the same symptoms the United Nations doctor for the city of Mitrovica refused to accept her as a patient or treat her because she was living one kilometre outside his jurisdiction.  That is an appalling reversal and denial of the hippocratic oath.  Luckily an NGO that has a conscience took her to Belgrade and saved her life.  The United Nations intervened to save Albanian nationalist forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army and evacuated them to the United States of America, yet it has supervised the imprisonment of these people in unspeakable conditions.</P>
      
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to take up this matter in the strongest possible way with the United Nations.  It is an organisation for which I have great respect.  It has its difficulties.  It is the only fallible instrument we have to protect us against the likes of George Bush or Saddam Hussein and we need it, but when it is wrong, it must be slapped down and told that it must not behave in this barbarous fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this disturbing case on the Adjournment.  I share his horror about the horrific effects of lead poisoning, especially on children, which I witnessed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As the Senator may be aware, the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities in the former Yugoslavia had a total population of approximately 8,000.  Following the outbreak of conflict in the early 1990s, the Roma Mahala community was forced to flee from its traditional home of the same name in southern Kosovo.  Some went to camps in northern Kosovo, while others were displaced to Serbia, Montenegro and western Europe.  Since then, international efforts to return minority groups to their place of origin have continued.  In particular, efforts to facilitate the return home of the Roma Mahala intensified after the end of the conflict in Kosovo in 1999.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the plight of the Roma Mahala and has supported a broad range of projects targeted at helping them.  For the period 2005 to 2009, Irish Aid, the section of the Department of Foreign Affairs for which I have responsibility, has allocated &euro;850,000 towards development work with the Roma Mahala and a further &euro;200,000 has been provided for the World Bank&rsquo;s Roma Education Fund, which has benefited the Roma community in 11 countries in central and eastern Europe, including Kosovo.</P>
        <P>The Government was one of the first donors to the initial phase of the Return to Roma Mahala project, which successfully resettled 90 Roma families in their places of origin.  Between 2005 and 2006, &euro;250,000 was provided to the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, to support the return of displaced refugees to Roma Mahala.</P>
        <P>For the period 2008 to 2009, more than &euro;600,000 has been committed to the Danish Refugee Council for a project aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities to build sustainable livelihoods and to support their economic and social integration into Kosovo society.  However, as Senator Norris correctly pointed out, many problems remain.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and I are deeply concerned about the current position of members of the Roma Mahala community who are living in camps in northern Mitrovica in Kosovo.  I am aware of reports that residents of those camps, especially young children who are highly vulnerable to lead intoxication, are exposed to high levels of lead contamination from disused mines in the area.  Senator Norris clearly and eloquently pointed that out.</P>
<Col N="406"/>
        <P>In response to information received on the issue in late July, the Minister asked officials in our embassy in Athens, accredited to Kosovo at that time, to raise our serious concern with UNMIK.  They were advised that UNMIK&rsquo;s Office of Communities, Returns and Minorities Affairs is supporting the Kosovar Ministry of Communities and Returns as it assumes responsibility for the management of the camps.  The Ministry is working closely with all stakeholders to pursue permanent housing solutions for all Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian internally displaced persons, IDPs, in the region.  That includes resettlement of the remaining IDPs who are residing in the areas subject to lead contamination.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Minister, Deputy Martin, concerns on the matter were also raised later in the summer with the International Civilian Office, ICO, in Kosovo and with the head of UNMIK, Mr. Lamberto Zannier.  The Minister has instructed officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs to continue monitoring developments and to ensure that our EU and international partners remain fully seized of Ireland&rsquo;s concerns.  Officials of the Department met recently with Mr. Paul Polansky, an expert on the living conditions of Roma people residing in the camps, for an update on the matter.</P>
        <P>At a European Union meeting on the western Balkans held in Brussels on Wednesday, 19 November, the Irish representative raised the issue with the Presidency and the Commission.  Furthermore, the Irish delegate to the meeting of the International Steering Group on Kosovo, which took place in Brussels on Friday last, raised the issue of IDPs, with particular reference to the plight of the Roma community residing in northern Mitrovica.  The Department is also monitoring progress on this question through liaison with NGOs working in the area.</P>
        <P>The process of state building continues in Kosovo and its institutional framework is being established.  Our embassy in Budapest, which is now accredited to Kosovo, will continue to monitor the situation through the relevant authorities and international supervisory institutions.</P>
        <P>This is a matter of great concern to me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We will continue to impress upon all parties concerned the need to work together for an urgent and sustainable solution to this serious problem.  I assure Senator Norris every opportunity will be taken to encourage the responsible agencies of the UN and the EU to help find such a solution and take forward the safe and secure resettlement of the Roma people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his humane reply, which I know comes directly from the heart.  The UNMIK people at the UN have obfuscated all the way along the line.  We cannot accept what they say and the Minister of State should not take anything they say on trust.  We must really put teeth into the monitoring process and push for those unfortunate people to be removed from the source of pollution immediately.  The matter is very urgent, as is shown by that ghastly tale of the small girl who died within recent months with miniature legs and in terrible agony.  We cannot allow any more of that.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for attending to deal with the issue.  I wish to outline my concern at the situation regarding the community swimming pool in Dunmanway.  I was informed a few years ago by the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, that refurbishment work would be carried out on the pool and subsequent to that there was a possibility that a brand new pool would be built.  The pool serves a population of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 people, depending on how one looks at it.  People from Macroom, Kinsale and all over west Cork use the pool.  It is a valuable asset to the town of Dunmanway and the hinterland as well as the entire area of west Cork.</P>
<Col N="407"/>
        <P>At one stage a clear commitment was given by the then Minister to provide the maximum grant aid available, which at that time was in the region of &euro;3.8 million, provided that Cork County Council prioritised it.  I understand that Cork County Council had prioritised both Cobh and Youghal, and Dunmanway was next in line.  That was four years ago.  I hope the Minister will have some positive news for me on the Dunmanway swimming pool project.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  As he is aware, the local authority swimming pool programme is administered by my Department.  The programme provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new public swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing public swimming pools provided by local authorities or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.  Cork County Council submitted an application on the Dunmanway swimming pool before the closing date for the receipt of such proposals, which was 31 July 2000.</P>
        <P>Under the programme a maximum grant of &euro;3.8 million can be obtained for a project.  There are four principal stages which must be undertaken by a local authority in developing a swimming pool project.  Those are preliminary report, including feasibility study, contract documents, tender stage and construction stage.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender is approved.  The Department&rsquo;s technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage.</P>
        <P>Two proposals were submitted by Cork County Council to my Department in respect of the Dunmanway swimming pool project.  The first proposal was for the refurbishment of the existing pool together with an extension to accommodate additional facilities, including a gym.  A preliminary report on that proposal was approved in March 2001.  The second proposal was for the demolition of the existing facility and a rebuild to incorporate the pool, gym and ancillary facilities.  That was received in December 2001.  The OPW advised that the second proposal made a convincing case for a replacement pool.  However, as Cork County Council envisaged a private company operating and managing the pool, the OPW instructed that the operators of the facility should be sourced and involved prior to contract preparation so that their requirements might be incorporated in the design.  The council tendered for operators on two occasions but received only one submission.</P>
        <P>On re-examining the matter this year, the council is considering reverting to the original proposal of refurbishing the existing pool and building an extension to accommodate additional facilities, including a gymnasium.  The local authority intends to operate the pool using its own employees and may outsource the management of the gym.  It has, therefore, instructed JODA Engineering Consultants, the consultants appointed for this project, to update the costs of both proposals with the intention of making a final decision within the next month or so on which proposal to pursue.  The council will notify the Department once a final decision has been made.   When this decision is made, the Dunmanway project can be progressed by the council.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  On a number of occasions in the Seanad, I have referred to the high level of unemployment nationally, particularly in my county, Donegal.  County Donegal had been experiencing a recession for many decades before the national recession.  Donegal had the highest level of unemployment, at approximately 18%, which was three or four times above the national average.  In the past year, there has been a considerable increase in the number of people made redundant in Donegal.  There has been a 58% increase in the past year alone.  This represents an increase of almost 5,000 people, from 8,321 to 13,145.  In Donegal, 100 people are losing their jobs every week.  This figure is based <Col N="408"/>on the last census but, since that census was carried out, companies have been closing down for Christmas and are not sure whether they will reopen.  The council has announced there are to be 238 redundancies among council staff.  This leads to one big problem, that is, access to social welfare payments in the county.</P>
        <P>There is no way that the social welfare service that has been in place until recently, which service was adequate and could issue benefits to those in need of them in reasonable time, can deal with the increase in demand.  Some 5,000 people have lost their jobs over the space of a year and, therefore, some adjustments are required.  The crisis point was when the social welfare office in Letterkenny had to close its doors to the public so its staff could catch up on some work.  There needs to be a redeployment of staff to the Donegal area.</P>
        <P>A number of social welfare offices are under serious pressure.  The Minister of Social and Family Affairs answered a parliamentary question stating the average waiting time in Letterkenny is five and a half weeks and that in Buncrana it is three and a half weeks, but the reality on the ground is somewhat different.  I do not dispute the average figures but they are only averages.  I spoke to someone last week who has been waiting for a social welfare payment for seven weeks.  He has been unemployed for the past 12 weeks and, for whatever reason, it took him five weeks to claim his benefit.  He has had no support for 12 weeks from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  That is unsustainable.  When one loses one&rsquo;s job, the bills do not stop coming in and the mortgage payments must still be made.  There needs to be a mechanism to deal with the problem more efficiently and effectively.</P>
        <P>It is not just a question of those who have become unemployed and who need to avail of the social welfare service to receive their payments, we must also consider the staff in the social welfare offices, who are under considerable pressure.  The 5,000 additional people who have become unemployed and those who may become unemployed in Donegal next week have sustained our economy in the good times.  They built the economy and contributed to the Celtic tiger.  It is very disrespectful to them that their social welfare entitlements are not forthcoming in a speedy manner and that they have to wait so long.</P>
        <P>Four new positions are to be created in the social welfare offices in the Donegal region.  I am not an expert but my feeling is that, with 5,000 additional people availing of the social welfare service &mdash; this week we heard of 238 job losses in the county council and of a factory in trouble &mdash; four people will not be able to deal with the demand.  I ask the Minister to consider this case compassionately.  Although the wage bill would be increased by employing extra staff in the social welfare offices, doing so would be the correct and respectful approach given that social welfare recipients need their money most in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister will be well aware that a company in Donegal has let its staff go for the month of December.  The workers are very concerned about whether they will receive any entitlements from the social welfare office by Christmas.  We are all human and want to buy presents for our children, parents, wives and husbands.  It is not right that the workers should be concerned.  They are entitled to their payments, which will be back-dated at some stage.  While I understand we are living in unique times, we need to pull out all the stops to address this matter.</P>
        <P>One person entitled to community welfare support showed me his cheque last week and it amounted to &euro;28.  I asked another person about his payment but he said he was not entitled to it due to anomalies associated with the requirement to work for 32 hours.  I will not elaborate on that because it is another matter.  The matter in question is that staff are required in counties such as Donegal, which has experienced a considerable increase in the number signing on, such that those entitled to social welfare supports can avail of them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  Unemployment supports for people who have lost their jobs, namely, the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, are administered in County Donegal from local offices located in Letterkenny, Buncrana, Dunfanaghy, Dungloe and Donegal town, in addition to branch offices under contract to the Department in Donegal town, Ballybofey, Ballyshannon and Killybegs.</P>
        <P>The number of people on the live register in Donegal has increased by 62% in the past year, leading to a similar increase in the claims being received for jobseeker&rsquo;s assistance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payments.  A total of 11,495 such claims were received in the Donegal local and branch offices in the first ten months of 2007.  This compares with 17,820 claims in the first ten months of 2008.</P>
        <P>In addition to dealing with jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit payments, the Department&rsquo;s local and branch offices in Donegal deal with supports for farmers under the farm assistance allowance scheme, supports for those seeking to resume employment or return to full-time education under the back-to-work and back-to-education allowance schemes and supports for lone parents under the one-parent family payment scheme.</P>
        <P>Despite the significant increase in the numbers claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and benefit, and the intake of claims for the other supports, every effort is being made to ensure that claims are processed and paid, where due, as speedily as possible.  On average, 62% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims and 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims are being processed within two weeks of application.</P>
        <P>While every effort is made to process claims speedily, delays sometimes arise where investigations into qualifying conditions, such as means in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, or social insurance contributions in the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, are required.  Delays can also occur where applicants are required to supply information or documentation from employers or other sources.  Recognising the difficulty such delays can cause for those who require these supports when becoming unemployed, every effort is made to assist applicants in the completion of application forms, in their interviews with local inspectors and in obtaining all necessary documentation in support of their applications.  Delays are usually experienced only in cases in which essential information or documentation is outstanding.</P>
        <P>The Department reviews its business processes on an ongoing basis to ensure streamlined service delivery in these times of increasing demand for unemployment supports.  Initiatives in this respect include the fast-tracking of straightforward cases, a speedier decision mechanism in local offices in cases where the claim form indicates further investigation by an inspector or the local office is unwarranted and interim decisions on claims in respect of which certain outstanding documentation is not considered critical.  A proactive approach to dealing with new applications for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is also undertaken in circumstances where it is known when a company plans to lay off staff.  In such circumstances, officials from the Department&rsquo;s local offices may visit the company and advise on the completion of the application forms, or the company may supply a list of those to be laid off, stating the date from which this will occur.  The local office will then commence work immediately on these cases.  This year, additional staffing resources have been allocated to the local office network to deal with jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claims and it is planned to allocate further resources over the coming months.</P>
        <P>A delay of up to two months in the payment of an entitlement to an unemployment support would be exceptional in County Donegal.  However, all applicants for these payments are entitled to make a claim for supplementary welfare allowance at the local Health Service Executive, HSE, centre pending the outcome of investigations, supply of supporting documentation and a decision on the claim.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The information I have is that four new positions will be made available to County Donegal.  I do not think that will go far enough but perhaps the Department has made an assessment that this number is what is required.  I believe more positions are needed.  What strikes me is that information is not included in the response.  Does the Minister have any further information about those four positions?  Will they be deployed to County Donegal?</P>
        <P>The Minister said that a delay of up to two months in payment is exceptional in County Donegal.  Does he recognise that the average waiting time in Letterkenny is five and a half weeks?  That is the average wait for everyone availing of social welfare payments in the Letterkenny area and is not exceptional.  I am sure the Minister is aware that one of the problems is that after waiting five and a half weeks or, in the case of those people who are on the other side of the average, six, seven or eight weeks, the applicants do not get all their entitlement.  They get their weekly allowance and the other weeks&rsquo; payments are posted to them at a later date.  Even when the application is processed and they get their first payment, it is only one week&rsquo;s due.  That is a significant problem.</P>
        <P>The Minister corrected my figures which were wrong in the context of the level of unemployment.  I should have said 62%.  Something must be done.  Perhaps the Minister might bring the issue back to the Department to find out if these positions are to be moved into County Donegal.  If that is the case, they should be moved as soon as possible in order that some of the backlog could be addressed in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any additional information.  If I had, I would make it available to the Senator.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, will communicate with him.  It is quite clear from the reply that more resources need to be and are being invested.  I am not sure where the figure of four, referred to by Senator Doherty, fits in but the Department will be able to clarify this for him.  I have no doubt, as a former Minister in this Department, that there is a good work ethic and commitment to try to resolve this issue for people who desperately need assistance, especially when they have lost their jobs.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, we are now coming into the Christmas season and I am sure that the Department will try to do everything to facilitate those outstanding matters.</P>
