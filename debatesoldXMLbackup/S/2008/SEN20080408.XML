	<P>I wish on my behalf and that of my fellow Senators to welcome to the House Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, President of the European Parliament.  Today is the second occasion on which this House has been honoured by an address by the President of the European Parliament, the last occasion being October 2002 when the then President, Mr. Pat Cox, addressed Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Since then, there have been major and significant developments and shifts in national and international affairs.  Notwithstanding the impact of such changes, the wisdom underlying the founding principles of the now European Union remains undiminished.</P>
        <P>In that context, the political career of our distinguished guest is testament to how a broken and fragmented Europe could be restructured to serve and honour the needs of all its citizens.  Even a glance of the titles of some of Mr. P&ouml;ttering&rsquo;s published works indicate the scope of his vision and dedication to furthering the values and objectives of the European Union.  On a personal level, Mr. P&ouml;ttering continues to pursue his interest in cross-cultural dialogue and I am sure his work in this area will have served to deepen his belief that dialogue is probably the most potent instrument humanity has to confront and resolve the challenges of an always uncertain future.</P>
        <P>In that spirit of dialogue, it gives me great pleasure to invite Mr. P&ouml;ttering, President of the European Parliament, to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering</NameTxt>
	<P>A Chathaoirligh agus a Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, is m&oacute;r an on&oacute;ir dom a bheith anseo inniu libh san &aacute;ras &aacute;rsa seo.  For your benefit and mine, I will continue in English.  It is even more for my benefit that I do so.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>On behalf of the European Parliament, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kind invitation.  Let me at the outset thank Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann here today for inviting me to address your Chamber.  This is a great honour for me and the European Parliament.  As the leader of one democratic institution to Members of another I say, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;  As President of the European Parliament, I hope to visit every one of the 27 member states of the EU during my two and a half year term of office.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to be here in Ireland at a very important time in the context of the future development of the European Union.  The last President of the European Parliament to address the Irish Seanad was Mr. Pat Cox, as mentioned by the Cathaoirleach.  He was a great ambassador for the European Union during his tenure of office.  We worked in an excellent way together on the basis of common ideals and goals.  Pat Cox was an extraordinary President of the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>I am, if Members will allow me to say, one of only six members of the European Parliament who have been there without interruption since the first direct elections were held in 1979.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past 29 years I have made many Irish friends in Europe, many of whom have held very high office at European level.  I started my work in 1979 in the regional committee which was and is so important for Ireland.  The co-ordinator for my group was Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Donnell who has been always a good friend.  I am happy to see here Mary Banotti, with whom I also worked closely in the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>Mr. Peter Sutherland was an inspiring member of the European Commission.  He revolutionised the European airline industry by opening up the European airline sector to competition in the 1980s.  We have all seen the clear success of this policy with cheaper air fares.  As an island nation, the Irish people are aware of the benefits of this policy more than most.</P>
        <P>Mr. Ray MacSharry as EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development reformed the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992.  The Common Agricultural Policy was the first truly European Community policy and it remains an important EU-wide initiative in terms of the EU budget and in terms of what it says about a community built on solidarity and human concerns.  For Ireland, it is worth &euro;2.2 billion in payments from Europe to Irish farmers and to Irish rural communities during the current financing perspective from 2007 to 2013.</P>
        <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Dick Spring, ran an impressive Irish Presidency of the European Union in 1996.  John, who is a good friend of mine with whom I liaised closely during a crucial time as presidency member of the European Convention, the body which drafted the constitutional treaty, is now a very highly respected and influential EU ambassador to the United States of America.</P>
        <P>The internal market Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, currently heads up economic policy making at European level and in recent times has been dealing with the EU response to current difficulties on the international financial markets.</P>
        <P>In the current legislature, Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP, is chairman of the fourth largest political group.  He always has been a good and reliable colleague and friend.  Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, chaired our committee of inquiry into equitable life insurance.  Ms Avril Doyle, MEP, has been just nominated rapporteur on the emission trading scheme and will steer through parliament this key piece of EU climate change legislation.</P>
        <P>I have a good working relationship with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, and with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Enda Kenny, who is from the same pan-European political family <Col N="3"/>as myself.  I must be more objective, but I am sure Members will allow me to mention that.  Deputy Enda Kenny is now the vice president of the European People&rsquo;s Party.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not only is Ireland a long-standing member of the European Union since 1973, it is a leading member of the Union and is playing a key role in policy making at a European level.  I recall &mdash; if I as a German am allowed to say this in this important Chamber &mdash; when we were in the process of German unification following the fall of the Berlin Wall, that the crucial decisions were taken in Dublin during the 1990 Irish Presidency under the Government of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, who is here. They seized the historical momentum and carefully sought the agreement of the European partners. The current secretary general of the European Commission is an Irish woman, Ms Catherine Day.  The country has important ladies in office.  I have just come from the castle &mdash; I do not know if that is the appropriate word to describe it &mdash; but it is a beautiful house where I met Madam President, Mary McAleese, a short while ago.  The previous secretary general of the European Commission was also one of your countrymen, Mr. David O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>
        <P>In 2004, when we had an Irish President of the Parliament, an Irish President of the Council and an Irish secretary general of the Commission, I recall thinking the Irish have taken over the place, but they have done so with charm, good humour and remarkable efficiency.  I thank the Members for this.  They should take over the leadership of the European Union more often; the so-called bigger countries would learn a great deal from the Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has been a highly respected member of the European Union from day one.  Many countries, particularly the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe who acceded to the Union in 2004 during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, look on this country as a role model in Europe.  When I travel to countries such as Poland, Lithuania or Slovakia, I hear people talk about the Irish model of making the most out of the opportunities presented by EU membership and turning their countries into economic success stories.  Ireland has left its mark on the Union in many ways.</P>
        <P>One policy where Irish influence is very strong in Europe is in the area of development aid.  Ireland is the sixth largest contributor of development aid <i>per capita</i> in the world.  It will contribute &euro;922 million in development aid this year.  As a country that was once poor, but which has grown wealthy within Europe, Ireland has not forgotten what it was to be without.  Ireland has been a shining example in a Union which itself shows the way to the rest of the world, and it can be proud of this.</P>
        <P>The role of Irish NGOs in overseeing and participating in many EU development aid programmes at all times deserves the highest of praise.  Many of these volunteers from civil and religious society work in extremely difficult environments.  The European Union seeks to promote democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law around the world.  The European Union project is a force for peace.  The EU has brought peace to the continent of Europe after two very destructive world wars in the 20th century.  As a German, born in September 1945 and growing up in the aftermath of the evil destruction of the Second World War and the Holocaust, my personal commitment to the European project was shaped by the determination of visionaries such as Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, Aldice de Gasperi and others, that never again should there be war between the peoples of Europe.  Schuman&rsquo;s dream that war should not only be morally repugnant but also made materially impossible, has been made a reality.  This is unique, not only in European history, but in world history also, and is the basis of our European engagement.</P>
        <?oasys cl14- ?><P>I support the European Union participating in peacekeeping operations around the world, with the backing of the United Nations.  EU peacekeeping missions have successfully served in ATSI, Indonesia, Palestine, Bosnia and Kosovo.  Having brought peace to our continent, I am proud that we are helping to build a global peace.  The 4,500-strong EU peacekeeping mission <Col N="4"/>is now being deployed in Chad.  This mission will help to address many of the humanitarian problems at present being faced by the 300,000 refugees in the camps in eastern Chad.  The men, women and children in these camps have fled from the barbarity of the genocide that is taking place in Sudan.  The international community must continue to do more to stop militia attacks against the people of Darfur.  This EU peacekeeping operation, with United Nations support, is under the strong leadership of an Irishman, Lt. General Patrick Nash, and will help to bring stability and peace to Chad and the volatile central African region.</P>
        <P>The European Union aims to help build a world where peace and understanding triumph over hostility and despair.  On the 50th anniversary of Ireland first taking part in United Nations peacekeeping, I should like to pay tribute to all the Irish Army personnel who have served &mdash; and continue to serve &mdash; on some 75 UN missions to date.  The Irish flag has flown together with the United Nations banner in many parts of the world, and I am sure it will continue to do so for many years to come.</P>
        <P>By good fortune, my first visit to Ireland as President of the European Parliament is within a few days of the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a useful occasion to reflect on the role that the European Union has played in bringing peace and reconciliation to the island of Ireland.  Irish and British membership of the European Union undoubtedly provided the common space that helped to build the close relations between political leaders.  These close relations, in turn, helped create the conditions in which peace could flourish.</P>
        <P>Since 1995, the European Union has also contributed more than &euro;1.65 billion in financial support to promote economic and social regeneration within the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  This support has been given through a variety of funds, including the INTERREG cross-border programme, the EU PEACE fund, mainstream Structural Funds and the International Fund for Ireland.  The European Parliament has always overwhelmingly supported strong EU financial aid programmes for Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The peace process in Ireland can and must be used as a model to help resolve other conflicts in Europe and around the world.  Ireland has shown that it can achieve peace but that it takes real courage, determination, leadership, understanding and forgiveness.</P>
        <P>As a Catholic, I am impressed that the Seanad starts its meetings with a prayer.  I am sorry that I was not in the Chamber for it.  Personalities who do this can forgive and this is part of our beliefs and values.  I congratulate the Members on having the courage to pray in their Chamber.  This is a very personal remark and I thank the Members for giving this example.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering</NameTxt>
	<P>John Hume, who together with David Trimble won the Nobel Peace Prize, was a great Member of the European Parliament.  We worked together from 1979 in the regional committee.  He described the European Union itself as the greatest peace process in history.  MEPs from Ireland and Northern Ireland have worked and have continued to work together within the European Parliament on issues of common concern, including on EU regional, social and agricultural policy, consumer protection initiatives and cross-border co-operation.</P>
        <P>The Single Market has been a great success for the European Union, including Ireland.  It has been vital for Ireland as an exporting country with a very open economy.  With the elimination of transaction costs, the single European currency, the euro, has brought clear benefits to consumers and businesses alike.  We should ask ourselves where Europe would be at this time of economic difficulty, and with trouble on the international financial markets, if the euro did not exist.  People are not thinking of the great advantage afforded by the European currency.  If our common currency were not an operating currency in 15 different member states, <Col N="5"/>we would be in the same situation we were in 1992 when international currency speculators played one EU currency off against the other.</P>
        <P>Let me make some remarks on the reform treaty.  When the treaty was signed in Lisbon on 13 December, I spoke about the remarkable growth in democracy in the European Union in the short period since the first European election in 1979.  Democracy is a big winner in this treaty.  The treaty helps to promote the democratic legitimacy of the European Union.  From its starting point as an appointed and consultative Assembly in 1958, the now directly-elected European Parliament has become the true voice of almost 500 million European citizens.  It is now an equal player with a Council of Ministers on a range of policy issues.  The Lisbon reform treaty will boost our so-called co-decision powers to almost 100% of European policy areas.  The treaty also extends the role of national parliaments and gives them, including this House, the guardianship of subsidiarity.  Members of the Seanad and their fellow parliamentarians will protect the balance between the Union and the member states.</P>
        <P>I would like to dispel the myth that the European Union is all powerful.  Under the doctrine of conferral, the European Union has only the powers the different EU treaties drawn up by the member states give it.  For example, the EU does not set our tax rates, regardless of what one reads in the newspapers.  It does not run our health, education and social services, nor does it decide our citizenship laws.  The Union does only those things that the member states have decided to do together since they can achieve better results by acting in common than by acting alone on a national level.  The essential secret of the EU&rsquo;s success is that it is a unique union of member states which respects the interests and rights of all of them, whether they are great or small.  I wish that the so-called great countries would appreciate more the work of the smaller countries, from whose behaviour &mdash; especially Ireland &mdash; they could learn a great deal.</P>
        <P>This reform treaty is about ensuring the European Union can become even more democratic, more efficient and more effective in how it will carry out its business into the future.  Strong European institutions are the best guarantee for the implementation of solidarity and ensuring the concerns of all member states, large, medium and small alike, are taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>The European Union must face up to new challenges such as ensuring climate change targets are met on time, energy supplies are protected, greater co-operation at an EU level to tackle cross-border drug smuggling, confronting organised crime and defeating international terrorism.  These challenges are clearly too large for any one country to meet and therefore we must meet them the European way by pooling our resources and working together.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will make some remarks on climate change.  The European Union has promised to lead the world towards a global post-Kyoto agreement with binding targets.  The eyes of the world will be on us throughout 2008 and 2009 until Copenhagen.  We must fulfil these expectations.  I recently visited the United Nations and the Secretary General and all other people I met there asked us &mdash; and they support us &mdash;  to take a real leadership.  To take leadership in a question of preserving the environment or, as I would prefer to say, preserving the creation is a wonderful, peaceful leadership we have the responsibility to accept.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>With the energy package, the European Union now has a sound and credible policy framework for achieving the goals it has set itself.  Putting the European Union on the path to a low-carbon future certainly demands a considerable commitment, but it also brings real opportunities for growth and increased competitiveness.  If the European Union manages to take the lead in environmental-friendly technologies such as carbon capture and storage, this would give it a decisive competitive edge on the global market.</P>
        <P>To fulfil its role as European co-legislator and to be able to make well-informed choices, in April last year the European Parliament established the Temporary Committee on Climate Change.  This committee will play a critical role in achieving a deal on the energy package.  We <Col N="6"/>want to achieve a result before the European elections in June 2009 and thus in time for the United Nations conference which will take place in Copenhagen the following December.  If we do not succeed in this, the Europeans will not have a position and this conference might fail.  Therefore, the work in the European Parliament is important and I ask all of the Senators to support us.</P>
        <P>Adopting the energy package as soon as possible is also a matter of credibility, as the European Union&rsquo;s role as leader in the fight against climate change is not just about setting targets.  If we want to be able to convince our partners world wide to participate in a global and binding framework, we will have to deliver.</P>
      
        <P>The European Parliament has overwhelmingly endorsed the Lisbon reform treaty.  I wish to state clearly that I fully support this treaty, as indeed I backed the earlier constitutional treaty which was agreed under the skilful negotiations of the 2004 Irish Presidency.  However, I also wish to make it clear that the method of ratification in each of the 27 member states is a matter for that country alone.  Ratification through national parliaments is as equally valid and legitimate as the referendum due to be held in Ireland by virtue of its Constitution.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that it is in the future economic and political interest of the European Union as a whole that this treaty be ratified.  This House will understand that I will be hoping for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote by the Irish electorate on referendum day.  However, this is, of course, a decision that only the Irish voters can make and it is not up to me or any other person to tell them how to vote.</P>
        <P>I trust in the wisdom of the Irish electorate which is perhaps the best-informed electorate in the EU about European matters.  This is in no small way due to its excellent National Forum on Europe under the very fair and able chairmanship of a former Member of this House, Maurice Hayes.  I pay tribute to him and the work of his excellent body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering</NameTxt>
	<P>This is yet another area where Ireland has shown leadership.  Many European countries have followed by creating such mechanisms to involve citizens and civil society in EU policymaking.  </P>
        <P>If the House allows it, I urge that a balanced and reasoned debate during this referendum campaign takes place in Ireland over the coming weeks.  All interested parties need to be given space to air their views.  I hope that scare tactics and falsehoods are avoided.  I hear from colleagues from the European Parliament who mislead the Irish people.  We should reject this.</P>
        <P>I am a believer in the defence of human life.  If somebody says that this is affected by European law and this reform treaty, it is not true.  The matter of how Ireland protects life is a matter for Irish policy.  I say this as a Catholic.  I defend Ireland&rsquo;s position.  Ireland should not believe these people and should look into their backgrounds, from where they received their education and what they want to tell today.  I am very outspoken because I am annoyed by what I sometimes read and hear, particularly from one colleague from the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>As Members of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, I am sure that Members will all take a particular interest in the provisions of the Lisbon treaty that, for the first time, give a legally guaranteed role to national parliaments in the EU legislative process.  The European Parliament greatly welcomes this development as we see the national parliaments as our partners in ensuring strong parliamentarianism, which is key to democratic control over the executive branch of government.  It is on this basis that we organise regular joint parliamentary meetings of the European Parliament and national parliaments so that we can co-operate on <Col N="7"/>such issues of concern to our electorates as climate change, the cultural dialogue and the Lisbon strategy.</P>
        <P>While economic integration is an ongoing process at an EU level, the European Union has always been conscious of the need to ensure that cultural, linguistic and national diversities are fully protected and promoted within a European context.  Unity in diversity is our ambition.  On 1 January 2007, the Irish language &mdash; Gaelic &mdash; became an official language of the European Union following a proposal by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and supported by all 27 EU governments.  This is another example of how the EU respects and promotes diversity.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, where injustice rears its ugly head around the world and where there are breaches of human rights, Europe must speak out, regardless of whether these take place in Israel, Palestine, Tibet, Zimbabwe, Guantanamo Bay or Belarus, which is the last Stalinist dictatorship in Europe.  Let us never forget that the eastern part of our continent lived in a situation in which Belarus is still living and it is our duty to defend the people in their peaceful fight for democracy and legal order.  Let us not forget the people of Belarus.</P>
        <P>Speaking with one voice, representing 500 million people and 27 different countries, the EU can and should play a more influential role on the international stage.  The European Union can be a strong voice and a force for peace, freedom, justice and democracy.  Europe is a force for good, but we must keep communicating to the people of Europe so that they can fully understand what work is being carried out at a political level in the European Union.  We can look on the achievements of those who founded the European Union with a great sense of pride.  From an initial six member states in 1957 there are now 27 members with many other European countries seeking membership of the Union.  This is a serious sign that Europe is heading in the right direction.  The people in Ireland can look on their achievements in Europe with a great sense of pride.  They have brought common sense, innovation and commitment to the European decision-making table, and in the name of the European Parliament I thank Ireland and its people for the great Irish contribution to European unity.</P>
        <P>A former Member of this House, Michael Yeats, was a member of the pre-1979 European Parliament.  His father, Ireland&rsquo;s great national poet, W. B. Yeats, of course also served his country as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I would like to conclude by quoting some lines of one of his most beautiful poems.  For me these lines bring to mind the delicate nature of what we have constructed together in Europe, inspired by the dreams and visions of that great post-war generation:</P>
        <P LI="1">But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</P>
        <P LI="1">I have spread my dreams under your feet;</P>
        <P LI="1">Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the president.  We have approximately 40 minute left and I will call representatives of each group to ask questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>While not the format we had originally intended, we will just ask questions now.  If anyone was in any way inconvenienced, I wish to apologise.  However, it will not take away from this wonderful occasion.  The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering MEP, is very welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We are honoured by his presence today.  We welcome him as someone who has shown unreserved commitment to co-operation and reconciliation among European peoples and states.  We salute him as one of a very select group of Members of the European Parliament who have served since the first direct <Col N="8"/>elections to the parliament in 1979.  Like the president, I also am a September 1945 person, which gives us something in common.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>The development of the European Union has seen a continent turn its back on an old nationalist way and through economic and political co-operation, consigned to history disastrous individualism.  At its heart has been the determination of member states to act in unity for the benefit of all members.  Ireland has been a member of the European Union for the past 32 years and the Union is now part and parcel of everyday life for this country.  Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Union has been a key factor in the transformation of the Irish economy over the past decade.  In particular, our access to the vast EU internal market, the richest and most sophisticated in the world, has been vital to securing investment and jobs in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The two questions I wish to ask the President are questions which currently exercise the minds of many Irish people.  Some people claim that the Lisbon treaty will mean an end to Irish neutrality and force Ireland to join a European army.  The President of the European Parliament has long experience dealing with foreign and security policy.  Will he offer his reaction to that claim?  Second, according to today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times,</i> the French plan to re-introduce the Commission&rsquo;s plan for a common corporate tax base.  This is a very serious issue for Ireland, given the disadvantages it has as an island state.  Can the President assure us that the Lisbon treaty will not remove member states&rsquo; powers to decide their national tax rates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure personally and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to welcome President P&ouml;ttering to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the tone and content of his remarks today; people will be very reassured by them.  I thank him for the warm tribute he paid to the Irish men and women who have contributed to the development of the European ideal and for his tribute to Irish peacemakers and the Irish Army.  We share the pride he mentioned in their contribution to peacekeeping over the decades.</P>
        <P>President P&ouml;ttering has led with distinction the European People&rsquo;s Party, to which Fine Gael is affiliated, and is also a leading member of our sister party, the German CDU.  In addition to welcoming him here today, I congratulate him on his recent appointment as president of the important Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.  It is an honour to have the President of the European Parliament in the Oireachtas at any time but it is particularly appropriate at this time given that Ireland is currently having a national conversation about the EU, its future and our role in it.  This is taking place, of course, in the context of the Lisbon treaty.  Fine Gael will tirelessly advocate a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and has already begun that process.</P>
        <P>At a public meeting I held recently in my constituency, I noticed that many of the issues raised had nothing to do with the treaty.  However, this happens all the time.  Issues that are not covered by the treaty continue to be attributed to it.  I agree with President P&ouml;ttering that we can never forget the fundamental importance of the European Union being a union of people, ideas and freedom.  The project is aimed at bringing people together, maximising opportunities for citizens and harnessing the benefits everybody can derive from co-operation.  The European Union has been very good for Ireland, not just for financial reasons but also for social and economic reasons.  It has been very good for progressing the social agenda,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As a female parliamentarian I must acknowledge that it is the European Parliament that has championed many of the important gender and social issues which confront European policymakers and legislators today.  When educated Irish women were emigrating and experiencing systematic discrimination in our laws, the European Union enfran<Col N="9"/>chised us in our country.  I know this well as a former chairman of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.  We have reason to be grateful.  When Ireland sought derogation, the European Union supported us in our efforts for full equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to raise a number of issues and ask President P&ouml;ttering questions on them.  One of these is climate change.  The Lisbon treaty, for the first time, affirms legally the possibility of working on climate change at a European level.  Europe is facing up to this serious issue and trying to lead the world in it.  I would like the President to spell out the implications of the initiatives he hopes to take in the coming years and how well he thinks citizens will be able to cope with the demands inherent in that.  It is critical that the interests of Irish and European agriculture are protected in world trade talks.  President P&ouml;ttering might comment on that area.</P>
        <P>The challenge for Europe is convincing people of the importance of a social Europe.  The benefits of membership are not economic alone.  We must ensure Europe&rsquo;s social agenda is not forced through an economic sieve, depriving it of its real meaning.  This is critical.  I would like President P&ouml;ttering to address that area.  Many Irish citizens have concerns about a social Europe and how it will develop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of palpable untruths have been spread about the treaty, its content and implications.  It is important the decision made by the Irish people is not based on those myths.  Although President P&ouml;ttering has addressed some of them, I will reiterate them, as the Leader has done, and ask him to comment on them.  There is a front page story in today&rsquo;s edition of<i> The</i><i> Irish Times</i> on the question of tax.  The myth is that the treaty will raise taxes.  Does the treaty bring tax policy within the powers of the EU?  Although President P&ouml;ttering has made the answer to that clear, perhaps he would address it once again.  As this is a self-amending treaty, the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side continues to insist this will be the last time the Irish people will have a say in any major changes on the EU.  I ask the President to address that.  It has been said on abortion and stem cell research that health policy does not remain a matter for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>The major issue is militarisation and the perception that Ireland will have to join a European Army.  I would like President P&ouml;ttering to address that issue because it is a cause of concern for many people.  We have had a very proud record of peacekeeping and enhancement, which President P&ouml;ttering has addressed, but that is capable of being misinterpreted given the provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  President P&ouml;ttering might comment on that.</P>
        <P>I thank the President for attending today and assure him of my party&rsquo;s continued support for the European project and our intention to canvass with vigour for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum in Ireland.  I ask him to keep in mind the continued need to ensure the EU is kept accessible and relevant to its citizens throughout its member states.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome President P&ouml;ttering.  In my role as Deputy Leader of the House and representing the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I join in the welcome given to him by previous speakers and welcome several aspects of his speech.  Senator Fitzgerald has raised the details of the position on climate change and energy security and I, too, welcome those aspects of the President&rsquo;s speech.  It is an important role that the European Parliament will be playing in years to come.  The provision on climate change in the reform treaty was a <Col N="10"/>recent initiative of the Irish Government.  It is the main difference between this treaty and the constitutional treaty and accompanied my party&rsquo;s participation in Government in this country.  It is very welcome to see the European Parliament playing a role in advancing that important agenda.  Indeed, it is the key agenda as the Union moves forward in years to come.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask President P&ouml;ttering about ongoing concerns relating to the structures of the European Union.  It is fair to say that several of the debates in this country that have accompanied the development and devolution of the Union, through the various referenda campaigns, have focused on concerns regarding a democratic deficit.  The European Union is a union of democratic nations and is formed by particular values.  The essence of democratic values is to have an ongoing, open and democratic debate.  I would be pleased to hear President P&ouml;ttering&rsquo;s views on the importance of such critical engagement about what the Union is and what it is evolving into.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, despite the existence of fora such as the Forum on Europe, the fact is very often lost that we need people to put forward arguments regarding whether the right direction is being followed.  The upcoming debate in this country must be informed as much by critical voices as by those who are intimately involved in the structures of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The essence of the democratic deficit is the involvement of the ordinary EU citizen.  Each of the structures of the Union &mdash; the Parliament, Council and Commission &mdash; must demonstrate how the deficit exists now and how it can be lessened in the future.  I am particularly keen to hear the views of the President of the European Parliament on that issue.</P>
        <P>The President also mentioned the role Ireland plays as a donor nation and referred to our <i>per capita</i> contribution in terms of development aid.  This is an area in which the European Union, collectively, plays an important role.  Does the President believe strategies can be devised to prevent that from being undermined by some of the trade policies of the European Union?  Is there a need to engage with developing countries in a better way?  Senator Frances Fitzgerald has already mentioned that trade matters must be examined critically to determine how they might affect the interests of small and peripheral countries such as Ireland.  I am interested in the President&rsquo;s response in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask President P&ouml;ttering about the foreign policy direction of the European Union.  We have had two instances in the past ten years where European Union member countries have chosen to take different positions, despite the move towards a common foreign policy.  I cite the example of the Iraq war in 2003 where member countries took independent positions and the EU did not adopt a collective position.  We are seeing that again now in the recognition of Kosovo as a new country.  While Ireland has made such a recognition, several member states are uncomfortable about doing so and, again, there is no common EU position.  Does Mr. P&ouml;ttering, as President of the Parliament, see this as one of the reasons there probably will never be a fully common European foreign policy acceptable to all members and that there will always be incidents and issues of policy where member states will decide on a national interest basis what their individual foreign policy positions will be?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been asked by my Independent colleagues to represent them here today.  I am a member of the Independent group on the National Forum for Europe, to which the President referred, and of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I am also chairman of EuroCommerce, based in Brussels, which represents retail, wholesale and international trade.  I thank my colleagues for asking me to say a few words on their behalf.</P>
        <P>All Members of this House come from a generation which is only one or two generations removed from the fight for independence in Ireland.  In view of this independence and nationalism were a very strong part of our upbringing.  In 1958, after finishing university, I spent a year <Col N="11"/>in Europe and I suddenly found myself torn between this sense of independent nationalism and becoming a European.  I returned rather excited about that because that was the time Europe was forming itself into a united entity of some sort.  The European Economic Community was founded and it evolved into the European Union.  Concerns have been expressed in Ireland about this movement.  People are concerned we will lose our identity and nationalism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The subject of the debate is the Lisbon treaty and when we discussed it in the House a few months ago, I looked up the Laeken Declaration of 2001.  I was excited about the declaration because it was like a breath of fresh air.  I always have been a fan of Europe but over the years I have become a little depressed by the extent to which European institutions fail to engage successfully with the peoples of Europe.  However, I was delighted with the Laeken Declaration because it created the constitutional treaty, which became the reform treaty.  I was also delighted with the President&rsquo;s words.  My colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, said to me, &ldquo;Did you hear the passion with which that man spoke?&rdquo;  That is what impressed me about what he said.</P>
        <P>The Laeken Declaration states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Within the Union, the European institutions must be brought closer to its citizens.  Citizens undoubtedly support the Union&rsquo;s broad aims but they do not always see a connection between those goals and the Union&rsquo;s everyday action.  They want the European institutions to be less unwieldily and rigid and, above all, more efficient and open and many also feel that the Union should involve itself more with their particular concerns instead of intervening in every detail in matters by their nature better left to member states&rsquo; and region&rsquo;s elected representatives.  This is even perceived by some as a threat to their identity and, more importantly, however, they feel that deals are too often cut out of their sight and they want better democratic scrutiny.</P>
        <P FLI="0">One can see why I was excited.  However, on the basis of returning to first principles, which is important, I would like to pose a question to the President.  Does the result we have to consider in the form of the reform treaty live up to these aspirations clearly set out in the declaration or, along the road, have the lawyers and the bureaucrats taken over the process so that instead of a new beginning we are presented with more of the same?  I hope the President will consider this to be as important an issue as I do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should scrutinise the reform treaty from the point of view of Irish interests but we should also ask whether the benefits to Ireland exceed the undoubted costs of going along with the treaty.  We owe the people of Ireland a duty to carry out that scrutiny legally and diligently.  The reform treaty takes a decisive step in shaping the Europe of the future and it is incumbent on us to ask ourselves solemnly and carefully if this is the way we want to go and whether the treaty lives up to the Laeken Declaration or undermines the fine principles and aspirations on which it was launched.  A reply will be very helpful to those in Ireland who will vote on the treaty shortly.  I am aware of the President&rsquo;s enthusiasm and passion and I would like him to put this into the answers to those questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted on behalf of the Labour Party to welcome the President to the House.  We are affiliated to the socialist group in the European Parliament, which vies with the President&rsquo;s group for largest group.  We do not have the largest group currently but we hope to before too long.  I had the pleasure of meeting the President last night and he said something to me that very much resonated in the context in which we are speaking.  The President stated that being in Berlin in 1962 or 1963 and seeing the wall being constructed represented the single biggest motivating factor for his entry into politics.  It is interesting that the wall was removed many years later in 1989.  All of us, whether left, right, centre, red, green or blue, celebrated the removal of this abomination at the heart of our continent.  It was <Col N="12"/>extraordinary to see the division it constituted in the continent of Europe removed so quickly in the end.  It was also an enormous moment historically for Europe to see it go.  It seems that in the context in which we are discussing the Lisbon treaty and having this debate we should not forget that this was an enormous symbolic occasion for Europe and the importance of a united Europe.</P>
        <P>Unity in Europe cannot be founded only on symbols, important as they are.  My party will support the Lisbon treaty enthusiastically and will actively canvass and campaign throughout the country for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  This morning&rsquo;s discussion is an interesting and useful occasion.  However, while it is not so much that storm clouds are gathering, in any debate we must address the serious economic issues we have on a worldwide scale at present.  We have seen what happened in the United States and Europe.  Will the President comment on the impact the economic downturn is having and is likely to have in the European context?</P>
        <P>What serious role can the European Union take to address the concerns of many millions of workers throughout the Union that at a time of economic downturn, the first to suffer are those on low pay and low wages?  These are people already affected by the impact of the various inequalities which still have not been removed throughout the continent.  We still have a 15% gender gap in pay, despite all we achieved.  We still have a gap between rich and poor in all countries of Europe and between the security of employment many of us have and the precarious situation many workers face.</P>
        <P>An issue I am especially concerned about is the question of the draft directive on agency workers, which we have debated in this House.  I am sorry to state the Government has not seen fit to support it, at least at this stage.  Does the President agree with me that it is vital a measure such as this is brought forward quickly?  If it is not brought forward during this Presidency, it should be brought forward in the next.  People who quite rightly are asked to vote in support of the Lisbon treaty would see they have a stake in it and that it has a real impact on their lives.</P>
        <P>Something which often amuses me, and I saw it arise again in recent days, is the notion of red tape.  I would like to reflect on this idea.  People rail against red tape and no one likes unnecessary bureaucracy.  When we criticise red tape we forget that in many cases this so-called &ldquo;red tape&rdquo; represents a major achievement.  People speak about the burden of regulation.  I would like to speak more about the achievements of regulation such as the fixed-term work directive and basic minimum holidays and hours of work which came from European directives.  We also have the equality directives, including the new equality framework directive.  All of these were initiated in the Commission, debated and passed at European level.  I do not regard any of these issues as red tape or a burden.  I regard them as real achievements for workers throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that during the debate in the European Parliament in recent days, it was suggested by some Members that the new framework directive brought forward by the Commission, of which I am sure the President is aware, represents more red tape.  If what is needed to combat income, gender and race discrimination is called red tape then I embrace red tape.  If this is what it is let us have more of it.  Of course, this is not what it is.  It is a pejorative way of describing it.  It is a real achievement of Europe and if the workers of Ireland are to be asked to support the Lisbon treaty, and we will ask them to do so, they must see that ratifying the treaty will have a real impact on their lives.  Perhaps Mr. P&ouml;ttering might comment on one of these points.  Mr. P&ouml;ttering has achieved much in his speech today but, above all, he has managed to persuade the Leader of the House to tell us what age he is.</P>

	<P>I thank Mr. P&ouml;ttering and it has been a pleasure to listen to him speak, as Senator Quinn mentioned, with such passion.  The ratification of the Lisbon treaty is an issue for Ireland and there is a certain level of complacency, which is a challenge we must address.  We need good reason to try and sell the treaty to the people.  As the treaty is a tidying-up exercise people are not really exercised about it and begin to wonder if they will bother voting.  That is what we need to guard against.  The presence of Mr. P&ouml;ttering here kicks off the campaign.  It is important to reiterate what Mr. P&ouml;ttering said, which is that he is not here to tell the people how to vote, but merely presenting his own arguments on why it is a good idea to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It was also a pleasure to listen to him because he highlighted the importance of Ireland to the EU, as well as the importance of the EU to Ireland.  It is always good to listen to praise about ourselves and he has all made us feel good.  I did not agree with everything he said but that is to be expected.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to be careful, to echo what Senator Boyle said, as we begin to become more homogenised in terms of the European Union, to protect a certain degree of flexibility.  We are very exercised by the report that was in the front page of the newspaper today, stating the French have indicated that they want to consolidate the European tax base.  They are entitled to that opinion, but they will be met with significant resistance from Ireland.  This is the challenge to which I referred.  Within the European Union each member state will place its national interests first.  The question I have for Mr. P&ouml;ttering relates to this tension between national interests on the one hand and the European ideal and European co-operation on issues such as foreign affairs, on the other.  The Senator made an important point that not all countries will look at issues in the same way.  I would like to hear some more detail on how Mr. P&ouml;ttering imagines that will work.  The European Union works best when it works together on such issues as climate change.  It is that tension to which I referred.</P>
        <P>For pan-European services there is a European market.  However, can we look forward to a union where we can have services?  For example, if I want my car insured can I go to a German or a French insurer?  Is that something Mr. P&ouml;ttering sees happening here, and if so how quickly?</P>
        <P>It is important for the Irish to remember that it is our duty, on behalf of our country, to vote on the Lisbon treaty.  It is unfair of those opposed to the treaty to indicate that it is our responsibility to take on the decision for every European country where the citizens do not get the right to vote.  Mr. P&ouml;ttering mentioned that each country&rsquo;s method for ratifying the treaty is part of its sovereignty, which is important   We need to be careful about this and we will answer the question on the Lisbon treaty for Ireland alone.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering </NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you.  When I was leader of the EPP-ED group in the European Parliament for seven and half years I always had six minutes to make my speeches.  I do not know how many minutes are available here.  An elderly female colleague from Luxembourg once said to me that I had six minutes and she had only one minute and she asked that I give her two minutes of my time.  That would be a little fairer.  I have to answer all these intelligent and wise remarks in ten minutes.  There is a difference between being intelligent and wise.  I am an honorary professor but would say that sometimes it would be good if professors were less intelligent and more wise.  I will, however, try to answer in ten minutes.</P><Col N="14"/>
        <P>I refer to Senator Donie Cassidy&rsquo;s comments and to neutrality, corporate tax and what the Lisbon treaty means.  Nobody, no country, no European Parliament, no European Commission or no Council of Ministers can define or change Ireland&rsquo;s status of neutrality.  It is its position and decision and nobody in the world or in Europe can tell the Irish people to change its position.  If it wants to keep neutrality, then that is its position.</P>
        <P>Although Ireland is expressly in favour of neutrality, it is engaged in human rights in the world.  My country, Germany, is engaged in Afghanistan under the framework of NATO but it is not engaged in Chad.  Ireland is engaged in Chad to defend human rights there.  This is a responsible position.  Nobody can force Ireland to enter NATO.  This is Ireland&rsquo;s position and decision and if somebody says this will change as a result of the Lisbon treaty, it is a lie.  We must be frank about it.  What one colleague from the European Parliament is saying about abortion is misleading and is a lie.  He knows it is a lie.  Nothing changes in this context.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of corporate tax.  Under the Lisbon treaty, a unanimous vote in respect of tax questions is required.  This means that without the agreement of Ireland, nothing can change.  If people say there will be a change with the Lisbon treaty, they are not telling the truth.  Most of them are lying.  Lying means saying something wrong and knowing it is wrong.  I have trust in the Irish people that they will realise people from outside this country are not telling the truth.</P>
        <P>I would like ministers from countries which regard themselves as great countries to be a little bit more wise and reluctant in making statements.  I will do my utmost to make sure these misleading remarks do not continue.  I assure Senators that the position in respect of neutrality, taxes and abortion will not change.  Decisions in respect of these questions are for the Irish people.  I thank Senator Donie Cassidy for his comments.</P>
        <P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald kindly referred to what I said about Ireland&rsquo;s peacekeeping in the world and its defence of human rights.  I met Senator Leyden in Athens.  The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is very important because it brings together representatives of the 27 countries of the European Union, including representatives of the most important chambers, such as the Seanad represented by Senator Leyden, and members of other parliaments of the European Union, the European Parliament and all parliaments from Turkey to Morocco, including Palestine and Israel.  On 13 July in Paris a decision will be made about the Barcelona process and the proposals of President Sarkozy.  We now have the right framework in that all countries of the European Union will be involved whereas some had been left outside.  In the first proposal, Ireland and Germany were not involved.  We thought this was wrong so Ireland, Germany and others are now in.  I thank the Senator for the encouragement as far as that is concerned.</P>
        <P>I refer to social Europe and related questions.  We must always defend the dignity of the human being.  Each citizen in the European Union and, of course, in the world must create the basis for his or her life.  I do not agree with those who want to make everything equal in the European Union.  For instance, it is up to the nations to decide on pension systems.  This is one of the disputes, that is, whether we want to harmonise things.  Some people want to harmonise most things while other speak about the identity of the nations.</P>
        <P>We must always try to find the answers to specific questions.  One cannot give a general answer to all questions.  With my political beliefs, I try to be somewhere in the centre.  Sometimes I am a little bit left of the centre and sometimes a little bit right of it but the main road is the centre.  I have always appreciated that in the context of Ireland.  Wherever it stands politically, it has a good approach &mdash; a policy of being in the centre.</P><Col N="15"/>
        <P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald referred to climate change.  There is now much discussion about CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> reductions in the car industry, other industry and so on.  We must each ask ourselves how we can reduce our energy consumption.  We must work hard to ensure deforestation does not continue.  Therefore, we need good co-operation with countries such as Brazil, Indonesia and others.  I have spoken about military alliances already.</P>
        <P>The accession to citizens was raised in many questions.  I am still chairman of my party in my region of the western part of Lower Saxony, not the Free State of Saxony which is in eastern Germany.  I am from the north west of Germany, Hanover-Osnabr&uuml;ck.  I believe we have three, four or even five political identities.  One is at local level where everything starts.  For people living in Kilkee, Ireland does not start in Dublin but in Kilkee which is where they start to be an Irish person.  As a result of Irish nationality, one gets European citizenship.  In my case, it starts at local level and at the regional level of Lower Saxony, and Ireland has its regions as well.  It then moves to national and European level.  That is four identities.  We then have a responsibility to the world.  If we see things that way, we can combine the different levels.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator Dan Boyle&rsquo;s comments.  I am a Christian Democrat and I have been criticised by my political friends in the European Parliament for being so engaged in the question of climate change.  People might have different reasons.  I like to speak about creation but others might have a different approach.  If our world is to survive, it is vital to take the necessary measures in the field of climate change.  However, time does not allow me to go too much into the details.  As far as the democratic deficit is concerned, when I started in the European Parliament in 1979 we had zero legislative competences.  The Council of Ministers did not consult us when taking decisions.  It was often not the Council of Ministers but officials who took the legal decisions.  I have great respect for officials but it is not their job to make decisions.  Representatives elected by the people must make the legal decisions.  This has been changed.</P>
        <P>Under the Lisbon treaty our legislative power as a European Parliament is almost 100%.  Taxes are excluded and that is why it is not 100%.  We share legislative power with the Council of Ministers.  The Commission President is elected by the European Parliament and it must respect the result of the elections in making its proposal.  The Commission requires the confidence vote of Parliament.</P>
        <P>On foreign policy, I have been always an advocate of a strong Europe in respect of world politics.  However, we do not always have to do the same thing.  If Ireland does not want to send troops to Iraq or to support the war in Iraq, it has a right to say so.  I could not imagine a situation whereby the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament or Commission could decide whether a country should send troops to war in foreign countries.  It is for Ireland, with the agreement of the people, to do this and nobody in Brussels or Strasbourg can make that decision.  This must be clear.  Development will be in the future.</P>
        <P>I would as many countries as possible to have the same policy.  However, those countries that do not wish to join should not be forced to do so.  They should do what they believe is right.  This is a good principle in respect of foreign affairs.  It is a position that works.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned he spent one year in Europe.  Ireland is also part of Europe and as such he has spent his whole life in Europe, which I appreciate.  I am fascinated by what he had to say.  I wish I had the time to spend one year outside my own country, a privilege enjoyed by Senator Quinn.  Perhaps Senator Quinn will tell me in what country he spent that year.</P>

	<P>The Senator should go back and speak to the Minister for the Economy, Finance and Employment about what she said and should bring my best regards to <Col N="16"/>her.  Christine Lagarde, to my astonishment, speaks fluent English.  I met her twice.  I do not know why she did what she did but she is a practical thinking person.  If the Senator calls her and informs her that what she said is not applicable to the Lisbon treaty, she will quickly understand.</P>
        <P>The Senator is correct, we must be near to the people.  However, politicians alone cannot do this.  We need the support of the media and, in particular, television.  In Germany, television programmes while not nationalised are home country orientated.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s conviction that television should be used more to provide information about the European Union and world politics.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White of the Labour Party spoke about Berlin.  I am happy he remembers what I said in respect of Berlin; it is the truth.  As somebody from the western part of Lower Saxony I first visited west Berlin in 1962.  The wall was built on 13 August 1961.  It is against nature to erect a wall and to block people from going from one area to another.  For example, in 1976, 15 years after the wall had been built, some 50 buses carrying a youth organisation from my party visited Berlin.  Only two buses were permitted to cross the Communist border to eastern Germany.  The bus on which I was travelling as Chairman of the youth organisation from my region was permitted to cross the border.  I will tell Members why.  I know of Ireland&rsquo;s history with the British.  I say this because we must always tell the truth.  On the bus on which I was travelling was a young boy from the United States of America and a young girl from the United Kingdom.  The Communists did not dare to send our bus away because the Americans and British had a special status in Berlin.  I realised how important it was that Germany always had the support of the Americans, the British, the French and Ireland.  I thank Dick Roche and Gerard Collins whom I mentioned earlier, for their contributions.</P>
        <P>While national boundaries are important, they are not the most important.  Self determination of the people is what is most important.  Self determination of the people means the people have the right to make decisions in respect of liberty and their own way of living and we must defend this at all times.</P>
        <P>The issue of red tape was mentioned.  In Germany, the European Commission is regarded as bureaucratic.  It is sometimes right to criticise the Commission.  President Barroso who does an excellent job will visit Ireland next week.  If I am welcome, I will come back next week to meet our political friends in Fine Gael.</P>

	<P>Mr. P&ouml;ttering is very welcome.  </P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering</NameTxt>
	<P>I may have to shorten a visit to some Arab countries but it is important to show solidarity.  On red tape bureaucracy, we must find middle ground.  If we introduce too much regulation then parts of the political spectrum will not want anything to do with Brussels.  Those who prefer regulation will, if left alone, do too much.  We must take all people with us on the European project.  This is why I favour a policy oriented in the centre.  I hope I have answered all Senator Alex White&rsquo;s questions.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley of the Progressive Democrats also asked some questions.  In the European Parliament the Progressive Democrats would be in the liberal democratic group, ALDE.  We have many difficult abbreviations in the European Parliament.  The alliance of the liberal and democratic parties is now chaired by Mr. Graham Watson and was previously chaired by Mr. Pat Cox prior to his election as President of the European Parliament.  We worked closely together when I was leader of our party.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke about flexibility, which I like.  I was astonished at what I learned last night.  Following dinner I always like to walk rather than to travel by car.  The driver told <Col N="17"/>me this morning that if I lived here I would be popular with the drivers because as I prefer to walk they could go home.  I walked around and saw all the nice pubs outside which there were many people smoking.  As a non-smoker I often feel sorry for smokers who must leave restaurants to smoke.  I learned yesterday that Ireland was the first country to implement regulation in this field.  It was Ireland&rsquo;s choice and it had a right to do this.</P>
      
        <P>I will tell the Members a nice little story about Europe.  I told it first at the Catholic faculty of an institution in south Germany &mdash; and am daring to also tell it here again &mdash; when a friend, the former Prime Minister of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, was given an honorary doctorate.  At the end of the story all the theological professors there smiled and laughed.  I will give Members an example of our European psychology.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">When I was chairman of the EEP-ED Group we had a bureau meeting in a nice hotel in Bordeaux, although it was not as nice as the one in which I had the honour and pleasure to stay last night.  I wish I had some more hours in that beautiful hotel.  We had a meeting in a good hotel in Bordeaux.  I chaired the meeting which continued for some four or five hours, after which I paid a visit to the toilet.  Before explaining this little story I must tell Members that the constitutional treaty was partly rejected in France because the French feared the threat posed to other workers by the &ldquo;Polish plumber&rdquo; under the provisions of the services directive.  The first proposal of the then Commissioner Bolkestein was to make the market totally free.  Thus the French were afraid of the threat to French workers posed by the Polish plumber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Now I can continue with the story.  At the end of the meeting as I was on my way to the toilet I met a Swedish colleague who, having been there, told me they need &ldquo;the Polish plumber&rdquo;.  I will not explain to my colleagues the conditions he described which I subsequently saw, but I can only say they needed &ldquo;the Polish plumber&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Some weeks later, and this is the truth, I was in Paris and was invited by a German diplomatic couple to their apartment for coffee.  As always, there was only ten minutes for coffee but it was enough time for me to speak about the experience I have had in my life, as I do here.  They had a beautiful apartment and they told me that they had waited for a year for a plumber to repair their heating.</P>
        <P>This is a nice story but what does it illustrate?  It shows that the thinking of the people is totally different from their needs.  The French in this case, and others as well, need Polish plumbers, but the French thought that in this special historic situation the Polish plumber would be a threat to them but this was wrong.  They voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Irish people are intelligent and wise and I will not make a recommendation, but the Members know my beliefs.</P>
        <P>Money may be important.  Is there any person who does not like money?  All people like it.  Organisations and institutions are important, but what is unique in the European Union, of which we can be proud, is that we share the same values.  We should speak about these values, namely, the dignity of the human being, human rights, democracy, legal order and the principle of solidarity.  The European Union is not without mistakes.  However, if one takes note of what is happening elsewhere in the world, one will note that the European Continent, made up of Ireland, Germany and the other member states, is based on these values.  We have a duty to defend our values.  I hope that everybody in Ireland when they vote in the referendum, which will probably be held on 12 June, will make a decision having regard to our being united in the European Union on the basis of the values we share.  I thank the Members for the good time they have shown me in this Chamber.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is often said that a week is a long time in politics.  Last week certainly gave meaning to that phrase.  It began with Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna F&aacute;il and by Wednesday he had announced his resignation, effective from 6 May.  By the end of the week Deputy Brian Cowen had become Leader-elect of his party.  It is <Col N="19"/>extraordinary how, in politics, events can gather momentum and pace.  So much happened last week that it might serve as a warning to the Seanad that we cannot take breaks at all. </P>
        <P>Party leaders in the D&aacute;il paid tribute to Deputy Bertie Ahern last week for his hard work during his tenure as Taoiseach.  I, too, wish the Taoiseach well as he departs office and thank him for his service and efforts.  While we have many disagreements on policy, it must be recognised that for the Taoiseach, politics was his life.  He brought great energy and dedication to the office of Taoiseach and played an enormously significant role in the Good Friday Agreement and in Ireland&rsquo;s successful European Presidency.</P>
        <P>An issue that emerged in this House, just before the Easter break, concerned the position of the illegal Irish in the United States.  The Taoiseach has yet to address the US Congress and I ask the Leader to raise this issue with him.  We had a somewhat unsatisfactory discussion in the House in this regard before the break and we were working on an all-party motion.  However, a number of reservations were expressed by Members as regards the approach the Taoiseach had taken.  Perhaps this issue could be raised again when he addresses Congress.</P>
        <P>While paying tribute to the Taoiseach and wishing him well, it is worth noting that the date of his departure was brought forward because to remain in office would have been a distraction, as he admitted, owing to the evidence before the Mahon tribunal and the unanswered questions.  However, I welcome the fact that the focus has returned to the many issues of concern such as the economy, rising levels of unemployment and the health service &mdash; we have another disturbing study, the O&rsquo;Malley report &mdash; and I hope we have the opportunity to discuss these matters in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I want to focus, however, on the very disturbing reports of crime in Limerick and around the country, as reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  It must strike horror and a chill into all our hearts to see what is happening with regard to the murder of those three young men.  We raised these concerns on this side of the House on a number of occasions, most recently in the aftermath of the killings of the two young Polish men.  Senators on all sides called for an immediate debate on this matter.  I shall move an amendment to today&rsquo;s Order of Business so that we may have a debate on law and order and the challenge which these gangs pose to the State, the Garda and increasingly, communities.</P>
        <P>A local Limerick priest, Fr. Joe Young, referred yesterday to the fear among residents in the local community.  I do not believe it is acceptable in a democracy that communities are frightened to give evidence, that they consider law and order to be out of hand and that illegal groups are running the streets &mdash; not the communities and not the Garda.  I should like today to move an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the Seanad and address this issue.  The issue has been raised not just on this side of the House but across the Seanad on a number of occasions in recent weeks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the points made by Senator Fitzgerald concerning the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement of his resignation.  It would be very helpful in dealing with this in an efficient manner, if the Leader could find some reason for inviting the Taoiseach to the House.  The best reason would be to get an update, as he sees it on leaving office, of the Northern situation, the Lisbon treaty and the possibilities of another national wage agreement.  I should like the Taoiseach to address the Seanad in a businesslike manner. </P>
        <P>I also acknowledge the work the Taoiseach has done for this country.  There will be time to talk about other matters in due course.  I believe that the balance sheet of his career will ultimately come out on the positive side.  In any event, it would be important to have that debate with him here, and hear his views.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P>On a personal note, the Taoiseach is someone who has stuck by his word to me over the 35 years that I have been dealing with him.  I can recall adverse public comment, including some within this House less than five years ago, when, having struck a deal with the Taoiseach on benchmarking, there were opposing voices on all sides of the Seanad, not least on my own benches.  Two of my Trinity College colleagues were calling for benchmarking not to be paid, but the Taoiseach stood by his agreement with me.  I can recall these matters and it will be time to talk about them again.</P>
        <P>People will have noted developments since last week on an issue I have raised many times in the House, namely, the question of China.  It is great and heartening to see that there is a demand around the world for recognition of human rights.  The so-called Chinese torch is effectively a symbol of torture, oppression and suppression&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-from a regime which has mobile execution chambers and kills people to sell their organs.  China is opening coal stations at the rate of one a week, flooding people out of their homes in order to create electricity and engaged in numerous other activities.  For polite people to be speaking to us as politicians and talking about the positive image of sport and not connecting it with politics conjures up a very clear message.  The Olympic Games are putting a positive gloss on the most repressive, oppressive, unacceptable regime in the world.  If leaders on the world stage stand beside the architects and leaders of China, then they are giving tacit international support to what it is doing &mdash; and they should not do this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not asking athletes to get involved, but political leaders are a different matter.  It is not right to say that politics and sport do not mix because it is far too late for that.  The Olympic Games are in China for political reasons, and that is the reality.  We are looking at an oppressive country, which tramples on human rights, suffocates free speech, denies freedom of religion and grabs countries such as Tibet and pulls them apart, as it has been doing since the Dalai Lama was kicked down the mountain in 1959.  It is time we pointed out to China that as a member of the United Nations, it is required to subscribe to the UN programme on human rights.  I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be invited to the House to indicate that no one representing the Irish Government will stand with the Chinese leaders or participate in the opening ceremony.</P>

	<P>I noted the remarkable sense of relief that appeared on the Deputy Leader&rsquo;s face after the events of last week.  No doubt the developments came as a great relief to him and his party, or so we are led to believe.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others have made the point that it is a pity that the Taoiseach has not had the opportunity to speak in the Chamber during the term of this Seanad.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion might be a way of addressing this.</P>
        <P>The very significant achievements of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, must be acknowledged without question, especially in the context of the historic events in Northern Ireland.  When the history of these events is written &mdash; some of it has been &mdash; many players will be regarded as having made a significant contribution.  It probably can be said that few, if any, made a more significant contribution to promoting peace and ensuring a resolution to the Troubles than the Taoiseach.  I have no difficulty whatsoever acknowledging that.</P>
        <P>We should acknowledge also that, in general, the Taoiseach has been a very successful politician.  Someone said to me that one of his characteristics is what is called the likeability factor.  I agree with this but the Taoiseach has needed the likeability factor, particularly in the past year or two.  Would he have survived as long as he did had he not had it?  It is a pity the departure from public life and politics of someone who achieved so much is tainted.  There is no question about this.</P>
        <P>I will seek a debate on an issue related to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s departure which Senator MacSharry raised before the break.  It was a pity the Taoiseach spoiled the dignity of the occasion last week &mdash; he was backed up in doing so &mdash; by again refusing to pass up the opportunity to have a go at the tribunals.</P>

We cannot have a parade of people asking that matters be left to the tribunal while the Taoiseach and a queue of Ministers never miss the opportunity to attack it, especially on an occasion such as that last week.</P>

	<P>Either one approach or the other should be adopted.  Either the tribunals are to be maintained and supported by this House, which set them up through the motion proposed by Senator Cassidy ten years ago, or they are not.

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The statement by the Taoiseach last week should remind Members that he will remain in office until the date on which he has decided to step down.  It would be more appropriate to have a debate closer to that date rather than sooner, not so much to pass judgment but to acknowledge his contribution over his period in office.  I acknowledge that the decision has been made and all of us in public life should be allowed to take cognisance of it and delve deeper into its significance as time passes.  Part of the problem over recent months is the way in which knee-jerk reactions have informed public debate in a way that public debate should not otherwise be informed.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the need for a debate on the Beijing Olympics, the manner in which the current relay of the Olympic torch is being used for political purposes and the impact of this on the continuing occupation of Tibet by the Chinese.</P>

	<P>Before the Easter recess, I asked the Leader for a debate on the current economic conditions.  Senator MacSharry and other Senators on the Government side also called for such a debate.  It would be apt to invite the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to the Chamber as soon as possible to discuss this matter before he is elevated to another office.  The discussion should focus on rising unemployment levels, the more modest projections for economic growth this year and the projected figures pertaining to tax revenue, which are much lower than those projected originally.  It would be appropriate that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, should come to the House to discuss how he sees matters developing from here and to get his views before he assumes another role.</P>
        <P>I am not sure whether this is the correct forum to raise this.  I had a number of Adjournment motions before the House before the Easter recess, the last two of which related to the area of education.  There are at least three, if not four, Ministers in the Department of Education and Science and on each occasion no Minister relevant to the portfolio was able to be present.  If one raises a specific issue, it is a poor show from any Department to be presented with an answer to an Adjournment debate which one knows is factually incorrect and not be able to question the Minister who arrives in the Chamber.  On the last such occasion it was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who answered as well as he could but could not deal with the specific questions I raised.  I understand that at times Ministers may not always be able to be present.  However, in a Department that has three, if not four, Ministers, surely one of them should be able to be present to take a debate relevant to that Department.</P>

	<P>I echo Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s request for the Taoiseach to visit the House so that we have an opportunity to listen to his views as he retires and, as the Senator stated, to pay tribute to the service he has provided on behalf of the Irish people for such an extended period.</P>
        <P>I also request a debate on the partnership talks.  Often people criticise Parliament for not having a relevance.  We might be provided with the opportunity to discuss our concerns here.  I accept that when one is going into negotiations one often likes to keep one&rsquo;s cards close to one&rsquo;s chest but it would afford us the opportunity to express views, particularly to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, as he prepares to go into the partnership talks.</P><Col N="24"/>
        <P>I also request a debate on the question of prisons.  As we seek to modernise our prisons system, a debate on the purpose of prisons and whether we are serving those needs is required.  In my previous constituency an institution for young offenders was closed down.  In that regard, we need to know there will be enough rehabilitation opportunities in places of incarceration and what is their purpose.  That is why I request a debate on prisons.</P>
        <P>I also echo the request from Senators Boyle and O&rsquo;Toole for a debate on Tibet.  As we prepare to go to the Olympic Games, it is appropriate that we in the Seanad should make known our views on the matter.</P>

	<P>Last Wednesday when we got out of our beds and trudged to what we were going to do, the one significant event on the landscape from a political point of view was the HIQA report on the Ms Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case.  Unfortunately, on the day concerned it was over shadowed by other events.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House to debate this and other reports but, in particular, the recommendations arising from this report.  Dr. Tracey Cooper of HIQA needs to be commended on this report.</P>

	<P>It was the first report of a new organisation and I was impressed by its recommendations, its tone and its language.  Following Rebecca&rsquo;s ability to speak about it &mdash; I spoke to her at length on a number of occasions since &mdash; the way in which HIQA worked with her over the intervening months and handled the matter is commendable.</P>
        <P>It was obvious from the report that there was a single point of failure.  In future we must learn that single points of failure in the health service are simply not good enough.  We need a triple lock, as is reported in the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The recommendations include three important points and Ms O&rsquo;Malley repeats these <i>ad nauseam</i> in the media.  They relate to how the HSE communicates and how it is introducing a patient-centred approach to the entire implementation of recommendations in the future.  It is important we all read these recommendations.  It is important that we on all sides of the House ensure they all are put in place for future patients.  Ms O&rsquo;Malley will create a legacy from her work, namely, patient empowerment resulting in patients asking more questions and demanding more answers from a health service that in the future will not be allowed get away with some of the things we all regret happened in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek that the Leader call the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to the House to discuss the new report by the European Environment Agency on mobile telephone masts and mobile telephones and their possible effect on health.  Its author, Dr. David Gee, reports to the European Commission and the European Parliament.  The report cautions the Government that it must apply the precautionary principle on the possible health effects of mobile telephone masts and mobile telephones.  It urges the Government to have the highest standards in terms of emissions for mobile telephone masts.  At present, we have the highest emissions in the world from mobile telephone masts.</P>
        <P>I sound a word of caution.  It took 57 years to prove that tobacco causes lung cancer.  We do not have 57 years to wait to prove that mobile telephone masts cause cancer.  The Irish people expect us to act in their best interests and to act against any vested interests.  The March 2007 report of the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been <Col N="25"/>superseded by other reports in Israel, Germany and beyond which state that there is now evidence that after ten years of mobile telephone usage there is a risk of cancer.</P>
        <P>I must declare a personal interest in this.  My uncle and aunt lived 100m from a mobile telephone mast in Kenmare and both died of cancer.  I cannot say the mobile telephone mast was the cause of their deaths but if it was, I hope no one else suffers this loss.  I urge the Government to apply the precautionary principle and to act in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>

        <P>We are to discuss the Lisbon treaty today.  I take issue with the comments made by Christine Lagarde, the Minister of Finance in France.  Her proposal for discussions relating to corporate tax on the next Presidency of the European Union, which will be taken over by France in July 2008, is very unhelpful for the reform treaty.  I welcome the clear statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Ireland has a veto on tax.  What the French say about it is irrelevant.  Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime is solely a matter for Ireland.  If others wish to join us, we will welcome it.</P>

        <P>I also thank the Cathaoirleach for inviting my good friend, Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, here today.  It showed very good judgment on the part of the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House.  It was a wonderful speech today.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what Senator Leyden said in at least one respect, namely, his remark that the 12.5% tax rate is worthy of a debate in this House.  The Cathaoirleach interrupted him to say that this could be raised in the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  It has nothing to do with the treaty.  I know it probably will be part of that debate but the danger is that it will become a red herring and a reason why people will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; when it is not relevant.</P>
        <P>We should realise how vital this is.  I ask the Leader to address this subject in his reply.  I would have thought that if we were going to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs here, the first thing we might ask him to do is to call in the French ambassador and tell him that we will not have any truck with this sort of continuous threat from the French Government, be it the current French Minister of Finance or anyone else.  There are three reasons why he should <Col N="27"/>come to the House in the next few days.  The French are constantly waging this kind of guerilla warfare against Ireland&rsquo;s tax rate and we want to make it absolutely plain that under no circumstances will we concede it and that they are wasting their time.  It is obvious that there is an ongoing campaign and that the French will try in other ways to force us to concede this.  It may be an attack on agriculture or somewhere else but as an economy, we cannot afford to give in on this issue.  In the newspapers this morning, Ms Lagarde said that she had not met any Irish people who were afraid of anything in her plan.  It would be quite useful to her if the message went out that at least this House is unanimously opposed to her plan.</P>

	<P>I would guess that it would also be the same in the D&aacute;il and among virtually every person in Ireland.  Let us have no more truck with the French on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs should also come to the House to discuss the issue of Tibet, which was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, because it is a matter of immediate importance.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has ploughed this furrow with a great deal of persistence for as long as I can remember and has championed the cause of human rights and debate for a long time.  The Minister should come to the House to reassure it about this matter.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a noble record in championing democracy and sending observers to democratic elections throughout the world.  What is happening with the election in Zimbabwe, which has being debated in this House on many occasions, is a complete travesty of democracy.  The Minister should come to the House and tell us what the Government is doing to try and ensure that democracy in Zimbabwe is enforced; whether he is making representations to the South African President, Mr. Mbeki and maybe Mr. Zuma to see that democracy is enforced in Zimbabwe; and what protests are being made about events which have happened in the past few days.  These events include the delay in announcing the result, which stinks of an attempt to reverse it, and the treatment of members of the opposition who have tried to get to court and been forbidden from doing so, and journalists who have been arrested and harassed.  The situation is very serious and is one in which this House has played a leading part.  To his credit, the Minister has played a leading part in representing western and neutral interests in Zimbabwe.  I hope that he can come to the House to tell us what he is doing about it again.</P>

        <P>I also endorse a call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House so that we can discuss the awful scenes now taking place with regard to the Olympic torch and how Tibet has been annihilated by the Chinese Government.

We moved a Private Members&rsquo; motion late last year on the same subject.  The Minister came to the House and essentially said that all is well and under control.  As we stated on that occasion, these were polite meaningless words.  He did not suggest any new measures, strategies or legislation.  He did not believe that was required.  </P>
        <P>From what we have seen in the past number of months and recent days, the reality is that the Minister is not in control and has a negligible impact on this problem.  The complacency is, at this stage, insufferable.  We need an urgent debate on the matter.</P>

        <P>The fact is that there is unfinished business in this House in respect of the standards we set for ourselves.  What are the standards by which politicians can receive money for personal use?  We have never addressed that issue, which I raised on my first day in this House.</P>
        <P>There is business to be finished in Dublin Castle.  It has reflected very badly on this country as reported in the European and international press.  We cannot airbrush it out of history one day later.  We must face up to the situation that we are viewed as having a polity which is not beyond corruption.  That reflects on business, foreign direct investment and the way we are perceived in this country.  We will not airbrush it out of history.  As the Taoiseach, Ministers and Members across this House continue to undermine the Mahon tribunal and its work, we on this side of the House will need to uphold a tribunal that was established by the Oireachtas.  The Mahon tribunal will be an issue for as long as we attempt to suggest that nothing is wrong in Irish politics despite the forced resignation of a second Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach.</P>

My original request predates any calls from Senators Alex White, Regan and others from the other side who joined us quite recently.  Regarding standards in public office, it was this party that led governments to ensure a number of measures were put in place by regulation leading to the documents all of us happily complete by way of declaration at the beginning of each year to ensure the highest standards of public office are upheld.</P>

	<P>I would welcome a debate on tribunals generally so that we can all participate.  It is important that we would monitor the progress of all our tribunals to ensure they operate to the highest standards and to ensure they are working in a way that is consistent with the way that the Oireachtas established them in the first place in terms of achieving the expectations of the public and in terms of ensuring adherence to the standards set by Fianna <Col N="29"/>F&aacute;il in government by its, soon to be, seven leaders and the leadership they have shown over many decades.  I proudly call on the Leader for that debate to take place as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence on two other issues.  I join Senator O&rsquo;Malley in calling for a debate on social partnership and the partnership talks which are to begin again in approximately one month&rsquo;s time.  As finance spokesman on this side of the House I believe it would be appropriate to have such a debate.  I ask the Leader to consider establishing an all-party committee to monitor the progress of those negotiations.</P>
        <P>I have asked on many occasions recently for a debate on the HSE.  I believe we would have all-party agreement on one of those taking place.  The HSE is undertaking a national review of its funded adult day services.  I recently received correspondence stating it is having a consultation process throughout the country.  I call for a debate because the north west has been substantially ignored on a variety of issues, not least cancer care services.  To be true to my name I must bring to the attention of the House the map that accompanied the invitation for consultation to this process.  The four venues are all south of a line from Dublin to Galway, which is consistent with the cancer care services that are available.  It is an endemic problem with the HSE that it refuses to acknowledge the existence of the 250,000 people who live in the north west region.  I again ask for an urgent debate on the HSE to address some of these issues.</P>

	<P>I echo the calls for a debate on crime, which should be extended to also deal with anti-social behaviour and alcohol-related crime.  I say this at a time when access to alcohol has never been easier.  Over the weekend we saw reports that an additional few hundred off-licences have been approved in the past year.  I say that knowing the impact anti-social behaviour and alcohol-related crime are having on residents.  Last night I attended a meeting in Ashbourne where residents must live with alcohol-related anti-social behaviour on a daily basis.  I say this at a time when there has been complete inaction on the part of Government.  In January the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he expected the advisory group that he established to report by the end of March and that we could expect legislation before the summer recess.  The latest legislative programme shows that this is way behind time.  The Minister is now saying that we might see some legislation before the end of the year.  I ask the Leader to pass on the comments from this Chamber that if we are to believe the Minister that action will be taken, it should be taken sooner rather than later.</P>

	<P>I compliment the T&aacute;naiste on what he said last week about the future of the Constituency Commission.  Legislation is to come before us and there might be all-party agreement to amend it.  In a previous debate on the electoral commission, Senators on the other side expressed the view that something should be done about the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s last report which did not take into consideration all the submissions made throughout the country.  Given that the Labour Party also wishes it to be reviewed, it would now be an opportune time for a debate even before the Bill comes before the House.  We had a debate on the electoral commission.  We should have a debate on the changes proposed by the Constituency Commission.</P>
        <P>I would also appreciate a debate on the WTO.  From what I can see, Commissioner Mandelson is about to sell us out on a number of issues.  It would be important for the House to express its opinions.  This morning the President of the European Parliament, Mr. P&ouml;ttering, said that member states had the right to make their own submissions regarding any proposed decision of the Commission.  It would be important to have this debate as soon as possible.  If it means that the WTO talks are a failure in order for us to protect national interests, we have the right to do that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I support my colleagues.  It is notable that the call came from across the House that we should have a debate on the Olympic Games and China.  We have a comprehensive motion, No. 8, in the name of the Independent Senators about the position, for example, of the Tibetan people under the Dalai Lama.  Driving the Olympic torch through Tibet is tantamount to driving a dagger through the heart of democracy.  It is unconscionable humiliation of the oppressed people of Tibet.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that of course politics and sport are mixed, as the Chinese Government knows perfectly well which is why it grabbed the Olympic Games and is trying to milk them for whatever it could get out of them.  I am glad it has backfired.  I would like the Minister to come to the House and explain why, despite the fact that no less than three Fianna F&aacute;il former Ministers, the late Frank Aitken, Michael O&rsquo;Kennedy and David Andrews, did not support the so-called integration of Tibet into China, the Chinese ambassador can use <i>The Irish Times</i> to inform the people that it is our policy.  Is the Chinese ambassador now formulating and articulating foreign policy on our behalf?  We should boycott the opening ceremony.  The athletes should maintain a dignified absence.  James Joyce said that on some occasions &ldquo;absence is the highest form of presence&rdquo;.  By absenting themselves they would make a moral statement and it would allow them to continue to compete, which everybody would also like.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that we take No. 36, in the name of all the Independent Senators.  It is of particular urgency as it refers to the case of Ingrid Betancourt.  I know I am not the only person in the House &mdash; virtually everybody here feels very strongly about it.  This is an extraordinary woman, whose father was Colombian ambassador to UNESCO, whose mother founded an institution for street children in Colombia, who, herself, was elected by the highest vote to the Colombian Senate, who opened discussions with FARC in an honourable manner and was then kidnapped by that group.  She is now seriously ill with malaria and hepatitis B, and has a serious dermatological condition.  She may die if she does not get a blood transfusion.  In the interests of humanity, I ask that we should give even 20 minutes today to pass this resolution, which I am sure would be an all-party resolution.</P>
        <P>In light of our experience of British airports, despite the fact that an Irishman is in charge of the latest fiasco, and in light of the recent article by Senator Feargal Quinn in <i>The Irish Times </i>about joining the Schengen Agreement, it should be noted that Irish citizens are routinely refused the use of flight transfer facilities in British airports.  They are forced to land and then to re-apply to the airline.  In recent days two people close to me have experienced great difficulties in Heathrow Airport.  It is no coincidence that they are black haired, brown eyed and brown skinned.  One of them, a close friend of mine, was detained and asked how somebody like him acquired an Irish passport.  In response to that, I ask the Irish Government to arrange for some of the no doubt fully Aryan, blue eyed, fair haired, fair skinned staff of the British Embassy to be routinely detained at Collinstown Aerodrome in a special little room so they can experience the delights of racism, to which Irish citizens are routinely treated in Heathrow and other British airports.</P>

	<P>I was particularly impressed by the gracious tributes paid by Senator O&rsquo;Toole to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  I genuinely believe the Senator, as in most cases, has his finger on the pulse of public opinion in this regard.  During the debates this House held on Northern Ireland four or five years ago I recall saying that Deputy Bertie Ahern would stand out as one of the great political figures in the history of Ireland.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s tribute was particularly significant because he based most of his judgment on his personal working experience with the Taoiseach.  He said the Taoiseach always kept his word.  Tony Blair, David Trimble, the President of the United States and many others said the same.  More importantly, the ordinary people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">More importantly, ordinary communities throughout the country could say the same.  I believe they feel that Deputy Bertie Ahern is an ordinary man who gave extraordinary service to this nation.  I have no doubt history will record that as well.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that towards the end of his term of office he should be invited to the Seanad to discuss the major issues with which he was engaged and promoted and in which he believed.  I cannot think of anybody who had greater vision or greater tenacity than the Taoiseach.  He was particularly gracious when he was confronted by antagonism, and that was one of his great strengths.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment briefly on the Olympic Games and the treatment of the Tibetans by China.  We saw with horror the terrible brutality exercised against people who were peacefully protesting.  However, I am not sure that boycott is the answer in a case such as this.  It would be like retreating to our bunkers.  This House held debates during the blackest days in the history of Northern Ireland and against a background of terrible atrocities.  Even at that time we continued to promote the concept of dialogue.  If we wish to make a statement, we should not do so from our bunkers.  We should, as is expected of legislators and politicians, confront the issues when the opportunity arises and do so directly with the people whom we consider to be the perpetrators.  People disagreed with me the last time I made these points in the House but we have made some progress at opening dialogue where China is concerned.  If we retrace our steps at this stage, we will not help global peace and I doubt that we will help Tibet.  Much can be learned from the Northern Ireland situation.  We must be consistent and persistent at all times.  If we believe in what we are saying, the place to do that is where it matters.</P>

	<P>I compliment the House on the visit of President P&ouml;ttering.  His presentation was very helpful and clear.  He exemplified all that is good and important about a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, promised this country a world class health service.  By no means do we have that.  I take this opportunity to ask the Leader and the Cathaoirleach to convey to the Minister for Finance and Taoiseach-in-waiting, Deputy Brian Cowen, the need to have the courage to consider replacing the current Minister for Health and Children with somebody who is nationally committed and patient focused.  I use the term &ldquo;nationally committed&rdquo; because in the past few days I learned that the Minister is ready to outsource all laboratory work in an EU tender.  Cervical smears will no longer be analysed in this country.  The Minister has not invested in the laboratories in this country and there are no accredited laboratories in any of our major teaching hospitals.  That is a disgrace.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is another example.  The Minister&rsquo;s actions are proof that she has no confidence in the HSE to deliver, while she fails to reform or manage it.</P>
        <P>Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said there is not a &ldquo;red cent&rdquo; for a hospital in the north east.  What does that say about the capital programme for health?  Our health service is in serious trouble.  The Cathaoirleach is very close to the new leader in waiting and I ask him to use this month to urge the replacement of the Minister for Health and Children.  I do not ask this easily but I seek a patient focused Minister.  This morning, University College Hospital in Galway had its highest number of people on trolleys, a total of 40.  The Minister is currently outsourcing smear tests to US laboratories, which have 80% to 85% reliability for results whereas in Galway, for example, there is 95% reliability.  That is the <Col N="32"/>standard of care for which this Minister stands.  I would like the Cathaoirleach to make an intervention on my behalf.</P>

We debate the loss of life in this Chamber through drug abuse, road traffic accidents and even gang land killings, yet we do not recognise the seriousness of eating disorders and the terrible effects they have on our young people.  Any time a debate is called for on eating disorders, it is sadly always raised by one of the female Senators.  We should take it on.  It is a potential killer; boys as young as seven suffer from it; it is on the increase; and its effects are carried through into adulthood.  I thank Bodywhys for keeping all Members of this House informed on what is going on with this terrible issue.</P>

D&rsquo;iarr m&eacute; go mbeadh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn mar ph&aacute;irt de Sheachtain na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge thart.  I ask the Leader to facilitate that debate.  When I contacted the Minister&rsquo;s office he was willing to come here during Seachtain na Gaeilge to discuss the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  It is a missed opportunity.  I ask the Leader to deal with that as soon as possible, considering the statistics on the problems the Irish language faces, which I have gone over time and again in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>I repeat a call I made before the recess about the pharmacy dispute and the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline to this Chamber the contingency she will put in place as a result of the pharmacies withdrawing from the contracts with effect from 1 May.  When the Minister was here before and in answering questions of Deputies and Senators she said only a handful of pharmacies will withdraw.  We now know the reality.  In Donegal 40 out of 51 will withdraw from the scheme from 1 May.  The figures in Mayo are similar and I believe the trend will continue to emerge throughout the country in the time ahead.  People and patients are concerned about where they will get their medicine on 1 and 2 May.  We need the Minister to outline her plan and we need to tease that out.</P>
        <P>We need a real debate on education and its funding.  As other Senators have said, we have just come off the back of the education conference that took place over Easter week.  The one clear message from that conference is that we cannot provide a world class education service on a shoestring.  This Government is trying to do that and we see the evidence in overcrowded classrooms, the difficulty of fund-raising and funding for the running costs of schools and the issue of dilapidated buildings.  We have a serious crisis in education if we want to achieve the type of education standard I would like to see.  We need that debate.</P>

	<P>I was delighted to hear much of the rubbish that has been talked outside the House put down by President P&ouml;ttering.  I was glad to get many of the clarifications of what is and is not included in the reform treaty.  President P&ouml;ttering spoke as a German and mentioned the Berlin wall coming down.  Not long ago Senator Quinn and I were in a forum with another German who said his parents lived near the wall and were there when it was built, but when they experienced Northern Ireland they experienced more of a wall there than they did with a physical wall in Germany.  In that context I add my voice to what I had presumed was on the cards, that the Taoiseach was to come here to talk about the situation in the North in the context of the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>While recognising the great strides that have taken place so far I ask the Taoiseach to come here before he steps down and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to do so on a separate day to talk about the matters that remain to be dealt with.  Anybody who watches the documentaries or lives in or near the areas knows the bigotry, sectarianism and the 17 new walls or extensions of walls that exist in the North.  They mean that while the political process has moved on, the community process remains to be dealt with.  Now that the Taoiseach is freer of the shackles of responsibility, he might feel freer to say some things he wants to say about what needs to happen from now on.</P>
        <P>I have previously raised the great work in producing music therapists in the University of Limerick and I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, the report in the health supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that music therapy is being used in rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain injury.  We often talk here about road accidents.  Half of the people who acquire brain injuries do so usually as a result of road accidents.  I draw the attention of the Leader, the House and the Minister to the tremendous work University of Limerick is doing on the development of research and music therapists.</P>
        <P>It is a scandal that we still do not professionally recognise music therapists.  I understand the reasons why they are not recognised but I ask that the process be developed quickly.  Music therapy is internationally recognised, even in the North of Ireland, but not here.  We have talked much about autism.  Music therapy has the capacity to bring speech to autistic children and reduce repetitive behaviour, but there is much new research emerging on music therapy and brain injury.</P>

	<P>Recent Exchequer returns indicate a serious reduction in the tax take.  It is undergoing radical decline in terms of budget projections and in absolute terms.  This will result, and is resulting, in cutbacks and retrenchment, particularly in current expenditure.  I am very concerned that these cutbacks are focused on front line services such as the reduction in home helps, the cancellation of the summer works programme and the proposed freezing of the reduction of school class sizes in primary schools.  These are only some of the cuts.  I put it to the Leader that we have a special debate on this.  I second Senator Phelan&rsquo;s proposition that we have a debate on the economy, but I want a particular focus on this.  Rather than reducing those front line services that are relevant to ordinary people, we should examine the quangos, the over-reliance on advisors and consultants and the marginalisation of the native civil service that parallels that.  We should have an audit on this area, reduce that wastage and use the <Col N="35"/>money saved for front line services.  It is a horror that the focus is the other way.  The old people who need home helps are the soft touch, the easy ones to target.  It is difficult to tackle the quangos, administrative personnel, consultancies and the major financial interest groups involved.  I put it to the Leader that we should have this debate to focus on these issues.  We must engage in a retrenchment of the economy that is based on proper human considerations in terms of efficiencies and not on the backs of the weak in our society.  I specifically want the issue of the reduction of class sizes at primary level put back on the rails by September.  We must examine where cuts are possible.  We can achieve much more by eliminating wastage and privilege in this country.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, to the House to debate the current situation regarding world food security.  I make this call because I am very conscious of the positive steps being taken regarding bio-fuel.  However, because a large percentage of world productive capacity is now moving towards the production of bio-fuel, there has been a drought in Australia and an increase in demand from China and India, there is now a developing food shortage and the commodity prices of items such as rice and wheat are increasing substantially.  At the moment, the security level of the world food supply is quite low.  There should be 90 days of reserves, but supplies are well below that level.  I suggest that this is an opportunity for this country to ask the EU to examine this issue in the context of the possibility of increasing food production because we have the capacity here to increase such production significantly.</P>

In that context, it would be appropriate to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House at the earliest possible date to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Pearse Doherty regarding the pharmacy dispute.  As he quite rightly said, 1 May is approaching quickly and on that date, pharmacies throughout the country will stop dispensing to medical card holders.

If the executive will not listen to the union or sit down with its members, how can it resolve the dispute?  This is an urgent issue.  Does the HSE have a contingency plan in place in the event of pharmacists ceasing to dispense to medical card holders?  What plans are in place to ensure the most vulnerable in society have their medical needs met?

        <P Just="Left">I raise the very disturbing reports that we are facing a measles epidemic as a direct result of a decrease in the rate of vaccinations.  While I can understand the concerns and fears of parents regarding the consequences of the MMR vaccine, there is as of yet no credible scientific evidence to link vaccination with the incidence of autism.  However, it is a clearly established fact <Col N="36"/>that measles can have devastating consequences.  It can leave in its wake children who had been experiencing normal development prior to infection but who, as a direct result of contracting measles, go on to acquire intellectual disabilities.  We are now seeing, for the first time in a very long time, children presenting for assessment and diagnosis of an intellectual disability as a result of having acquired measles.  This is completely preventable and avoidable.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Health and Children the necessity for an urgent campaign of public information on the facts of vaccination.  This is also an opportune moment to ask those who have been urging parents not to have their children vaccinated to reflect on the consequences of such action.</P>

        <P>When does the Leader expect that the electoral Bill, giving legislative effect to the changes proposed by the boundary commission, will be published and introduced in the House?  Senator Ellis beat me to the punch in referring to the comments of the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach-designate, Deputy Brian Cowen, who suggested that there might be a possible interim stage in future arrangements regarding the workings of the commission in that we may have a draft proposal or draft documents which could be discussed in both Houses.  There may be some merit in that and the T&aacute;naiste was careful to say he intended that such a process would not in any way detract from or diminish the independence of the commission, which would be vital.  I look forward to hearing the Leader of the House, given he is a conduit between this House and the Government, on current Government thinking on this matter.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleagues regarding the long-running and ongoing pharmacy dispute.  We all know that this cannot be settled without dialogue.  There will be no resolution without dialogue.  I plead with the Leader to use his good offices with the Government to ensure a structure for dialogue is put in place immediately.

It was very heartening today to hear the President of the European Parliament, Mr. P&ouml;ttering, address us in his few words of Gaeilge and to refer to the fact that Irish is now an official language of the EU.  That is a victory for many Members on all sides of this House who regularly championed the cause of the Irish language.

        <P>Senator Feeney raised the very important matter of the treatment of anorexia nervosa.  I have dealt with that issue in my profession on many occasions.  There is a very strong argument to be made for a properly equipped unit to be located in the midlands.  Such a unit would not require many beds but would provide a very important service.  It is regrettable that the incidence of anorexia nervosa is on the increase and in that context, the argument for a dedicated unit is well made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have raised the matter of organ donation on previous occasions.  It is a vexed question but one with which we must deal.  In many cases, as I have said previously, we are burying life with <Col N="37"/>death.  The organs of people involved in serious accidents could be used to extend the lives of sufferers with various ailments.  I ask again that this debate take place as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Perhaps my party spokesperson, Senator Feeney, and others will liaise with the Leader to organise a debate on the increasing incidence of diabetes.  I argued for a debate on this issue for two years during the previous Seanad before it was granted.  It was a short debate but this issue must be tackled.  If diabetes were eradicated, many hospitals could close.  There are many reasons the high incidence of diabetes should be centre stage.</P>

        <P>I also support Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business in order that we can briefly debate No. 19, motion 36.  &ldquo;Debate&rdquo; is the wrong word because I was delighted with the move towards to an all-party agreement in No. 19, motion 32.  It is similar to ours but longer and it calls for the release of Ingrid Betancourt and other hostages in Colombia.  However, this week her detention has reached a crisis.  Protests have taken place across Europe and in other countries and it is looking very bad for her.  It would be important for the House to discuss an agreed motion or hold a short debate on the issue in order that we can add our voices to the pressure building for her release.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a boycott of the opening ceremony at the Olympic Games in light of China&rsquo;s treatment of Tibetan protestors.  A surprising source suggested on a radio programme earlier that sport and politics are entirely separate.  I was reminded of the old feminist slogan, &ldquo;The personal is political.&rdquo;  Even a decision not to vaccinate one&rsquo;s child is a political decision and we cannot separate the two.  It is important that this sensible call for a boycott in light of the status of Tibet should be supported by us and we should have a debate in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan mentioned the electoral boundary commission and need for an all-party view to be taken on its report.  Although I do not have a direct interest in this, I and the other Independent Members are conscious of the need to ensure the voices of Independent Deputies should be heard on whatever decisions are taken on the redrawing of constituency boundaries.</P>

	<P>It is not the appropriate day but Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, O&rsquo;Malley, Leyden, Ormonde, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Healy-Eames, Feeney, Keaveney and Corrigan expressed their views about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s retirement.  I would like to join them in acknowledging his achievements.  We all were surprised and those of us who have worked closely with him for a long time are aware of his achievements.  Ireland is a better and more prosperous place and a safer island with almost 1 million more people at work.  The Taoiseach has made an immeasurable contribution to the lifestyle of every family on the island of Ireland.  There will be an appropriate time when all Members can acknowledge and recognise his achievements.</P>
        <P>It was suggested the Taoiseach should be invited to the House before 6 May and it is my intention to make this possible, especially in the context of upcoming debates on the Lisbon treaty and the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  This week marks the historic anniversary of the achievements of those who participated in the negotiations and made the <Col N="38"/>Agreement happen.  The Taoiseach represented our part of the island with great distinction, determination and ability and he was successful in bringing the Agreement to fruition.  The lives of all children aged 13 or 14 have changed immeasurably and, for example, many 20 year olds do not remember any Taoiseach other than Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Many constituents are aware of the immeasurable contribution he has made and I will endeavour to have him present in the House to update the House on the future of the Agreement and the Lisbon treaty and to reflect on the achievements of the past.  We can let our views be known to him on these issues.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach, Senators and the staff of the House for making the historic visit of the President of the European Parliament to the House possible.  It was an uplifting experience.  He made a brilliant contribution which was one of the best I have ever heard in the House.  I thank Senators, particularly those who had to travel more than 200 miles, for being present early this morning.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Regan, Hannigan, O&rsquo;Toole and Fitzgerald called for an urgent update and debate on crime and the difficulties being experienced, in particular, in the Limerick region.  Deputy Boyle referred to the Limerick regeneration plan and we will give all the support we can to everyone concerned, including the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  They are being confronted with issues on an hourly basis throughout the country.  I have no difficulty scheduling a debate on this and I will make the request of the Minister later.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Malley, Buttimer, Ross, John Paul Phelan, Doherty, Norris and Bacik called for an urgent debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the upcoming Olympic Games in China and the difficulties being experienced in Zimbabwe.  I have contacted the Minister to finalise a date for a debate and he has agreed to attend the House.  It is only a matter of finding a date in his diary and I will try to arrange this as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Many Senators sought a debate on education and I have no difficulty inviting the Minister for Education and Science to the House to update us on her achievements over the past ten years and to outline what will happen over the next five to ten years.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and Buttimer called for an urgent debate on the national aviation strategy and, in particular, Cork Airport.  I have no difficulty inviting the Minister for Transport to the House for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators John Paul Phelan, Ross, MacSharry and O&rsquo;Reilly requested a debate on the challenges facing the economy, especially in the context of the upcoming social partnership talks.  It was reassuring to hear the comments of the President of the European Parliament on corporation tax.  <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an article today on Ireland&rsquo;s veto in this regard.  I was pleased we were able to get clarification on this at first hand.</P>
      
        <P>With regard to Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s point on consultants, the use of consultants began when his former Leader was Taoiseach in the 1980s.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley called for a debate on prisons and I have no problem with allocating time for this.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly called for a debate on the report on Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley.  I assure the House I have no difficulty with this and will try to have it prioritised so it will happen as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly called for an urgent debate on the report on mobile telephones and masts.  He outlined to the House his very sad experience with regard to the fears of family members.  The fear about this is enormous in certain areas.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate.  Senator MacSharry called for a debate on tribunals.  I will endeavour to have this take place.</P><Col N="39"/>
        <P>Senators MacSharry and Burke called for an urgent debate on the Health Service Executive.  In particular, Senator MacSharry outlined to the House that a major case can be made for north of the line from Dublin to Galway.  I will have this debated in the House during the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senators Ellis and Coghlan are concerned about the electoral boundary commission and want an urgent update.  Naturally enough, this is of serious concern, especially where county boundaries have been breached.  I have a vested interest, along with Senator Ellis in particular.  I can safely state that if the county boundaries in our areas were not breached we would be Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann today.</P>

Everyone deserves to have good representation.  People from one area should not be put into another, leaving that area without representation, especially on the Government side.  The loss of a Government TD is a serious one for an area.  I speak with considerable experience.</P>

	<P>Senator Ellis also called for a debate on matters pertaining to the World Trade Organisation, in particular to Commissioner Mandelson.  I have agreed to have the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, present for a full all-day debate on agriculture and everything pertaining to the portfolio at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Bacik and Coghlan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business with regard to No. 19, motion 36.  I will endeavour to allocate time for one hour on Thursday morning and I ask Senator Norris to consider this.  I can speak with the Leaders of the various groups after the Order of Business to see whether this is possible.  This side of the House fully supports Senator Norris.  It is horrific.  We had an all-party signature on this prior to the recess and the House fully supports the Senator&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>Senators Feeney, Glynn and Bacik called for a special unit to be put in place for eating disorders.  It is a serious challenge, especially for young people.  I fully support the call made on me here today and I will agree to have a debate.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>Senators Burke, Coghlan and Glynn called for a debate on the Irish language.  Every year, we have one major debate on the Irish language and it is now due.  We definitely will have it during this session.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn also called for a debate on diabetes.  It is a serious disease and one of which everyone should be made fully aware.  I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate on this.  I congratulate Senator Glynn on his steadfast determination to bring this disease to the forefront.</P>
        <P>Senators Doherty, Burke, Coghlan and Glynn expressed concern regarding the difficulties between the pharmacists and the Health Service Executive and called for the Minister to update the House on the matter, in particular with regard to the 1 May deadline.  This is another deadline the country faces and I will endeavour to have the Minister present to discuss this.</P>
        <P>I will pass on to the Minister Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s strong views with regard to music therapy.  We all know it is very uplifting.  Those of us involved in the industry for most of our lives certainly can support her call.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on world productive capacity, in particular with regard to world food supplies.  I can have a debate take place on this and I support the call made.</P>
        <P>Senators Corrigan and Bacik raised the issue of vaccinations and the measles epidemic which could take place if people are not careful enough and do not treat vaccinations as a serious precaution.  We must take the advice of Senator Corrigan in particular as she has a great deal of experience in this area.  I will pass on her strong views to the Minister and if we need a debate on it, I will allow time for it to take place.  Senator Glynn called for a debate on organ donations.  This is another important call and I can have it take place.</P>
        <P>The Leaders of the groups can assist me as Leader of the House by taking the matters raised during the Order of Business in Private Members&rsquo; time.  For example, I could suggest to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues that we take the organ donations issue in Private Members&rsquo; time.  Today, 37 Senators contributed on the Order of Business.  A great deal of business is being called on during this session.  We have a long session on this occasion.  However, in an effort to be helpful we should consider Private Members&rsquo; time to discuss and debate some of the genuine calls being made on me today and to bring them to the attention of the relevant Ministers.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to speak on the EU reform treaty.  Members will be aware that last week the D&aacute;il began the debate and I look forward to it moving to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Before I get into the body of my contribution, I wish to refer to some comments by the French Finance Minister reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  The statement, as reported, is untimely, unhelpful and, frankly, inappropriate.  The House will be aware that to date a paper on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, has not been even produced.  When such a paper emerges 26 member states as well as France will have a view on the issue.  Ireland will not be the only member state which will be negative in so far as CCCTB is concerned.</P>
        <P>Any CCCTB proposal would require unanimous agreement and there is absolutely no chance of that.  However, what this episode demonstrates is the wisdom of a recent statement by the president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland who urged a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum to maximise our standing and our negotiating position in Europe.  He went on to state that voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; will achieve that and voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the opposite.</P>
        <P>The French Finance Minister was speaking yesterday at an annual Brussels tax forum about the themes for the upcoming French Presidency of the EU in the second half of the year which will include environmental taxation, the savings directive as well as company taxation.  On the common consolidated corporate tax base, she admitted that it is a controversial issue and that there may be no swift agreement on it.  One could sing that.  She also said that France supports the CCCTB concept and that she would like to have a debate on the issue.  We would welcome the opportunity for an open, honest and informed discussion on the matter because we will make our opposition clear at that time and so, incidentally, will member states which, like Ireland, have been waiting for this elephant to be deposited.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty preserves the existing treaty arrangements whereby taxation matters must be decided by unanimous vote.  Taxation matters are, and will remain, within the competence of member states.  They are not a Union competence now nor will they be when the treaty is enacted.  Any member state can veto a proposal on taxation, and that is as it should be.  Any CCCTB proposal would require unanimous agreement to become Community law.  A substantial number of member states have already indicated their opposition to the proposal and to the direction this debate has been taking.  A CCCTB could not be lawfully established by way of enhanced co-operation if it were liable to impose a degree of enforced harmonisation on non-participating member states.</P>
        <P>More importantly, any member state which is not part of an enhanced co-operation agreement cannot be forced to participate in, or be subject to, the decisions made by the group of member states establishing the agreement.  The assertions that somehow or other Ireland is to lose its veto on taxation is false.  No member state can be forced against its will to change the rules on taxation under the reform treaty or under any other treaty.  The reform treaty matters to Ireland and Europe.  That is why I take this opportunity to put these views on the record.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>The treaty has resulted from a negotiation process that began with the Convention on the Future of Europe.  As Senator Quinn identified earlier today, that convention flowed from the Laeken agreement and was informed by the Laeken statement.  The convention was an important democratic innovation.  It brought the process of EU treaty reform closer to the citizens.  It involved representatives of not only EU governments, or their administrations, as had been the case in all previous treaties but also of the national parliaments of the 27 member states.  It brought governments and oppositions into the same chamber and the institutions and a civil society pillar together.  The input of these various players can be seen in the shape of the treaty.  It is a document which provides for greater transparency, enhanced democracy and for a Europe that, more than ever before, can look outwards beyond its borders to the challenges presented by the wider world.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, the treaty is a very balanced document.  Great balance was achieved in the discussions on the future of Europe and during the Irish IGC.  The negotiation process informed the treaty before us.  It is particularly beneficial from the viewpoint of smaller member states.</P>
        <P>One point should be kept in mind given the suggestion that the negotiators should be sent back to the drawing board to come up with another treaty.  Any search for a different outcome could well upset the very hard-earned balance we have achieved in this treaty.  To suggest to the other 26 member states that they should start again is, to put it very kindly, a naive course to take.  As I said, the existing proposal is a good one and rejecting it would serve no useful purpose, above all for Ireland.  Ireland, more than any other member state, copperfastened all its key issues, taxation, neutrality and, as the President of the European Parliament said this morning, our position on abortion in this treaty.</P>
        <P>In light of the French Finance Minister&rsquo;s statements, does anybody with a clue as to how negotiations work really think that voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;, thereby reopening a Pandora&rsquo;s box, including the taxation question, is a good idea?  Having sat through the Convention on the Future of Europe, the ICG and the Irish Presidency and been involved in the last set of decisions, I, for one, do not believe it is an idea which has anything to recommend it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">President P&ouml;ttering in his address to the Seanad this morning made the point that the EU has seen a Continent turn its back on 19th century nationalism.  He is right in that regard.  Through economic and political co-operation the Union has consigned disastrous European wars to history.  At its heart has been the determination of member states to act, not, as some suggest, in a way that beggars their neighbour or achieves some new hegemony in Europe but, in solidarity in the overall European interest.  The essential secret of the European Union is that it is a unique union of equal member states.  While it might seem paradoxical to some, particularly those who oppose this treaty, such solidarity, which often involves real compromise and concession, is also in the interests of individual member states, particularly the smaller ones like Ireland.</P>
        <P>The treaty enhances the European Union&rsquo;s democratic character.  Who in Ireland would vote against more democracy?  Not I.  It increases the role of the national and EU Parliaments.  Who sees this as a dangerous topic?  Not I.  I believe that the decision to involve national parliaments more intimately in the process of making European law is one of the most revolutionary steps forward since the original Treaty of Rome.  The treaty also seeks to reform the decision-making institutions of the EU and makes the Union better equipped to deal with the real issues that are important to the lives of Europe&rsquo;s citizens, globalisation, energy security, climate change and, a more challenging international economic environment.  These  challenges cannot be addressed by any individual member state but by the Union acting in concert.</P><Col N="44"/>
        <P>The treaty strengthens the voice of the European Union on the world stage.  This is a good thing because the European Union is built, as Mr. P&ouml;ttering said this morning, on values which come from our constitutions and from the heart of the people.  It gives legal effect the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a fine document.  It sets out more clearly the EU&rsquo;s powers and limits and it gives specific powers to the Union to help combat international and cross-border crime.</P>
        <P>The increase in the role of national parliaments is of particular relevance to this House.  This capacity for national parliaments to invoke the principle of subsidiarity will enhance ownership, parliamentary engagement and accountability.  Between us, the 27 member states have almost 10,000 Senators and Members of Parliament.  Connecting these many thousands of public representatives directly to the EU legislative process can, and will, inject an entirely new dynamic into the democratic functioning of the Union.   For example, I was taken by a document recently produced by IBEC in which it explored exactly what this would mean to Irish businesses, small, medium and large.  IBEC made the point that Irish businesses will be better able to communicate their concerns and wishes to the directly elected members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann and to represent their views at a much earlier stage in the process of law making than is the case currently.</P>
        <P>Some opponents of the treaty have dismissed this step as insignificant.  I respectfully disagree and I believe that the vast majority of parliamentarians across Europe would share my view.  The impact of this change will be largely what we, parliamentarians, make it.  The enhancement of the European Parliament&rsquo;s co-decision-making powers, the introduction of the so-called &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; for national parliaments and the citizens&rsquo; initiative makes the Union more effective, open and democratically accountable.  As stated by Mr. P&ouml;ttering this morning, when he entered, as a directly elected member, the Parliament of Europe in 1979 it had no co-decision rights.  Following ratification of this treaty, it will be involved in virtually every single area.  This cannot be dismissed as anything other than positive in a nation that espouses democracy.</P>
        <P>In doing so, the treaty aims to show that political leaders have learned from their dialogue with citizens and are bringing representatives of the people of Europe closer into the process.  Some opponents of the treaty worry about what they see as a loss of sovereignty, an argument that has been around for 35 years.  One respects people&rsquo;s views.  The greatest measure of our sovereignty is our capacity to chart our own course; to meet our obligations and to realise our ambitions.  In this respect, we are better able today to provide a decent pension for the elderly and a better living for the young.  We are better able to build a future for current and future generations and are less likely than ever before to wave off new generations to a future of emigration.  These are practical, day-to-day, food-on-the-table measures of sovereignty.  I put it to this House, we are much better in the expression of our sovereignty of a nation now than in 1972.  We are more the masters of our destiny today than we were then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people are attached to the nation state and the sense of identity and security that goes with it.  I am one of those people.  I believe the concept of the nation state is alive and well.  I am a Wexford man by birth, I live in Wicklow, I am Irish and European.  It is not a question of being one or the other but of being all at the same time.  Most of us would acknowledge that we must pool our resources if we, small countries, are to have any chance of coping with the global challenges facing us.  If we are honest, we know this is a major reason so many countries want to be part of the Union.  The test we face is legitimising the institutions we have created and the structures we have built to implement the policies we have devised to face our global challenges.  For reasons of language and culture this is not straightforward.  That is why I agree with those who say it is important to find better ways of connecting our national political <Col N="45"/>institutions with the European institutions.  What is certain, beyond doubt, is that the treaty does that; it creates a greater sense of connection than ever before.</P>
        <P>The EU institutions should not be viewed as remote, irrelevant bodies.  They, and the careful balance that exists between them, play a real role in the lives of European citizens.  This balance, particularly that between the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, has served the interests of Europe well for more than 50 years.  It has also served this nation well for more than 35 years.  In doing so, it has served the interests of the small and the large states.</P>
        <P>I recall during the debate on the second Nice treaty referendum asking an opponent during an interview on a radio station to name one occasion when large member states had ganged up on small member states.  That does not happen.  It is not the way the Union works.  That is why the Government places great value on preserving this balance.  It is why we worked hard to this end on the convention and during the negotiations on the constitutional and reform treaties.  It is because this vital balance has been preserved that we wholeheartedly endorse the treaty.  We were part of what was known as &ldquo;the friends of the Community method&rdquo;, a group of small and medium sized countries in the convention.  We created a lot of difficulties for Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing but we did so because we wanted balance.  We wanted equality to be recognised and enshrined and we won that battle.  One of the great victories in the Convention on the Future of Europe was when the small and medium states managed to persuade the large states it was in everybody&rsquo;s interest to recognise equality.  To suggest, as opponents do, that small member states are losing their footing in this treaty does not ring true.  The scenario painted by opponents would suggest that the majority of governments, which, after all, represent small and medium-sized states, took leave of their senses and accepted an agreement that was against their national interests.  That is not likely and it did not happen.</P>
        <P>In the Commission, there is equality of treatment between member states and that is a good idea.  In the Council, the double majority system strikes a reasonable balance and recognises the equality between member states and citizens.  People who argue that we have had our voting strength halved are not telling the truth.  The reality of the new voting system is that a 55% majority of member states representing not less than 65% of member states is required.  To suggest, as Sinn F&eacute;in has done, that this is not the case, is simply to decide one will decide who wins a hurling match by not counting those balls that go over the bar.</P>
        <P>In the European Parliament, small member states continue to be allocated more seats than strict population criteria would allow.  For some, our membership of the Union after 35 years is a given or something to be taken for granted.  However, I take a different view.  I take the view that it is part of our role to build the Union, to create a more equal and democratic one and one that works and builds on the previous blocks.  We, like all member states, have a right to see it develop in the direction we want it to go.</P>
        <P>The Union gives us in Ireland a platform to develop our economy and improve the living standards of our citizens.  It gives us a place at the table to put forward our views on the important global issues of the day.  It gives us confidence as a nation that goes with membership of a group of countries possessing shared aspirations and, most importantly, shared values.</P>
        <P>The treaty will give the Union the flexibility and capability to face the major challenges that lie ahead.  The sheer scale of the challenges &mdash; climate change, migration, the eradication of poverty and globalisation &mdash; means that no single country of any scale can deal with those problems, let alone a small country.  The European Union is the most effective way of dealing with these problems we face.  It is the most effective organisation, universally, for that purpose.  It has an important role in creating a better future and has a real responsibility to play that role effectively.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P>The reform treaty recognises this.  In creating a President of the European Council, it is creating more efficiency within the Council.  The president title seems to scare some people, but it means little more than the title &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo;.  In creating a high representative for common foreign and security policy, the treaty aims to give the Union a clearer and more coherent voice in international affairs.  Having regard to the manner in which international affairs have turned in recent years, surely a coherent voice that represents more clearly the combined values of the European member states is something to which we should look forward.  This voice will reflect the shared interests and values of European people &mdash; a voice that will have democracy, human rights and the rule of law at its core.  It will be a consensus voice that will speak on behalf of and follow the mandate of all the member states.  The new high representative will not be an authority in his or her right.  That role will follow the role prescribed by the member states.</P>
        <P>We, as a small nation, have a strong interest in preventing and resolving regional and global conflicts and in creating a fairer international order.  We have an interest in bringing our influence and principles to bear.  The best way for us to do this is through active engagement in the Union, in particular as the Union has as its core the principles of the United Nations Charter.  This is not to say that our national voice or interests will be submerged.  That will not be the case.  Unanimity will continue to rule with regard to the common foreign and security policy, in particular in the defence area.  This also applies to military and defence applications.  There is absolutely no threat to our traditional policy of military neutrality.  Again the myth makers are attempting to mislead the Irish people.</P>
        <P>I would like to address some issues concerning the referendum.  One issue has been the question of creating more information.  The best thing we can do as democrats, whether we are in favour of or against this treaty, is to engage the people in a truthful dialogue about it and to have a narration on the treaty which deals with its provisions and not with myths.  To facilitate this, we have taken certain steps because we believe a high voter turnout is important.  It is important because it is our constitution and every citizen in this State has a right and a responsibility to protect it.</P>
        <P>The Government published a White Paper last week which explains the content of the treaty in a clear, factual and detailed manner.  The White Paper is available free of charge from my Department.  It is being distributed to public libraries, citizens advice centres and other public offices.  It is also available on the reform treaty website.  All key documents are available in Irish and in English and there are special versions for the visually impaired.  Additionally, we will distribute an explanatory guide to the treaty later this month to every household in the country.  That has been available from the freefone number since early in the year.  Every library and citizens information centre also has received multiple copies of all the key documents.</P>
        <P>Separately, the referendum commission will begin shortly its work of providing independent and impartial information to voters on the subject matter of the referendum.  The Forum on Europe, which was mentioned this morning, deserves further positive mention as it has done incredible work.  Other organisations are involved also in engaging in the hosting of public information meetings throughout the country.</P>
        <P>In total, therefore, there is and will be a wealth of information available to citizens.  The Government is fully content to let the facts speak for themselves.  This is a good treaty.  When the people realise it is about creating a more open, transparent, democratic, efficient and effective Europe built on rights and which enshrines in its law the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the people will be persuaded, as I am, that this is a good treaty.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>I believe the Irish people will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for positive reasons.  I do not like an element that crept into the debate of bullying, badgering and misleading the people.  No one in this referendum should try to scare or bully people in voting in any particular direction.  It would be futile and counter-productive because the Irish people are and will be the best informed in Europe.</P>
        <P>On the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; side, we believe the treaty speaks loudly and positively for itself.  We will highlight and explain these attributes.  Where necessary, we will counter the misrepresentations about the treaty, some of which are bizarre, even by the standards of previous referenda.  We will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because we recognise the value of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the European project.  Who would challenge the fact that Ireland today is an infinitely more wealthy, self-confident, progressive, forward-looking place than it was in 1972?</P>

	<P>I remember entering the Civil Service as a young civil servant in 1972.  The order of the day was mass migration &mdash; emigration.  Our biggest export was our people.  Our industry was basic and protected behind barriers.  Our only trading partner of any order was the United Kingdom.  Today we have become one of the most successful economies in the world.  We no longer force our young people, our talent, our patrimony to leave our shores.  As a nation, we have grown self-confident, progressive and dynamic in Europe because of Europe.  As the President  of the European Parliament said in this House earlier, we have added to Europe.  We will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because the Irish people value the peace that the European Union has shaped on the Continent and we recognise the support that Europe has given to shaping peace on this island.  We will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because we value a more democratic place.  We value the ideas for which that the Union stands.  We want a more effective and efficient Union.  We want a Union that can champion peace, justice, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for the individual in an all too often troubled world.  We will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because, as a practical people, we recognise that the best way to deal with the major global challenges that face the world today is to combine our efforts.  As was said this morning, the essential genius of the European Union was that by pooling small amounts of sovereignty, huge mountains were climbed.  Above all, we will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; because the majority of the Irish people can see and are convinced our development, our place as a nation and our future economic well-being are best served by keeping Ireland where it has been for the past 35 years &mdash; at the heart of Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will be speaking to American Chamber of Commerce Ireland tomorrow morning.  I was much taken by a document it produced which illustrates how much value there is in being where we are in Europe.  This document was produced two months ago in Brussels.  It points out that this island nation off the coast of Europe with a population of 4.2 million attracted $88 billion in US foreign direct investment to our shores in the period to 2006.  In the same period Brazil, India, Russia and China attracted US$73 billion in such investment.  That US$88 billion investment in this country produced jobs and resulted in prosperity flowing through our economy.</P>
        <P>When Se&aacute;n Lemass signed a document on 31 July 1961 to apply to join the then EEC, he could not in his wildest dreams have imagined the momentousness of that day.  Ireland is the only country that will be asked to vote in a referendum on this treaty.  I celebrate that fact.  It is a good thing.  Referenda are good things.  Democracy is a good thing.  If all of us on either side of the argument bring truthful arguments to the Irish people, the vote will be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I hope that will be the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming again to the House to discuss the Lisbon treaty.  I compliment him on his energy and determination in pursuing a <Col N="48"/>vigorous campaign to have the treaty passed in a referendum.  The important lesson we have learned from the Nice treaty referendums is that we do not want domestic political issues clouding the decision.  We want the treaties to be judged on their merits and we want people to be informed and to have a high turnout.  The events of the past week, where Deputy Bertie Ahern has resigned as Taoiseach, have effectively removed a major issue which was clouding the debate.  I have no doubt this would have had a determining effect on the outcome. </P>
        <P>I questioned whether this referendum could be won if Deputy Bertie Ahern was still Taoiseach, last November, when the Minister of State was in this House.  He took umbrage with my comments that day, but time has shown it was a correct statement.  I am glad these domestic political issues will not cloud the decision on 12 June, if that is the date of the referendum.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and all the parties are playing their part in informing people, trying to give a correct account of what is actually in the treaty, and the significance of the changes proposed.  We will be playing our part in ensuring that Fine Gael supporters and those who we can influence will vote on the day.  As the Minister of State has said, the facts speak for themselves.  When the document is examined and judged on its merits, I believe the treaty will be passed.</P>
        <P>It is also important to state that the treaty did not emerge from thin air.  Like all previous treaties it arose from a response to the political and economic demands and challenges of each era.  The Treaty of Rome, 1957, was established in Europe to ensure that economic integration would lead to the establishment of post-war economic recovery.  The Single European Act 1986 was designed to improve the competitiveness of Europe, providing for the completion of the Internal Market.  The Maastricht treaty was designed to establish economic and monetary union, among many other things, and ultimately the establishment of the euro.  The purpose of the Amsterdam treaty was to prepare the Union for enlargement and the Nice treaty was designed to make essentially institutional changes.  Ireland played a part in each case and had a very big influence in shaping the treaties.  President P&ouml;ttering this morning pointed out the important events which took place when Ireland had the Presidency.  Liam Cosgrave was President of the European Council during the Irish Presidency, from January to June 1975, Garret FitzGerald in 1984, Charlie Haughey in 1990, John Bruton in 1996 and the outgoing Taoiseach in 2004.</P>
        <P>The Cohesion Fund is a good example of the many areas in which Ireland has influenced the shape of Europe.  Most of the significant changes took place after Ireland&rsquo;s entry to the EEC.  The Single European Act, the first change, came about as a result of work carried out by Jim Dooge, a former Senator and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He was appointed to chair the Dooge Committee, which essentially laid the basis for the structure and wording of the Single European Act.  Having participated in this process for 35 years and played our part in shaping the nature of the Union to which we belong, it is surely not credible that we now question elements of the basic structure of the European Union which have been decided on and from which we have benefited.  That is what is happening, to some extent, in the debate which is taking place.</P>
        <P>With regard to many of the changes, we can recall the Crotty judgment of the Supreme Court in the early 1980s.  From that judgment resulted the decision to have a referendum in that period on the Single European Act.  What is forgotten, however, is that this judgment approved of many of the changes included in the Act &mdash; as being covered by Ireland&rsquo;s original decision to enter Europe, in the first referendum.  The Supreme Court stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">[T]he Community is a developing organism, with diverse and changing methods for making decisions, and an inbuilt and clearly expressed objective of expansion and progress, both in <Col N="49"/>terms of the number of its Member States and in terms of the mechanics to be used in the achievement of its agreed objectives.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is very important to bear this in mind.</P>
        <P>The need for a referendum was decided by the Supreme Court on one issue concerning the foreign policy element of that treaty.  In terms of moving from unanimity voting to qualified majority voting, QMV, the court ruled that this was something that could be anticipated by Ireland&rsquo;s decision, when it entered the European Economic Community, given that it was an evolving mechanism.  We hear the same argument in the current debate as regards the fact that we are losing our sovereignty as more decisions move from unanimity voting to QMV.</P>
        <P>My view is that this treaty does not raise any constitutional issues.  I have never heard a convincing argument as to why we actually need, on legal grounds, to have a referendum.  I agree with what Peter Sutherland said recently, that of all the treaties we have adopted as regards amendments to the original Treaty of Rome, this is, perhaps, the least significant.</P>
        <P>One feature of the Europe Union is very important when we examine the question of the adoption and ratification of this treaty.  Taking one simple example, we are concerned about Ireland&rsquo;s position within the Commission.  We have had excellent Commissioners who have managed while in office to keep an to keep an eye on Europe, and Irish interests therein.  When it was suggested that the number of Commissioners should be limited it was argued that the larger member states would never give up their two Commissioners, but they did.  It was then said they would never agree to rotation on a pure equality basis, and they did.  That is what is in this treaty, namely, that we are among equals when it comes to membership of the European Commission.  It will rotate and Ireland will have its turn, the same as the larger member states.  No objections, therefore, can be raised in that regard.</P>
        <P>As regards the move to QMV, one has to examine those areas where we are moving from unanimity voting.  When one examines the individual policy areas, there is no threat to Irish sovereignty.  It is a system from which we benefit.  As the Minister of State has said, we have never been overruled and outvoted on matters that are of vital national interest.  The key policy areas which the treaty introduces, and which require emphasis as being of particular importance to Ireland, are in the areas of organised and cross-Border crime, people trafficking, etc.  These matters involve policing and judicial co-operation.  As the President of the European Parliament, Herr P&ouml;ttering said this morning, with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Europe is a Union of values.  To consolidate the principles and values by which the Community operates is very important.  Also important is the increased role of national parliaments in ensuring that Europe does not overstep the mark in terms of legislation that can best be handled at national level.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This treaty is not about the creation of a European superstate.  It is not about interfering in any way with our decision as regards abortion in Ireland.  The protocol in the Maastricht treaty secured that and it is being carried forward.  It is not about the democratic deficit because, if anything, it is designed to enhance democracy and transparency in the Union.  It is not about interfering with our corporation or income tax rates.  It is not about Irish neutrality because the Nice treaty, ratified in our last constitutional referendum, prevents Ireland from joining an EU common defence alliance without a further referendum.  It is not about privatisation or an end to the principle of competition.  Contrary to the belief of different groups, including Sinn F&eacute;in and Libertas, the European Union does not decide on the privatisation of industry.  It recognises the principle, firmly established in this treaty, of providing services of general economic interest.  Interpretations in this regard favouring Ireland have been made by the European Court of Justice in recent cases, such as those concerning the ambulance service, An Post, and risk equalisation in respect of the VHI.  These <Col N="50"/>have all been approved on the basis of such principles.  The European Union has an increasing influence on our lives but it has, in general, been benign and beneficial.  If there is frustration with the Union in any area, it should be, and is, over the manner in which we implement EU law.</P>
        <P>There is no good reason for Ireland to vote against this treaty.  We would generate a lot of good-will by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  To jeopardise for no good reason the goodwill we have in Europe, which we have enjoyed for 35 years, would be very foolhardy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and his officials to the House.  I wish the Minister of State well in this campaign because he has enormous responsibility.  He is acquitting himself very well, as he did in respect of the second referendum on the Nice treaty.  He changed public opinion and had that treaty ratified.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan has vast knowledge of the European Union and the proposed treaty, but he should note that it is right and proper to have a referendum.  One could argue whether it is necessary legally &mdash; I know the Senator is a barrister &mdash; but different lawyers have different opinions on the matter.  The referendum is giving everyone a great opportunity to vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe we should have a referendum.  That is not the issue and therefore the Senator has missed the point.</P>

	<P>The Senator stated the referendum may not be legally necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but it is politically desirable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough.</P>
        <P>I will be voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on 12 June.  I do not need to emphasise how important Irish involvement in the European Union has become.  The reform treaty is crucial to continuing and developing that involvement and Ireland is in the unique position of holding a referendum on its ratification.  Consequently, 4 million people in Ireland will effectively decide the future of an institution with an overall population of nearly 500 million people.  All eyes in Europe will be on Ireland on the day of the referendum, most likely 12 June.</P>
        <P>Three of the main objections to the treaty have been dealt with comprehensively in many fora.  There is simply no way in which the Lisbon treaty will undermine our sovereignty in matters of military activity or taxation.  The Minister of State outlined this clearly today, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in light of the comments of the French finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  I compliment the Minister of State, Dick Roche, on his clear statement today.  It is very important that it be clear.  I wonder why the French are endeavouring to undermine our campaign on the reform treaty.  While the issue has been raised, it has been dealt with comprehensively by the Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The remaining members of the Government will do so in due course.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty will not affect domestic policy or matters such as abortion.  Nothing that happens at the meeting of the Council of Europe next week regarding Ms Gisela Wurm&rsquo;s proposal on abortion will have a bearing on Ireland or jurisdiction therein.  Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, President of the European Parliament, clearly stated this in the House this morning in his excellent, passionate and well-informed speech.  It was great to have him present.  He made a very clear statement on many issues has been a great help.  I hope his speech is published widely in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There are many campaigns currently under way to inform the public about the treaty.  In the coming weeks, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, will hold <Col N="51"/>open public meetings around the country at which experts will speak on the implications of the treaty.  When the Referendum Commission is established, it will undertake its own independent campaign to inform voters of the issues at stake.  Those who advocate a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on the grounds that there is insufficient information available should open their eyes to the vast amount of information available on-line, in the media and from public representatives.  The documentation of the Minister of State is very helpful in this regard.  All the arguments have been dealt with comprehensively and very useful speaking notes have been provided for anyone making a contribution on radio or television.</P>
        <P>Contrary to some assertions made by witnesses to the Joint Committee on European Affairs earlier today, hard copies of the text of the treaty are available free of charge to the public throughout the country in all public libraries and at other locations.  The document would be practically impossible to send to every household because it is so long, large and comprehensive.</P>
        <P>Those who advocate a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote simply on the grounds that the treaty is too complex and the text too long should realise that the treaty&rsquo;s purpose is to improve and develop the co-operation between 27 member states consisting of almost 500 million people in a very diverse range of areas.  If such a document were short and simple, then there would be something to worry about.</P>
        <P>There is no confusion over what the main implications of the treaty will be.  The main features are clear and generally unobjectionable.  They include a new voting system in the Council of Ministers to make decision-making more effective; a greater role for national parliaments in the Union&rsquo;s activities; a rotating system of membership of the European Commission, equal to all members.  Eighteen Commissioners will be chosen from the 27 member states but this will not come into force until 2014.  There will be equality in that each member state, for a period of five years out of 15, will not have a Commissioner, but there will be representation at the Council of Ministers.  There is no change in this regard.  This was decided ultimately by the Council of Ministers, as I know having represented the country in respect of the Single European Act.</P>
        <P>Other main features of the treaty include a full-time President of the European Council to co-ordinate and chair EU summit meetings, appointed on a 2.5-year basis.  I hope we will have a very suitable, qualified and idea candidate for this role when the treaty is approved.  We all wish our potential candidate well.  He is one of the most experienced politicians in Europe.  I refer to the outgoing and wonderful Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The treaty will also make provision for a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who will bring greater coherence to the Union&rsquo;s approach to foreign policy.  There is to be a Charter of Fundamental Rights which is to be given legally binding status.  These are all very positive features and can be adopted comprehensively and with great satisfaction.  In the negotiations, Ireland succeeded in achieving its key priorities, including maintaining unanimous decision-making on tax matters; ensuring balance in the Union&rsquo;s institutions and equality with regard to membership in the Commission; and protecting Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon reform treaty is not a self-amending treaty, as some claim.  The provisions for simplified amendment of EU treaties clearly state that every alteration must be ratified &ldquo;according to the constitutional requirements of each member state&rdquo;.  Out of the 27 member states, Ireland is unique in that its citizens will be asked to vote on ratification.  I hope the referendum will be on 12 June.  The treaty is our treaty and this is why it is so important that voters be well informed.  The campaign on the treaty is very exciting because ratification is now the most vital issue in Europe.  All eyes in Europe will be on Ireland on referendum day.  We must be at the <Col N="52"/>centre of decision-making in Europe.  By voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum, we will be maintaining our position.  Anything less than a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will be totally unacceptable, not to our 26 partners but for the future of this country, including the future of employment.  Our position and strength in Europe will be guaranteed by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum.  If we vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, it will be a slap in the face to the Union, which has given us so much since 1973.</P>
        <P>Membership has changed this country totally, as outlined by the Minister of State in great detail.  The changes to the structures of the European Union are necessary to update the workings of an institution which was designed for less than ten member states but now consists of 27 states and will expand further, to the benefit of all members.  For example, the creation of the position of President of the European Council will mean there will be greater continuity than there is currently with the six-month rotating Presidency system.  Giving national Parliaments a greater role will address any perceptions of a democratic deficit in the legislative process of the EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The role of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny will be expanded to ensure everyone has a say in that regard.  Today I attended a meeting of that committee where all the European legislation was brought forward and will be sent to different committees of these Houses for processing and consideration.</P>
        <P>It is wonderful that all legislation being published by the European Union will now come to each independent Parliament for consideration and we will have certain rights, yellow cards, etc.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on his negotiating skills in this regard.  He played a pivotal role in negotiating this treaty in Europe.  I am confident we will get it through but it will need our combined efforts.  I am delighted most of the parties in this House are in favour of the treaty and it shows the wisdom of the electoral process and the democratic system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the delegation from Algeria with whom I have had the opportunity to join today.  Je souhaite la bienvenue aux membres de la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation alg&eacute;rienne.  C&rsquo;est la premi&egrave;re fois qu&rsquo;ils nous rendent visite ici.  Je veux souhaiter la bienvenue &agrave; tout le monde. This is a useful debate and I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, is present.  I have found the debate of considerable interest to me.</P>
        <P>I have reserved my position.  Today groups arguing for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote came before the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I was disappointed to discover that at least one of them, Libertas, refused to come, and I do not know why.  They also refused to come to the Forum on Europe the other day as well.  I am just surprised at this from somebody who is voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I made it clear that I still have an open mind.  I want to hear the arguments for and against, and that is why it is so logical to have a good debate.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, state that we must avoid threats, abuse and language that has been used sometimes in the past few weeks.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <?oasys _cl13- ?><P Just="Left">Today&rsquo;s debate at the Joint Committee on European Affairs was useful.  Three different delegations came in and spoke.  One of them, Mr. Roger Cole from the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, spoke about the concern for neutrality.  I was reminded of my son in law.  I have five children &mdash; two girls and three boys.  We sent them all to France to school before they were 14 because somebody said that if one learns a language before one is 14, it is possible to speak it without accent.  The two girls promptly fell in love with Frenchmen at the age of 14 and are now both married to Frenchmen.  The family home of one of those Frenchmen, Nicolas de Schonen, where they now live, is in Soissons, about 80 km north-east of Paris.  It was damaged severely in 1870 when the Germans decided to visit Paris.  They stopped there, there was a battle there and the house was destroyed.  It was rebuilt a few years later.  In 1914, the Germans again decided to visit Paris and again the house was destroyed, and from the war reparations it was rebuilt.  In 1940, the Germans made it their headquarters and the Americans bombed the house.  This is to give the House some idea of what happened.  We in Ireland are inclined to forget that in those years three wars took place and since 1945 there has not been anything like such a European war. On that entire area of neutrality and of the belief that we can keep peace, we must give credit to the European movement.</P>
        <P>Mr. Roger Cole spoke of his concern about collective self-defence which is included in this reform treaty.   Collective self-defence is exactly what we need.  It seems so important.  If we in Ireland were ever attacked, I would like to think our colleagues in Europe would come to help us.</P>
        <P>Mr. Kieran Allen represented a different group and I was pleased to hear his view.  One of his concerns was the quotation in the debate that the treaty includes &ldquo;a system ensuring that competition is not distorted&rdquo;.  I queried this, asking that surely he did not want competition that is distorted and it turned out he did.  That opened my eyes.  I find being able to query and ask questions of those who are opposed and those who are in favour is useful.</P>
        <P>I was concerned about something reported today in the newspaper in connection with the French view on taxation.  It was a quote from later in that article or elsewhere.  It seems there was some sort of agreement in Europe not to bring up contentious issues until the Irish have had their referendum.  I would be glad to hear the Minister of State on this matter.  Is this possible?  Is there a behind-the-scene call asking those who want to make changes in Europe not to raise them because they will only concern the Irish and the treaty might be rejected?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>

	<P>Unfortunately not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe so.  The reason for this reform treaty &mdash; there is little doubt it came from the Laeken Declaration originally &mdash; and for the constitutional change is efficiency.  Therefore, I have examined it to see if there are efficiencies, and some of them make a great deal of sense.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State to respond to this later.  Ms Patricia McKenna made two points that I have not heard previously.  One of them was that the member states, in the previous document, proposed the Commissioner that they wished to appoint, and that word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; has been changed to &ldquo;make a suggestion&rdquo;.  There may be no change in the meaning of these wordings, but it would concern me if there are changes taking place and we do not understand the nuances behind them.</P>
        <P>The other point Ms McKenna raised related to taxation and to the amendment to Article 113.  The Minister of State made it clear that taxation is excluded from all of this.</P><Col N="54"/>
        <P>I quoted the Laeken Declaration earlier today when the President of the European Parliament was here.  The declaration also spelled out an exciting role for the EU in the new globalised world that was emerging in 2001.  It stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The role it has to play is that of a power resolutely doing battle against all violence, all terror and all fanaticism, but which also does not turn a blind eye to the world&rsquo;s heart-rending injustices.  In short, a power wanting to change the course of world affairs in such a way as to benefit not just the rich countries but also the poorest.  A power seeking to set globalisation within a moral framework, in other words to anchor it in solidarity and sustainable development.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is heady stuff.  Perhaps it is a little strange for us to look back today and recognise it as the start of a long and tortuous process that took place, but we owe the people of Ireland a duty to carry out diligently the necessary scrutiny on this treaty.  That is what we are doing here today and, I hope, in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Surely we have another responsibility as well.  It is a responsibility taken by us, not just as Irish men and women but as Europeans.  We are in the process of building a supranational structure under which our children and grandchildren must live.  In this reform treaty we are taking a decisive step to shape the Europe of the future and it is incumbent on us to ask ourselves carefully if this is really the way we want to go.  Does this treaty live up to the Laeken Declaration or does it undermine the fine principles and aspirations on which the reform project was launched?  If we have any doubts about that issue, now is the time to voice them, when we still have an opportunity to affect the course the future Europe will take.  If we stay silent now, we are agreeing to one particular way forward for Europe and turning our back on any other.  Therefore, the forthcoming referendum will pose the Irish people with some of the most important and fundamental questions they have ever had put to them.  In preparing for that referendum, we must treat this issue with all the seriousness it deserves.  The Irish people will not be bullied or blackmailed, as the Minister of State said, into giving one particular answer or the other.  They will demand a reasoned debate and my hope is that they will get it.</P>
        <P>At Mass on Sunday, I picked up a newspaper I had not seen before called <i>Alive!</i> and was surprised by what I read.  If this newspaper is in every church in the country and is, therefore, widely read, I am surprised by the amount of debate that needs to be addressed.  I should go through the matters debated in it because we must answer them.  One letter to the newspaper stated that:</P>
        <P LI="1">At present the EU sets the policy that its 27 member states are likely to follow at the UN.  However, countries can still take the above type of principled stand.  Under the Lisbon Treaty this will no longer be possible.  Under Article 24.3 of the treaty it will be illegal for any country to have its own foreign policy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I do not know if this is correct but I doubt if it is.  Another article stated that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The EU funded embryo research in 2006; (b) gave EU taxes to fund abortion in developing countries in 2002, and (c) in 2000 insisted that &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce apply to Irish citizens.</P>
        <P FLI="0">They are the sort of issues that have been raised.  I welcome the debate because if these issues are being raised and not answered, we must ensure we answer them, that the debate is rational and effective and that every side gets a chance to voice its opinion.  I believe that when I come to cast my vote, I will have done so in a rational way that listened to all sides and took them into account in making that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad and thank him for his very interesting presentation on the Lisbon treaty.  He came to the House on the same day <Col N="55"/>as the President of the European Parliament who addressed us here and touched on the Lisbon treaty in his presentation, which we were fortunate to hear.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the President of the European Parliament addressed the Upper House today.  This trend should be encouraged.  National parliaments and Ministers representing us should make the institutions of the European Union aware that it is very positive that we can put a human face on the institutions of the European Union and that national parliaments, particularly upper houses, can play an important role in terms of facilitating visits by the President of the European Parliament, other parliamentarians and commissioners when directives are being prepared so that there is an opportunity to counter the sense of disconnect between what is happening at national level and what is happening in Brussels or at European level.  It is to be hoped today&rsquo;s visit was a very welcome start to that process.</P>
        <P>I will touch on the European Parliament&rsquo;s role in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  Obviously, the treaty will greatly strengthen the powers of the European Parliament, which is a very welcome development.  By strengthening the powers of the European Parliament and significantly increasing its co-decision making powers it will reduce the influence of executive power within the European Union.  It seems that, to date, the power wielded by both the European Commission and the Council of Ministers could be described as executive power.  While the Council of Ministers is made up of representatives of governments, the power it uses is a form of executive power.  The strengthening of the European Parliament and its co-decision making powers strengthens the overall democratic legitimacy of the European Union and for that reason it is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The one concern that has been expressed to me as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs by groups that have come to the committee is whether the co-decision making process will slow down decision making in the European Union.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on that.</P>
        <P>It is a very positive development that under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, the European Parliament will have the power to elect the President of the Commission.  It will not just have the power of assent but will have the power to elect or refuse the nomination of the European Council in respect of the President of the Commission.  This will mean that the largest grouping in the European Parliament will have a very important say in future legislation because, as we know, the Commission has the powers of legislative initiative at a European level.  If the socialist group is the largest party in the European Parliament, we are likely to see a socialist-inclined President of the European Commission which could have a significant impact on the type of legislation we could expect to see proposed by the Commission.  It is an important new power for the European Parliament and should concentrate the minds of the European electorate on the fact that the people they elect to the European Parliament in June 2009 will have an important say in the composition of the Commission and, therefore, the overall legislative output of the European Union.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The one issue about the treaty that concerns me is the fact that in terms of improving and strengthening the powers of the European Parliament, it does not add significantly to its decision-making role in terms of trade policy.  The issue of trade policy has been an area of concern for many development organisations and others who see much secrecy and a lack of transparency surrounding the way in which trade policy is decided at a European level.  The US Houses of Congress have much greater powers than the European Parliament has had to date in respect of formulating and deciding trade policy.  Unfortunately, the Lisbon treaty only gives the European Parliament powers of assent rather than significant decision-making powers.  Could the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
        <P>In respect of the representation we will have on the European Commission, the equality of rotation seems to be the important principle.  The larger member states have accepted that.  What will be important in the future is that the cabinet of the various Commissioners will include a representative number of Irish officials along with officials from all the other member states.  If member states feel that they are represented at an official level within the Commission <Col N="56"/>that can adequately reflect the perspectives and interests of that particular member state, the fact that there might not be a Commissioner representing each member state will not be such a significant issue.</P>
        <P>Another feature of the Lisbon treaty worth highlighting is the fact that it strengthens and makes more meaningful the concept of European citizenship both through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which strengthens and gives a legal basis to citizens&rsquo; rights across the European Union, and the introduction of the citizens&rsquo; initiative which gives citizens a say in the kind of legislation they would like to see.  It is possibly not as strong as some citizens would like it to be but it gives them the power to petition the European Commission to introduce new legislation.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty also strengthens the EU&rsquo;s external coherence which, again, must be a good thing because it will strengthen the European Union&rsquo;s influence globally.  When we look at issues such as climate change, energy security and migration which are all underpinned by the values so clearly expressed in the Lisbon treaty, especially in its early stages, the strengthening of the EU&rsquo;s external coherence certainly is important.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the President of the European Parliament spoke today about the values of the European Union, the fact that we are a community of values and the importance of European values and promoting them at a global level.  It is important that as well as seeing the positive elements in terms of what the European Union represents, we are able to accept criticism.  There is a danger that if the European Union becomes unable to listen to the critical voices that perhaps are pointing to some aspects of its functioning that are less than perfect at the moment, we will just listen to the positive aspects of the functioning of the European Union and there will be more and more unwillingness to look at some aspects of its functioning that may not be to the satisfaction of its citizens or particular interest groups within the European Union.  It is important that in addition to being able to see and promote positive values, there is always the capacity to listen to critical voices, absorb and respond to that criticism and improve the areas of functioning of the European Union where necessary.</P>
        <P>The Green Party is delighted that the campaign on the Lisbon treaty has kicked off.  We would like to play our part in promoting the treaty to the people of Ireland and hopefully seeing a positive vote for it on 12 June 2008.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I accept the Government is committed to the development of appropriate mental health services and this is clearly seen in the allocation of money to those areas of the health service.  My question is about the allocation of &euro;25 million for the implementation of A Vision for Change in the 2007 budget.</P>
        <P>On 20 December last, I asked in an Adjournment debate where this money had been spent.  The reply I received indicated the laudable projects to which the money was allocated, but it did not indicate whether the money was actually spent on these projects.  My concern is that the evidence available does not appear to indicate that the &euro;25 million was spent on mental health services.  The purpose of this debate is to examine the concrete progress on those projects.  Just under &euro;8 million, for example, was allocated to services for children and adolescents.  That included provision for 22 inpatient beds for children and adolescents.  However, we do not have 22 such beds.  I have spoken to people in the Health Service Executive and have asked Professor Drumm whether any adolescent beds will be provided this year.  He indicated that it appears unlikely.  However, the reply I received in December stated that the money had been specifically allocated last year for the provision of those beds.</P>
        <P>The reply also stated that eight teams were being developed specifically for children and adolescents.  Has that happened?  I was also told that &euro;12.5 million was being allocated to improve specialist mental health services for older people, to improve specialist mental health services for people with intellectual disabilities and to increase the number of adult teams in the community.  Will the Minister indicate whether that money was spent in the areas for which <Col N="59"/>it was allocated?  Can he give a progress report on each of the projects identified to me in December as being in receipt of that funding?  There is no evidence they received the funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is obliged to operate within its overall Vote.  In this regard, it took steps to ensure it met this objective in 2007 by delaying some of its planned developments, including developments in mental health.</P>
        <P>I understand from the HSE that some mental health services funded in 2006 and 2007 will be put in place in 2008. These include the provision of eight additional consultant child psychiatry teams; the provision of 18 additional beds for children and adolescents at St. Anne&rsquo;s, Galway, St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Fairview and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork, to increase the bed complement from the current provision of 12 to 30 during 2008; and the construction of two 20-bed units for children and adolescents in Cork and Galway.  Construction on these units is expected to commence in 2008 and be completed in 2009.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, which was launched in January 2006, has been accepted by the Government as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  Implementation of the report is the responsibility of the HSE.  The estimated additional cost of the implementation of A Vision for Change is &euro;150 million over a seven to ten-year period.</P>
        <P>Substantial resources have been invested in mental health.  A total of &euro;51.2 million has been allocated since 2006, which represents more than a third of the overall requirement.  In addition to the extra funding required to finance A Vision for Change, existing resources need to be remodelled and reallocated.  Implementation of A Vision for Change is dependent to a much greater extent on the remodelling of existing resources than on new additional funding.  Additional investment must be phased in parallel with the reorganisation of mental health services and resources.  In view of the significant additional investment in 2006 and 2007, it is entirely appropriate to pause and review the situation to ensure consolidation of the investment to date.</P>
        <P>In the context of ever rising demands for health resources, mental health expenditure should be closely monitored to ensure services demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency.  Before any further additional funding is provided it is essential the HSE is in a position to demonstrate that money allocated for mental health services is used efficiently and that the substantial changes in the organisation and delivery of mental health services envisaged in A Vision for Change are progressed.</P>
        <P>An independent monitoring group was established to monitor and assess progress by the Health Service Executive, Departments and other agencies in implementing the recommendations set out in the report.  The monitoring group&rsquo;s first annual report was published in May 2007.  The report acknowledges the progress made but expressed concern about the lack of a systematic approach to implementation of the report and the lack of clarity in responsibility for implementation in the HSE.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health.  The office will support the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health in exercising his responsibilities in four Departments, namely, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues.  It has a remit to drive the implementation of A Vision for Change, working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  It aims to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues by working to develop person-<Col N="60"/>centred services, focusing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently approved an implementation plan which sets out six key priorities for 2008 and 2009.  Following concerns raised by the Office for Disability and Mental Health regarding the need for a longer-term focus, the HSE has indicated it will prepare a more comprehensive plan before the end of this year.  I assure the Senator of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of mental health services in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response, which is more realistic than the one I received in December.  I do not find it acceptable that the HSE can be allocated money specifically for projects for which there is a greater need and that it can indicate to the House that the money was spent when it was not.</P>

Ar&eacute;ir, bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; pac&aacute;ilte i mBaile Dh&uacute;n na nGall do dhaoine ar a bhfuil imn&iacute; mh&oacute;r faoi seo, nach bhfuil a leith&eacute;id seirbh&iacute;s radaiteiripe ar f&aacute;il, agus n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; sin, mar go bhfuil an Rialtas ag tarraingt siar ar an tseirbh&iacute;s at&aacute; san Ospid&eacute;al Ginear&aacute;lta Shligigh, a bh&iacute; ann &oacute; 2000 ar aghaidh, is &eacute; sin an tseirbh&iacute;s ailse.</P>
        <P>I am here to ask the Minister for Health and Children to retain cancer services at Sligo General Hospital and to further develop those services to include radiation oncology.  Last night I attended a packed meeting in Donegal town where we heard the concerns of patients and families of those who went through cancer treatment in the recent past or those who have been diagnosed with cancer and are going through treatment.  They are appalled at the decision by the HSE and this Government to remove the cancer services that have been in Sligo General Hospital since 2000 and to ask patients to travel to Galway for their cancer surgical and diagnostic services in the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a clear line drawn on the map of Ireland with all the eight centres of excellence below a line drawn between Galway and Dublin.  The concern I echo here today is that the people of the north west, too, are cancer sufferers, need the type of treatment available to other regions, are taxpayers in this country and have votes.  I was informed at last night&rsquo;s meeting that they will use their votes if they are not able to achieve their goals of retaining the services in Sligo General Hospital and developing them to include radiation oncology.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s heart is in the west and I appeal to him to bring the appeal I echo on behalf of the patients of the north west and their families and friends to the Minister for Health and Children and ask her to look sympathetically on it.  I very clearly told the Minister for Health and Children in this Chamber that she is guilty of negligence of the health concerns of the people of the north west.  I repeat that again tonight because she is stripping services from these hospitals.  The west and north west is one of the last regions to avail of BreastCheck and time and again we are ignored.</P>
        <P>Last night&rsquo;s calls were heartfelt and it was difficult to listen to them.  Some of the speakers had just come through cancer treatment in recent weeks and talked in glowing terms about the service in Sligo General Hospital and the consultants there.  Within a couple of days people can be seen, find out if they have cancer and be referred for the necessary treatment.  There is also concern about the fact that there is no radiation available in the north west.  People are <Col N="61"/>forced to travel long journeys, 400 mile round trips, leaving their families for seven or eight weeks at a time of serious difficulty for them when they need their families around them.  We also know of the incidents where, unfortunately, women choose to have mastectomies instead of availing of the treatment.  The demand from the north west, from Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and south Donegal, is that these services are maintained in Sligo General Hospital, that they are expanded to include radiation oncology and that the north west has another centre of excellence that will rebalance the map which shows the eight centres all based in the southern end of this island.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo ar son an Aire Sl&aacute;inte agus Leana&iacute;, an Teachta Mary Harney, agus t&aacute;im ag tabhairt an fhreagra ar a son.

        <P>As the House is aware, Professor Tom Keane has been appointed to lead and manage the establishment of the HSE national cancer control programme.  Professor Keane has ambitious plans and has already made significant progress in implementation of the programme.  The key objective of the national cancer control programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of outcome irrespective of geography.  This will involve significant re-alignment of cancer services to move from the present fragmented system of care to one which is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  The decisions of the HSE on four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2008 and 80% to 90% by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE western region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by<?oasys _jy ?>multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, much of the treatment, other than surgery, can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Sligo General Hospital has a dedicated in-patient oncology unit, comprising 15 beds, and a dedicated day services unit, comprising eight beds.  Cancer day care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children and the HSE have been working closely to expedite the delivery of the national plan for radiation oncology, which was approved by Government in July 2005.  The plan consists of four large centres in Dublin &mdash; at St. James&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals &mdash; Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Limerick and Waterford regional hospitals.  Patients from Sligo needing radiotherapy continue to be referred to the radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway for treatment.</P>
        <P>The HSE has confirmed it will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet the needs of the population by 2010.  After 2010 the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure these needs continue to be met.  The Minister for Health and Children is fully confident this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, PPP and, where appropriate, the use of the private sector.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international stan<Col N="62"/>dards.  The developments I outlined here will ensure a comprehensive service is available to all patients with cancer in the western region including in Sligo.</P>

	<P>I expected such an answer from the Minister and the Department and it is disappointing for me and, more importantly, for those who have to avail of the services now and in the future.  I note Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s comments at the beginning of his response, which were not scripted by the Department, saying patients are willing to travel for the best care, and I concur with that.  People will travel to the end of the earth to save their loved ones if that is where services are.  According to the Government&rsquo;s figures and the O&rsquo;Higgins report the numbers are there in the north west to provide radiotherapy centres safely.  Later this month the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children will turn the sod for a private hospital that will provide radiation services in Donegal.  How can the Government say that in the public sector it would be unsafe to have such a service in the north west but in the private sector it will be safe?  I appreciate that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is not in the Department but I ask him to take those concerns back to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
