	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Limerick City Boundary Alteration Order 2008, which is back from committee and will be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements on the national waste strategy (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude not later than 1 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes, all other Senators having eight minutes, on which Senators may share time with agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for concluding comments and questions from spokespersons; No. 3, statements on Malin Head and Valentia Island coast guard stations, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2 and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes, all other Senators having eight minutes, on which Senators may share time with the agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments; and No. 16, motion 34 re civil marriages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3.

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to comments made yesterday in the House by a number of Senators on the Government side, which were reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, regarding the tribunal lacking due process.  The Leader implicitly supported these comments when he said other Senators would do well to take on board Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s views about what had happened in the tribunal to date.  The D&aacute;il voted confidence in the tribunal and, as recently as last week, Mr. Justice Mahon said to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s counsel that if they were concerned about due process, they could go to the courts and take a case.  It is a serious matter for Senators on the Government side to take pot shots like this in the House at the tribunal, especially when they make a most serious charge about a lack of due process.  I would like the Leader clarify his views on the matter.</P>
        <P>The Government has set up a range of inquiries over recent years and I am very concerned that individual citizens feel they are not obtaining the response they would wish for from Government regarding these inquiries.  The timeframe for them is also very delayed.  For example, the family in the Rossiter case has waited five years for justice and yesterday it emerged that families <Col N="1247"/>involved in the Dunne inquiry used a freedom of information application to obtain information they believed was required.  Why could they not be given the full report instead of having to obtain additional information in the most distressing way, as they did this week?  In addition, the inquiry into breast cancer misdiagnosis, especially in the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case, has been going on for more than a year while the Portlaoise hospital inquiry is also ongoing.</P>
        <P>A series of crises occurred and the immediate response was to set up an inquiry and report back, yet several years later no decent mechanism is in place for the families to get hold of the outcome.  Will the Leader and the Deputy Leader examine the mechanisms offered by the State to individuals where inquires are carried out to establish whether it can do better than it has to date?  Perhaps the Leader will come back to the House with definitive information on the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case, for example.  When will that report be made available so that we can learn from it to ensure no other woman will be given a misdiagnosis and then have to wait to find out what happened?  It is a serious issue.  The State has a problem producing reports and providing answers to citizens.  The Westminster Parliament produces such reports quickly all the time.  We need to examine the mechanisms we use to try to do better by citizens who experience trauma in their lives and want to know how public policy can change in order that other people do not go through what they have experienced.  Will the Leader come back to the House on this as soon as possible on that matter?</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Callely on last night&rsquo;s autism partnership meeting which was attended by people from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Despite the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s intransigence and lingering animosity, as Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke remarked, there is clearly scope for cross-party work on putting in place the proper policies and reaching out to the increasing numbers of families who have to cope with autism.  An interesting initiative was mentioned last night which involves making space for policy makers, politicians and families to come together and discuss what is needed.  This initiative is particularly popular in America but we take a similar approach to other issues.  We need to bring these parties together if we are to get the services we need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the first matter on the Order of Business, a motion on the alteration of Limerick city&rsquo;s boundary, is to be taken without debate.  Although I do not have a difficulty with that, I have not had an opportunity to read or discuss the motion.  We never have difficulties taking referral to committee motions without debate because that is the appropriate way to deal with such motions and we always leave open the option of debating them on their <Col N="1248"/>return from committee.  However, this motion pertains to a ministerial order laid before the Houses and could be subjected to debate if Limerick city is grabbing a portion of County Clare, north Tipperary or even a bit of County Limerick.  The name of the town from which I come was grabbed by one of these orders.  In that respect, it would be helpful for the people of Dingle to know when the Government&rsquo;s commitment to give Dingle back na tr&iacute; ainmeacha at&aacute; aici, An Daingean, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is and Dingle.  When does the Leader expect that matter to be brought to a conclusion?  I have no pressing need to discuss the Limerick city boundary but we might in future get a brief memorandum on such motions.</P>
        <P>In the past 24 hours, there has been a certain amount of debate on the question of access to emergency contraception, also known as the morning after pill.  We need to have a proper discussion on that issue to develop a clear understanding of what is available.  As far back as 2001, the British Medical Association recommended that the morning after pill be made freely available in pharmacies.  That is not the case in Ireland, where people have to get a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.  That requirement appears to be unnecessary and the only reason for it is to avoid encouraging too much sexual activity.  Other jurisdictions have addressed the issue by requiring that people of a certain age have to go through, for example, a school nurse to access the pill.  Research on the issue by Imperial College London concludes that access to the morning after pill does not impact in any way on sexual activity.  It is progressive and safe to allow access and I would like an open debate on the issue with either the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Health and Children in the interest of making the pill available to people who need it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call made by Senator Fitzgerald for clarification, perhaps by the Leader, on the remarks made yesterday regarding whether fair procedures exist in the tribunal.  I have no intention of trespassing into areas which are the province of the courts but for this House to give the impression that it believes the tribunal does not exercise fair procedures is a very serious matter.  The tribunal was set up by order of this House and, therefore, we are bound to avoid giving the impression that we now believe it does not exercise fair procedures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ruled on that matter yesterday.  The Chair always endeavours to ensure the House respects the independence of the tribunals in the exercise of their functions.  Members have on occasion made certain comments when I was unable to stop them.  I said that on several occasions and all Members are intelligent enough not to get involved in any matter that is <i>sub judice</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears not all are intelligent enough to avoid creating the impression that the problem in this country is the tribunals rather than the people whose actions led to their establishment in the first place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The normally mild mannered Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has given the impression that he believes the tribunals are the problem rather than the people who caused their establishment.</P>
        <P>I have just come from an excellent conference organised by Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society, MEAS.  Yesterday colleagues asked the Leader to facilitate a debate on alcohol and alcohol abuse, and I repeat that request today.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, presented some alarming figures on the increase in alcohol consumption in the past ten years.  A number of calls have been made for consultation and partnership approaches, with which I agree, but real action is needed on some of these issues.</P>
        <P>In terms of the easy availability of alcohol, one cannot enter a garage or shop to purchase a newspaper at 7.30 a.m. without tripping over crates of wine and cans of beer.  It was a serious mistake to allow such wide availability of alcohol in so many different outlets and it is manifestly creating real issues in terms of easy availability of alcohol in relatively uncontrolled environments.  I commend the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland, which of course has a vested interest, on a measured article it published in this morning&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> which laments the problems it faces from the demise of the rural, and sometimes suburban, pub.  The pub&rsquo;s place as a centre of social activity in rural Ireland has been greatly undermined by recent changes.  Nobody wants to close pubs but we need to restrict in some intelligent way the availability of alcohol.  The issue has gotten out of hand in that regard and this House should return to it.</P>
        <P>Some Senators disagree but we have to address the issue of commercial sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The association of alcohol with sporting prowess through the GAA, rugby organisations and elsewhere is wrong and ought to be addressed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I asked the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to discuss with the House the new nursing home regulations.  I would also like her to address the future role of pharmacies in the delivery of health care services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I see in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that the regulator for the pharmacy sector is considering ways of expanding the services provided by the pharmacy sector to include important primary care services such as screening for diabetes and other common disorders, managing long-term stable conditions and dealing with minor ailments in order that people do not have to attend their GPs.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>The pharmacy sector has an important role to play in health promotion and prevention.  The current stand-off between the pharmacy sector and the HSE is unfortunate because it is in all our interests that the sector takes on a new and expanded role in terms of providing various health services.  When the Minister comes to the House, I will ask her to address this issue and her vision of the future of the pharmacy sector and the expanded role it can play in the delivery of primary health care services.</P>
        <P>I refer to worrying research findings in regard to the use of anti-depressants.  An article which contained a review of clinic trials obtained under freedom of information from the US federal drugs agency and which was published in the Public Library of Science indicated that the use of very common anti-depressants, such as Prozac, Seroxat and Effexor, are very ineffective in terms of their effect on the people taking them who suffer from depression.  The HSE spent &euro;5 million on Prozac and &euro;5 million on Seroxat in 2006 and yet the efficacy of these drugs is very much being questioned by the information being released by the US federal drugs agency.  It is important we look at this issue as part of our examination of mental health.  Perhaps the Minister will address this issue when she comes to the House.</P><Col N="1251"/>
        <P>The policy A Vision for Change does not seem to be resourced as originally intended.  It is important in terms of the delivery of our mental health services that we move away from an over-reliance on pharmaceutical approaches to dealing with common mental health problems, such as depression, and that we look at alternatives.  People who have commented on this research have stated that there is a shortage of alternatives available, including counselling and psychotherapy services, for people who suffer from depression.  It is in all our interests to ensure the mental health services expand so that these alternatives become much more readily available and we reduce our reliance on pharmaceutical interventions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the sad story in the newspapers this morning about the Navan bus crash and the fact the trial has been postponed because of a lack of space in the court.  We should speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Reform to ensure that is not a reason a case cannot be heard.  My heart goes out to the families of the five girls who lost their lives which must wait a whole year for the case to be heard because of lack of funding by this Government.  It makes a sham of the service.  The Courts Service has apologised but its hands are tied.</P>
        <P>Some 300,000 telephone calls were answered by Childline last year while 300,000 were not answered because of a lack funding.  Will the Leader find out why 300,000 telephone calls were not answered?  Childline has said it was because of a lack of funding.  Were the telephone calls of 300,000 children, who were in a desperate state, not answered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a discussion on Fairtrade.  As we are in the middle of Fairtrade fortnight, it is important we discuss the part trade can play in the developing world.  We, in the developed world, give over &euro;100 billion each year to the Third World but it is estimated that we cost it three times that in our trade policies.  The programme for Government seeks that all Departments secure and procure Fairtrade products where possible.  This week we hope to become one of the first Fairtrade Parliaments in the world.  If the Leader could find time during Fairtrade fortnight to discuss Fairtrade, I would be grateful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the important issue of the protection of our environment?  There are many problems in the areas of regulation and licensing and in respect of discharges and emissions from industry and public and private waste facilities.  I will be interested to hear what the Green Party, which claims to be the guardians of our environment, has to say <Col N="1252"/>about the many licensing breaches by waste facilities and industry.  Licensing and the way the law is flouted needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>There are also issues in terms of the role and responsibilities of the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authority environment departments.  There seems to be much passing the buck and turning a blind eye.  I will be interested to hear what resources the Minister proposes to put into these important areas because the protection of our environment should be a high priority for us all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide time as soon as possible to discuss the Lisbon treaty?  At 12 p.m. today, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs will launch an interim report on the treaty.  I am very concerned about yesterday&rsquo;s protest by the IFA at the European Commission offices in regard to the negotiations at the world trade talks in Geneva and the fact Peter Mandelson seems to be a runaway train as far as they are concerned.  He has given concessions which will affect farming in the future.  If we lose the farming vote for the Lisbon treaty, it will be defeated.</P>
        <P>Farmers are very concerned about this issue.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House to discuss her views on the concessions proposed by Peter Mandelson which will see a 70% cut in the tariffs on beef, zero tariffs on lamb and which will result in halving the cost of the production of beef?  The Cathaoirleach will appreciate that if that happens, farming in this country will be finished.</P>
        <P>It is a serious issue and it is now being linked to the Lisbon treaty referendum.  The IFA is very concerned about it, as are those involved in rural Ireland.  Peter Mandelson is misleading the views of the European Commission in this regard and he should be reigned in.  It is so serious that the Taoiseach should become involved and call for a discussion at European Commission level about the concessions proposed.  If those concessions are given and approved by the majority of the European Commission, it will be the death knell for farmers in this country and for the Lisbon treaty.  If that is what the European Commission wants, that is what it will get at the referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House to discuss the important issue of technology investment?  In the past couple of days, a number of firms have stated that growth rates will be below what the Government expects, although they are hopeful they will grow as we reach 2010-11.  I am, however, concerned that support mechanisms for certain sectors of the economy may not be in place by then.</P>
        <P>I refer, in particular, to the technology sector which is growing and needs support given the change in the economy.  Three supports are <Col N="1253"/>required in this area.  The first is education, in which there has been investment across the broad over a number of years.  The second is communications infrastructure.  I will not raise the issue now but we know that for the past ten years, broadband penetration and our policies in this area have been a disgrace and that we need to do something about that.  We will support Senator Ross&rsquo;s Bill in this regard.</P>
        <P>The third support is technology investment techniques.  I was disappointed the Minister for Finance did not do something in this area in the last budget.  I know there are various techniques for supporting businesses, such as the BES, but the time has come for significant technology investment techniques, through whatever tax concessions or means possible, to support small indigenous SME-type technology companies.  We have heard too many stories about companies moving to Silicon Valley and elsewhere because they did not get supports in this country.  It is time we woke up and supported these companies because otherwise the intellectual drain out of this country will continue.  I do not want that to happen because we need these people.  They are the entrepreneurs of the future.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald regarding the length of time it takes to complete independent inquiries.  On previous occasions I have referred to the report into the case of my near neighbour, Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley.  Every day this report remains unpublished is one day too many.  There is potential for other women to suffer because the recommendations of the report have not been put in place.  That is not good enough.  The report must be published as soon as possible because Ms O&rsquo;Malley is fed up and wants the matter to be dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald.  We must express confidence in the tribunal, which was established by the Oireachtas and which is presided over by three eminent judges.  However, we cannot demonstrate confidence in the tribunal if we do not allow it to do its work.  We should await its findings before rushing to judgment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments in respect of the morning-after pill.  I was astonished to discover that a majority of young women who approach the medical authorities do not, because they were so drunk, know with whom they had sex or if they had sex.  This behaviour places in context the Private Members&rsquo; debate to take place later. <Col N="1254"/> There are people who do not want to allow respectable gay couples to marry and this is despite the fact that certain individuals from the group of which they are members engage in such questionable behaviour.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator McFadden on the Navan school bus tragedy.  It would be extraordinary if this case were to be postponed for a year simply because a courthouse is not available.  Surely some facility could be rented to allow the case to proceed.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader make time available for a debate on homelessness?  I am sure Members on all sides will agree with my request in this regard.  I do not like to appear to be continually attacking or undermining the HSE.  The executive is extremely large, is obliged to make difficult decisions and has limited resources.  It was disturbing to hear Dr. Austin O&rsquo;Carroll state on radio this morning that everything has been put on hold, that there will be no new investment and that the provision of a 32-bed transition facility for homeless people being discharged from hospital will not now proceed.  It is incredible that, in the 21st century, citizens of our wealthy country continue to be discharged straight from hospital back onto the streets, where they may well die.  This is despite the wonderful work done by people such as Alice Leahy.</P>
        <P>I am seeking information regarding the ultimate destination of this noble House.  It is obvious that we cannot transfer operations to the Natural History Museum because it would not be appropriate to do so.  There are some extremely valuable exhibits in the museum that would have to be dismantled if the Seanad were to move there.  It is extraordinary that we should be moved from a building that may be dangerous into one which is obviously dangerous.</P>
        <P>I previously raised the notion, not in a completely jocular way, of the Seanad transferring its operations to the former Houses of Parliament building on College Green which is currently owned and occupied by the Bank of Ireland.  If this option is being considered, one of my neighbours informed me this morning that when the building was sold to the bank, the Government of the day meanly included a proviso that it must never again be used for parliamentary purposes.  The idea behind this was to neuter the Irish Parliament.  Would it not be a fine gesture of republican defiance in respect of the Act of Union 1800 to introduce in Seanad &Eacute;ireann legislation to reverse the proviso to which I refer?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Coffey&rsquo;s proposal for a debate on environmental protection.  Concerns should be expressed regarding Ireland&rsquo;s slide from tenth to 34th position in the world in respect of environmental protection.  This slide occurred because in the past policies were discussed rather than implemented.  The agencies to which Senator Coffey referred should be the focus of such a debate.  The programme for Government refers to the need to review and reform the Environmental Protection Agency.  The role of local authorities and their willingness and capacity to deal with many environmental problems would be also worthy of a debate.</P>
        <P>Members of Opposition parties should be cognisant of the regulatory role their representatives have to play within local authorities.  Most local authorities have a large number of members from Fine Gael and Labour.  Why is more pressure not being exerted at local authority level in respect of the environmental regulation role?  Problems relating to emissions and discharges are meant to be dealt with by local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is disgraceful that the Minister for Health and Children has sanctioned the behaviour of the HSE in its dealings with pharmacists.  As democrats, all Members believe in dispute resolution procedures.  Equally, we all subscribe to the view that it is not possible to do business in the absence of dialogue.  At present, dialogue is not taking place and there has been a complete breakdown in negotiations.  The situation is disgraceful.  I call on the Leader &mdash; with the goodwill of the House on his side &mdash; to address this matter immediately.  In my opinion, there is unanimity among Members in respect of this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the issue of Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is.  The situation in this regard is also disgraceful.  A commitment was given to the people of the area, who held a plebiscite almost two years ago and made a democratic decision in respect of this matter.  We were led to believe the Government had accepted their decision.  The Minister met a deputation &mdash; <Col N="1256"/>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is more familiar than I with the outcome of that meeting &mdash; and added to the commitment that has been reneged upon.</P>

I will raise this matter on the Adjournment later today and I look forward to the Minister coming before the House to comment on it.  I hope there will be no disruption of pharmaceutical supplies in the interim.  There are many outstanding issues in respect of which answers have not been forthcoming.

	<P>When elections are held in other jurisdictions, international independent observers are tasked with monitoring the processes involved.  Will the Leader indicate the independent monitoring mechanisms that will be put in place for the Russian presidential election, which is due to be held early in March?</P>
        <P>I welcome the contributions of Senator David Norris and others on homelessness and its difficulties.  The Leader responded to me on this issue recently and indicated we might have the Minister attend the House to debate the issue.  Prior to a debate, could the Leader arrange a briefing document for Members on housing and related issues?  Such a document would give a breakdown of people on local authority housing lists, indicating those housing applicants with special needs such as treatment for addiction and mental health issues, as well as vulnerable people and those requiring transitional housing, etc.  I understand we are failing in our duties to meet the varied needs of these people.</P>
        <P>Equally I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s remarks on Trust Ireland and the good work of Alice Leahy in that organisation.  There are also many other agencies doing tremendous work with people in homeless and vulnerable positions.  I mentioned last week the outreach workers who deal with people with addiction.  It is a very serious issue which this House should prioritise.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss home birth.  Many people in this country are denied the right to a home birth.  I also seek a discussion on indemnity insurance for independent midwives and the service they give.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Frances Fitzgerald in her comments on the O&rsquo;Malley and Rossiter cases and their supports.  I congratulate Senator Ivor Callely on his organisation of the autism debate last night.</P>

	<P>Last week I asked the Leader if the Minister for Health and Children would come into the House to debate child psychiatry.  I raise the matter again as a matter of urgency and ask that we would have a debate on this important issue.  We should particularly speak about the ring-fencing of beds and the creation of dedicated units for young adolescents suffering with eating disorders.  It has come to my notice over the weekend that boys as young as eight or nine are now presenting to their GPs with nowhere else to go.  One of them had to resort to Great Ormonde Street Hospital in London for treatment in the last couple of months.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this.</P>
        <P>I add my voice to that of Senator de B&uacute;rca in her commending the research published yesterday with regard to the effectiveness of the drug Prozac.  I commend the knowledgeable professor <Col N="1258"/>from Hull, whom I listened to last night.  I am always a supporter of research as the more money we can put into it, the better it will be for us and the generations coming after us.  In this country alone there are hundreds of thousands of people on Prozac.  They should not be frightened.  It would be very damaging for their health if they became aware of this debate, not fully understand it and go off their medication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Feeney mentioned an issue I wished to raise, given we are in Eating Disorder Week.  It is an important matter that affects 7,000 people directly and has signifi<Col N="1259"/>cant consequent problems for families and society.  This Government published A Vision for Change in 2006 and it has not delivered in its commitment.  I agree with Senator Feeney&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>A friend of mine has a daughter using services abroad because she cannot get access to services here.  That is a terrible indictment of modern Ireland in its treatment of a young girl struggling to cope with life.  This is not a political issue.  The report published by Bodywise last week indicated resources were inadequate and the commitment in A Vision for Change has not been implemented.  It is about time we had a debate on the whole aspect of services relating to eating disorders.  We are not addressing the matter.  I ask the Leader to organise the debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Alex White, who spoke about the increased consumption of alcohol and what action we can take to address the issue.  I have done much thinking on this but I do not know the answer.  I do not believe any of us in the House know what action we should take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We could implement the task force report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am blue in the face from talking about the increase in alcohol consumption, what we should do, what parents and the community should do and what responsibility those outside this Chamber have.  We can introduce all the legislation and do all the monitoring in the world.  I regularly address 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds in schools on this serious problem.  I welcome the debate but I fear for the future unless something can be decided on what action we can take.  It is beyond us as it is a global issue.  We should consider the matter in that context.</P>
        <P>I compliment garda&iacute; because they are out on the beat on Fridays and Saturdays at all hours of the night.  We wake up on Sunday morning and see the place ruined with bottles, cans and various forms of drink.  The retail outlets, such as garages, have a significant role to play in this.  Society also has a role to play.</P>
        <P>We need a bigger, societal, debate on this issue.  The Celtic tiger has been very good for us economically but socially I worry about the future.  I welcome the debate and I would like to hear all the views that would emerge as to how best we, as legislators, can work to improve the quality of life for the people in future.  I worry about young people and the way they behave.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey referred to the environment and asked that the Minister be invited to discuss how the law is abused.  He mentioned the EPA and the role of authorities where licensing is concerned, and how this is being breached regularly, especially in rural areas.  I would welcome the <Col N="1260"/>Minister here for a full debate on the role of local authorities in administering their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators still wish to speak and time is moving on.  I ask remaining Senators to be brief, although some I will call are always brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was interesting that Senator Daly brought up the question of Fairtrade policy.  Senator Norris said to me it must have been an association of ideas because the Cathaoirleach immediately called on Senator Coffey to speak after introducing the topic of Fairtrade.  Coffee and Fairtrade naturally go together.  We are having free Fairtrade coffee in both of the restaurants this morning.</P>
        <P>I mention this because of something brought up by Senator Terry Leyden, namely, the protectionist policy pursued by Peter Mandelson.  Mr. Mandelson identified the &euro;100 billion protectionist policy operating in Europe that Senator Daly mentioned.  He is working hard to reduce it to ensure a livelihood for those who live in the fair trade areas.  Senator Leyden and the Irish Farmers Association may criticise everything he does but he is acting in Europe&rsquo;s best interests by making sure that we are not protecting ourselves against those in the developing world who have difficulty succeeding.</P>
        <P>We have an extra day this year, on Friday.  I was impressed to see that the Northern Ireland National Trust has given all its staff a day off and asked them to do something for the environment on that day rather than work as normal.  We could perhaps do something for our environment by unplugging our different pieces of equipment that night and get into the habit of watching our electricity use.  We waste billions of hours of energy by leaving equipment plugged in or on stand-by overnight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to the matter that Senator McFadden raised.  According to today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent , </i>&ldquo;Childline dealt with almost 300,000 calls from children last year &mdash; but another 300,000 went unanswered due to lack of funding ... more than 25,000 of the calls were from children looking for help on issues relating to abuse, violence and mental health&rdquo;.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said yesterday that an out-of-hours service is vital.</P>
        <P>In my newsletter to county councillors of January 2008, I called for the urgent implementation of the proposals by the Health Service Executive for a 24 hour a day, seven day a week call service with nurses and psychiatrists available.  Every county in Ireland should be linked to this centralised service.  The Minister for Health and Children should provide funding for the HSE proposals that are on the table.  Every child in Ireland should have access to help from nurses <Col N="1261"/>and psychiatrists around the clock, and on Saturdays and Sundays.  It is a matter of urgency that we look after our children and that funding to do that is put on the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have repeatedly asked the Leader to intervene in the community pharmacy issue.  The deadline is Saturday, 1 March.  I can confirm that pharmacists around the country have begun between 500 and 600 legal cases against the unilateral breach of their contract by the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  A significant amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be wasted on litigation when those pharmacists are willing to engage with the Minister to save &euro;100 million in drug costs.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca is in denial when she talks about the new and expanded role of pharmacists.  Many pharmacists already engage in the health promotion about which she spoke.  Other rural and new pharmacists who would like to do so will go out of business.  It is not fair to put people out of business.  I do not want to see taxpayers&rsquo; money wasted on litigation, as has happened in the Department of Education and Science which has spent &euro;11.5 million fighting parents of children with special needs.</P>
        <P>I was out of the House last week when the Leader replied to my request for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the serious water and sewerage crisis in Galway, particularly in Clifden.  The Leader said that there had been a previous cock-up between Galway city and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It was never involved in that problem.  The bay there is contaminated and an accident would be fatal.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with those Senators who have raised the dispute between the pharmacies and the HSE.  Boxes of letters are being distributed to Deputies and Senators outside the gates of Leinster House.  They contain 475,000 signatures from people throughout the 26 counties calling for intervention in this dispute.  It is amazing and crazy that almost half a million people are demanding action yet we cannot even <Col N="1262"/>have a debate on the issue in the Upper House of the Parliament.  Will the Leader sort out that issue immediately and facilitate a debate today or tomorrow on the pharmacies and ask the Minister for Health and Children to come in to discuss it?</P>
        <P>The Leader may be aware of a study on the use of the Irish language within the Gaeltacht which contains many recommendations.  One alarming finding is that unless we change Government policy the truest Gaeltacht areas will disappear within 15 to 20 years.  Will the Leader in the lead-up to Seachtain na Gaeilge have a debate on Staid&eacute;ar Cuimsitheach Teangeola&iacute;ochta ar &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White, Kelly, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Boyle and Prendergast called for various matters which Senator Fitzgerald requested.</P>
        <P>I have said very little on the tribunals as Leader because there is no point in our interfering in a job allocated to professionals.  I will say no more, but that I fully respect the position of the tribunals and the professionals appointed.  The Taoiseach led the setting up of these tribunals to put in place all the corrective measures regarded as necessary by  politicians of all or most political parties.  I am not getting involved but the independence of the tribunals should be sacrosanct as far as we are concerned.</P>
        <P>We should all get back to the issues that many Senators bring to light here every day on the Order of Business.  It is a pleasure to be able to assist, to have Ministers come to the House to see what can be done, to listen to the views of the experienced Senators here, and those who have experience in other walks of life, to assist the Department, the Government and the Minister in a given portfolio.</P>
        <P>I agree with the wishes expressed by Senators about the delays in the unfortunate inquiries to eliminate the suffering of families concerned.  We will contact the various Departments after the Order of Business, especially in the case of Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley.  I fully agree with the sentiments that have been expressed and will do all I can to see if we can bring the concerns of Senators to the Minister&rsquo;s attention, and examine how I can progress any of the suggestions made in this area.</P>
        <P>I join with Senators in congratulating Senator Callely in bringing together last night the splendid groups who participated in the autism debate.  It is a great idea and a wonderful suggestion to bring together the families and policymakers in <?oasys _dc28- ?>any way to assist in any challenge facing any group.  I again congratulate the Senator on his great work in bringing everyone together last night.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?><P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and Norris expressed concerns in respect of motions that come back from committee without having been debated in the House and I will endeavour to have available an up-to-date memorandum on such motions.  This is a worthwhile suggestion and <Col N="1263"/>I will do everything I can to make it happen.  Senator Coghlan again offered his congratulations to the hard-working Deputy from Kerry South, Jackie Healy-Rae.  While this was never in doubt, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue and other colleagues, who have been carrying the flag down there and doing their best for the people of south Kerry, all work just as hard and I wish them all well.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other Senators called for a debate on the morning-after pill and to make it more freely accessible and available.  Senator Mary White has been a champion of matters pertaining to children and I can facilitate a debate on this issue in the House.  I heard an interview on radio this morning in respect of changing society and all the areas in which the present position must be reviewed.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time for such a topic.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White and Ormonde called for an urgent debate on alcohol abuse and referred to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher.  I note there are now 4,000 off-licences in Ireland.  This is because public houses are closing down and their licences are being put up for sale.  Naturally, the unfortunate people who are obliged to close down their establishments, which had been kept going for generations, are selling them on to the off-licences.</P>
        <P>First, if anyone is serious about alcohol, the Cathaoirleach and I, as well as Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Callanan, have been pioneers for life and have never participated in the pleasure of the alcohol dream.  The second point of advice to young people is that the gift of sport as fitness is the greatest gift that one can give one&rsquo;s body.  I look around and see many colleagues who could take up the proposal on walking  made yesterday by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and stay out of such establishments as an alternative.  A clear head in the morning is a huge asset to all professions.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash; at the earliest possible time and will endeavour to secure all-party agreement on the motion in respect of statements in the House on alcohol abuse.  I call on the leaders of all political parties in the House to join with me in holding an all-party debate and statements on how Members can help the Minister and the Department in this respect.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca, Coghlan, Callely, Prendergast, Feeney, Buttimer, Healy Eames and others expressed serious concerns in respect of the pharmacy issue.  Members are aware that my intention was that the Minister would appear before the House tomorrow.  However, she will be in the D&aacute;il tomorrow at the time I had hoped she would come before the Seanad.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister will be in the Seanad next Tuesday from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., for statements on the pharmacy issue and the up-to-date position in this regard.  The D&aacute;il will receive an update on this matter tomorrow.  As Members are aware, 1 March is the crucial date.  I urge all Members who wish to contribute to speak to their Whips and to get their rota in order for the Cathaoirleach because nearly all Members will wish to speak on this issue.</P>
        <P>In respect of the proposal for clinical trials, the &euro;10 million the HSE has spent up to now on various trials, as well as those who are taking the Prozac medication, I have no difficulty in passing on these views to the Minister after the conclusion of the Order of Business or in inviting her to attend the House at another time to discuss the entire portfolio of health in respect of this matter, which probably will require an all-day debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators McFadden and Mary White raised the issue of the delayed trial in respect of the terrible school bus tragedy.  I concur with their sentiments and will pass on their views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The national Road Safety Authority has a duty to introduce the fitting of black box technology on all registered public transport.  I have called on it to so do on two or three previous occasions as 53,000 public transport licences have been granted in Ireland for school buses, ambulances, taxis or <Col N="1266"/>whatever.  It is the duty of the Government to have in place such black box technology because the cause of such an accident would be known definitively within 20 minutes of it taking place.  Members fully support the sentiments expressed this morning by Senators McFadden and Mary White and I will do everything I can to ascertain whether anything can be done through the Minister regarding the request made in the House this morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Daly and Quinn mentioned this is Fair Trade fortnight and Fairtrade products are being sold in Leinster House today.  I intend to place statements on fair trade on the Order of Business one day next week to measure progress and to discuss how to assist the Fairtrade organisations, which are doing such a wonderful job in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Coffey and Ormonde called for a debate on waste related matters.  Statements on waste management will follow the Order of Business today and I understand the Minister is waiting in the ante-room outside for this debate to take place.  Perhaps the particular points raised by the Senators can be addressed in the House this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden, who is the Government&rsquo;s spokesman on European affairs, referred to the Lisbon reform treaty.  I concur with the Senator&rsquo;s views on Commissioner Mandelson and the serious concerns about which our farmers must be very vigilant.  I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, for her steadfast opposition to his proposals on protecting Irish farmers and the farming community at present.  I will endeavour to have the requested debate take place at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly called for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come before the House to discuss small to medium sized businesses, which employ more that 800,000 people in Ireland at present, with particular reference to the technology sector.  I can facilitate such a debate and have already made a request to the Minister to have a debate on that worthwhile subject.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Callely called for an urgent debate on homelessness.  I heard Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll&rsquo;s radio interview this morning and I wish to compliment both him and Ms Alice Leahy, who already has been named in the House, for the great work they are doing.  In particular I refer to the night bus that drives around the city of Dublin, as well as to other areas in which great work is being done in respect of homelessness.  However, it defies logic to treat someone in hospital for a week or two and then to let that person out with nowhere to go.  Such a person will more or less have been put back on the street.  This is unacceptable in this day and age and Members will have a lengthy debate on this issue at the very earliest possible time.</P><Col N="1267"/>
        <P>All local authorities received a substantial increase in their allocations in recent years.  I call on our colleagues opposite, whose parties control 95% of local authorities given their numbers following the outcome of the previous local elections, to assist the Government in ensuring what the Deputy Leader of the House has called on me to take on board.  It is important to ensure this, especially when increased allocations have been made for roads, water and sewerage schemes and other essential services and given that local authority members decide where most of those moneys will be spent.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely requested information on the general election in Russia.  I will pass on his view to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will endeavour to get a response to his query.</P>
        <P>Senators Feeney and Buttimer requested a debate on child psychiatry, with which I agree and I will pass on their views.  I can arrange for such a debate to be taken, perhaps in Private Members&rsquo; time given that it is only four weeks until the Easter recess.  Perhaps political party Whips and leaders would consider facilitating some of these urgent worthwhile requests and assist the House in agreeing to such matters being taken in Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn made a good suggestion, namely, that on leap year day, 29 February, which is this coming Friday, all households plug out or turn off their television sets and other electrical appliances and not leave them on standby at night-time in particular.  When appliances are left on standby 20% of the electricity it takes for them to be fully powered is wasted.  The House will join the Senator in calling on all citizens to respond to an energy request on leap year day and, thereby, get into that good habit.  People have got into the bad habit of switching off their television sets with their remote controls and not turning them off manually, which one must do to turn off most television sets.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames called for a debate on water quality and the sewerage scheme in Clifden.  This is an issue that could be taken during in Private Members&rsquo; time.  Perhaps the information the Senator requested could be obtained more quickly if this matter were taken in Private Members&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on a study on Gaeltacht areas being undertaken.  We always have a debate once a year on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  This is a worthy request and I have no difficulty in arranging for such a debate.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House.  Senator Cannon was in possession, but as he is not present I call Senator Glynn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim comhghairdeas leis as ucht an jab at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige i dtaobh an chomhshaoil.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to the House and congratulate him on the proactive measures he has taken in regard to the environment since he took office.  It is one thing to talk the talk, but the Minister is also walking the walk, and that must be commended.</P>
        <P>Waste management is next major question facing us and it has been a major issue for some time.  It is the reality.  As we all know, the reality that exists when one goes to bed at night is still the reality in the morning when one wakes up.  Nothing will have changed.</P>
        <P>A suite of policies developed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government over the past decade has provided a framework for the implementation of national policy.  This policy is premised on the internationally accepted waste hierarchy which favours prevention and minimisation of waste followed by reuse, recycling and energy recovery, with disposal to landfill being the least favoured option.<b>  </b>There is no point in putting our problems into the earth and covering them with soil.  If we do that, <i>de facto</i> we will plant the seed that will produce problems for future generations.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a range of commitments to waste management policy centred on the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, which places major emphasis on the prevention, reuse and recycling of waste while minimising reliance on landfill and other disposal options.  The programme also makes major commitments to national waste policy.  In particular, there is an emphasis on moving away from high reliance on incineration, foreseen in the national development plan and reflected in the regional waste management plans for which the local authorities have statutory responsibility, generally operating in regional groupings.  It is intended that there would be a commitment to the increased use of alternative technologies, including those known as mechanical and biological treatment, MBT.</P><Col N="1269"/>
        <P>Capital costs of heavy waste infrastructure are not funded by the Exchequer but are provided by the private sector as entirely commercial developments or by local authorities by way of public private partnerships.  Through the environment fund and, more recently, the Exchequer, however, the State co-funds local authority recycling facilities at a rate of 75%.  The national development plan provides for a continuation of this funding and does not foresee its extension to heavy waste infrastructure, for example, landfills or incinerators.</P>
        <P>A private individual has taken on the mantle of providing a recycling service in Mullingar and Westmeath County Council also provides such a service.  I benefit from the availability of those two services.  I am not allowed to mention names in the House, but I commend that local contractor, a young man who took his courage in his hands and provided this service.  If one misses the waste collection one day, it is great that one can avail of the alternative service a few days later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The introduction of the brown bin collection service is also welcome.  This service collects household waste, grass cuttings, hedge clippings and other such waste which posed a major problem, especially in an urban setting.  As a country man living in a town, I am aware of the problems such household waste has created.  The innovation and the practical policy implemented by the members of Westmeath County Council, on which I was proud to serve for almost 25 years, has resulted in the introduction of the brown bin and the blue bin service.  Therefore, the excuse cannot be made that one is producing waste that is not collectable.  A service to collect all household waste is provided for by Westmeath County Council, on which I commend it.  I ask the Minister to take note of the brave decisions on waste disposal taken by that council.</P>
        <P>I was bred, born and reared in the country, with a strong farming background on my mother&rsquo;s side of the family.  I am a strong advocate of farmers and farming methods.  However, one matter has been drawn to my attention, namely, the spreading of slurry at certain times of the year on land whose soil is impervious, with a very small depth of arable soil covering the impervious soil.  If the gradient of the land is towards a river which is usually the case, even a small amount of rainfall will result in a run-off into the river.  I acknowledge that slurry is a very good fertiliser but I ask the Minister and his Department to ensure land which falls into this category would be enriched by other methods.  I preface my remarks by reiterating that I am a strong advocate of the farming community and its methods in the main.</P>
        <P>Ireland must meet challenging targets for the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill.  From 866,000 tonnes recovered in 2006, Ireland must achieve landfill diversion targets of 1.4 million in 2010, 1.7 million in 2013 and 1.8 million in 2016.  The national strategy for biodegradable <Col N="1270"/>waste sets out a detailed set of measures to meet these targets.  An immediate priority will be the roll-out of a brown bin service in line with the regional waste management plans drawn up by local authorities.  I am aware that this is happening in the local authority area of Westmeath County Council and it is a marvellous service.  It is also the intention to ensure adequate economic drivers to encourage diversion of this waste stream.</P>
        <P>As a further step towards meeting the programme for Government commitment, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has directed his Department to commission the international review of waste management policy provided for in the programme.  It is intended that this review will provide a mechanism to give further effect to the commitments on waste management in the Government&rsquo;s programme. The review will examine the current statutory, organisational and operational arrangements of waste management infrastructure and services.  Expected outputs from this study would include an analysis of the various technologies available to recover and dispose of waste in an environmentally responsible manner, including the potential for co-firing; the standards for mechanical and biological processes which should apply to waste management to match best international practice; and the scope for greater use of economic instruments to achieve recycling objectives and meet landfill diversion requirements.</P>
        <P>These are some of the measures which the Minister and the Government have put in place.  I wish the Minister and his Department every success in achieving the objectives set out.</P>
        <P>I live in County Westmeath which is known as the lake county.  It is regrettable to see the manner in which the shorelines of our lakes are used by people who avail of the facilities but leave piles of rubbish and other matter in black bags and in other receptacles and which would be best located in a refuse bin.  It is not too much to ask a person to protect the environment which he or she has been lucky enough to have been born into.  Even the poorest person in society can make one bequest to posterity by his or her contribution to ensuring the environment is clean and healthy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his announcement yesterday regarding car emissions and registration costs.  I am delighted to have the opportunity of contributing on the question of waste.  If he did nothing else as Minister except to take control of a number of small issues about waste, a lot could be achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before Deputy Gormley rose to the high office of Minister, he and I discussed on a number of occasions the waste miles spent in sending boatloads of our waste from western Europe to China every week.  If it came down to a straight choice <Col N="1271"/>between incineration and sending waste to China, I would consider incineration and this is my own view.</P>
        <P>There is no traceability of waste.  People throughout Ireland are separating their waste and using their green bins.  On at least four occasions over the past five years, I have tried to trace a little piece of waste but I found it quite impossible to do so.  The stuff goes into one selection area, for example, in Castleisland, Farranfore or Milltown in County Kerry.  Mr. Binman collects it and then someone else takes it from there to somewhere else where it is separated out &mdash; God knows how &mdash; and is then separated again into washed or unwashed categories.  This system may have changed but the last time I checked, dirty plastic was sent to the Continent to be washed.  We may be doing that ourselves now.</P>
        <P>The European waste directive has ruled that waste should be disposed of as close as possible to where it is created.  If we are sending hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste out of the country every year we are patently not in compliance with the directive.</P>
        <P>I am speaking in the Minister&rsquo;s favour.  There needs to be a straight, honest and direct discussion on what we are doing with our waste.  I praised the Minister for raising the issue of waste-derived fuel, in particular, not derived by incineration but rather by natural chemical or physical methods which do not require incineration and do not create waste.  A number of companies are engaged in research such as one in Dublin City University.  This information should be made available to local authorities so that they can deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to do one thing immediately.  Any county or local authority which is not collecting waste on the basis of volume or weight should be fined.  There are still counties which encourage people to dump all the waste they wish so long as they pay a set charge a year.  The idea of an annual charge for waste collection is completely and utterly wrong.  Waste collection should be made on the basis of the volume of waste or else by the number of bin lifts or some such quantifiable or measurable method.  I understand this also was the view held by the Minister and the view of the previous Government.  The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, also was of that view.  I suggest the Minister should direct local authorities.  An annual charge provides no encouragement to people to minimise waste and this is wrong.  The argument is often made that one must not be unfair to people with large families but there is a simple way.  Some people could be given a number of bin lifts for free over the year.  I ask the Minister to put the boot in hard on this issue.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of China hosting the Olympic Games.  Dongyang is a city in China and it is the place where most European waste is dealt <Col N="1272"/>with.  It is a place which is polluted and where people are choked and are literally suffering the hardships of coping with our waste.  They are breathing it and living it.  There is no regard for environmental regulations or health and safety regulations.</P>
        <P>I understand another European regulation requires those exporting waste to be able to guarantee governments that their waste is being disposed of in a proper manner.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I will make a promise to pay my own way to Dongyang if the Minister will come with me and if we are allowed free access to see what is going on there.  The people of that city are not allowed use the Internet or anything else to promote their views.  They are trying to make their situation clear.  We would be doing Europe a favour.  We in Ireland do not want to deal with the argument about incineration and Europe does not know what to do with all its waste.  We are all turning a blind eye and are filling ships with our rubbish which goes to China and chokes the people there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to those who export fuel.  I should say dump rather than export.  While some regulations must be met and in some cases licences must be obtained, it would be good if those involved in these activities were publicly listed.  Such lists are freely available, although I do not know where they can be found.  I would like to know what regulations these people have to meet in order to do their business.  In regard to exporting, is it not the case that waste can only be exported abroad if there is a guarantee that it is to be used for the creation of fuel?  I understand European regulations provide for this.</P>
        <P>I do not know how we are meeting requirements in this area.  I asked for this debate and I could speak at length but I will confine myself to the narrow points I have raised.  There is no point in telling schoolchildren to be careful with waste if they are living in a county where the system is such that no matter how much rubbish is put out at the end of a week, it is collected just because their parents pay a couple of hundred euro a year.  The system should not be like that.  It should operate as a cost per lift, bag, tonne or whatever.  It should operate on the basis of the amount of waste created and there should be a clear understanding of this.</P>
        <P>People should be shown the bulk of their waste, as in those food programmes when people who are overweight are shown the number of hamburgers they have eaten.  People are appalled by that.  I would like to see the waste that an average household creates per year for sending abroad piled up beside the house.  People would then see what they were doing.</P>
        <P>Many people are under the misapprehension that the waste they put into a green bin is cleaned away and that everything goes in one direction.  When I was in primary school, a favourite essay title was &ldquo;An old biro or pencil tells its own story&rdquo;.  An old piece of rubbish might tell its own <Col N="1273"/>story in terms of following all the tracks it makes to reach its end usage.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to deal with the China question and the matter of waste-derived fuel.  I have met two groups who guarantee me that they can derive fuel from waste, and I have also seen this subject covered on a television programme.  Let us do this.  The Minister could give a grant to a county or a local authority for the purpose.  My understanding is that there are two local authorities in the UK, one of them in London, now working on a &pound;30 million project of this kind.  It is no longer simply a project because they are now dealing with their waste in this way.  There is no impact on the local environment, huge amounts of waste are being dealt with and the system is as efficient as an incinerator.  It also gives fuel.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister whether it is possible to put a bag over every landfill in Ireland to collect the methane produced.  People are not aware that the methane which is given off by landfill is 20 times more damaging to the environment than carbon.  We always call such emissions carbon but a tonne of methane is equal to 20 tonnes of carbon.  We are wasting fuel this in way.  It is another area we should be examining.  The Minister should make grants available to any county or area that puts serious effort into extracting methane from landfill.  He is already doing this in a small way.</P>
        <P>There should be a double incentive to do this in that such waste treatment would also save us money in the area of carbon credits.  Some &euro;270 million of wasteful expenditure has been set aside by the budget to buy carbon credits, a situation the Minister has criticised.  I remember meeting him the night after the Budget Statement.  I accept and agree that we must engage in some element of carbon credit dealing but we do not need to do as much as we are doing.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply although I will be absent for a part of the debate as I have to attend a meeting.  These are significant issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Gormley to the House and compliment him on a job well done to date.  I am pleased that matters are going well.  It has always been my view that the notion of the Green Party coming into Government with Fianna F&aacute;il is a wake-up call for our party.  We have our faults and failings on the issue of waste management and other environmental matters and the new coalition is pulling us in the right direction.  It could have a positive impact politically on our party.  There may be a few at grass roots level with a jaundiced view, but there are many others who believe it is probably a good thing.</P>
        <P>Forgive me for being somewhat parochial but I have a some issues that weigh heavily.  One issue is waste management.  I live in a beautiful area of Ireland and I was born beside the shore of Bantry Bay.  I do a little fishing as one of my pastimes and the litter and waste, including plastics and rubbish, that come onshore in beautiful places <Col N="1274"/>such as Ballylickey, Barleycove, Schull and Courtmacsharry is appalling.  This is a problem for local authorities with a coastline.  I imagine the same applies in County Kerry.  It is particularly acute in the south west because the busiest shipping lanes in the world pass by there.  The south west of Ireland also has problems with drugs importation, etc.</P>
        <P>The Minister should urge local authorities in these coastal regions to take a more proactive approach to cleaning up the beaches.  Litter comes in whether it is high or low water and there have been instances of harm to birds and damage to the environment.  There have been many oil slicks in Bantry but I do not want to get into that.  There is an ongoing problem with rubbish that primarily is not ours.  I imagine it is carelessly dumped off boats.  Bags of rubbish and sometimes much more drift onshore and stay there.</P>
        <P>If we are to promote tourism and a healthy environment there must be change.  I am not sure what the answers are.  I was a member of my local authority in Cork for almost 20 years and, while not wishing to be disparaging towards it, the attitude appeared to be that it was not our waste or rubbish so we could stand aside and let someone else deal with it.  The result has been that no one has dealt with it.  There is a non-political group in west Cork which has done a lot of work in this area conducting research and taking photographs.  I have seen the rubbish in little coves and inlets along Bantry Bay, Dunmanus Bay and Roaring Water Bay.  I feel ashamed that we are not prepared to deal with it.  Perhaps some initiative could be taken.  While I do not want the Minister to contact the Cork county manager and say I said he was doing nothing, something must be done.  There must be a programme for dealing with waste coming onshore.</P>
        <P>On the positive side, the committee of the western division of Cork County Council, under an initiative from the now-retired chief administrative officer in Clonakilty, Mr. Jerome C. O&rsquo;Sullivan, became the first in Cork if not in Ireland to introduce a pay-by-weight scheme.  There was a political fuss at the time but the effect was a 60% reduction in two years in the amount of rubbish collected.  Once the scheme hit the householder&rsquo;s pocket, there was greater awareness of the need to reuse, recycle, compost and segregate rubbish.  I include myself in that.  There was a time 12 or 15 years ago when I had three bins, but I confess I soon learned.  The impact in the western division of Cork County Council was immense in a short space of time.  When I joined the council in 1985, there were six landfill dumps in west Cork.  Most are closed now and I believe there is only one left, mainly because we are a long way from a central area.</P>
        <P>We must consider providing civic amenity centres.  One was proposed by a very forward thinking assistant county manager of Cork County Council, west Cork division, John Deasy, who has now retired.  He proposed having a civic <Col N="1275"/>amenity site in Bantry, my home town, approximately 12 years ago.  There was a great hoo-ha that we were about to create a dump and following public meetings it was stopped.  It was supposed to be the model for County Cork.  Bantry is the only town of its size without a civic amenity site.  Anybody with an old bed or fridge-freezer to dump must travel for miles to get rid of it.  I have urged locally that such facilities should be provided in every town.</P>
        <P>I laud the very important anti-litter awareness grant scheme.  My generation needed to be dragged kicking and screaming when our pockets were hit in order to stand up and smell the roses and face the reality of having to pay to get rid of our rubbish.  There is a young generation from national school upwards that must be educated on how to deal with plastics and protect the environment.  When I was a teenager that issue did not arise.  However, now there is awareness among young people who question what the world will be like when they grow up and for the next generation.  We must tap into that awareness and promote it.</P>
        <P>Individual households produce domestic waste.  Thankfully we have bottle banks and can recycle plastics and paper.  However, one of the main problems involves commercial retail and wholesale companies dealing with bulk waste like cartons.  Supermarkets generate significant volumes of cardboard, plastics and other types of waste.  Commercial entities, including large supermarket chains, should be taxed or forced to take a more realistic approach.  There is a provision allowing them to pay into an educational programme for dealing with waste, which should be encouraged and controlled.  There is no doubt it can be a success.</P>
        <P>Clonakilty in west Cork won several awards.  Dealing with litter in the town was key to its winning Tidy Towns awards and international gold medals of all descriptions.  That town has a civic mindedness of top quality.  Its inhabitants have a town of which they are very proud.  It generates tourism and has achieved international recognition.  The people in the town and its hinterland are conscious of littering and waste, which rubs off on others.  We should congratulate Clonakilty on its success in the past ten or 15 years.  Other towns should aspire to similar achievements.  A town with a litter problem will not win a Tidy Towns award or an international gold medal, whether European or on the world stage.  If it can be achieved in Clonakilty it can be achieved in other towns.  Clonakilty is a medium-sized town with a population of approximately 5,500.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on what Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned earlier.  While it might be changing we have a mindset of &ldquo;not in my backyard&rdquo;.  The export of waste to China and India is a short-term cheap-shot measure that I do not advocate.  There have been heated debates about the proposed incinerator in Ringaskiddy.  I had mixed views on <Col N="1276"/>it and abstained when the council had a critical vote on the matter, in part because I lived 60 or 70 miles away from the proposed site.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand anymore.</P>
        <P>My home town and Castletownbere have plans to dredge the harbours to clear mercury and TBT from the silt.  That is a very expensive way of dealing with this issue.  I would like to know where the mercury is coming from.  I always thought the mercury in my home town came from the local hospital.  It cannot be taken out to sea as it is a lethal chemical.</P>
        <P>In Castletownbere the silt that is contaminated is being skimmed off to a depth of 1 m or less.  It is dried, mixed with concrete and exported to Germany as concrete blocks.  Those two towns may be exceptions.  However, we should consider how we can eliminate the contamination of harbours and ports by mercury.  The dredging of the inner harbour in Bantry has been delayed for 20 years.  When a seismographic study was carried out and found the contamination, the authorities ran away from the problem.  The old way was to dredge the area and release the waste 20 or 30 miles from shore.  That is not allowed anymore because it can do serious damage to marine life.  Mercury is a lethal poison.  While the Minister might not be aware of this parochial issue, perhaps he might look into it at some time to ascertain how we can deal with it in the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on climate change and I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  While I was doing research for this debate, I noted that the EPA has stated that the outcomes achieved, especially on biodegradable municipal waste, are less than satisfactory.  Recent data from the national waste report showed that 1.4 million tonnes of such waste went to landfill in 2006.  We have very few facilities for disposing of green waste.  As a former county councillor in the recent past, one of the big issues was how gardeners, in particular, would dispose of green waste.  We need to take urgent action if we are to meet our EU commitments.  At present 92% of organic municipal waste is going to landfill, which is a disgrace and needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn already referred to the fact that Westmeath County Council has rolled out a pilot scheme to 1,000 people, on which I commend it.  The same is happening in other parts of the country.  I ask the Minister to engage in an awareness campaign to encourage people to use brown bins and to recycle organic waste.  Some people are doing so in their own households, for which I commend them.  At the end of this process we need to decide how the market will deal with biodegradable waste.  A development group is meeting to discuss the market and I look forward to its findings.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about plastic and the end product of our dry recyclables.  I ask the Minister to comment on that matter.  I have <Col N="1277"/>always wondered where our dry recyclables go.  I have asked that question several times in the county council and was told they are sorted and exported.  It is not very environmentally friendly considering the amount of energy it takes to transport our disposables.  I ask the Minister to comment on the matter.</P>
        <P>The amount of energy we use is the main contributor to climate change.  Agriculture and transport are contributory factors to global warming.  I note that our transport-related greenhouse emissions have increased by 160% from 1990 to 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the past the Minister has been, and still is, passionate about transport and the environment.  I would ask him to elaborate on how we will proceed in this respect.  I welcome Dublin City Council's plan to provide bicycles, which will be rolled out in a year&rsquo;s time.  Under the plan that is currently being discussed, the public will be able to pick up a bicycle to travel to their destination where they can park it.  I welcome that very good idea.</P>
        <P>Recently, I travelled on the new Dublin-Sligo train, which is a comfortable state-of-the-art facility but I was disappointed to learn that it is run on diesel.  Why is it not electric?  Perhaps the Minister can answer that point.</P>
        <P>I commend the improvements that have been achieved in the agricultural sector which was one of the chief contributors to global warming.  In addition, energy production, including home heating and insulation, has improved significantly.  This debate provides an opportunity to highlight ways in which the public can recycle and reduce emissions.</P>
        <P>The Government should fund local authority waivers for waste collection schemes.  It is impossible for local authorities to compete with private waste collectors if they must provide this service free for the elderly and others who are less well off.</P>
        <P>Some people have been granted licences to produce biofuels but others who are not producing biofuels have also been granted such licences.  Meanwhile, there are people who are desperate to establish their own biofuel businesses yet cannot obtain these licences.  I therefore ask the Minister to comment on the biofuel licensing process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in commending the Minister for his announcement backdating the lower green motor tax to January.  The story was carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  The Minister&rsquo;s viewpoint on all these issues is welcomed not only by Members of the Oireachtas but also by the public, including my own constituents.  I commend the Minister for his positive thinking on new initiatives, ideas and methods of minimising waste as well as fulfilling our environmental protection commitments.  </P>
        <P>Waste management has emerged as one of the most challenging environmental issues facing the <Col N="1278"/>country in recent years.  Modern lifestyles have resulted in a significant increase in the quantity and type of waste being produced, but we are faced with the problem of how to dispose of it.  Traditionally, most waste was disposed of as landfill and we continue to depend on that disposal method.  Due to new legislation, increased environmental concerns and a lack of suitable disposal sites, we are now turning correctly towards waste minimisation, recycling and composting as the chief means of dealing with waste.</P>
        <P>Under the Waste Management Act 1996 local authorities are responsible for producing waste management plans in their areas.  Such plans are proving to be both positive and workable, giving local councillors an input into the decision-making process for such issues.  I suggest, however, that councillors should have more input into compiling those plans.  In my own local authority, of which I was a member up to last August, the plan was enacted by the county manager with little input by elected councillors.  While not wishing to run down the manager, I want to bring that point to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>Waste prevention is a key priority of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to minimise the generation of unnecessary waste.  A recent international report examined models of best international practice for waste prevention and how this might pertain to Ireland.  The report also examined anticipated EU legislation, such as a review of the waste framework directive which proposes benchmarking and target-setting for waste prevention.</P>
        <P>The national waste prevention programme, NWPP, is currently being reviewed by the EPA which is the lead agency in developing that programme.  The local authority prevention demonstration programme is acknowledged as the agency&rsquo;s flagship under the NWPP for the local authority sector.  It is specifically aimed at empowering local authorities to prevent waste in their areas.  It will be interesting to see how that is achieved in each local authority area.  Perhaps a league table could be drawn up which could be made available to elected councillors and Members of the Oireachtas so they can gauge the positive and negative elements involved.  We should review them annually or biannually.</P>
        <P>I welcome initiatives aimed at changing existing waste disposal practices by reducing unnecessary waste volumes, including food, plastics, farm waste and packaging materials.  Such initiatives also encourage the reuse of such products.</P>
        <P>We must focus on recycling as a pivotal element of waste management.  In Ireland, we recycle approximately 35% to 40% of our waste, although the Minister may have more up-to-date figures.  European, national and county targets have been set to increase and thus improve these figures.  We have a number of challenging targets to meet in the coming years, including the diversion of 50% of waste from landfill, reducing the <Col N="1279"/>organic fraction of landfill waste by 65%, and reducing household waste by 35%.</P>
        <P>I understand that Donegal County Council is currently recycling approximately 27% of waste in its area but that figure should be increased.  Local authorities, such as Donegal County Council, should not merely focus on recycling in urban areas &mdash; they must also provide recycling bins and other such services to people in rural areas.  That is one of the challenges to be faced.</P>
        <P>Since August 2005, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, WEEE, has required producers to finance the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally-sound disposal of such equipment.  Civic amenity sites are generally being developed across the country on the basis of electoral areas but we should also provide more local collection facilities.  While civic amenity sites are being opened, many people will not take the time to travel to such sites which could be 40 or 50 miles away in a rural area.  Therefore fridges, freezers and computers are being dumped in bogland areas.  This problem should be taken into consideration.  While civic amenity sites represent a significant step forward, we must deal with the problem on a more localised basis.  For example, contractors or the local authorities could engage in the collection of such waste at local level and feed it back into the civic amenity sites.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the importance of maintaining beaches and the coastline.  As a person who lives in an area with an extensive coastline, I had reason recently to write to the Minister on the issue of beach environmental management.  It is an issue that may come under the remit of more than one Department.  I understand my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has some responsibility in this area and I have spoken to her about it.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should play an active role in encouraging local authorities to take responsibility for beach management.  There is no evidence of such management in my constituency.  It is important that beaches are maintained so that local people and tourists alike can enjoy this important amenity.  It is also a question of protecting a natural resource.  In Spain, Portugal and other European countries, the resources may not be readily available but the beach management plans are in place, including everything from lifeguards to litter bins, signage and so on.  We must promote our beaches as the best in Europe, which they are.</P>
        <P>I commend An Taisce on its proactive approach in introducing the green flag programme.  Many schools are availing of the initiative as it is rolled out throughout the State.  It is playing a vital role in educating the next generation on the importance of minimising waste and transferring from the traditional methods of treatment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1280"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and apologise for missing his opening remarks.  I have heard him speak before on this issue.  In the past ten or 15 years, in this and the other House, I have heard so many Ministers speak about waste management that if all the scripts were piled on top of each other there would be a recycling bin to fill.  Every Minister comes to this portfolio full of good intentions but we are still not making sufficient progress and we remain as far from the clean, green Ireland we seek to achieve as we were ten or 15 years ago.</P>
        <P>We still do not have a co-ordinated national waste strategy.  I made this point last week to the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, Senator Boyle, as I have done on many occasions in recent years.  The Republic of Ireland is not a large country, but every local authority appears to have a slightly different or slightly amended plan.  For instance, the waste management plan for County Cork is different from that for County Kerry and both differ from the plan for County Limerick.  That is difficult to accept.  If the plan for County Cork represents the best possible solution, there should be no difference in the plans for Limerick, Clare and elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council spent up to seven years debating waste management before arriving at what the management considered the best solution, which was a combination of a materials recovery facility process and a landfill site.  The latter is located in my parish, a mile or two from my back door.  It is an enormous facility that cost a significant amount of money to put in place.  Cork City Council was to work in tandem with the county council to develop the materials recovery facility.  However, the city council reneged on this commitment and that element of the project has not progressed.</P>
        <P>While the strategy at national level is focused on waste minimisation and reduction, many local authorities across the State seem to concentrate on landfill.  The landfill site in County Cork, in the townland of Bottle Hill, has an enormous capacity and will be sufficient to meet the county&rsquo;s needs for up to 40 years.  If we succeed in reducing the level of waste by fully practising the concept of reduction, reuse and recycling, the site could be viable for 100 years.</P>
        <P>My concern, as I said, is that different local authorities in this small State seem to be coming up with different solutions to the same problem.  Who will take charge of co-ordinating these plans?  It is somewhat late in the day for Cork given that tens of millions of euro were spent on the landfill site at Bottle Hill.  In other counties, however, where the same financial commitment has not been made, the Department should take charge of waste management to a tighter degree by imposing some type of best national practice.  I am not sure how far the Minister has progressed in this regard.  It is disappointing that there apparently is no correlation between the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="1281"/>waste management strategy and the various strategies of individual local authorities.</P>
        <P>When I entered politics in 1985, the local elections of that era were dominated by service charges and, more particularly, people&rsquo;s apparent unwillingness to pay for refuse and water services.  Fortunately, there has been a general change in thinking on this issue and most people now accept that the waste they create must be disposed of properly and at some cost to themselves.  We have a duty at national and local government level to respond to the public&rsquo;s willingness to pay.  Previous speakers referred to civic amenity sites and bring centres, which are a positive aspect of the waste management strategy.  While I am disappointed by some elements of the waste strategy for County Cork, several of these civic amenity facilities have been built in the county and are working well.  They are a visible illustration of waste management and an important encouragement to the public to bring materials for recovery, reuse and recycling on a regular basis.  Local authorities seeking funding from the Department to develop bring centres and civic amenity sites should be facilitated to the maximum extent possible.</P>
        <P>The debate on waste continues to evolve.  When a county such as Cork spends a substantial sum on a landfill solution, however, there may be an unwillingness to consider other solutions.  The waste to energy debate is only commencing and may well assume a pivotal role in the overall waste management strategy.  Any prospect of incineration, however, whether industrial or domestic, causes great concern for many people.  There is a scientific school of thought to support both sides of the argument.  We must invest time and careful thought in considering waste to energy solutions where they are appropriate.  We should not shut our minds to some of the new forms of waste management.  At a time when there is great concern about the security of our energy supply, it seems unwise to dispose of large quantities of waste underground in landfill sites without fully investigating waste to energy solutions.</P>
        <P>Schools have an important role to play in waste management efforts.  Children are generally the best informed about good environmental practices and we must continue to encourage that.  The debate about water charges for schools is a separate issue  but it is part of the Minister&rsquo;s broader environmental responsibility.  Will he work with the Minister for Education and Science to consider making funding available to allow schools put water harvesting systems in place?  While such systems are relatively inexpensive, they may be a little beyond the budget of individual schools with limited resources.  At a time when we are encouraging schools not to waste water &mdash; it is proposed to charge all schools for water &mdash; we need to help those schools which are willing to install water harvesting systems.  The use of such systems in schools would give pupils <Col N="1282"/>a good example of best environmental practice.  Perhaps the Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Hanafin, can agree on the provision of some form of State aid to assist schools in this regard.  While this worthwhile and laudable proposal might not relate directly to the debate, I would be glad if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would consider it and discuss it with his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.  The Department should help schools because they are under financial pressure at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to the House and thank him for keeping in touch with me as a public representative in the Seanad.  He is prompt in letting me know what is happening in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is very important.</P>
        <P>This country&rsquo;s waste management services have developed from a low base.  I spent 17 years as a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The council opened its first baling station in Ballymount in 1993 because it was not happy with what it was putting into the ground.  It understood the need to focus on recycling in Dublin.  It closed Ballyogan tiphead, which was quite close to the city, five years later.  Five years is not long in a recycling process.  The baling and recycling station that was developed by the council has worked very well.  There has been some criticism of this country&rsquo;s waste management systems, including recycling.  We have improved such services in the short time since we began to take them seriously.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, who has some good ideas, will keep us on our toes.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight some figures which show that Ireland&rsquo;s performance in this regard is improving.  There are 81 civic amenity sites and 1,937 bring banks in operation throughout the country.  That is a significant improvement.  We started with nothing.  Some 58% of packaging is now recycled.  I am sure we can do better in that regard.  We should ask supermarkets, which represent the main source of recyclable waste, to look at the repackaging programme they have for display on their shelves.</P>
        <P>The most amazing improvements which have been made are in the construction industry.  Some 87% of waste from that industry, which used to go into landfill, is now recycled.  That great improvement shows we are aware of what we can do with the recycled materials for which we have found a market.  It is good we are thinking about how we can recycle and reuse material from demolitions on construction sites.  It is a great improvement.  Some 34% of biodegradable waste was recycled in 2005.  I am sure we can do better than that.  I have given some of the figures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bradford mentioned the electrical trade in which significant improvements have been made.  There was a great deal of opposition <Col N="1283"/>to the decision to phase in the recycling of such waste.  I applaud the then Minister, Deputy Roche, on his introduction of electrical recycling which has made a major difference.  If he had not taken that step, the countryside could have been littered with many more washing machines and cookers, etc.  Although one can now bring such waste to recycling centres, some of it is still being dumped in the countryside.</P>
        <P>The existence of recycling centres serves to remind people they cannot dump things anymore.  One must recycle what one brings to recycling centres by putting it in the various bins.  The substantial improvements made over the past ten to 15 years, when green, blue and brown bins have been supplied, have helped to educate people and change their mindsets.  People in some parts of the country are still waiting to get brown bins, however.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the waiver system for vulnerable people with fixed incomes, which has already been mentioned.  Many people on social welfare, for example, cannot afford to pay waste charges.  While I am a firm believer in the polluter pays principle, we need to help polluters who cannot afford to pay.  I suggest the Minister for Social and Family Affairs should be in charge of the waiver system because it is a little unfair to ask the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with it.  As that could be a good move, it should be considered.  The waiver system should be operated in the same way as the social welfare and pensions systems.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight a major problem which Dublin will be the first part of the country to experience.  Kill landfill facility will close at some stage in the next five years.  Dublin is exporting its waste.  I suggest to the Minister that Dublin will have to consider incineration and thermal treatment.  We should develop three or four incinerators throughout the country because this problem will affect areas outside Dublin as time goes by.  When there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain, the authorities there found it difficult to dispose of animal waste and material such as tallow.  We have to look at the bigger waste management picture.  As a farming nation, we must consider how we will handle problems which will arise in the agriculture sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the many Senators who contributed to the debate on this important topic.  Their concerns ranged across a number of issues, including this country&rsquo;s overall approach to waste management and the regulation of the waste management sector.  Like the Senators who contributed, I am also conscious of how important is a sustainable approach to waste management.  Since coming to office I have identified waste management along <Col N="1284"/>with climate change as my major environmental priorities.</P>
        <P>We need nothing less than a step-change in our approach to waste management if we are to rid ourselves of unsustainable practices and meet our national and EU ambitions and targets.  In particular, I am acutely conscious of the imminent challenge posed by the EU landfill directive.  If we are to meet our obligations under this directive and avoid the threat of legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice, we must double the amount of biodegradable waste diverted from landfill by 2010.  The scale of the challenge this presents was well illustrated in the EPA&rsquo;s recent national waste report for 2006, which shows that while quantities of waste recycled increased so too did the quantity of waste sent to landfill.  The report demonstrates good progress is being made in recovering and recycling packaging, biodegradable waste and household and commercial waste.  However, this is being offset by the increase in the volume of waste being generated.</P>
        <P>While the rapid economic growth of recent years, with the accompanying increase in population and number of households, is the driver of this increase it is not one that can be maintained.  Sustainable development is fundamentally about decoupling our increasing prosperity from the environmental impacts which can be a consequence of it.  Development and proper waste management are not mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>A new way forward needs to be charted.  For this reason, the programme for Government identified the need for a fundamental review of our approach to waste management, which I have initiated.  I intend that it be completed and acted upon in months and not years because time is not on our side.  We need to accelerate the move away from landfill quite dramatically, to examine all the technologies that can contribute to this and to regulate the sector in a manner that supports optimal environmental performance at minimum cost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, we should be under no illusion.  Good environmental performance comes at a price.  Ireland leads Europe in its application of the polluter pays principle through its system of use-based charging and the funding of most of our infrastructure in this way.  It must be ensured that the costs of using this infrastructure reflect the environmental burden imposed.  For this reason I shall shortly increase the landfill levy by the &euro;5 per tonne maximum currently permitted in law and I shall develop proposals for a much more ambitious approach to using levies to minimise our reliance on landfill and incineration and to promote the viability of the alternative technologies.  This is being done at a time when the fall in landfill gate fees runs counter to the need to rapidly reduce our reliance on this outmoded technology and avoid the sanctions that will result if we do not meet our landfill directive obligations.</P><Col N="1285"/>
        <P>An ambitious programme to achieve the diversion of waste from landfill required by the directive is set out in the national strategy on biodegradable waste published in 2006.  The programme for Government commits to implementing it.  This will involve diversion of up to 1.4 million tonnes of waste from landfill by 2010, 1.7 million tonnes by 2013 and an estimated 1.8 million tonnes by 2016.  To put this in context, of the 2.3 million tonnes of biodegradable waste generated in 2006, only 867,000 tonnes were recovered.  The Government is committed to ensuring the implementation of the national strategy through segregated collection of biodegradable waste and the generation of compost and through the introduction of mechanical and biological treatment facilities as one of a range of technologies.</P>
        <P>The review will not only be about technology.  Its terms of reference are deliberately broad to promote a fundamental review of the legal, institutional and financial approach taken to waste management.  If the review indicates the need for significant legislative changes, then I will bring the necessary proposals to Government.  Inaction is not an option and the approach reflected in the current crop of waste management plans, while facilitating some progress, is simply not going far enough fast enough.  We need to move from being reactive to proactive, from accepting received wisdom in regard to waste management to seeking the most innovative solutions available internationally.  Ireland has led the way on the plastic bag levy, ridding the workplace of smoking and will soon lead in the approach to energy efficient lighting and a motor taxation system that tackles the climate issue head on.</P>
        <P>In the same way I believe we can lead in waste management.  Ireland can move from being an under achiever to world class standard which will see us not struggle to meet EU targets, as is the case with landfill diversion, but take a position of leadership.  For this reason, the programme for Government sets the ambitious long-term goal of reducing reliance on landfill to 10%.  There have been rapid changes in the waste management sector over the past decade due to the increased involvement of a developing and consolidating private sector, the changing role of local authorities as service providers and competitors within the industry and the movement towards full cost recovery for waste services that has led to increased charges for the consumer.  While the sector is fully and properly regulated from an environmental perspective, no similarly comprehensive system of socioeconomic regulation has been put in place.</P>
        <P>While there is general agreement that the existing regulatory framework needs modernisation, there is no consensus on what form this should take, for example, whether a waste regulator is required or whether it would be sufficient to change the regulatory framework to provide for a form of public service obligation and to ensure waste can be directed appropriately.  A key over<Col N="1286"/>arching issue that has emerged is the dual role of local authorities as competitors and regulators in the same market and the perceived conflict of interest arising from this.  Private sector involvement drives least cost solutions, which may not always address necessary social and environmental objectives.  In environmental terms, the absence of a universal household collection service leads to increased fly tipping and backyard burning.  Social equity is also an issue in the absence of waiver schemes in respect of privately provided services raising issues regarding what kind of public service obligation might need to be determined for service providers.  Senator Butler made a number of good points in raising this issue.</P>
        <P>The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the current OECD review of the public service, which includes a specific case study on waste management, and which will be implemented in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy provided for in the programme for Government.  I again stress my commitment, which I know is shared by Members, to ensure we rapidly move towards the world class waste management system a world class economy deserves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to a number of the issues raised by Senators.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the question of traceability.  While, like him, I want a waste infrastructure that does not involve the export of waste, there is a problem, which we share with other small economies, regarding economies of scale.  For the foreseeable future, we will rely on exports but the points made by the Senator are valid.  We need to find out where the waste is going and whether it is being properly handled and I have taken steps in this regard.  An authority did not look after this area but on advice I selected Dublin City Council as the authority to examine trans-boundary shipment of waste.  The council is doing so and it has stepped up to the plate.  The system is more rigorous and there is much more vigilance regarding such shipments.  I will examine the Senator&rsquo;s offer to travel to<?oasys _jy ?>Dongyang.  However, the air miles must be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The Senator also raised the issue of refuse-derived fuel, RDF.  Ireland is the only member state that does not use RDF and this must be addressed.  I have begun discussions with Lagan Cement Limited, which has an EPA licence.  Progress is being made on this and, therefore, RDF will be used in cement kilns.  Currently, no kiln uses this fuel.  Ireland is bottom of the league in Europe in this regard and it is my intention to move Ireland up the table.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Other Senators raised important issues.  Senator Glynn referred to people in the private sector who are making an important contribution.  Some people in the private sector are making important contributions.  When the interaction between local authorities and the private sector is reviewed, we will have to look closely at the role being played by private operators because some perform very well and are making serious contributions in terms of recycling.  I have visited some of these private plants and found them to be conscientious in how they recycle but critical of certain local authorities.  Consistency is needed between private operators and local authorities in regard to collection and recycling of waste.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn also raised the issue of slurry spreading.  I am conscious of that issue and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also has a role to play.  Farming organisations complain to me that their members are over inspected.  They are now inspected by the EPA, local authorities and water authorities in some instances.  The Senator made a valid point in that regard.</P>
        <P>Several Senators referred to coastal zone management.  This function does not at present reside with my Department although legislation has been proposed to move it there from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is extremely important that my Department has a function in regard to foreshore management in particular.  At present we assist Coastwatch Ireland and An Taisce&rsquo;s blue flag initiative.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill spoke about beach management.  The blue flag initiative does not pertain to water quality alone.  There are outstanding beaches throughout the country which do not have blue flags but have fantastic water quality.  Blue flag status requires that beaches have lifeguards, carparks and other ancillary services.  I would like to put in place a system that makes information available on water quality in order that people can be aware of beaches which have outstanding water quality even though they lack blue flags.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an important issue.  Most local authorities operate weight or volume based systems and, where a service is farmed out to another provider, it is usually done on the basis of one of those systems.  It makes sense to do so because the more one produces, the more one pays.  I can find out for the Senator where the exemptions exist and which local authorities do not have these systems in place.  He is clearly aware of at least one such local authority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

	<P>I can collate that data to give Senators Coffey and O&rsquo;Toole a better idea.  We could speak about consistency in respect of many areas.  We are trying to introduce new efficiency criteria and league tables across a range of issues in order that we can see how local authorities perform.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden strayed somewhat from our brief and in answering questions I have ranged beyond the issue of waste management.  The Senator&rsquo;s desire for electrification of the railway system is a matter for the Minister for Transport.  Electrification is a good idea but it will be very costly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Transport, on the subject of Malin Head and Valentia Coast Guard stations.  It would be useful if I outlined the context within which these centres operate and gave some of the background to the current state of play.</P>
        <P>The organisation responsible for marine emergency management, MEM, in Ireland is the Irish Coast Guard, which is a part of the Department of Transport.  Marine emergency management includes search and rescue, SAR, marine pollution, casualty and salvage preparedness and response and safety awareness.  This 24 hours per day, seven days per week emergency response is carried out in co-operation with other Depart<Col N="1289"/>ments, charities and voluntary organisations dedicated to SAR.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard&rsquo;s areas of responsibility are the Ireland search and rescue region, the Irish pollution response zone, inland waters, mountains and caves, cliffs of Ireland and offshore islands.  It has some 80 full-time staff and over 1,000 volunteers.</P>
        <P>There are 55 Irish Coast Guard coastal units operated by volunteers both male and female, strategically located around the coast and inland waters.  These units have full 24 hours per days, seven days per week capabilities and range of equipment and vehicles depending on the marine risks in their areas of operation.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard also has helicopter coverage which is provided under contract with the private sector company Canadian Helicopter Corporation (Ireland) Limited.  The company supplies six helicopters, equipment and crew for four bases at Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo airports.  The Coast Guard helicopters can travel up to 200 miles out to sea and rescue up to 14 people.  In similarity with the other services provided by the Coast Guard, the helicopters are available 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 365 days per year at 15 minutes notice during the daytime and 45 minutes notice during the night-time.</P>
        <P>Whatever combination of resources is used, rescue operations are often carried out in the most extreme conditions and inclement weather.  The personnel involved work in extremely difficult situations and stressful conditions and that fact is acknowledged by the State.</P>
        <P>Emergencies occurring in the Irish maritime search and rescue region have been co-ordinated from the marine rescue co-ordination centre, MRCC, in Dublin since the early 1990s and before that from MRCC Shannon.  Prior to 2001, both Malin Head and Valentia were commercial coast radio stations whose principal responsibility was to carry out ship-to-shore links to shipping, issue weather forecasts and navigational warnings and logging fishing reports.  Search and rescue co-ordination was delegated to Malin Head and Valentia from MRCC Dublin in 2001.</P>
        <P>There may be some confusion between the work done in co-ordination centres and that undertaken by local volunteers.  The location of a co-ordination centre and local knowledge are not entirely linked as the principal element of local knowledge is from the local Coast Guard coastal units and lifeboat crews strategically positioned around our coast.  Their local knowledge of tides, currents, bays and local historical incident locations is invaluable to the watch officers of the Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>I put on record again my appreciation and that of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, of the selfless voluntary efforts of the Coast Guard, RNLI Lifeboat and community rescue boat crews in rescuing those in trouble on our coasts, cliffs and offshore islands.  We are also indebted to a <Col N="1290"/>wide range of organisations, both public and private, that make their facilities available to the Coast Guard on a 24 hour basis or who have operational or liaison agreements with the Coast Guard.</P>
        <P>When an incident occurs, emergency calls are routed to a Coast Guard co-ordination centre and the operations of the different agencies are co-ordinated from the centre.  Clearly, the communication system on which these centres rely is the backbone infrastructure on which Coast Guard operations depend.  It is essential that it is of high quality, efficient, effective and that it provides value for money.</P>
        <P>With regard to the overall maritime safety structure, which I have outlined, it is the intention of the Minister that the Irish Coast Guard and maritime administration will be strengthened to meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century.  In that context the Minister is concerned at the state of the present equipment and has confirmed that investment in a new integrated communications system equipment should proceed as quickly as possible.  There has been some delay in recent years in proceeding with this upgrade due to uncertainty about the number and nature of centres to be provided for and where they should be located.  It is considered that neither Malin Head nor Valentia MRSC is designed to accommodate a world-class maritime rescue service as they are currently constructed.  Each centre has evolved with piecemeal modernisation over the last century and is in need of major investment.</P>
        <P>The issue of the number of centres was raised in a 2002 Deloitte and Touche Irish Coast Guard study.  This report has provided a backdrop to ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard in the past six years.  The consultants, having regard to international best practice and value for money, made more than 100 recommendations in respect of the future development of the service.  The recommendations concern IRCG functions, structure and operations.  A number of recommendations are strategic in nature and &mdash; critically for the issue being considered by the House &mdash; include reducing the number of rescue co-ordination centres from three to two enhanced facilities.</P>
        <P>It might be useful to recall that the most economical option identified by the consultants was one co-ordination centre to operate the system for the entire country, with a reserve centre nearby which could be activated quickly if the main centre was out of commission and which would double also as a training facility.  Its benefits to staff included improved availability for advanced training and development, personnel availability in the event of major emergencies or in times of severe staff shortages, for example, during a flu epidemic, reduced travel times, subsistence, overtime and other costs, redeployment opportunities, continuous senior management availability to all staff and improved career <Col N="1291"/>opportunities.  However, the need for strengthened resilience in the event of a severe localised incident which could make a single centre and its nearby reserve centre inoperable led to the focus on a two-centre operation, with an emphasis on retaining as many of the one-centre benefits as possible.  Critically, it is important to stress that the consultants were silent on the issue of where the two centres should be located.</P>
        <P>A proposal to close any one of the three centres, no matter how well-intentioned and regardless of the ultimate benefits, was going to cause controversy.  Over the years three possibilities have been put forward.  The first was to close the Dublin centre, while the second was to close either the Malin or Valentia centres.  The most recent proposal would involve relocating all three but would result in one centre, along with the Coast Guard and maritime administration headquarters, being put in on the east coast and another on the west coast.  A two-centre operation, geographically separated, is envisaged.  Each centre will be equipped and manned in such a way that if one ceases to operate, the other will be in a position to assume control of the maritime emergency management of Ireland for the required period.</P>
        <P>Any of these options give rise to difficulties as well as advantages.  However, the most controversial aspect revolves around the question of where to locate the centre on the west coast.  The Minister considers that the site on the west coast should be in a technically robust location, well served by transport and infrastructure, and also should be situated where all staff can live within close proximity to enable them to be called on in an emergency.  He has not finalised where that location should be.  The review of locations is under way and I understand the possibilities have been narrowed down to three sites in the Limerick-Shannon area and those at Malin and Valentia.  Should a decision be made to transfer operations from Malin or Valentia, the possibility of keeping existing staff running combined radio watches from their existing stations is also under evaluation to utilise fully the professional knowledge of current staff while not asking them to move.</P>
        <P>At the heart of this debate is a view that existing locations are not ideal for co-ordination centres.  Whatever happens, change is inevitable.  I can understand the motivation behind the Irish Coast Guard exploring whether a new location would provide better and more efficient service to those at risk at sea. Any such move would also have an adverse impact on local communities, however, which should be taken into account before a final decision is reached.  The Minister made it clear that his final decision will also take account of the safety needs of local communities, the ongoing improvement of the service to the public and the concerns of individual staff members.</P><Col N="1292"/>
        <P>I wish to make a number of other points which I hope will be of assistance.  Regardless of the option selected, there is likely to be need for construction work to be carried out.  In their current state, neither MRSC can properly accommodate the requirements of a modern, integrated national SAR function and prepare for the future without considerable building modifications being made.  As both existing sites are co-located with earth mats, the amount of room available for building is limited.  At Malin Head, this could entail a new building along the roadway and the demolition of existing structures.  At Valentia, it is likely to involve an extension to the operations room out over and beneath the current car park, installation of new working positions within the operations room, new offices, recabling of the building, the relocation of existing equipment and refurbishment and extension of the equipment room.</P>
        <P>I am also aware that there have been ongoing concerns in ensuring power and communications resilience at both Malin Head and Valentia.  This point has been the subject of much debate and criticism.  I understand the ESB and Eircom have been requested to give an indication of what would be required to remedy any problems.  However, a survey report within the Irish Coast Guard indicated that there were significant differences in the electrical supply events recorded by the uninterrupted power supply, UPS, systems.  The UPS automatically switches to battery back-up power when it detects a change in the normal supply where high or low-voltage tolerances are exceeded.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coast Guard operates the same UPS product at all MRCC-MRSCs and at the automatic identification system main server room located in Blanchardstown, Dublin.  In the period during which the UPS system was installed at all these locations, there were 119 unaccounted for events at Valentia over 16 months.  This compares with 14 events at the MRCC in Dublin over 18 months.  A similar significant variation was recorded for Malin Head.  Back-up generators are available at both locations but it is not considered desirable that sensitive equipment and a resilient communications structure should be reliant on and exposed to such fluctuations.  As already stated, this information has been passed to the ESB which has been asked to comment on this situation and propose a solution for both Valentia and Malin Head.  There is a particular need to do so in Kerry where there is exposure to sustained power interruption on the single-line supply from Killorglin.</P>
        <P>The Valentia MRSC has suffered three known major communications faults, affecting multiple or all circuits between the MRSC and radio sites, since 1 November 2006.  These outages occurred on 15 November 2006, 8 and 9 February 2007 and 2 December 2007.  The most recent is attributed to faulty Eircom equipment within the Valentia MRSC.  The February 2007 incident was the result <Col N="1293"/>of an optical fibre being dug up Caherciveen.  The MRCC in Dublin also suffered one such Eircom interruption in December 2007 owing to a combination of planned upgrade works and a fault occurring on a protected ring where additional circuits not tagged as relating to the Coast Guard were impacted upon.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coast Guard requires point-to-point, hard-wired communications with its masts.  As a result, simple access to the network is not sufficient and duplicate access to the Eircom ring main is required.  Again, Eircom has been asked to draw up proposals to improve resilience at both Malin Head and Valentia.</P>
        <P>Recent decisions have been taken to prepare the Irish Coast Guard for future development and optimal configuration of co-ordination centres while ensuring the detailed technical knowledge and experience of watch officers is retained and fully utilised.  I reiterate on behalf of the Minister that officers will not be forced to move or lose their jobs.  Any transition arrangements for new centres will be introduced on a phased basis and will be negotiated with staff to ensure there is no loss of expertise.</P>
        <P>With regard to the east coast location, Irish Coast Guard senior operational staff must have daily access to MRCC facilities to deal with incidents and intervention.  This is vital in times of major crises and was evidenced last week when senior operational staff of the Irish Coast Guard intervened and exercised powers of intervention under the Sea Pollution Act 1991 during the <i>MV Horncliff</i> and <i>MV Acacia</i> incidents.  Both incidents had the potential to inflict major environmental damage on our coastline.  The Minister has arranged that the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the Irish Coast Guard and the submission to him on which recent decisions were based be published on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.transport.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>My final comments relate to the fact that the restructuring of the Irish Coast Guard currently in train is aimed at improving the overall quality and efficiency of a key public service.  Members will be aware that on budget day, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance asked that each Department undertake an efficiency review of expenditure.  These reviews are required specifically to consider possible inefficiencies due to the multiplicity of boards and agencies, the need for better sharing of certain services and efficiencies in management, travel and consumables in general.  The Department of Transport is in the process of evaluating options and this includes examining the similarities in service provision in the Department and its agencies, particularly in the area of safety, to consider whether there are duplicating or overlapping functions which could be more efficiently delivered through the amalgamation, abolition or reduction in the number of bodies or the pooling of services.  The position of Coast Guard services is being considered in that context and with the benefit of the many comments that <Col N="1294"/>the Minister has received since the restructuring proposal was announced.  The Minister has met both Government and Opposition representatives and members of the local community to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister has specifically asked me to assure the House that all the views expressed and made this afternoon will be taken into account before a west coast location is determined.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House in the absence of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  The Minister of State has, with words clothed in reason&rsquo;s garb, endeavoured to make the worse appear the better reason.  It is effectively a hatchet job for Valentia and Malin, with which no Senator on either side of the House accepts or agrees.</P>
        <P>We should be promoting employment and social inclusion in these peripheral areas, an idea to which we would all subscribe.  The removal of jobs from these areas to a proposed site 20 miles or so from Dublin makes a nonsense of Government decentralisation policy.  I am informed that assistant secretary John Fearon&rsquo;s report of October last was based on much out-of-date information and has been rebutted by the Inishowen Development Partnership, IDP, response.  Facts referred to in the IDP rebuttal regarding power supply and communications have been confirmed by ESB Networks and the Letterkenny Institute of Technology report.  Some Senators opposite are more familiar with that and no doubt they will elaborate on it.</P>
        <P>The republic&rsquo;s smallest area of sole responsibility is the Irish Sea and not the north west or south west coasts, where the reductions in staffing are being considered.  The report in the <i>Oban Times</i> shows the reality of closing MRCCs and the cost in human lives lost at sea.  The report of the British select committee reinforces this view.  It also highlights the problem of accessing a supply of adequately trained staff.</P>
        <P>The suggestion from Inishowen Development Partnership is that operational control should be maintained at Valentia and Malin Head, where years of experience support existing services and where there is a pool of qualified applicants available from the fishing industry for any staff positions that may be required in either of the two stations.  That is very much the view from Valentia and the south west also.</P><Col N="1295"/>
        <P>Headquarters, stores, logistics, administration and training staff and facilities could be concentrated in an area north of Dublin, either Drogheda or the proposed new port facility at Bremore.  A stand-by radio and MRCC facility could be included in this headquarters for training and emergency services.  This should satisfy the Minister while still maintaining the core of excellence inherent in Valentia and Malin.</P>
        <P>The total downgrade of Valentia and Malin could be described as decentralisation in reverse.  Instead of planning to shut down these centres the Government should support proposals to upgrade the facilities at both, and the centres re-equipped and left in place.  This was recommended by the Deloitte &amp; Touche report we have been informed so much about.</P>
        <P>Valentia and Malin Coast Guard stations have done a wonderful and sterling job in the service of the State as MRCCs where highly-skilled and dedicated staff deal with serious marine incidents.  They have done so successfully over a long period.  The arguments for moving the centres away from the coasts and into an urban location do not stand up.  There is nothing substandard about the infrastructure in either location and there are no valid arguments based on electrical supply, broadband or cost effectiveness.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept what another Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, agreed in signing off on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report recommendations to upgrade the two stations.  Centralising the operations of Valentia and Malin to an urban location would be a total reversal of everything that this Government has been preaching about supporting peripheral areas.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would also be a reversal of what all Senators, on both sides of the House, subscribe to.  It flies in the face of common sense to remove such highly-trained and skilled people from these locations when they are already working extremely effectively and harmoniously.  Valentia and Malin Coast Guard stations have a long service record and are extremely busy.  They have dealt very effectively with many serious marine incidents over a long period.</P>
        <P>It is good to see the Spanish ambassador in the Gallery because he knows full well the value of the Spanish-speaking proficiency of the people in these stations when they deal with so many Spanish trawlers and other Spanish personnel in sea incidents off our coast.  I should also refer to Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue, the recently retired chairman of ESB.  He refuted very well the argument and gave his views strongly in favour of Valentia and Malin in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He disputed very much the Irish Coast Guard&rsquo;s case for their total downgrade.</P><Col N="1296"/>
        <P>I am reliably informed by seafarers and people who sail off the south, west and north coasts of our country that they have tremendous confidence in the Valentia and Malin rescue centres.  My learned colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, stated it is not just about technology or radar screens but about all of the many years of experience.  It is about people who know the size of the swell two days after the waves have gone and who know the sounds of Dursey, Sceilig Mhich&iacute;l and Sceilig Bheag and the Blaskets, and can tell one from the other.</P>

It will become clear that we unanimously consider these closures to be totally unacceptable.  We look forward to hearing from all our colleagues and I know from chatting informally with everyone here that we are of the one view.</P>
        <P>There are sound building structures already in place, along with excellent personnel.  The upgrading which might be required could be done while retaining both stations.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole has already pointed out, it is about more than technology and data.  I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s position and I will not say he was sent in here to do a hatchet job.  He was sent in here and supplied with the information.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies.  Valentia Island marine rescue centre is the only one in Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales or France that can communicate with Spanish-speaking sailors when their vessels are in difficulty.  That is why the Ambassador is in the House today.</P>
        <P>The 2002 Deloitte &amp; Touche report made several recommendations for the new locations for marine rescue centres.  The Minister responsible at the time, Deputy Dermot Ahern, agreed to expand Malin and Valentia.  That report, recommendation and order were not acted upon for many years until a new Minister came into office.  We are being told that the Valentia Island centre is not being closed.  It is being wound down through natural wastage as men retire.  Eventually only the noise of machines will be heard there.  The staff will be centralised in urban locations on the east and west coasts.</P>
        <P>The 16 page report issued last year to close the centres is full of lies and deception.  The first lie is: &ldquo;At present about half of the staff do not live in either home MRSC county.&rdquo;  There are 14 staff in Valentia, 11 of whom live in County Kerry.  The second lie is: &ldquo;New staff require access to schools, shopping and leisure facilities and employment for partners.&rdquo;  Of the 11 members of staff who live in County Kerry, ten of their spouses are in employment.  Col&aacute;iste na Sceilige, the secondary school in Cahirciveen, sends 80% of its leaving certificate class to third level education.  One cannot get better facilities.</P>
        <P>The third lie concerns the electricity supply to which my colleague, Senator Coghlan referred.  Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue, former head of ESB, said that outages on the island should be no more nor less than in any other part of the country.  His mother lives on Valentia Island and he is from the island.</P>

	<P>Inside this document is another report from the Irish Coast Guard.  If it is anything like a previous report in which the Coast Guard service supplied information we can be sure it will not be very accurate.  In the report it is submitting to the Minister it has dropped the issue of the location of staff but continues to discuss infrastructure.  Transmission Links Ireland, which has upgraded all the infrastructure for the electricity service in County Kerry, wrote a letter on 21 February 2008 refuting the assertion that electricity supply networks in the area are inadequate.  We will investigate the statements of the Irish Coast Guard.  These facts will go to south Kerry and Tadhg O&rsquo;Donoghue who will respond to the contents of this report.</P>
        <P>Since the 2002 Deloitte &amp; Touche report was published 99% of the infrastructure for electricity in south Kerry has been upgraded and is better than it was at the time of the report.  The gas thing about the report is that it contains the statement: <Col N="1298"/>&ldquo;with modern equipment it would be possible to run the marine rescue coordination centre from one location anywhere in the country&rdquo;.  I know Valentia is an island and Malin is a long a way from Dublin but they are &ldquo;anywhere in the country&rdquo;.  The report, however, states that the centre cannot be located in Valentia or Malin.</P>
        <P>The fourth lie concerns the communications infrastructure.  Tim Brosnan of Eircom said on 6 November 2007 that because of Eircom&rsquo;s alternative routing policy there is durability within the system for the location in Valentia.  There is, however, a gap &mdash; the last four miles which are badly served.  Four dishes, two in Valentia and two at the Eircom station in Cahirciveen, could bridge that gap at a cost of &euro;28,000.  Senior management in the Irish Coast Guard can report that Valentia is not up to standard because of that gap.  They have left a gap in the system so that they can recommend closing Valentia in the report.  They are putting lives at risk when it would take only &euro;28,000 to fix.  It is a dereliction of their duty not to have bridged the gap knowing it is there.</P>
        <P>Fexco is a world-class service centre for the likes of Western Union and other multinational companies that rely on communication.  It employs more than 100 in Cahirciveen, relying on resilient broadband.  The man in charge of its communication systems told me that the company would not have located there if it did not believe in the system.  It  does believe in the system and is going to expand, yet there is talk of closure.</P>
        <P>The fifth lie states that: &ldquo;locating the centres at either Valentia or Malin would require major construction work.&rdquo;  That is in the information given to the Minister of State today.  I cannot speak about Malin but I have been inside the control room of Valentia Island Coast Guard station.  It is huge.  When the Dublin centre operated out of Valentia owing to reconstruction work in Dublin, it was able to run the entire east and west coast from that room, yet now the Coast Guard says that is not possible and the centre must be expanded.  It does not need expansion because the big consoles will be taken out and touch screens installed, yet they continue reporting that the building facilities in Valentia are not up to standard.</P>
        <P>If Valentia and Malin stations close, the service will lose experienced staff.  Dublin deals with most of the Coast Guard traffic.  What lay people call mayday distress calls, the Coast Guard calls urgency broadcasts.  There were 258 mayday calls last year of which Malin dealt with 41, Dublin 52 and Valentia 165.  Those guys will be put out to grass.  The Coast Guard will hire new, young, fresh-faced fellows with no experience.  They will not be able to speak Spanish.</P>
        <P>When coastguard stations in the United Kingdom were closed between 1998 and 2002, deaths at sea increased by 28.1% because experienced staff were sent out to pasture.  Inexperi<Col N="1299"/>enced staff in Belfast caused a death in Lough Rinn because in the stress of an emergency they inputted the wrong co-ordinates and the helicopter arrived at the wrong place.  The loss of experienced staff will entail the loss of Spanish speakers in the Irish Coast Guard and marine rescue services and Spanish lives will be put at risk.</P>
        <P>When the staff in Valentia asked for Spanish tapes to improve their Spanish, senior management told them it was the responsibility of the captain of the ship to have an English speaker on board.  That is not much good to a Spanish trawler going down in high seas off the west coast.  The staff got their own tapes and can speak Spanish but not because of senior management in the Irish Coast Guard service.</P>
        <P>Senior management in the Irish Coast Guard supplied the information that has led to the threatened closure of Valentia and Malin.  They have lied about the number of staff living in County Kerry and the employment available for partners in the area.  They have lied about the electricity supply and the telecommunications within the system.  There is an agenda at senior management level at the heart of this report that threatens the closure of Valentia and Malin as marine rescue centres.  Those who supplied the false and misleading information are not public servants but are self-serving public officials.</P>

	<P>The two previous speakers, who also hail from County Kerry, have discussed much of the detail on this issue.  Consequently, I will make some broader points and will focus on some narrower ones thereafter.  The saddest thing about the congregation of Members for this debate, with the honourable exception of Senator Paschal Donohoe, is that it reflects all that is wrong with regional development in Ireland.  Whenever someone has a go at a particular locality in rural Ireland, the only Members who show up to discuss it are those from the affected county.  Attendance at this debate should reflect all counties in the west of Ireland.  This is what happens all the time and the west is being denuded because everyone is watching his or her own patch.</P>
        <P>I consider this proposal to be an absolute outrage against the west coast.  It constitutes yet another denuding of support, infrastructure and tradition from rural Ireland.  As I am not familiar with the detailed facts as put forward by the Irish Coast Guard, I will not engage in an exchange on them.  However, whatever the economic rights and wrongs of this proposal, it is wrong socially and in every other way.</P><Col N="1300"/>
        <P>I will tell a story.  On Easter week of 1916, two signatories of the proclamation sent two men to Valentia.  While I do not have time to go into details, they were sent down to break into Fitzgerald&rsquo;s radio centre between Cahirciveen and Valentia, to steal radio systems they could use to communicate with the German ship that was bringing rifles to Banna Strand.  The cultural and historical tradition extends back that far in that parish and is almost as old as radio.  The Minister of State must understand that it is not simply a matter of the number of jobs.</P>
        <P>I know both Malin and Valentia.  A lovely new school has been located on the north side of Malin on the way towards Malin Head, which will lose numbers as a result of this measure.  Every time one removes something from any small parish in the west, a ripple effect takes place throughout the community and everyone suffers in some way.  Moreover, this is of great cultural significance and the points made by the previous speakers were highly impactful.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am an offshore member of the RNLI and if I am sitting in Dursey Sound and wondering whether to stick my nose out into Kenmare Bay or to venture along the coast as far as Valentia, I would like to know that the person who speaking to me from Valentia is able to say what the swell is like, what kind of wind is blowing, whether there are many white tops in front of him or her or what is the story.  Alternatively, if I am offshore and wish to get into Portmagee around Bray Head, I want someone who knows every inch of the area to be able to tell me it is a bit rough today, a south westerly is blowing up and it is dangerous and difficult.  Anyone from any place from the south west to Malin who has ever suffered a night waiting for a lost boat to make contact and return home knows that the dependency on Malin and Valentia was an integral part of how we grew up.  We grew up listening to old ships&rsquo; radios and while matters obviously have advanced since then, in the old days everyone tuned into channel 16 and listened to the marine services.  These services are always present and know every inch of the region.  Although the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech made clear distinctions between the various aspects of the service, it is still part of us.</P>
        <P>Above all however, this is decentralisation turned on its head.  What is being done is completely wrong.  There is a Minister with responsibility for the west, namely, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  What is that Department doing?  All Members present have at some point fought for a small school, hospital, industry or whatever in their localities because they know that such facilities are the building blocks of a community.  Anything that is removed from such a community ultimately causes suffering for all.  Members do not wish to see such developments happening.  This is a bigger issue that pertains to regionalisation, decentralisation and saving the west.  It resembles the thinking <Col N="1301"/>underlying the opening of the Atlantic highway from Derry to Limerick and beyond and is similar to opening the western rail corridor.  It pertains to those issues and forms part and parcel of an interdependency of infrastructures and community in those areas.</P>
        <P>This development is happening before Members&rsquo; eyes.  Last year, half of the Members of the Oireachtas more or less mentally cheered when the salmon fisheries were closed.  While I know there were good reasons for decommissioning one third of the fishing fleet, if matters continue in this fashion there will be nothing left in the west.  It will be like turning out the lights on rural Ireland.  Every week another decision is made which takes more from that area.  Members should be sufficiently brave and responsible to acknowledge that it will cost more to invest in the west of Ireland and that there is inequality of investment in such regional areas.  What is happening in Malin and Valentia at present is a step backwards and I ask the Government to withdraw its position in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time with me and I agree with his comments.  The Government has embarked on a ridiculous policy by trying to close the Valentia and Malin Head marine rescue co-ordination centres.  When I first asked for a debate on this issue last October, a debate on Seagate, which was withdrawing from the north west, was taking place.  I stated that given the economic climate in a globalised economy, one can understand that if businesses pull out of an area, one cannot always blame the Government.  In this instance however, the Government can be blamed if it intends to withdraw services from area that deeply needs employment.  I refer to counties Kerry and Donegal, which have the highest unemployment rates in the State.  It is ridiculous that the Government has taken this position, which is not the position originally taken by it.</P>
        <P>While I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech today, a far better reply was delivered in 2003 when the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was asked a question on the closure of the Dublin centre and the transfer of responsibility to Valentia and Malin Head.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The decision to transfer the services [of the marine rescue co-ordination centre] from Dublin was taken on foot of a study of the coast guard . . . undertaken by independent consultants.  Reflecting advances in modern communications technologies, the consultants recommended that the coast guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present.  This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings [by keeping Valentia and <Col N="1302"/>Malin Head open], thus enabling other elements of the coast guard service to be developed, which in turn will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He continued by stating the objective of the Department was &ldquo;that the remaining two centres at Valentia and Malin [Head] will be developed to handle all emergencies around [the] coast, on inland waters, . . . mountain, cliff and cave rescue&rdquo;.  Significantly, he stated, &ldquo;communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past&rdquo; in this context.  He also added, &ldquo;Government policies on decentralisation from Dublin are . . . relevant to this decision&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>What has happened in the past five years since the then Minister made those remarks?  What has made the Government change its mind?  Nothing has happened in respect of the upgrading and transfer of the aforementioned services to those two areas.  I agree with the point made by Senator Coghlan when he stated that when one closes or fails to expand centres, people&rsquo;s lives are put at risk.  The British House of Commons Select Committee on Transport recently has blamed continuing high marine casualty deaths on the closure of marine rescue co-ordination centres.  Members should note this is not simply an issue of regional development but also is an issue of safety for those on our seas.</P>
        <P>I attended a public meeting on Malin Head, which was packed with standing room only.  The meeting heard from a range of marine interests, from search and recovery to people who worked within the Malin Head marine rescue co-ordination centre, as well as different people who worked in Coast Guard stations and people from the islands.  They are appalled at the Government&rsquo;s decision.  The Government needs to reverse its stated position on these stations.</P>
        <P>A Fianna F&aacute;il Senator referred to the lies in this report and we have the documentation.  The report presented to the Minister is not factual.  Regardless of this, the Minister has accepted lie after lie.  I am disappointed he is not present in the Chamber to take this matter.  It is time for him to come forward and say that he will continue to keep the commitment his predecessor gave in the D&aacute;il in 2003 to the residents of Malin Head and Valentia Island .</P>
        <P>The Government will say that this change will not result in any jobs being lost and that none of the staff will be forced to move from Valentia Island or Malin Head.  That may be true but when staff seek promotion, they will not be offered it unless they move to the new centres.  When members of staff retire their positions will not be replaced.  In effect, this decision will result in jobs being loss in Inishowen and Valentia.  That is unacceptable and I cannot stand for it.</P><Col N="1303"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister to echo the words spoken by the Leader of this House prior to Christmas when he asked for all-party consensus on this issue to oppose the decision by the Government to remove the Malin Head and Valentia marine co-ordination centres, a position echoed by the Ceann Comhairle in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister said that he will take on board the views of Members in this debate when he makes a decision.  I ask him to seriously take them on board and not merely use this debate as a paper exercise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not often we speak on an issue with one voice in terms of cross-party and cross-county support.  We are all saying the same thing.  These centres have been under attack by some body or group for many years.  I have fought left, right and centre in my corner for them for many years.   I would like to think that my intervention in the past helped ensure the outcome referred to in the earlier statements about the 2003-04 decision to not only maintain but upgrade the two operation centres at Malin Head and on Valentia Island.  It is terrible that another attack is being launched on two fundamental sections of our communities.  </P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the expansion of areas.  I was responsible for ensuring a major upgrade of the school in 2007, to which he referred, when it was concerned about being closed.  Major investment has been made in developing the pier and cr&egrave;che facilities in Malin Head.  Other Departments are also investing in Malin Head and I have been at the core of ensuring such investment.  I have also been at the core of ensuring that the station at Malin Head would not be closed during recent years.  We received a report which recommended that it, as well as the station on Valentia Island, should be upgraded.  My comments are based on my experience in regard to the station at Malin Head and in solidarity with the position being taken by those in the station on Valentia Island.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister of State to bring back the message to Government that if this service can be provided anywhere in the country, then it should be left where it is.  The stations on Valentia Island and at Malin Head can deliver this service.  I will go through some of the extensive detail at my disposal regarding the position of Malin Head in order to prove that the same untruths that were told about the station on Valentia Island were told about the station at Malin Head.  When I asked the people in the area surrounding Malin Head for a rebuttal of the report, they came together and put the information down on the paper.  We are not talking about an emotional argument.  This is not about emotions but about facts.  We do not want our area downgraded because factually, it can sustain what is required and the local community want to ensure this.</P>
        <P>It is nonsense to talk about the need for a second facility to be located close to a first <Col N="1304"/>facility.  If one were to travel out of Dublin between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., it would take two hours to travel from one side of the city to the other.  One could travel a fair distance from Malin Head in two hours.  If a situation is an emergency, a helicopter will be used and it does not matter where one is in that context.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said that should a decision be taken to move the service from the stations on Valentia Island and at Malin Head, the Department would examine the retention of the existing staff to operate radio watches from their existing stations.  I ask for no half measures.  The Government should leave what is well enough alone.  The only problem to date has been that the stations are run down, but that is not due to the people of Malin Head or the people on Valentia Island but because of the lack of central in-house investment promised more than five years ago and signed off by the then Minister.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, the argument of moving everything in this regard to Drogheda and seeking a west coast location is a nonsense.   Undoubtedly, many services can be decentralised to Drogheda, including parts of the marine section of the Department.  I speak on foot of information supplied to me by people who know the position a little better than I do.</P>
        <P>The idea of a new radio station and a marine rescue co-ordination centres, MRCC, in Drogheda is not supported by any realistic rationale.  A chart of VHF sites in my possession clearly shows that the Drogheda MRCC would be situated less than 80 miles from the Northern Ireland MRCC at Orlock Head.  The chart also indicates the restricted area of responsibility of the Irish Coast Guard in the Irish Sea.  Approximately 80% of the area is covered by the UK services under the existing agreements on marine rescue co-ordination.  Conversely, the Irish area of responsibility in the north west stands to be increased significantly due to recent changes in legislation, for example, marine pollution, etc.  The Republic&rsquo;s smallest area of sole responsibility is the Irish Sea, not the west coast where the reductions in staffing are being considered.  Any increase in oil exploration within Irish waters will be concentrated in the west and north west, namely, the areas closest to Malin Head.</P>
        <P>That is not to say there is not a function for a new station in Drogheda.  A headquarters stores, logistics, administration and training of staff could be operated from such a facility in Drogheda or at the new port at Bremore.  We are being told that this service can be run from anywhere, but that is anywhere except Valentia Island or Malin Head.</P>
        <P>I have a letter from the ESB.  I do not know what details were included in the Minister&rsquo;s report in terms of the dates to which he referred.  The letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our records show that there were four interruptions in electricity supply to the Coast <Col N="1305"/>Guard . . . in Malin Head in 2007.  Two of these faults were during storm conditions in January, there was planned interruption in April and a fault in November.  Excluding storm damage, this performance was better than the national average.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Since the completion of the Network Renewal Programme . . . and the installation of a medium voltage submarine cable between the Isle of Daogh and Lagg in 2005, the quality of the electricity supply in . . . Malin [Head] . . . had improved greatly.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In future years, ESB Networks expect the continuity of supply in Malin to be at the national average.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That letter was from Brian Hegarty, area manager Letterkenny, ESB Network Services.  Is he a liar?  I do not believe he is.  He is closest to the ground and I believe he knows the facts.</P>
        <P>The same type of back-up service exists in terms of broadband infrastructure.  I would like to go into the detail of that, but suffice to say that one of the greatest clouds that hung over our area was the demise of the Fruit of the Loom operation.  However, arising from that a task force was set up and it identified telemarketing and call-centre operations as a possible source of job opportunities.  Much work was put into that and many groups came together and a substantial rollout of broadband infrastructure has occurred, even in the recent past.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest problems we face is that the Department considers this to be a 26-county Ireland with a massive type of Berlin Wall surrounding the rest of the country.  Fortunately, normal people like myself live in the north east and we interact on a 32-country island basis.  If I were employed in Malin Head and lived in Derry, I would challenge some Members, such as Senator Doherty, to travel to Malin Head in the time I could travel there from Derry.  I would say that I would arrive 30 or 40 minutes ahead of his arrival from where he is based.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are being accused of not living within the county.  Someone needs to examine the geography of the region.  Malin Head is 40 minutes from the fourth largest centre on the island of Ireland.  We have pointed out to the Minister and Mr. Fearon that Malin Head is close to institutes of technology in Letterkenny and Derry and universities in Derry, Limavaddy and Coleraine.  It is an hour and half from Belfast.  Regardless of whether people are from the area or travelling to it, they have access to good educational qualifications and have great potential, but that is not recognised because the facilities are across the Border.  We do not recognise borders in our area; we work in conjunction with the facilities in place.  There are fundamental reasons people might live in Derry but work in Donegal.</P>
      
        <P>The main point I want to put forward is that the arguments concerning the ESB supply, broad<Col N="1306"/>band deficiency and that people in the area will not take up jobs are not factual.  We have had major infrastructural changes in recent years.  A decommissioning process will take young people away from the biggest whitefish fleet in the country which is based in Greencastle, very close to Malin Head.  These people will need new employment opportunities.  The Department has changed the regulations governing the qualifications for working in these centres.  These people will be able to work there.  Everyone in my area is disgusted with being undermined by a process of decentralisation.  How can we sell the idea of decentralisation to Buncrana when the Government says that Inishowen is not the place to go?  This is head about tail stuff and it needs to be reversed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of State.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House for organising this debate.  There have been some fine fiery debates in this House during this term and I am sure this debate will not be any different.</P>
        <P>This issue is of the utmost importance for the people of Valentia Island and Malin Head.  I commend the manner in which people in both areas have campaigned with honesty and dignity.  They have succeeded in bringing this issue to national prominence.  I congratulate them on their efforts and I assure them of the Labour Party&rsquo;s ongoing support for them in their campaigns.</P>
        <P>I express my complete opposition to any proposal to close these stations under the Government&rsquo;s restructuring plan for the Irish Coast Guard.  I suggest it is not the Coast Guard stations that need restructuring but rather the Government because of its plain lack of support for rural Ireland.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to reverse immediately the Government&rsquo;s plan to shut down transmissions from these maritime coastal stations and to give a clear and unambiguous guarantee that Valentia in County Kerry and Malin Head in County Donegal will continue to operate as Coast Guard radio stations, that no jobs will be lost and that no employees will be redeployed elsewhere.</P>
        <P>This matter confirms my long-held belief that this Government has lost touch with rural Ireland.  The Minister&rsquo;s plan to close these world-renowned stations and build a new station in a yet to be announced location makes no sense.  There is no financial or geographic reason for it and safety at sea will not be enhanced if the plan goes ahead.  The idea goes against the 2002 consultants&rsquo; report which put forward the option of upgrading both Valentia and Malin Head stations.  It seems the Minister is intent on carrying on his tradition of going headlong into a battle without first properly thinking through the feasibility of his Department&rsquo;s plan.  He would do well to take less notice of civil servants in Dublin <Col N="1307"/>and listen instead to party colleagues and others throughout the country, people who represent coastal and maritime constituencies such as mine &mdash; Cork South-West.</P>
        <P>Following the Shannon-Heathrow debacle, one would have thought the Minister would have learned a lesson but sadly this is not the case.  Lest we forget, this is the same Minister who invented the idea of electronic voting, who fought tooth and nail with fishermen and endeavoured to destroy the fishing industry in this country, who contemplated the reintroduction of third level college fees, who also tried to take hundreds of thousands of learner drivers off the road over one bank holiday weekend without providing adequate driving test places.  Now he wants to endanger the lives and livelihoods of another 40 families in some of the most rural places in the country.  It strikes me that the Minister is like a kamikaze pilot intent on flying into something and blowing it up.</P>
        <P>Coming from a coastal constituency like Cork South-West, I am especially concerned about Valentia.  I am acutely aware of the importance of this radio station to coastal and fishing communities all around the south-west coast.  I think of the fishing communities in Castletownbere, Union Hall, Baltimore, Kinsale and so on.  Valentia&rsquo;s proud history as an important centre of communications has been sustained since 1858 when the first messages were sent across the Atlantic.</P>
        <P>The Valentia Coast Guard station is the busiest in the country when it comes to dealing with serious marine incidents and its staff are highly skilled.  One does not just make a decision to end all this, especially when one considers the Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants&rsquo; report, paid for by taxpayers, which recommended the complete opposite of what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
        <P>I refer to what a Fianna F&aacute;il county councillor in County Kerry, Paul O&rsquo;Donoghue, said &mdash; he happens to be the brother of the Ceann Comhairle: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t close these facilities, you enhance them.&rdquo;  The Minister would do very well to listen to his party colleagues in Kerry.  More stations of this calibre are needed rather than closure and downgrading.</P>
        <P>The UK coastguard service has 19 stations and covers almost 18,000 km of coastline, leaving about 900 km of coastline per station.  If the Minister&rsquo;s plan goes ahead, the Irish Coast Guard will be downgraded to two stations and each station will cover a coastline of 3,700 km.  This is a frightening statistic and it cannot be allowed to happen.  At its most basic, this plan has a major flaw and it highlights the Government&rsquo;s complete hypocrisy regarding its regional development policy.  In the era of decentralisation the Minister is going against the grain and centralising these facilities.  This will have significant consequences not only for the 35 to 40 jobs at stake but also for entire coastal communities.  The removal of these jobs is <Col N="1308"/>a vote of no confidence in the south west and north west.  It is equivalent to pulling the rug out from under efforts to create jobs in rural Ireland.  It is another example, as if one were needed, that this Government is bowing to the advice of civil servants and ignoring the needs of rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I commented earlier on the dignity and honesty of those in these two communities who are campaigning to stop these closures, and it is a pity the same could not be said about the Minister, with his undisclosed reports, the mistruths being bandied about and the eloquent points made about the same inaccuracies by Senators on the Government side.  Members have been informed about the poor electricity supply, the lack of technology, reduced access to universities and no shops for the staff.  This is all nonsense.  It is unbelievable that the same people who are listening to this advice are the same people who have been in Government for the past 11 years.</P>
        <P>I am not for a moment taking from the genuine and sincere remarks made by Senators on the Government side but another point needs to be made about the dual role of Government party Members in both Houses who serve as Opposition and Government at the same time.  My colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, spoke in the other House during the Private Members&rsquo; motion on agency workers:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will no longer tolerate Deputies [and Senators] who are all things to all people in their constituencies but do not express the views of [their constituents] when they get an opportunity to make decisions on important matters in the [House] ... We do not want any nice token speeches from members of this Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We want action.  It is not good enough for these people to go to a constituency or head out to the plinth and say one thing while their voting record proves they towed the party line.  The late Deputy Jim Kemmy spoke to a Fianna F&aacute;il Limerick Deputy about an issue of significant importance to Limerick.  The same Deputy went on to become promoted in many Governments since that time.  He accused him of being Mighty Mouse in Limerick and a church mouse in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>In the 11 years of this Government we have seen many policies which have denigrated rural Ireland.  The rural creameries and the post offices are all gone.  The Government, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, is now trying to exterminate the rural pharmacies and shut them down as well.  To add a sense of irony, a Government party Senator appeared on &ldquo;The Week In Politics&rdquo; recently and made a point which I had made in this House when this decision was announced.  It was that 20 jobs in rural Ireland was the equivalent of 2,000 jobs in Dublin.  If that logic were to be applied, it would be equal to a loss of about 22,000 jobs for the Dublin area, which is a frightening statistic.  However, no one is batting an eyelid.</P><Col N="1309"/>
        <P>Things have gone from bad to worse in the area of employment.  According to information available to me from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the total number of unemployed in my area between the last Friday of 2004 and the last Friday of January 2008, has risen by 228 people.  This would also be representative of other areas.  I was unable to obtain figures for my town because the social welfare office in Dunmanway has been shut down by this Government.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment with the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and I have tabled several questions to the Minister, Deputy Cullen.  Trying to get information is like trying to get blood out of a turnip.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my three questions for the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  Can he give Members a clear and unambiguous guarantee that Valentia in County Kerry and Malin Head in County Donegal will continue to operate as Coast Guard radio stations?  Can he guarantee Members that no jobs will be lost and can he also guarantee the House that no employees will be deployed elsewhere?  My party fully supports the campaign to save these marine radio stations and we ask the Minister to consider rural Ireland and the coastal communities who are at the pin of their collars and fighting an uphill battle for survival.  We ask the Minister to consider the employees and their families and we ask him to make a stand against the anti-rural bias so clearly evident in so many Government decisions.  There is cross-party agreement in this House for the points I have just made.  Every Senator, Government and Opposition, is singing from the same hymn sheet.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, would do very well to listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to read from a letter I received from the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in recent weeks concerning the Malin Head and Valentia marine rescue co-ordination sub-centres.  I wrote to the Minister impressing upon him the urgency to review the impending decision in light of recommendations made by Department of Transport officials.  He stated in his reply:</P>
        <P LI="1">My ambition is to put in place a service which will meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The communications system is the backbone infrastructure on which Coast Guard operations depend.  It is essential that it is of high quality, efficient, effective and that it provides value for money.  I am concerned at the state of the present equipment and have confirmed that a &euro;2 million investment in essential equipment should proceed without any further delay.  I have also confirmed that this equipment should be sufficient to operate two fully manned Co-Ordination centres.  I have also confirmed that locating one on the east coast and one on the west coast is the preferred <Col N="1310"/>option and that the east coast centre should be co-located with the HQ.  These decisions were made against the background of a study completed by Deloitte and Touche in 2002.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following that study I understand a decision was taken by the then Minister not to proceed on the basis of the recommendations in the study.  However, I understand that in October 2007 the assistant secretary in the Department issued his report which was based on much out of date information which has been rebutted by the Inishowen Development Partnership.  In its response to the assistant secretary&rsquo;s recommendations it referred to facts regarding the electricity supply to Inishowen, the broadband service and some socio-economic issues.  I refer to a letter sent to the Inishowen Development Partnership from the area manager of the Electricity Supply Board in Donegal, which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our records show that there were four interruptions in electricity supply to the Coast Guard Station in Malin Head in 2007.  Two of these faults were during storm conditions in January, there was a planned interruption in April and a fault in November.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The most important line in the letter was as follows: &ldquo;Excluding storm damage, this performance was better than the national average&rdquo;.  This would suggest that the references in the assistant secretary&rsquo;s report to out of date ESB equipment is not true.  I would like the matter to be reviewed and for us to receive a response.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney covered the issue of broadband.  Broadband is readily available within 500 m of the Coast Guard station.  Broadband is also readily available on a radial broadband programme from Limavady, which is just across the sea in the North of Ireland.  Broadband is not an issue and electricity supply is not an issue.  The socio-economic issues referred to in the report that went to the Minister and on which this decision is based, must be disregarded.  The findings of that report must also be disregarded.</P>
        <P>The idea of a new station in Drogheda is not supported by any rational argument.  The chart of VHF sites clearly shows that the Drogheda station would be sited less than 80 miles from the Northern Ireland station at Orlock Head.  The chart also indicates the restricted area of responsibility of the Irish Coast Guard in the Irish Sea.  Approximately 80% of this area is covered by the UK services under existing agreements on marine rescue co-ordination.  This means that a station on the east coast would not cover the total sea area, whereas on the west coast and in the northern area the next port of call is Iceland or America.  There is a vast geographical area that is not covered, whereas the east coast has the coverage from the UK authorities working in conjunction with the services here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Inishowen Development Partnership, the local partnership in Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s area in <Col N="1311"/>the peninsula of Inishowen, is fighting on the ground to retain the services at Malin Head.  The partnership outlines that Malin Head and Valentia have years of experience of supporting existing services and have a pool of qualified applicants readily available from the fishing industry if the need arises in those Coast Guard stations.  Headquarters, stores, logistics, administration and training of staff could be concentrated in a facility in Drogheda as proposed.  However, the Malin Head and Valentia facilities should remain.  We are dealing with geographically dispersed areas, a fishing fleet and a tourism sector.  We are talking about pleasure craft coming into areas like Killybegs and the fishing areas around the Donegal offshore islands.  As pleasure craft use those facilities on a regular basis, it is essential to have cover in those areas.</P>
        <P>As late as this week the Malin Head station assisted in the rescue of two lifeboat men who were winched to safety on Sunday morning from the sea approximately 600 m from Bundoran.  That rescue was co-ordinated by the Malin Head Coast Guard.  I am glad to acknowledge that it was a successful rescue.  Such rescues are vital for the people who live in the west and north west.  The Malin Head Coast Guard facility is located in an ideal environment to work in close co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland.  I strongly agree with all Senators from both sides of the House that the Minister should revisit the proposed decision regarding this matter.  The recommendations of an assistant secretary may be well meant coming from the viewpoint from the 2002 report.  However, in my view and the view of the local development association in Inishowen and the local community they are based on out of date information, which simply does not stand up.</P>
        <P>The Inishowen Development Partnership&rsquo;s comments are primarily based on information relating to Malin Head.  However, common ground exists between the Malin Head and Valentia stations, as they are both fishing areas with a large number of fishermen and considerable activity at sea.  The report by the assistant secretary appears to be based on out of date information regarding the electricity supply, communications infrastructure and socio-economic shortcomings of the area.  The assistant secretary&rsquo;s report, which appears to be informing the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, should be reviewed.  The Minister should consider the retention of the stations at Valentia and Malin Head.  If there is a need to have a headquarters in Drogheda, so be it.  Let us have the headquarters in Drogheda or in a location close by as proposed.  However, the services should be retained in Donegal and Kerry.  The political viewpoint coming from today&rsquo;s debate should inform the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>I was glad to see in the last line of the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, <Col N="1312"/>that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will take into account all the views expressed by Senators here today.  I call on the Minister to do that.  He should  ensure these services are retained in order that communities in the west, including the north-west, can rest assured that the current service provision will remain.  The Government&rsquo;s regionalisation policy should be maintained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my party&rsquo;s support for the objectives outlined by previous speakers, including regionalisation and balanced regional growth.  It is ironic that I am speaking on this matter now because the first opportunity I had to address the House was to discuss the withdrawal of services at Shannon Airport.  I now find myself talking about something that has all the hallmarks of the Shannon issue.  On the one hand, we have the Government&rsquo;s stated objective of the need to deliver balanced regional development, which is laid out in the national development plan and all Government statements on this issue.  On the other hand, however, we clearly see that the objective is not being delivered.  If balanced regional development is important, surely it is most important for smaller communities that are dependent on public sector enterprise and employment.  This is clearly so in the case of the two communities under discussion.  </P>
        <P>I have been struck by the number of knowledgeable people, including maritime safety experts and local representatives, who have provided information on the superb role these institutions have provided in protecting seafarers over the years.  For that reason alone it is evident that both Coast Guard stations need to be kept open.  The political point must be emphasised in this respect.  Senators are correct in saying there is cross-party agreement on the matter but the responsibility for this decision sits squarely on the Government side of the House.  We are all agreed on the points that have been made.  I was struck by the forensic analysis offered by the three Government Senators and the clear passion that drove their arguments but the Opposition is not in a position to make a decision on the matter &mdash; that is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility.  Those privileged to be elected or appointed to this House on the Government side, and who can take credit for many wonderful things that have been delivered in their constituencies, have a clear responsibility to reverse this decision.  In other debates, I have often heard references to the mystical power of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, and I am sure the Green Party&rsquo;s parliamentary party meetings and those of the other party in Government are no less mystic or powerful.  However, that power is clearly lacking when it is needed to reverse a decision upon which vulnerable communities depend.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the poised and poetic contribution made by Senator Daly in which his passion <Col N="1313"/>was evident.  He talked about the lies that were being produced by a semi-State body, which is very strong language to use.  He said that organisation was lying in the evidence it was producing.  If that is true, and the Senator appeared to produce evidence to back up his assertions, what makes it even more striking is that a Minister is willing to act on evidence that every Opposition speaker has comprehensively rebutted.  What does that say about the quality of decision making in Cabinet on issues such as this?  What does it say about the quality of decision making by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey?</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan provided a strong analysis and a rebuttal of all the Government side&rsquo;s points.  That was compounded by the various points that have been made so far in this debate.  If the privilege of serving in Government is confined to the other side of the House, the responsibility lies with that side also.  I will be unflinching in pointing out that while cross-party opinion is valuable and welcome in dealing with local community issues, the responsibility for dealing with them lies with the Government side and particularly the Senators who have made those points.  If they are going to claim credit for doing good work in their constituencies, they must also carry the can for things that are not going so well and about which those in the community feel strongly.</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to repeat what others have said, I want to draw attention to two of the points that have been made so far.  I have spent some time trying to understand this issue and have spoken to people about it in order that I could make a strong contribution.  The first point concerns the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks about the quality of service provided by Eircom.  He offered that as a rationale for decisions made concerning the two Coast Guard stations but one cannot blame those institutions for Eircom&rsquo;s inability to supply broadband and the telecommunications infrastructure they need.  It seems perverse to say that just because Eircom and other bodies cannot provide the services needed by these Coast Guard stations, we will blame those centres for it and shut them down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second point, which was strongly made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, concerns the value of experience in these matters.  Senators have referred to data from the United Kingdom about the ability to save lives being dependent on the number of centres and their relationship to the areas covered.  That point seems to be self-evident but why is it not clear to the Minister who is making this decision?  Why should our heritage, local expertise, ability to understand local conditions and the provision of safe navigation be thrown to the wind by a decision to close these Coast Guard stations?  Expert opinion on both sides of the House has strongly rebutted this decision, which begs the question as to why this is happening?  How can one reverse the clear recommendations of a 2002 consultant&rsquo;s report which was supported by taxpayers&rsquo; money?  The reason is money.  In <Col N="1314"/>recent months, the House has debated cutbacks in the HSE and other public services, but the common thread is money.  The obvious reason this is happening is that the Department of Transport is examining budgetary matters and must find ways of recouping the money it has wasted in other areas.  In doing so, however, it will neglect the value of local experience and heritage which other Senators have indicated so well.  That is a political decision but if one is going to accept responsibility for how well the economy is doing and the fine work of local representatives in their constituencies, one must also take action to reverse a bad policy-making decision which will have a negative impact on coastal communities and others reliant on Coast Guard services for safety at sea.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is rare to hear the House speak in one voice on such an issue, especially one that could be used for narrow party political purposes.  While some attempt has been made to remind the Government of its responsibilities in this area, it is fair to say all contributions have supported the retention of both Coast Guard stations.  That is how it should be because logic does not seem to have had a significant part in this decision.  We had the 2002 report and we had an agenda that was fostered elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; D&oacute;mhnaill referred to the last page of the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  I too note the references to the Department of Finance and the efficiency review that all Departments are now required to undertake.  I suspect this is a more likely rationale for what is being proposed and what certain people in the Department would like to happen.  The decision to have one station where two existed previously represents not merely a reverse decentralisation proposal but a rationalisation.  It is proposed that people operating in Malin Head and Valentia Island be reallocated to a new location where property prices are higher than in either counties Donegal or Kerry and where the quality of life in terms of access to schools and trying to get from A to B is commensurately worse than in those areas.  This makes no sense in the context of a commitment to Government policies that seek to improve the quality of life of all citizens on this island.</P>
        <P>I caution against an accountant&rsquo;s approach in looking at the assets of a Department and how they should be deployed.  I have other reasons for asking that the Coast Guard stations at Valentia Island and Malin Head be maintained.  I represent an area that is coastal in its own right even though it is an urban area.  As a Munster man, I have an affinity with the Kerry operation.  Furthermore, my father is a Donegal man, a merchant sailor and an islander.  I like to think I have some affin<Col N="1315"/>ity for the maritime history that brought about the construction of lighthouses and Coast Guard stations throughout the State.  Their locations were chosen precisely according to where they needed to be located.  These were the locations where maritime traffic took place and where those with an expertise in maritime life lived and continue to live.  The proposal that this history, expertise and valuable maritime heritage can somehow be uprooted and relocated in a place like Drogheda is beyond any consideration of what we are as an island nation.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State and the departmental officials to commit to an active reconsideration of this decision.  It represents not merely a reversal of the 2002 Deloitte &amp; Touche report but a reversal of the active programme of investment in the Irish Coast Guard that took place from the start of the decade onwards.  When I had the privilege of representing the constituency of Cork South-Central, Oysterhaven was part of that constituency.  It has since moved to Cork South-West and a new, modern station has been constructed, although it does not perform exactly the same function as the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island.  Since then, however, other Coast Guard stations such as Crosshaven, which remains in Cork South-Central, have been kicked from pillar to post in their efforts to secure badly needed resources in terms of upgraded facilities and a new location.  I would prefer if ministerial and departmental efforts went into maintaining a programme of work which was proving successful.  As well as maintaining the Coast Guard stations in places such as Malin Head and Valentia Island, we must also upgrade the Irish Coast Guard service itself.  Dozens of Coast Guard stations require upgrading and to provide for that would represent an economic saving in the long term.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge our maritime heritage and the economic value of being an island nation and the associated dependence on the sea.  I spoke recently to the harbour master in Cork Harbour who explained to me a concept that he and other harbour masters are trying to promote, that of the highways of the seas.  He told me that fish are being landed by Spanish ships in Bantry, taken by container truck from Bantry to Rosslare, put on a ferry to Pembroke and put on the road to Southampton before finally being put on a ferry to France and driven to Spain.  One can only imagine the carbon footprint.  This is illustrative of the illogical nature of our transport and maritime policies.  It is indicative of a small mindedness and a failure to look to the future in attempting to solve the problems of the present.  Until we stop thinking and acting like this, I fear for future maritime policy.</P>
        <P>All this is before we come to the issues of rural development that have been the focus of debate today.  It is unquestionably important that facilities such as those at Malin Head and Valentia <Col N="1316"/>Island are maintained because there is a need for critical mass in the communities in which they are located.  They serve as focal points and places of employment and provide the expertise in terms of justifying all the other elements of social infrastructure in Malin Head and Valentia Island.  Our policies should encourage their maintenance and ensure the people who work there can remain in the communities.  The primary argument for their retention is economic.  In this instance, however, there is no evidence of a genuine maritime policy or if there is such a policy, it operates in an entirely illogical way.</P>
        <P>I return to the subject of rural development policy because it is an issue in which I am greatly interested as a consequence of my own family history.  Although I am from Cork, I am more familiar with Malin Head than with Valentia Island.  I know the landscape and the communities who live there.  In economic terms, as other speakers observed, a decision of this type has an immeasurably greater impact for the relevant communities than, for example, large-scale factory closures in urban areas.  As political representatives, and as a Government, we cannot and should not allow such decisions to be made.</P>
        <P>The only hope I have is that by the end of this debate, the single mindedness with which all the contributions have been articulated in this Chamber will be heeded and the necessary reversal of the decision taken.  If not, I fear it will be the start of a process where similarly stupid mistakes will be made.  If this House is to have any impact and relevance, I hope the voices that have been raised today will achieve that change.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate over the last couple of hours has raised many interesting and useful points.  I assure the House that I will pass the Senators&rsquo; extensive comments on the future of Malin Head and Valentia Island Coast Guard stations to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  It is significant that a debate on maritime safety is taking place at national level.  Regardless of our differences of opinion or emphasis about how best to proceed, we are seeking to improve the level of maritime safety around our coast.  The Minister has repeatedly indicated his intention to make improvements in this regard.  I understand that the proposed improvements range from new legislation to improvements in resources, training and equipment and the provision of new infrastructure.  It will be important to ensure that investment takes place in a context in which the greatest benefits can be achieved from the financial commitments which are made.</P>
        <P>It is universally agreed that investment in a new integrated communications system is necessary and desirable.  The need to develop modern, efficient and flexible co-ordination centres not only involves the provision of such a system, but <Col N="1317"/>also the provision of support accommodation such as training rooms and other infrastructure, which will have to be developed with security, functionality, sustainability, resilience and flexibility in mind.  We will have to pay attention to the potential future use of the building, in the context of local facilities and its strategic location.  It is essential that communications centres are established on the east and west coasts and equipped to a standard that enables the Coast Guard to meet future challenges.  Considerable building work will be required in the locations which are chosen.  I assure the House that the work that is undertaken will not have any negative impact on the volunteers who respond to emergencies at a local level.  The disruption to staff will be minimised regardless of where the new centres are located.  I emphasise the deep appreciation of the work done by those working in the centres.  The valuable role played by the staff of the rescue co-ordination centre, who plan and co-ordinate responses to marine emergencies 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, is also recognised.</P>
        <P>Comparisons have been made in correspondence to the international benchmarking of the watch officers.  Such officers in the UK are paid a maximum of &pound;18,500, compared with a maximum of &euro;51,000 for officers of the same grade in the Coast Guard.  While the UK has no marine rescue sub-centres, it has 18 marine rescue co-ordination centres, with approximately 450 staff, to cover an area of responsibility of 2 million sq. km.  The UK employs an average of 25 staff per centre, which is similar to this country&rsquo;s proposed two-centre model.  When an incident arises, the staff who listen for distress signals and monitor automatic alerting systems day and night are the first point of call.  They seek the relevant information from appropriate sources, assess and task the search and rescue resources needed to deal with the incident, ascertain a vessel&rsquo;s location, condition and intention and, if appropriate, designate and advise an on-scene co-ordinator.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport is determined that the emergency management expertise that has been developed will not be lost during the process of modernising the Coast Guard.  He is keen to ensure that it is retained for future generations.  I reiterate that at an individual level, no one will lose his or her job in this process.  Nobody will be forced to move to a new location.  This policy presents challenges, as it does in the decentralisation programme.  Such challenges are being discussed with the staff involved and will be overcome during the ongoing consultation with them.  The sequence of this change was outlined to staff at formal meetings which were held in Malin Head, Valentia Island and Dublin in November 2007.  The next step in the sequence will be to identify the west coast location and to ascertain the interest of staff in that location.  Staff have been advised that a clearer picture will emerge at that point.  Formal discussions with staff represen<Col N="1318"/>tatives on any changes that might arise will then commence.  The director of the Coast Guard has been in ongoing informal contact with the relevant union branch representative.  The director recently distributed copies of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report, which was originally made public in 2003, to all his staff.  Further formal meetings are scheduled for Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia Island in March and April.  A meeting was held recently for all Dublin-based Coast Guard maritime administration staff whose functions it is proposed to transfer.  The potential restructuring has also been discussed by the relevant committees on which organisations with an interest in search and rescue services are represented.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department of Transport have written to the ESB stating that the Coast Guard would like to improve the resilience of electricity power supply to Malin Head and Valentia Island Coast Guard stations to the standard of that supplied to the station at Leeson Lane in Dublin.  They cited their record of the number of times the uninterrupted power supply systems have automatically switched to battery back-up power on foot of supply threshold abnormalities in the incoming power supply.  They pointed out that these events occur at Malin Head and Valentia Island ten times more frequently than at the Coast Guard&rsquo;s uninterrupted power supply systems in the Dublin area.  They asked the ESB to provide costed proposals to achieve a similar standard of power supply at Malin Head and Valentia Island stations to that experienced in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Departmental officials have asked Eircom to produce specific proposals and cost comparisons for the enhancement of the communications services at Malin Head and Valentia Island.  It is hoped that Eircom can provide the capacity to ensure flexible and full operational coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s marine emergency management needs.  Consideration is also being given to the possibility of locating the communications centre at an alternative west coast location, such as Limerick or Shannon.  The cost, engineering and operational merits and limitations of such locations will be compared to those of the existing centres at Malin Head and Valentia Island before a decision is made.  Senators will appreciate that the examination by Department of Transport officials of the best possible option for the Coast Guard and those who are at risk at sea will focus on how the marine rescue emergency service can best be delivered efficiently and effectively.  In making the final decision, the Minister will consider a range of wider socioeconomic factors, as well as the case made by local representatives, local community groups and individuals.  The T&aacute;naiste announced on budget day that each Department is to undertake an efficiency review of expenditure.  The specific requirement to consider possible inefficiencies will have a bearing on the final decision in this instance.</P><Col N="1319"/>
        <P>It is important not to lose sight of the driving force behind this process, which is marine safety in general.  The Coast Guard needs to continue to improve its service to the public using available resources.  I emphasise that these decisions will be taken against a background of increased focus on and support for the maritime safety sector.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is that the Coast Guard and maritime administration will continue to be enhanced over the coming years.  The changes to be made will improve emergency response services throughout the country and help to reduce loss of life at sea, particularly for coastal communities.  A wide range of views has been expressed not only over the last couple of hours but also in representations the Minister has received from diverse sources.  They will be taken into account before final decisions are made.  One undeniable benefit from the discussion is a heightened awareness of marine safety.  This will lead to a reinforced commitment to ensure the provision of a world-class service of which we can be immensely proud.  The commitment by the Minister for Transport to develop a service that reflects Ireland&rsquo;s key position as a maritime nation on the western approaches to Europe will require significant commitment, focus and change in the years ahead.  I thank Senators for their contributions during this debate.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I welcome the Minister, although I do not welcome his rather flabby amendment.  Private Members&rsquo; time is one of the most important times in our parliamentary calendar.  We all take it very seriously, despite the fact due to the lateness of the day, very often it is not covered at all, and we try to raise serious issues.  I wanted to raise a number of issues, including cystic fibrosis, which was taken by Senator de B&uacute;rca.  She received a surprisingly comprehensive reply and I felt it would be wrong to expand on that.  I then wanted to raise the questions of extraordinary rendition <Col N="1320"/>and the Civil Partnership Bill 2004, which I had tabled.  However, I withdrew it on 13 February to show my revulsion at the attitude of the Government parties and the fact that they had so clearly dragged their heels on this important issue.  My Bill was before the House for approximately four years and nothing was done.  Had the Government acted at the time it would have been generous.  There might have been a streak of the prophetic and the visionary but all that has drained away.  We are getting reform by dribs and dribs in a mean spirited, mean minded, legalistic, cheese paring way and it is not good enough.  I will not tolerate the stuff we got from former Senator Mansergh in the past, attempting to dilute recognition of gay people&rsquo;s relationships to remove from them any sense of celebration, public endorsement and respect.  I will not take that any more and I will not be a second class citizen in this country in a manner which I am clearly defined.  I will not accept such dilution.</P>
        <P>The motion was tabled with great seriousness in light of the principles enunciated by Maire Geoghegan-Quinn in 1993 when, in a marvellous moment, she said clearly that, as a Minister, she would require clear, cogent and practical reasons to discriminate against an Irish citizen and in light of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement in 2006 that:</P>
        <P LI="2">Our sexual orientation is not an incidental attribute.  It is an essential part of who and what we are.  All citizens, regardless of sexual orientation, stand equal in the eyes of the law.  Sexual orientation cannot and must not be the basis of a second class citizenship.  Our laws have changed and will continue to change to reflect this principle.</P>
        <P>Would that his words were true but they were not and we are not equal.  We are being given, at best, second-class citizenship.  Those who oppose this say they are defending marriage but they are not.  They are, in a mean spirited way, defending what they see as their entitlement to superiority and they are doing it in precisely the same way those arrogant members of the former Protestant ascendancy in this country defended their privilege against Daniel O&rsquo;Connell who made the effective point that human liberty is not a finite resource that is diminished by being extended to other people but, instead, is enriched, enhanced and increased by being extended.</P>
        <P>The Government parties compliment themselves in their amendment on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  I had something to do with that when I had to drag the Government to Europe to get it.  It took four years before anything was done.  I recall the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, a decent man, being questioned about it and replying it was not a priority.  What was held to be a serious violation of fundamental human rights is not a priority when it affects gay people.  The amendment refers to the Unfair Dismissals Acts and dismissal being unfair on the ground of sexual orientation.  That is my sexual <Col N="1321"/>orientation clause, which was also inserted in the Refugee Act 1996.  The Government can claim credit only for parachuting in on the work that was done.  Astonishingly, reference is made to the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 to 2007, and the Equal Status Act 2000.  I cannot believe I am reading this.  These are the Acts from which gay people in a profession to which many of them are drawn are specifically excluded, despite the overwhelming evidence of the Ferns report.  We also know that because of the exemptions sought by and given to the churches, they have the right to dismiss people from their jobs as teachers on the ground of their sexual orientation.  For that reason, young people are subjected to homophobic bullying in the area of education.  In 80% of bullying cases a homophobic element is involved and in 80% teachers do nothing about it because this Act makes them afraid.  It is curious, therefore, to see it in the amendment.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Act is the first score for the Government and well done on that.  The European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated, including the issue of incompatibility certificates &mdash; Lydia Foy received the first of these the other day &mdash; but the Government was required to incorporate it.  Well done too on the Parental Leave Act, which represents a small step.  The Government amendment then notes that legislation to conform must be fully consistent with the relevant provisions of the Constitution.  However, the Constitution does not define marriage as between a man and a woman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The High Court settled that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Declan Costello pointed out in 1967 that the Constitution is an organic and developing document.  The United Nations defines &ldquo;family&rdquo; in a variety of ways that are not confined to this group.  With regard to the Constitution, the Law Reform Commission sought and obtained opinion to the effect that the only way constitutionality could be challenged would be through legislation which purported to give greater rights to the new institution than to marriage.  I am aware the Attorney General gave a different view but Attorneys General by their very nature have to be cautious in their advice.  It would be easy to address this situation and I invite the Minister to do so.  A simple tweak to the Civil Registration Act would introduce civil marriage.</P>
        <P>The tenth report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution was splendid.  The Colley report recommended civil marriage as the best option because it advised that the status of gay people would otherwise be further eroded.  The report of the former North Eastern Health Board showed the significant damage done to health and well-being by the lack of status for gay people, including increases in suicides and psychiatric illnesses.  The report stated these effects did not <Col N="1322"/>come from their sexuality but from the kind of attitudes expressed in opposing the measures we are discussing today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A lot of nonsense is spoken about the history of marriage as if it was a permanent institution, unlike the Constitution which is organic and developing.  It was not until 1754 that marriage was regulated in this country.  Until then, marriage was recognised on the basis of an exchange of vows.  By the 1920s, according to <i>Conscience &mdash; the News Journal of Catholic Opinion</i>, the definition of marriage in America was narrowed to forbid interracial marriages.  During the same period, the drawbacks to not being married increased.</P>
        <P>The number of cohabiting couples in the 2006 census was 121,000, or double the number of four years earlier.  This figure included more than 2,000 gay couples but that is a serious underestimate because gay people tend not to report this arrangement.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that I am not seeking religious marriage.  This is strictly a civil marriage issue.  However, the work of an internationally renowned historian and social commentator, the late Professor John Boswell, reveals that the early Christian church enacted rituals for the blessing of same sex unions.  That has been neatly obliterated from the history of western Christianity.</P>
        <P>In regard to the attitudes of Irish people, at least 41% are strongly in favour and a survey carried in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of 21 February 2006 revealed that 51% of the population favoured gay marriage or unions.</P>
        <P>Same sex marriage was introduced in the Netherlands under that country&rsquo;s marriage act of 2001, while in Belgium it was introduced in 2003.  Same sex marriage became legal in Canada on 20 July 2005.  That is interesting to Ireland because of the Zappone and Gilligan case.  In holy Catholic Spain, same sex marriage was introduced on 3 July 2005.  The High Court of Israel issued a ruling recognising same sex marriage on the basis of an action taken by people who had been married in Canada.  That is an interesting precedent for this country.  In the United States of America, Massachusetts has allowed full marriage equality since 18 November 2003.  One of the original sponsors of an amendment to ban gay marriage and legalised civil unions, Brian Lees, stated, &ldquo;gay marriage has begun and life has not changed for the citizens of the commonwealth&rdquo;.  It is therefore not the disaster people pretended it would be.  In Northern Ireland, civil partnership is allowed with ceremonies performed by marriage registrars.  As I noted earlier, there is more freedom for people like me in Paisley&rsquo;s Belfast then in Bertie&rsquo;s Dublin.  That is a significant reproach.</P>
        <P>People suffer from a range of disadvantages at present, including in the area of immigration.  People who in previous years had to leave this country formed relationships abroad, some of which were recognised, and they have now <Col N="1323"/>returned.  The last time I discussed this issue, I brought into the House five folders containing these agonising stories.  My secretary had to help me carry them.  At the conclusion of this debate I will put the human face on this material.</P>
        <P>A letter from a psychiatrist to yesterday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> suggested some kind of negative impact on children.  The American Academy of Pedriatics states there is no data to suggest that children who have gay or lesbian parents are different in any aspect of psychological, social or sexual development to children in heterosexual families.  The American Psychological Association states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . there is no evidence to suggest that lesbian women or gay men are unfit to be parents or that psychosocial development among children of lesbian women or gay men is compromised relative to that among offspring of heterosexual parents . . . Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Studies by the Australian Psychological Society comparing groups of children raised by homosexual and heterosexual parents found no developmental difference between the groups.  The Canadian Psychological Association states:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a popular misconception that gay and lesbian parents, because of their sexual orientation, compromise the psychological and sexual development of their children . . . Psychosocial research into lesbian and gay parenting indicates that there is no basis in the scientific literature for this perception.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I will list other organisations and return to them in my concluding speech: The Royal College of Psychiatrists; the National Association of Social Workers; and the American Psychiatric Association.  That should put that canard to rest, notwithstanding the discrimination that exists against gay people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to second the important motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Norris, with his customary eloquence.  I pay tribute to the work he has done in bringing about much of the legal change to which the Government amendment refers.</P>
        <P>Before addressing the substance of the motion, I declare a professional interest in the matter.  In my capacity as a practising barrister I represent the plaintiffs in the case currently before the courts seeking legal recognition for a marriage contracted in Canada and a declaration of the plaintiffs&rsquo; right to marry in Ireland.  The case has been heard in the High Court and an appeal is pending in the Supreme Court.  I am, therefore, ethically restricted as to what I can say directly related to the case.</P><Col N="1324"/>
        <P>I am here to support the principle of equality before the law for same sex couples and in particular to support the principle that same sex couples, like opposite sex couples, have the right to marry.  Not only is this clear from the growing number of jurisdictions that provide legal recognition for same sex marriages, notably Spain, but a consensus has also emerged in Ireland on the need for some form of legal recognition for same sex couples.  This is evidenced by the November 2006 report of the Colley group, the tenth report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the report of the Law Reform Commission on cohabitees and in the Government legislative programme in which a commitment is given to prepare a scheme of a civil partnership Bill.  A consensus has emerged on the need to provide recognition for same-sex relationships in law.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in December 2006 &mdash; the Civil Unions Bill &mdash; which was reintroduced in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Howlin in October-November of last year.  The Government made a shameful U-turn in its response to the Labour Party Bill and gave a tokenistic reiteration of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to legislate for civil partnership at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government.  This is the same formula of words used in the amendment to this motion.</P>
        <P>Some of the comments made by Government party Deputies in November-December last betrayed a deep resistance to the principle of equality and parity of esteem for same-sex couples.  The comments of some Deputies might have been unsurprising but it was particularly disappointing to hear the Minister say that the Labour Party Bill risked impugning the constitutionally protected family.</P>
        <P>The attitude change of Green Party Deputies was also particularly disappointing.  From being a party which apparently had supported the principle of gay marriage, it had retreated behind a vague Government commitment to bring forward the heads of a Bill by the end of March of this year.  In fact, neither the Government amendment to this motion nor the Fine Gael amendment refer to March or to any deadline for the introduction of heads of a Bill or, indeed, of legislation.  In other words, the commitment to the introduction of civil partnership legislation expressed in the amendments is an empty one which does nothing to advance the principle of recognition for gay and lesbian couples let alone the principle of equality.</P>
        <P>This is especially disappointing given the commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to parity of protection of human rights North and South of the Border and the fact gay couples from Belfast to Bangor to Derry can enter civil unions in a society which is, in many ways, more socially conservative than our own.</P><Col N="1325"/>
        <P>The only conclusion one can draw from the Government approach to this issue is that it is hoping it will simply go away.  However, we can tell them &mdash; Senator Norris has already made it clear &mdash; that it will not go away and that the consequences of continued non-recognition for thousands of men, women and especially children of same sex couples are too serious for this simply to disappear from the political agenda.</P>
        <P>A good deal has been said about the rights of children in this debate, particularly by those who oppose the principle of recognition for same-sex couples.  None of them has addressed the central truth that there are already many children in Ireland being raised by same sex parents and whose rights are unprotected in our law.  Many of those children have spoken out in recent days in the newspapers and on radio and television and none of the opponents of recognition has been able to give solid reasons that the recognition of marriage would encroach in any way on the rights of the children of gay relationships.</P>
        <P>As Senator Norris said, all the available unbiased, scientific and peer-reviewed research shows that children brought up by same sex parents do as well as those brought by opposite sex parents.  Indeed, all parents, male or female or gay or straight can relate to their children in ways which might be described as masculine or feminine.  What matters is not the sexuality or gender of the parents but rather the quality of the parenting and the relationship the parents have with the children.  We all know this in reality both as parents and as children of parents.</P>
        <P>Apart from the issues of children, child custody and adoption, gay people are currently discriminated against in a range of ways as couples, including taxation, social welfare, succession rights, next-of-kin rights, immigration matters and so on, as illustrated in research and reports produced by GLEN, the Equality Authority and others.  This is by virtue of the lack of recognition for intimate and committed relationships.  It is important to state that a loving relationship between two persons, whether of different sexes or the same sex, is not the same as, or comparable with, the relationship between two siblings or two flatmates and yet those on the other side of the debate have frequently made that comparison.</P>
        <P>The group, MarriagEquality, which launched last week has made clear it seeks recognition in the law for civil marriage.  It is looking for equality in law and I support its aims which are reflected in the wording of this important motion but which can be summarised in one word, that is, &ldquo;equality&rdquo;.  Even if a specific time commitment were given by the Government for the introduction of legislation allowing for civil partnership, it is not the same as marriage and does not amount to equality in law for gay people.  In the spirit of equality, I urge other Members of this House to support this motion and reject the amendments.</P>

	<P>As the motion from the Independent Senators points out, it was my distinguished predecessor, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who in 1993 introduced the ground-breaking legislation to decriminalise homosexuality in this country.  Senator Norris played a signal part in the evolution of the law in this area but she deserves credit for introducing the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Since that time, there has been much positive change for lesbians and gay men.  A broad range of equality legislation and the associated equality infrastructure has been put in place.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion before the House this evening quite properly records that progress and shows that in the particular area of protection against discrimination, Ireland has been to the forefront internationally.  The various legislative enactments set out in the Government amendment are a response to the expressed terms in the motion, as proposed, which referred to the statements of the then Minister for Justice in 1993.</P>
        <P>The Government proposes to go a step further.  In An Agreed Programme for Government we have committed ourselves to legislating for civil partnerships.  This commitment is given concrete expression in the Government legislative programme which includes a civil partnership Bill providing for a system of civil registration of same-sex partnerships and for certain legal protections for them and other cohabitants.  The Government has asked me to bring forward a scheme of a Bill by the end of March and I intend to do so.  While that may not be in the Government amendment, I am happy to put that on the record.</P>
        <P>The scheme of a Bill currently being prepared in my Department will be extensive with provisions ranging across diverse areas of the law, including civil registration, maintenance, property rights and succession, pensions, taxation and many other matters.  I note Fine Gael has tabled an amendment to which I do not take any great exception.</P><Col N="1328"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach, which was approved by the D&aacute;il last November, is to provide a statutory scheme from which same-sex couples who choose to register their partnerships will derive extensive rights and protections.  This scheme will build on the Colley options paper and the Law Reform Commission report on cohabitants.</P>
        <P>It will provide for a redress scheme open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.  The redress scheme is proposed specifically to protect vulnerable dependent cohabitants at the end of a relationship where the couple have neither married nor entered a civil partnership.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that civil partnership legislation is the appropriate way to proceed having regard to the boundaries set by the Constitution.  The Independent Senators&rsquo; motion calls for access to civil marriage for gay couples.  This call has been echoed by some outside the House in recent days and I have listened very carefully to their arguments.  I accept that those who put them forward do so out of the highest and sincerely held motives.</P>
        <P>However, as the Minister responsible for law reform, I must bring in a law that is consistent with our Constitution.  The advice of successive Attorneys General is that same-sex marriage would not be constitutional.  Within the Constitution, marriage has a very specific judicial meaning and that meaning does not encompass same-sex marriage.  This was confirmed most recently in the proceedings referred to by Senator Bacik, the Zappone and Gilligan case, in which she correctly pointed out that she had an interest.  The High Court found that there is no right for same-sex couples to marry under our Constitution.  In evidence in that case, it was also clear that the consensus internationally does not support a move towards same-sex marriage.  There has been limited support for the concept of same-sex marriage in Canada, Massachusetts and South Africa together with three European jurisdictions, namely, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>Some jurisdictions have given recognition of some kind to same-sex and opposite-sex couples with or without a registration scheme.  Ten of the European Union states are without a registration scheme.  The observation of the court was that there is no discernible pattern apparent from the approaches taken in the different jurisdictions.  I have taken note of the court&rsquo;s comment and I quote from the judgment of the learned High Court judge who stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">[U]ndoubtedly people in the position of the Plaintiffs in the case be they same-sex couples or heterosexual couples can suffer difficulty or hardship in the event of the death or serious illness of their partner . . . It is hoped that the legislative changes to ameliorate these difficulties will not be long in coming.  Ultimately it is for the legislature to determine the extent to which such changes should be made.</P><Col N="1329"/>
        <P FLI="0">The civil partnership Bill will address these issues.  The Zappone case is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  I had a choice and I could have awaited the outcome of that appeal.  However, the Government believes we should make progress on this matter at an early date.</P>
        <P>We should proceed now to introduce a law that will give recognition and protection to same sex couples who are involved in committed, stable relationships.  It is the responsibility of the State to provide a supportive legal framework for such relationships.  That is the view of the Government and that is why the agreed programme for Government has committed us to making progress on this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, who moved amendment No. 1 to the motion, chaired the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which in its tenth report, entitled &ldquo;The Family&rdquo; and published in January 2006, supports the approach by the Government in respect of this matter.  In that report, the committee concluded that a proposal to amend the Constitution to extend the definition of the family would be deeply divisive and would not necessarily be passed.  I share this conclusion.  Presenting this issue to the people in a constitutional referendum would be deeply divisive and unsuccessful and would jeopardise the progress we have made in the past 15 years.  We need to remind ourselves that considerable progress has been made.  When homosexuality was decriminalised in 1993, who would have thought that just 15 years later we would be discussing the legal recognition by the State of same sex partnerships?</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas committee took the view that the principal development for same sex couples should come at legislative level and this is precisely the course of action the Government has decided to take.  I look forward to bringing about change by presenting the proposals for a civil partnership Bill to Government in the coming weeks.  Those proposals will put in place a comprehensive and supportive legal framework for same sex couples.  I urge the House to back the Government&rsquo;s measured approach by supporting amendment No. 1.</P>

	<P>Similar commitments were made on previous occasions.</P>
        <P>I understand the motivation behind Senator Norris&rsquo;s original motion.  I share the sentiments expressed.  The Senator&rsquo;s action is born out of frustration at the lack of action on the part of the Government in respect of progressing this matter. <Col N="1330"/> I am somewhat concerned, therefore, regarding when the civil partnership Bill will be introduced.</P>
        <P>In 2004, Fine Gael was the first party to publish a civil partnership plan.  This was designed to confer rights on same sex and opposite sex cohabiting couples by way of registration and related to pension, tax, property, inheritance, social welfare, next of kin and workplace entitlements.  In the same year, the Law Reform Commission issued a report highlighting this issue.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s plan was comprehensive and was put forward at a time when consensus in respect of this matter did not exist.  Fine Gael introduced new ideas and pushed for a resolution in respect of those unfortunate people who had no legal protection and who were not treated equally before the law in the areas of residency, tax, pension entitlements and property rights.</P>
        <P>One of the proposals put forward by Fine Gael was to extend the provisions of the Family Home Protection Act to include registered couples.  We also suggested that registered partners should be entitled to compassionate leave from their employment in the event of serious illness or the death of their partners.  Many of the issues outlined in Fine Gael&rsquo;s 2004 plan are covered by and reflected the Colley report, which was published in 2006 and which outlined a series of options regarding how we should proceed in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to some of the legalities and constitutional principles that apply.  These are extremely important.  When legislating in respect of this area, we must ensure we get it right.  The position of the family is protected under Article 41 of the Constitution, although there is no definition as to what constitutes a family.  There has been a series of cases and the Minister referred to some of these.  For example, there was the State (Nicolaou) <i>v</i>. An Bord Ucht&aacute;la case and the G <i>v</i>. An Bord Ucht&aacute;la case, in which is was stated that Article 41 &ldquo;refers exclusively to the family founded and based on the institution of marriage&rdquo;.  It follows from these cases that a cohabiting couple and their children, if any, are not to be regarded as a family under Irish law.  It is here that problems arise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There also have been the Hyde <i>v</i>. Hyde, Griffith <i>v</i>. Griffith, R <i>v</i>. R and Zappone and Gilligan <i>v</i>. Revenue Commissioners and Others cases.  In the latter case, which is the most recent, the High Court refused to redefine marriage on the basis that &ldquo;the definition of marriage has always been understood as same sex marriage".  It also refused to accept that some kind of changing consensus exists.</P>
        <P>I am of the view, however, that a political consensus is emerging.  This is based on the concept of civil partnership and arises out of Fine Gael&rsquo;s 2004 plan.  There is growing public support for legal recognition for gay and lesbian couples.  A poll conducted for <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in 2006 found that 64% of those surveyed believed that same sex couples should have the same legal and financial rights as married couples.  In November <Col N="1331"/>of the same year, a survey carried out by Lansdowne Market Research for the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, found that 84% of those questioned were in favour of marriage or civil partnership for gay couples.</P>
        <P>In international terms, the position has changed.  The first civil union was introduced in Denmark in 1989.  In the interim, civil unions, civil partnerships and domestic partnerships have become recognised in law in 15 other states.  A number of these countries are members of the European Union.</P>
        <P>There is a political consensus in both Houses in respect of moving forward with a civil partnership Bill, with specific entitlements &mdash; based on the principle of equality &mdash; for gay and lesbian and cohabiting couples of the same sex.  The debate in this regard will continue.  However, it is important that we move forward with the legislation and deal with the situation as it currently exists.  We must arrive at an accord across the political spectrum.</P>
        <P>The political consensus to which I refer should be reflected in the legislation.  That is the basis of the amendment tabled by Fine Gael.  There was a specific commitment to publish the Bill by 31 March.  However, amendment No. 1 makes no reference to this date.  It is important that the commitment regarding the date be adhered to.  I am not confident this will happen and, for that reason alone, I cannot support amendment No. 1.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris has, on a number of previous occasions, referred to the importance of and the urgency attaching to this issue.  I fully understand his motivation and the importance of legislation in this area.  The Fine Gael position is the civil partnership policy approach and it has a twin benefit not only of dealing with the lack of equality for same-sex couples but also providing protection for heterosexual cohabiting couples who do not wish to marry.  There is a lacuna in the law in that area as well.  If we could deal with this in appropriate legislation in 2008, the Oireachtas will have done some good work.  I will oppose the Government amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already proposed the amendment to the motion and I will say a few brief words in the time allowed.  As the Minister indicated, I chaired the last Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution and in January 2006 we produced a report known as the Tenth Progress Report: The Family.</P>
        <P>For the record it should be noted the Taoiseach wrote to the then Chairman of that committee, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asking him to look at the area of the family, children&rsquo;s rights, etc.  As a result of the impending general election in 2002 and ongoing work carried out by the committee at that stage, it fell to me to deal with this matter.</P><Col N="1332"/>
        <P>We advertised for submissions because we were very open and transparent in dealing with the matter.  More than 16,000 petitions were sent and there were 8,000 submissions, the majority being individuals.  There were 103 groups from various parts of the community, from bishops to groups expressing their views on the family.  This report deals with many issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the motion before the House, it is important to note the committee came to a decision, although there was not unanimity.  There were two dissenters, I believe, but the majority of opinion, being cognisant of senior counsel in the eminent person of Dr. Gerard Hogan and others, was that to change the law to allow for same-sex marriages would first require a constitutional amendment.  That was the first hurdle and that view is accepted by the Government.</P>
        <P>We also came to the conclusion that there was nothing preventing this or any Government from bringing in legislation that would effect legislative change to allow for civil partnership, as was originally mooted in Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill which he recently withdrew.  In that regard, the committee was very clear that it was quite prepared to make a recommendation which I am grateful to see has been taken on board by the Government.  It advocated that legislation be put in place to allow for issues such as succession rights, rights on taxation and inheritance tax in particular, income tax and other matters.  This would provide cohabiting couples and same-sex couples with basic rights in taxation, a significant step forward.</P>
        <P>In the 1996 census, the figure for gay and lesbian couples was approximately 150, although I am unsure if this was accurate.  In 2002 that had risen to approximately 1,350 and the most recent census figures puts it in excess of 2,000.  We are seeing a substantial increase on the previous decade in same-sex unions or relationships.  I may be incorrect in this private view but I believe less than 20 years ago, couples in a relationship would suffer a stigma and they were afraid, in the privacy of a census, to declare they were in such a relationship.  Thankfully that stigma is diminishing and there is more openness in that regard.</P>
        <P>In this regard it is very difficult to introduce legislation and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that the heads of a Bill are being prepared and the legislation will probably be introduced into the D&aacute;il in the next term.  I look forward to it being dealt with in the Seanad.  It is important to welcome this because we cannot deal with the motion, as proposed by Senator Norris, without including the many thousands of cohabiting couples, who currently number well over 100,000 in Ireland.  They are in a limbo.</P>
        <P>I have come across many sad cases in my legal life.  Going back ten or 20 years ago there was a famous couple in west Cork to whom Senator Norris has referred, although I will not go into names.  These two gay men were at retirement age and had some property.  One of the men was <Col N="1333"/>diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, unfortunately, and his life partner wanted to look after him.  Unfortunately, the better of the two had a heart attack and died suddenly, so the other man was deprived of his entitlements and property rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Such cases exist and we should bring regularity to them.  As a former Chairman of the committee, I hold the view that the provision regarding same-sex marriages, as now seems to be demanded, is a step too far.  The bar has been raised by Senator Norris with this motion.  Despite the predictions and polls by various papers, the Government must consider whether we should run the risk in this instance of having a referendum to change the playing pitch.</P>
        <P>That might be the ultimate Utopian desire of Senator Norris in his proposal but if that referendum were lost, and it probably would be, we would defer the civil partnership legislation, as proposed by the Government and soon to be recommended, for ten or 20 years.  In many ways the purpose would be defeated.  The method the Government is choosing is sensible, balanced and the European norm.  I welcome it and commend the amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Prendergast.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will indicate when five minutes have elapsed.</P>
        <P>I commend the Independent Senators on tabling this motion and they have done very well to use their Private Members&rsquo; time to up the ante on this issue.  We must move forward with this.</P>
        <P>This month marks the one-year anniversary of my party&rsquo;s introduction of the Civil Unions Bill, comprehensive legislation that would have given legal recognition to civil unions for couples.  It was backed by Ireland&rsquo;s gay community but was rejected by the Government at the time, just before the most recent general election.  On the second time around for the Bill last autumn, the Government decided to reject it, saying it would introduce the heads of a Bill concerning civil partnership.</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister state earlier that he expects to bring in the heads of a Bill in a matter of weeks.  My concern is that we will never actually see a real Bill from the Government.  Although we might see the heads of what a Bill might look like, an actual Bill will not see the light of day and there will be an outline with no consequence.  The reason for this is the Government is pandering to the mean-minded conservatives within its constituent parties, although they are probably a minority.  As a result, it is not allowing a Bill to be brought forward.  Consequently, we will not accept the Government&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>We believe the Government is trying to appease some members of the conservative wing and appeal to some of the more progressive people in the Government, such as some of those in the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s party.  They say they <Col N="1334"/>have taken note of the options presented in the Colley report, the Oireachtas Commission on the Constitution, and the Law Reform Commission and are keen to point out how good they have been in moving other forms of legislation such as employment law.  The Employment Equality Act 1998 is intended to protect the gay community against discrimination in areas such as employment, vocational training and the provision of goods.  Section 37, however, allows discrimination to exist by permitting medical, educational and religious institutions to refuse to hire gay people on the grounds of their sexuality.  That is not what equality means to me.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion, stating that it wants to introduce heads of a Bill makes me worry that we will never see one.  This is no longer a reasonable, acceptable or sufficient approach to the issue.  Dr. Martin Luther King said that the freedom of the American white community was linked to that of the black community.  The lack of equality in civil unions here demeans all the citizens of the nation.</P>
        <P>Two members of a group founded a few weeks ago, MarriageEquality, published an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>this week about their experience of bringing up their son.  They wrote that civil marriage &ldquo;would mean that we would be recognised as a family unit, no ands, ifs or buts. We are not looking for a church marriage or blessing. We are not challenging individual church beliefs and understandings on marriage in any way. We are simply looking to be treated fairly in law for our son&rdquo;.  They focus on a loving family, no matter what form it takes.  This family needs to be protected.</P>
        <P>The Government cannot cast the State&rsquo;s youngest citizens aside and treat their parents as second class citizens.  Children should not have to suffer at the hands of a weak-willed Government which is pandering to a hard core conservative minority within its own ranks, rather than protecting citizens.  I commend the motion as proposed by Senator Norris and the Independent Senators and encourage the House to support it and vote down the Government and Fine Gael amendments.</P>

	<P>I agree that there have been many improvements and positive changes for lesbians and gay men but I have problems with the Fine Gael amendment because it does not deal with the families of same sex couples.  There is no reference to adoption or to the potential equality of any kind of family unit.  We in the Labour Party are committed to full equality for gay and lesbian couples.  </P>
        <P>Many studies have been carried out to show that children brought up by same sex couples do just as well as children in conventional families because parenting is what matters.</P>

        <P>Speakers from all sides of the House on our civil union Bill in the D&aacute;il had open reservations about adoption by same sex couples.  I know of cases in which one partner in a same sex union was taken seriously ill but there was no recognition of the status of the other partner, which is very sad.</P>
        <P>Economic factors were not the only ones that drove people to leave these shores years ago.  Many left because their sexual orientation could not be expressed.  I acknowledge that we have come some way towards accepting that certain people need a formal legal interpretation of their status.  I oppose the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Marriage between a man and woman is an institution fundamental to the propagation of the human race.  It is also fundamental to the care, nurture and rearing of children to become good and valuable citizens of the future.  That is best achieved through children being raised by their biological parents, father and mother in a loving, stable, married relationship.  I am not saying that there are not many children who are well reared in other family units but the family unit of mother, father and children is the ideal for society.  As such, it deserves  unique recognition and support by the State.  </P>
        <P>It will be obvious that I do not support marriage for same sex couples.  That is not to say that certain entitlements should not be granted to gay couples who share their lives but they should not simply replicate each and every marriage entitlement.  Instead, there should be a focused and specific targeting of matters that impinge on gay couples, recognition of rights of next of kin, entitlement to nominate successors to pensions, domestic violence provisions, which have already been extended, and certain social welfare supports.  The amendments made to property succession rights some years ago should also apply to those living together in a gay relationship.</P>
        <P>We do not know what entitlements will be prescribed in the civil partnership Bill.  If married allowances and inheritance tax provisions available to married couples are extended to civil partnerships for gay couples we are moving in the direction of conferring practically all marriage entitlements on gay couples.  That is marriage by another name.</P>
        <P>A recent survey in the United States showed that married women spend an average of 11 years out of the workforce, in most cases rearing their children.  That is 25% of a woman&rsquo;s working life which has obvious financial consequences for <Col N="1336"/>them and their families.  It is therefore understandable that if we fully support marriage, tax benefits apply.  If all the marital entitlements are transferred to gay marriage then civil partnership is analogous to marriage between a man and a woman, which may be seen as  disingenuous or as a ruse to overcome the constitutional impediment to such marriage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It disenfranchises the public from adjudicating on the issue and marriage is covered in, and protected by, the Constitution.  More importantly, it would abrogate Members&rsquo; responsibility to uphold the Constitution.  It would be seen as circumventing it and this would be a highly retrograde step to take.  If this right is pursued, I suggest the question should be put to the people by way of referendum.</P>
        <P>I refer to the intrusion of the European Union into such matters.  These are matters of social importance that often are reflected in the culture and ethos of each member state.  There have been two recent developments to which I would not subscribe or support.  Civil partnership has been introduced in Germany and in recent weeks, an EU Commissioner has written to Germany stating the model it has adopted does not go far enough for gays and that it must be equal to marriage.  The Christian Democratic Union is fighting back on this issue.  Moreover, a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights found in favour of a French couple in the area of adoption and overturned a number of French court decisions in that regard.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the State can adopt a position of indifference on the rights of the child.  Despite people&rsquo;s assertions, there are well-established and recognised reports that show the best prospect for children, their protection and development, is to be reared by their biological mothers and fathers.  This is the ideal and should be supported by Members.  One cannot have a position of indifference on the right of a child to be raised by his or her mother and father.  The State cannot be neutral if biological parenting is being downgraded.  As for the rights of the individual, I recognise there are certain issues which must be addressed in the interests of enhancing the lives who commit to each other in a gay relationship.  However, there are balancing rights in respect of the overall well-being of society and fundamental to that well-being, I propose that the family unit is a key component and cornerstone that must be protected at all costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who is not present, may wish to share time.  If he appears, I will happily conclude.  If this is the case, perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach will inform me when I am halfway through.</P>
        <P>I wish to preface my remarks by stating this is an issue of tremendous importance and enormous sensitivity and there are deeply-held feelings on all sides on this issue.  It goes to the heart of the <Col N="1337"/>self-identity of many people who are proponents of same sex partnerships, gay marriage or whatever term of description one cares to use.  Equally, people on the other side of the argument have sincere and legitimate concerns about the importance of family life and how the common good is to be served.  In this respect I welcome the quotation of the comment by the former Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, to the effect that there must be clear, factual and cogent arguments.</P>
        <P>This is what I seek to present and much as I esteem my colleague, Senator Norris, I wish to express my disquiet at the characterisation of arguments against same sex marriage, let alone civil unions, as being somehow nasty.  My colleague, Senator Hannigan, spoke of mean-minded conservatives.  Others have invoked the Church as though to suggest the only arguments one might make against civil partnerships or same sex marriage are those that somehow are grounded exclusively in theology.  Any arguments I wish to make this evening are intended to appeal to people regardless of whether they have my faith, another faith or none.  One must go forward on the basis of rational argument.  One must seek the common good, seek to do justice as one&rsquo;s desire for justice must trump any ideological motivation.  This is my starting point and I hope it is shared by all Members.</P>
        <P>The majority of speakers in the House this evening have tended towards the view that there ought to be civil partnerships or same sex marriage.  However, a majority of people in Ireland, certainly a majority of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael members and probably a significant minority of Labour Party members, have a deep disquiet about civil partnerships.  This is not because they are hostile towards people with same sex attractions or because they believe such people have fewer rights as citizens or less dignity, but because they believe the common good requires the State to prefer marriage, because of the complementarity of the sexes in the context of bringing up children.  Moreover they believe there are other ways of seeking to do justice in those scenarios in which people in mutually dependent circumstances, who deserve every credit for making sacrifices for each other, should be allowed to confer benefits on each other and should be allowed to avail of certain benefits at the expense of the State.  This is my view and we must move towards addressing those benefits and subsequently, as a separate issue, deal with the question of the State&rsquo;s interest or otherwise in recognising relationships other than marital relationships as we know them.</P>
        <P>While Members will hear much on this issue in the media, it is disingenuous to take individual cases in which justice must be done, regardless of whether they pertain to inheritance in scenarios in which people who are mutually dependent find themselves in difficulties or to children who are not getting their rights.  These issues must be con<Col N="1338"/>sidered in the context of the provisions that must be made in such cases.  However, the argument that one somehow must create same sex partnerships to so do is both illogical and does a grave injustice to the many other scenarios in which people are not necessarily romantically involved but are engaged in the care and upbringing of children.  One must keep clear the issues, which was my point in respect of Members&rsquo; concern for justice and rational and evidence-based argument that must trump ideology.</P>
        <P>The approaches taken by other countries in this regard do not matter as Members should examine it in the light of Irish constitutional traditions, which correctly speak of the centrality of marriage, as does the Constitution, in which the State pledges to &ldquo;guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded&rdquo;.  The State does this because it recognises that marriage is a unique institution in respect of children&rsquo;s needs.  I disagree again with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I dissent from Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> from the esteemed psychiatrist, Professor Patricia Casey.  She asked why, if children being raised by same-sex couples should be given the protections of marriage, such protections should not be given to children being raised in other non-marital family unions.  This is a perfectly rational argument and should not be characterised as being nasty or mean-spirited.  Does the fact that children are found in unions other than in traditional marriage mean one should automatically create new State recognition for relationships akin to marriage?  This is disingenuous because one can confer the benefits on the children.  However, the State still has an interest in seeking to promote that relationship which the evidence increasingly shows works to the good of children, in terms of the complementarity of the sexes and the stable upbringing of children in society.  This is a time when marriage as we know it is under much pressure.</P>
        <P>One must avoid the flawed arguments.  I note in particular that the High Court was unconvinced in the Zappone and  Gilligan case about arguments that children raised in same sex relationships do equally well as children raised in marital relationships.  The point is that almost none of the studies that have been cited in the House has been longitudinal.  They do not measure the welfare of children of same sex couples over the long term.  Those that do measure such outcomes use such small sample sizes as to be unreliable.  This is the reason that in her High Court ruling on the recent case, Miss Justice Elizabeth Dunne stated the State should proceed cautiously in respect of this research.</P>

	<P>We must have regard to the fact that statistics are easily quoted, but we should note that the burden of proof is on those who advocate radical social change.  If we are sincere about providing the best possible environment for the upbringing of children in society, we will do nothing to put that at risk.  We certainly will not do it on the basis of half-baked research.  We must wait.  I am not saying it is impossible to provide rights for persons who may be in same sex unions or in other mutually dependent situations, for example, siblings, carers and their dependants and relations of other kinds.  As a means of seeking to end discrimination on the basis of a hollow notion of equality, would it not be inappropriate to bring in another form of unjust discrimination?  The reality is that the preference the State gives to marriage exists purely and simply because of what married couples can do for society in terms of the upbringing of children.  That does not mean we denigrate the situation of people where children are found elsewhere; it simply means we promote what is good while cherishing all the children of the nation equally at the same time.</P>
        <P>The State must not be tempted to give same sex couples, given that they are vocal &mdash; that is no disrespect to them &mdash; and small in number, what they want because it would cost the taxpayer less.  That would not constitute good social policy.  It is certainly not appropriate to allow some classes of couples to jump the queue so to speak and to enjoy, along with married couples as we know them, rights to which other couples may equally lay claim.</P>
        <P>These are the kinds of issues the Minister must consider carefully.  I would be unhappy if, as a tactic, we saw opponents of same sex unions on one side &mdash; who I stress are not opposed to rights for people, that may come at a cost to the State, rights that they confer on each other privately &mdash; and advocates of same sex marriage, on the other side.  It is not  an acceptable compromise to create a same sex partnership situation, if that entails rights to which other couples, who are not necessary sexually or romantically involved, may equally lay claim.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by the Independent Senators not only because this issue deserves a good airing and debate but for the purposes of clarification.</P>
        <P>The Green Party supports the principle of equality through giving legal recognition to same sex unions.  Our party&rsquo;s policy is that same sex couples should be allowed to enjoy the full rights and responsibilities of marriage.  The previous Government had proposed awaiting the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in the Zappone case, but as part of the Green Party&rsquo;s negotiations on the formation of the Government with Fianna F&aacute;il, it was agreed that legislation should be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Our party has been actively pursuing equality legislation for same sex couples.  In 2006, the Green Party passed a marriage and partnerships rights policy.  This policy stated our belief that full access to civil marriage for same sex couples was the only way to achieve full equality.  This continues to be the Green Party policy.  Full equality will be achieved only when same sex couples are allowed civil marriage.</P>
        <P>In early 2007 we supported the Labour Party&rsquo;s Civil Unions Bill.  During the debate on it our spokesperson, Deputy Cuffe, made the point that while we were supportive of the Bill, we did not see the Labour Party proposals on civil unions going far enough and we supported full access to same sex marriage.  After the general election we entered negotiations with Fianna F&aacute;il.  Our team, led by the then Deputy Gormley, requested that the programme for Government include a commitment to legislating for same sex marriage.  However, we could not bring about this alone without the support of all Government parties.  We, as a party, had to decide how to proceed.  We decided that as both the main political parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, oppose full civil marriage for same sex couples, and as the Zappone case had been rejected in the Supreme Court, the best way to proceed was to achieve some protection for same sex couples currently in relationships in this five-year period of Government, while continuing to push for full access to civil marriage for same sex couples in the future.   In light of this, the programme for Government includes a commitment to legislate for civil partnerships.  It states, &ldquo;Taking account of the Options Paper prepared by the Colley Group and the pending Supreme Court Case, we will legislate for Civil Partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government.&rdquo;  Like <Col N="1341"/>Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, the Green Party believes that true equality will come only when same sex couples are given full access to civil marriage.  We accept that the Bill being proposed by the Government will not do this.  However, given that neither of the main parties is prepared to accept civil marriage at this stage, we believe the civil partnerships this Bill will introduce will allow for protection of important aspects of same sex relationships while we continue to fight for complete equality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the programme for Government, the Green Party will deliver legislation on civil partnerships which will allow same sex couples to enter into a legal union, with rights and obligations recognised by the State. The heads of the Bill giving effect to this is to be published next month.  it is a move in the right direction to take the first legal steps to allow for legal recognition of partnerships that were previously ignored by official Ireland.  The former Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, started the process by decriminalising homosexuality in 1994 and now we are talking about legal recognition of same sex partners.</P>
        <P>The new Bill extends to cohabiting gay couples, who register their relationship with a new agency, some of the same rights under the law as heterosexual couples.  The Government approved the drafting of a report of a scheme of a civil partnerships Bill in October 2007 and the draft scheme is based on the Colley option paper and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on the rights and duties of cohabitants.  The scheme aims to establish a statutory mechanism for the registration of same sex partnerships to set out duties and responsibilities of registered partners and the consequences of a separation or termination of such partnerships.  It also provides a legal safety net and protection to a dependent party at the end of a relationship or through bereavement by establishing a scheme of redress for unregistered or unmarried cohabitants.</P>
        <P>The Green Party considers this a significant further step in equality, but we will push for more rights and protections in the family law area in respect of same sex couples.  However, as my colleague, Deputy Cuffe, pointed out last October, there is a difference between proposing while in opposition and enacting while in government.  There is a range of legal, taxation, social welfare and pension issues that must be fully thought out and delivered in this Bill if it is to protect the rights of those in same sex partnerships.  This legislation must stand up to scrutiny in the Irish courts and respect international best practice in this field of law.  It must ensure the rights of those in same sex relationships are protected.  It must cover all taxation, social welfare and pension rights issues and protect and deliver on issues such as succession, shared home ownership and power of attorney when partners are ill.</P><Col N="1342"/>
        <P>The Green Party has been in consultation with our Government partners, in particular the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to push for those and other measures.  We favour the application of full marriage rights &mdash; as accorded to heterosexual married couples under the Constitution &mdash; to same sex couples.  We believe, however, that in the interim it is most important in our discussions with our Government partners to secure protection for those already in existing relationships while at the same time continuing to press for full civil marriage rights.</P>
        <P>The Green Party supports civil marriage for same sex couples, as it offers more protections and rights, particularly in regard to the protection of the family units of same sex partnerships.  However, we believe, with the civil partnership Bill being proposed, the first legal steps are being taken to accord legal recognition to thousands of people previously ignored by official Ireland.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  One of the most courageous political acts I have witnessed in this House was when the then Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced her Bill.  It was not a very popular Bill with Fianna F&aacute;il at the time but she went ahead and introduced it.  One of the events that motivated her to introduce it was a meeting she had with the parents of young gay people.  She was very moved by their experiences and the trauma and life experiences which their children had been through because of the situation as it existed at the time.  I hope the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will do what he says he will do, which is to introduce civil partnership legislation.  I hope Senator Hannigan is mistaken when he says he does not believe it will happen.  I hope he is proved wrong on this occasion and that the Minister will introduce the legislation and will have the courage to do so.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate yet disappointed this debate is so necessary owing to the continued legal and social discrimination of same-sex couples in this country.  I commend both Senator David Norris and Senator Ivana Bacik on bringing this issue to the fore and providing the opportunity to have this debate by using their  Private Members&rsquo; time to debate and discuss this important social issue.</P>
        <P>Some very interesting contributions have been made from all sides of the House.  Senator Mullen said we must serve justice and this is true.  I will explain how I believe justice can be served in this context.  I also wish to commend my party colleague, the former Senator, Sheila Terry, for her work as our party&rsquo;s equality spokesperson in the previous Seanad during which time she produced a comprehensive and progressive policy paper on civil partnership.  Fine Gael was the first political party to produce such a paper.</P><Col N="1343"/>
        <P>It should be noted that in the general election manifestos last year, all political parties gave a commitment to support legal recognition of same-sex couples.  The Oireachtas introduced legislation ten years ago in the form of the Employment Equality Act which afforded legal protection for gay and lesbian people in employment.  As a nation and in the intervening period, however, we have failed to act to advance the rights of gay and lesbian people in terms of property rights, succession rights, pension, tax, social welfare, inheritance rights and next-of-kin status.  The legal framework continues to discriminate against people involved in same-sex relationships.  It discriminates in a way which is unacceptable and repulsive in the modern, progressive society to which we aspire and in which we claim to live and work.</P>
        <P>If one were to see two babies lying side by side in neighbouring cradles in any maternity hospital in the country today, would one really have the heart to look at one baby and say it can grow up, its behaviour will be viewed as the norm, its interests in developing a romantic relationship will be encouraged by society and seen as the done thing, and whenever it enters into a serious relationship, the State will recognise its love and provide a legitimacy to its relationship, and say to the other that it will grow up in a society where it will be viewed with distaste by the State, its relationship with another individual will never be recognised and, by implication, will be almost frowned upon, its love for its partner will always be viewed as illegitimate and the State will afford it no recognition?  This is the current situation.  It is a mixture of prejudice and misconception which has created a situation where from the moment of birth, a child is destined effectively to be ignored for life by this State because of his or her sexuality, something which is outside his or her control.</P>
        <P>Many homophobic attitudes still remain in this country and they often emerge during a debate such as this.  To some degree this is a generational issue but not entirely.  I refer to the serious national phenomenon of homophobic bullying in schools.  We all have heard the stories and the problem is very common.  The phenomenon of male suicide is affected by the homophobia that continues to be present in society.  Many men, surprisingly young, still feel so ignored, discriminated against and afraid to speak about their sexuality that they become very depressed and, unfortunately, take their own lives.  This is a frequent occurrence.  It is beginning to be spoken about and to be identified in the research in this area.  Huge pain is caused in society by the prejudicial attitudes which still remain.  This House has work to do.  We can lead the way in many ways and improve the quality of life and the human rights of our citizens.</P>
        <P>I thank the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, for the comprehensive briefing it <Col N="1344"/>provided to Oireachtas Members today.  It was most helpful in moving the debate forward and in enabling the House to conduct the debate based on fact rather than on myth.  More information is required.  GLEN provided information on a question raised by Senator Norris about children with same-sex parents.  More research is required in this area so that we can understand the issues.</P>
        <P>When I read the information supplied by GLEN, I came across a real-life story which may help to personalise and understand the very human side to the current discriminatory legislative situation.  With the indulgence of the House I wish to quote from the information.  Many Members may have seen this case highlighted on the recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and will have seen Mrs. Margaret Gill speak about her family experience.  Senator Mullen said it was invidious to talk about individual cases but nothing better illustrates the reality of life than such individual cases, whether that be cystic fibrosis or mental health.  The individual cases bring home to us the reality of people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>Barbara and Ruth were in a committed relationship for 12 years and lived in Kilkenny.  Like many couples they decided to have a family together.  Ruth became pregnant and the couple made the decision that she would stay at home to raise their child.  Stephen was born in February 2007.  Knowing that their family had no standing in law, they moved quickly to have their wills changed to reflect their new family status.  Tragically, before they were able to sign the wills, Barbara was killed when she was struck by a truck while cycling to work.  Stephen was just eight weeks old.  Barbara&rsquo;s existing will named her parents as sole beneficiaries.  However, her parents want to honour Barbara&rsquo;s wishes and give the proceeds of her estate to Ruth and Stephen whom they recognise as their grandchild.  In gifting the estate to Ruth, large amounts of tax will have to be paid to the State.  This is the issue of non-recognition which Mrs. Margaret Gill spoke very movingly about on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>This is an example of a situation.  Pension rights could not be passed on to the surviving partner.</P>
        <P>On 25 June 2003, Fine Gael published its policy paper on civil partnership.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made a number of promises.  It is five years since the Fine Gael policy paper was published and Fianna F&aacute;il has not yet introduced legislation.  Every time the issue is raised, we are told: &ldquo;Not today but tomorrow.&rdquo;  I hope the commitment given tonight to publish the heads of the Bill by the end of March will be met.</P>
        <P>Our amendment to this motion expresses Fine Gael&rsquo;s commitment to civil partnership legislation to deal with the significant inequalities and discriminatory practices currently in place with respect to same-sex couples.  Unfortunately, due <Col N="1345"/>to the procedures of the House, we are unable to move this amendment today which is to be regretted.</P>
        <P>I congratulate Senator Norris, not just on this debate tonight but on his lifetime commitment to this issue and the overall issues surrounding equality and gay rights.  Jane Addams, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, remarked that: &ldquo;The good we secure for ourselves is precarious and uncertain until it is secured for all of us and incorporated into our common life.&rdquo;  We must now incorporate equality based on sexual orientation into our common life and law.  This is the challenge for this House and this Oireachtas.  Fine Gael will be pursuing the Government to ensure civil partnership legislation is introduced in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the Government amendment.  I do so having listened to an exceptionally measured contribution from the Minister.  If that same speech were given 12 months or two years ago, I believe we would all feel relatively happy with it.  However, the goalposts have obviously now changed, which is why the debate has taken a different turn.  I was encouraged by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement in 2006 at the launch of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution report on the family when he said:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is clear that the Committee has worked hard to get this delicate balance right.  It has taken a pragmatic and compassionate approach, rather than a legalistic or ideological one.  It is no surprise that there was not a full consensus on the Committee as regards some of its conclusions.</P>
        <P LI="1">It has laid out a strategy that does not require wholesale constitutional change.  It avoids divisive battles on issues over which people hold very strong opinions.  In particular, I find the Committee&rsquo;s reasoning on the definition of the family &mdash; and why that definition should not be changed at this time &mdash; convincing.  The reality is that the traditional family based on marriage has presented great benefits to our society.  It has given social stability and, in general, it has provided a most favourable context in which to rear children.  Many believe that to dilute the protection given to the family based on marriage would be to jeopardise the common good.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Senator Norris made a very powerful and telling speech &mdash; I would not expect anything less from such an eminent Senator.  In a way it reminded us of the deep emotions involved in this issue.  It is very easy to approach this in a clinical manner.  It is perhaps even easy to approach it in a theological manner.  However, at the end of the day human emotions are involved and they are exceptionally deep-seated emotions.  It is only when one comes across people or is a friend of people with a different sexual orientation from one&rsquo;s own that one realises they do not have two heads, <Col N="1346"/>that one is able to interact with them and that much of the stigma which existed is no longer there as a barrier or obstruction.</P>
        <P>For that reason I was exceptionally impressed by the whole tone of the discussion we have had so far this evening.  In other circumstances, as I am sure Senator Norris would agree, such as on the Order of Business this morning and yesterday when we discussed issues that I will not mention, there would be considerable interaction and heckling in a nice sense.  However, that is not the case in this debate because we realise this is a very serious and important matter &mdash; a point Senator Norris, himself, made.  It is fundamental and will obviously have an impact one way or another not just on society but also in a biological way on the very existence of the human race.  That might sound a little bit exaggerated and far-fetched.  However, we know that as the parameters are moved, new elements are brought to bear.</P>
        <P>Somebody has said it is not a child issue &mdash; I do not accept that.  Our policy needs to be child-centred in this regard.  While I accept that we have the exceptions of single parents and so on, the ideal environment in which to rear children is the traditional family with the biological parents.  I do not fully accept the findings put forward by Senator Norris.  I heard a very good discussion on radio last Sunday evening with which I was very impressed.  However, the bona fides of that finding was questioned very much.  It was seen more as a report rather than research that had been carried out in a scientific way.  I do not want to score points on that or to lower it to this point.  However, when children come into the equation we must consider what has now happened in Spain.  A birth certificate in Spain can no longer carry the names of parents by law.  One should try to tell the traditional family that in the future it is possible, given what has happened in other jurisdictions, that the parents&rsquo; names might not be permitted to appear on a birth certificate.  There is a certain degree of taking away one&rsquo;s identity.  It also takes away the continuity of the family and raises exceptionally important questions regarding succession rights, which needs to be considered.  That does not help the cause of those in same sex unions.</P>
        <P>We need to pull back somewhat from where the debate has arrived and review from whence we have come and the progress that has been made in that time.  There are many legal issues that need to be considered.  I take to heart the experience of Senator Prendergast in a hospital where a gay couple with a child could not be regarded  as the guardians or whatever.  That is of concern and we need to consider such issues.  The same is true of property rights.  It is not possible to say it is genuinely right if two people have lived together for 20 or 30 years, probably have pooled their savings and worked together to build up whatever property they have that in some way the remaining partner does not have rights in <Col N="1347"/>those cases.  I would probably even go a step further which may contradict a point made earlier.  I would not totally rule out the same rights being given to siblings of a certain age.  I am glad to see Senator Norris nodding his head.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a different issue, but I agree with the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In a way that diminishes the argument we are trying to make on behalf of same sex couples.  It is not an issue of knowing what is happening in the bedroom.  It is an issue of affection and of sharing lives together.  If we are to go down that road, the issue of siblings needs to be brought to bear.  I do not know at what age that should start or whatever the case might be.  However, we must have a discussion on the matter.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Government&rsquo;s amendment is not the usual type.  It is a chronological list of what has been done to date, which was appropriate to do.  Senator Norris would rightly get credit for some of those developments.  It is important to provide the background from whence we have come to where we are, which the amendment does.  Having listened to what the Minister said, as I understand it, we are talking about civil partnerships.  The issues and headings he outlined are comprehensive and all embracing.  Ultimately one wonders why it is necessary even to take on the bastion of the traditional family status in this case because it will create division and a negative reaction, which nobody wants in this case.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Norris on having tabled the motion.  There is too much talk in the back rooms and corridors.  Let us come in and express our views and let us not be insulting to anyone in this.  Let us learn from each other, as that is what debate should be about.  There is a considerable amount in the amendment when it is taken in light of the Minister&rsquo;s measured contribution and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement in 2006.  We have much there on which to build.</P>

T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil s&eacute; sin r&aacute;ite againn anocht.  I welcome the Minister of <Col N="1348"/>State to the House.  These issues are important.  When I first came to Dublin I did not understand the issues of equality and homophobia because rightly or wrongly I was reared in a society in Dingle where neither of them existed.  There may have been the odd schoolboy jokes about it.  I thought men and women were equal, because they were definitely equal where I was reared in Dingle-Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, An Daingean.  If people were gay and seen to be slightly different that was an accepted thing in society, no more than people with difficulties who might be different for other reasons were also accepted.  That was the kind of community in which I grew up.  When I was elected to this House initially, for the first five years I shared my office with the only acknowledged gay parliamentarian in the country.  I saw the pain he went through in terms of hate mail and other nastiness.  I made a certain commitment to myself then, which was not a difficult thing to do, that I would always support any gay rights issues that he put forward and I think I have done that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator certainly has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not always agree with everything he says and I have taken issue with some of the matters he has tabled tonight but that is not the point because I believe these issues should be discussed.  I always think of these debates in terms of how the loyal, perhaps Christian, honest, gay citizen of Ireland hears this debate.  Do people feel we are representing that person here?  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said this debate should be child-centred and I agree with him.  In retrospect, we can agree on one document &mdash; the Proclamation of the Republic &mdash; whose fourth paragraph refers to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  Those who wrote the Proclamation were not talking about juveniles but about citizens of the State.  It was probably the most powerful and fundamental comment ever made in the history of this State, although it has never been allowed into any of our Constitutions.  Had it been inserted as a constitutional provision, it would not have been necessary to hold this debate.  This is an issue of love, equality, rights and no more than that.  Over the years, I have found it so difficult to witness the reluctance with which we share our rights with people who happen to be gay.  It is despicable and I have never understood it.  I can understand people wishing to protect the institutions of the State and various other institutions and processes by which we live, but I cannot understand the reluctance with which we share our rights in a democracy.  It is wrong and I cannot cope with it.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not know the difference between civil partnership and civil marriage.  I stand for making sure people have equal rights wherever they happen to be.  It is as simple and fundamental as that.  It is an ethical and moral matter, and may be also <Col N="1349"/>a Christian and constitutional matter.  It is fundamentally an issue of humanity, which is where it must remain rooted.  Senator Frances Fitzgerald referred to the woman from middle Ireland who spoke with absolute articulation on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, for the first time ever in the public eye, to say she wanted her deceased daughter&rsquo;s child to be raised legally and properly by her daughter&rsquo;s partner.  I cannot see why that should create a difficulty for anybody in an honest and fair society.  I am talking about the right of a gay person to sit in the front pew at the funeral mass of a deceased gay partner.  That is not unreasonable.  I would echo Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s point about the right of a person to continue to live in the family home after the death of a gay partner who was the legal owner of the property.  Who can argue with these matters and why are we waiting so long to deal with them?</P>
        <P>It is easy for people to tell Senator Norris that he has gone too far but have we not learned the phrase &ldquo;Too little, too late&rdquo;?  If this matter had been dealt with when it was promised and if we had grasped the nettle, we would not be at this stage but it always seems to happen this way.  There is a clear understanding that honest and fair commitments were given which do not go beyond what any reasonable person would want.  Let us not make a big issue of this, or some sort of deal-breaker in the citizenship we all share.  Let us look at this matter in an honest, fair and balanced way.  If we root our decision in humanity, fairness and equity it will become very easy indeed.  I ask Senators to support the proposal by Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the right of same-sex couples to marry and found a family, including by adoption.  We also support the right of unmarried and same-sex couples to enter into civil partnerships, to which the motion refers.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in was the first party to try to enshrine this right in legislation, when former Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe tabled an amendment to the Civil Registration Bill 2003 to provide for equal recognition of same-sex marriage.  In 2004, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh tabled an amendment to the Equality Bill to allow for a more inclusive definition of the term &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; to recognise same-sex partnerships.  In 2005, our submission to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution called for the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; to be extended to include same-sex couples.  In our manifesto for last year&rsquo;s general election we stated that Sinn F&eacute;in in Government would &ldquo;introduce legislation to permit and recognise same-sex marriage, provide full and equal recognition of all civil partnerships in law, and recognise the right of same-sex couples to adopt children in the same manner as heterosexual couples&rdquo;.  Our record on this issue is clear and unambiguous and that is why I support the  motion proposed by Senator Norris.</P><Col N="1350"/>
        <P>I wish to focus on two issues, one of which concerns our responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has an obligation to introduce equality protections for this community under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement&rsquo;s equivalence provisions.  In Britain, the Transsexual Act 2004 and Civil Partnerships Act 2005 provide that lesbian and gay couples in the Six Counties now have broadly equivalent rights to those enjoyed by married couples.  Both the Equality Authority and NESF have called for this State to level-up its equality legislation by introducing similar provisions.  The report endorsed by the Six County Equality Authority and the Equality Commission, entitled &ldquo;Equivalence in Promoting Equality&rdquo; and published in December 2005, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">[that the reforms] need not precisely replicate UK legislation.  However, legislation is required to protect and give effect to equal treatment of transsexual people and lesbian and gay couples under the equivalence requirement [of the Good Friday Agreement].</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is, therefore, a responsibility on the Government to do this.  International instruments and court challenges can all prompt the Government to act but it should not drag its heels and wait for either to occur.  It should legislate proactively for the progression of human rights in a modern and changing society.</P>
        <P>Another step that needs to be taken urgently is one highlighted last October by the Equality Authority, namely, the need to amend the equality laws to provide protection for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgendered persons employed in religious-run schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The current law contains an exemption which allows such institutions to discriminate on the basis of a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation or family status.  This is unacceptable particularly in publicly-funded schools in the 21st century.  The exemption means that even if the Government introduces a civil partnership Bill, it would be useless for many gay and lesbian teachers who would be afraid to enter into a civil partnership because it might mean losing their jobs.  If the Government wants to demonstrate a genuine commitment to equality it cannot continue to tolerate a situation where gay and lesbian teachers can be effectively barred from employment in more than 90% of the State&rsquo;s schools, or forced to lead a double life, under so-called equality legislation.</P>
        <P>While Sinn F&eacute;in supports the right to civil partnership, it should not be seen as a substitute for the right to marry.  Full equality for gays and lesbians will be achieved only when same-sex couples can enter into either civil partnerships or marriages, according to their own choice.  I urge the Government parties to stop dithering and <Col N="1351"/>making up excuses.  They should support the motion to introduce legislation immediately in the interest of basic equality and human rights for the gay and lesbian community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government states that the Government is &ldquo;committed to full equality for all in society&rdquo;.  It goes on to state, &ldquo;Taking account of the options paper prepared by the Colley group, we will legislate for civil partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government.&rdquo;  I welcome this commitment to &ldquo;full equality&rdquo; and to legislate for civil partnerships.  The two commitments go hand in hand and complement each other.  They represent the working out of the principle of equality, as enshrined in the Constitution, EU treaties and international human rights conventions, which has led to considerable changes for the better in the legislative rights and institutional protections for gay and lesbian members of our society in the past 15 years.</P>
        <P>The passing of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 was a momentous achievement which brought to an end a long history of criminalisation of homosexual practices.  It reflected the perseverance over many years of a Member of this House, Senator Norris, in campaigning for such a change.  The commitment of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, to persuading the wider public of the fairness, equity and appropriateness of the change was also a crucial factor.  Bringing the wider public along with the wisdom of supporting changes in acceptable sexual mores or the nature of the family unit is as desirable now as it was in the case of the decriminalisation of homosexual practices in 1993.</P>
        <P>The equality legislation enacted in subsequent years marked the continued progression of the achievement of equity for gay and lesbian citizens.  The Employment Equality Act 1998 outlaws discrimination in accessing employment and conditions of employment and the Equal Status Act 2000 prohibits discrimination in the supply of goods and services to anyone because of their sexualorientation.  The Equality Authority is active in promoting compliance with these legislative rights.</P>
        <P>Another legislative milestone in the progression of rights and protections for gay and lesbian persons will shortly come before us, namely, the legislation for civil partnerships.  This is a difficult and emotional issue for many people in our society who will see it as a further erosion of what they consider the core of our society, namely, the traditional heterosexual family unit.  That perspective is enshrined in our Constitution, at Article 41.3.1, which states, &ldquo;the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded&rdquo; and to protect it against attack .</P><Col N="1352"/>
        <P>It is incumbent on us as legislators to respect and recognise the fears and apprehensions of many of our fellow citizens that civil partnership legislation may represent a further weakening of the traditional family unit.  It is further incumbent on us to do our best to respond to these genuinely held fears of new legislation, as M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn did so well in 1993, by explaining with our own conviction that civil partnership legislation provides rights and protections in law to same sex couples that any decent society would seek to provide.</P>
        <P>I fully support the protections the civil partnership legislation will provide.  It is a further mark of our maturity as a society and the sense of decency and fairness we would like to see embedded in our laws to provide these protections.  There are many, including those proposing this motion, who regard the civil partnership legislation as insufficient.  I contend that it marks a substantial step forward.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; observed, what we are doing now would have been seen as progressive only a year ago.  There is a clear urgency on the part of the Government in putting in place the rights and protections of civil partnerships for thousands of our fellow citizens.  We look forward to same sex couples availing of the right to civil partnerships at the earliest possible date and enabling them to celebrate their new status.  The discussion of the differences between civil partnerships and traditional marriage is one for another day, taking account of the constitutional and social issues involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s motion and oppose the amendments put forward.  Having been detained in a committee meeting for the past two hours, I have not had an opportunity to hear any of my colleagues&rsquo; contributions, so I am somewhat constrained in responding to the debate.  We all know that the married family, if I can call it that, is at the heart of our Constitution.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the family, as characterised by the union of two persons in marriage, enjoys inalienable and imprescriptable rights.  So much of our jurisprudence in regard to the family and children has flown from this fundamental and repeatedly sanctioned principle.</P>
        <P>The rights of persons in a family characterised by marriage are immeasurably greater than those enjoyed by others.  Senator Norris makes an unanswerable argument when he states that for as long as we have an exclusion on the rights of gay people to get married, there will remain at the heart of our constitutional system and our society a fundamental inequality.  &ldquo;Marriage trumps everything&rdquo; was a phrase used by one of the lawyers in the discussion we had earlier on the proposed children&rsquo;s rights referendum.  Marriage is at the core of everything.  With respect to my colleagues on the other side of the House, it is not enough for the Minister or others to present a list of all the positive developments that have <Col N="1353"/>taken place in this area as if they were gifts to gay people, as if employment and equality legislation and other developments are somehow to be regarded as enough.  The attitude is, &ldquo;You have these concessions, be happy.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I wholeheartedly support Senator Norris&rsquo;s position that it is not enough to say these developments, important and fundamental as they are, have been achieved.  To establish true equality, we must extend the right to marry to gay persons.  It is a question of political courage.  The Minister said in his speech that if a proposal of this type were put to the people, it would be deeply divisive and would not necessarily be passed.  Deeply divisive proposals have been put to the electorate before.  More than that, many of the proposals put to the people were inherently divisive.  Nobody looks for division or seeks to be divisive but these difficult issues must be addressed.  It is not enough to state that we should shy away from them because of the likelihood of a potentially divisive and difficult public debate.  That is not how legislators should behave.  This is a time for courage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Having listened to this civilised and important debate, I am glad I put down this motion.  There seems to be a type of <i>zeitgeist</i> at play, with the Gilligan-Zappone case and the work done by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN.  I honour the work done by all these people.  It was pure fluke that the briefing to which I referred took place today.  It was interesting that only two Senators spoke in favour of discrimination and against equality, neither of whom materialised at that briefing.  Their absence was regrettable because we all have much to learn from each other.</P>
        <P>I agree completely with what Senator Alex White said.  It is time to have courage.  I do not want to smuggle something in under the carpet without discussion with the people.  Let us have that discussion; I will be delighted to campaign for change.  We must have the courage to put the proposal to the people.  I guarantee we will win.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mary White are absolutely right that if this change had been initiated four years ago, when I first put forward the Bill, I would have welcomed it as prophetic and visionary.  Now, however, change is coming in dribs and drabs, parsimoniously, and there is no vision.  The problem is that what is proposed does not represent equality.  With the greatest respect, equality is not what Senator Mullen thinks it is when he proposes to share time equally, as he said, with Senator O&rsquo;Toole but proceeds to speak for the full eight minutes, thus denying Senator O&rsquo;Toole the opportunity to speak.  If that is his notion of equality, I am not surprised he took the view he did.  He dismissed every major international and reputable authority and report.  I will not list them all again but if they do not convince him, it is a case of what might be described in <Col N="1354"/>theological terms as invincible ignorance.  I cannot help him.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I know what equality is.  Equality is 2+3=5 and not just in those cases where &ldquo;2&rdquo; is a man and &ldquo;3&rdquo; is a woman.  If both are men or both are women, it is still five, not four and a half or four and three quarters.  That is not equality.  Even I know enough arithmetic to know that is the case.  It is a cause for concern.  That is why I am glad that we got through today.  There will be a vote.  The members of the Government parties will vote not in favour of my proposal but clearly in favour of civil partnership.  That is an advance.  We have done that, at least, by raising the bar.  I would like the Minister of State to bring back to his Cabinet colleagues a request for us to be given details of the timing of this move.</P>
        <P>I am glad that Margaret Gill, who gave a remarkable performance on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, was mentioned.  Mrs. Gill is from Edenderry, County Offaly, which is the heart of Ireland.  I am proud to say that my family also comes from the bogs of Ireland, which is the real Ireland.  The woman in question expressed her concern for her grandchild.  There is clear evidence that the love of a parent for his or her child &mdash; the parent&rsquo;s capacity to give love to the child to help him or her to grow &mdash; is central to good parenting.  It was interesting that neither of the Senators who spoke against equality mentioned the word &ldquo;love&rdquo;, which is what we want.  As gay people, we are entitled to celebrate our sexuality.  We do not want it to be neutered.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s point that siblings must be looked after.  However, we should not neuter the relationships between gay people.  They should be entitled to celebrate joyfully their sexual union, express their pleasure and show their commitment to each other.  It astonishes me that those very voices who used to complain about promiscuity in the gay community are now belly-aching because gay people are emphasising the importance of commitment.  Such logic confuses me.  Gay people were committed to each other during those evil days when homosexuality was a major criminal offence.  I have been to 20th, 25th and 30th anniversary celebrations in the past year.  The 25th anniversary celebration honoured my successor in the National Gay Federation, Eamonn, and his companion, Tom&aacute;s.  I was at a wedding in the Unitarian Church of a couple who have been known to me for many years.  They lived together for five years before they were able to get married.  I honour the clergyman who performed the ceremony.  I do not see any reason priests should not give blessings.  I have seen priests of various denominations blessing war planes, bombs, ploughs and goldfish.  I do not know how the priest who blessed the goldfish knew they were not lesbian &mdash; with goldfish, it is extremely difficult to tell.  We need to look beyond these things.</P><Col N="1355"/>
        <P>I urge all Members of the House to read the briefing prepared by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, which lists the technical disadvantages faced by gay couples in areas like tax, inheritance and the giving of evidence.  I honour the representatives of MarriagEquality.  I have thrown myself behind what they have to say.  Having mentioned Margaret Gill, I would like to mention some other wonderful people.  I encourage Senators to read the article written by Terry Prone in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of Monday, 18 February last.  Ms Prone wrote about a wonderful, talented and committed person with whom she worked.  It is only at the end of the article that one realises it is about a woman who is in a relationship with another woman.  The final lines of the article read:</P>
        <P LI="1">I still hope to attend a wedding in the not too distant future.  Of my gay friend.  The girl who designed a calendar in memory of her mother.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a tribute to love, as is a marvellous article by R&oacute;is&iacute;n Ingle in <i>The Irish Times</i> about Orla Howard, her partner Gr&aacute;inne and Gr&aacute;inne&rsquo;s daughters.  The article states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Seventeen-year-old Clare O&rsquo;Connell knew exactly the message she wanted to get across to her local TDs when she and her family met them to discuss the issue of same-sex marriage in Leinster House earlier this week.  We go to school and play basketball and listen to music.  We eat pasta and do our homework.  It&rsquo;s not radical, we don&rsquo;t live in a hippy commune and the only difference is that we have two women as parents.  I just want to know whether the politicians think it&rsquo;s right that my Mum and her partner are not allowed to get married.  I just want them to see that our family is normal, almost boring, really.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The photograph that accompanied the article shows us that the two girls are lovely.  It is clearly a happy, joyful, good and wholesome family.  The final lines of the article read:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;I think people are afraid of the unknown&rdquo;, says Clare, while Daire says that living with two women as parents has made her and her sister very open-minded.  &ldquo;There are people around the country who might never have even met a gay person and so they might have concerns about us having gay parents, but look at me and Daire, we are not that bad are we?&rdquo;  Not bad at all.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Those who think they have never met a gay person can take it from me that they have.  Every Member of this House has a gay member of his or her family.  A Member of the other House who used to regularly rail against gay people approached me in the car park of Leinster House approximately two years ago to tell me that his <Col N="1356"/>son had told him he was gay.  When I asked the Deputy what he had said to his son, he told me he had said, &ldquo;I love you.  You are my son and you will always be my son.  You will always have my love&rdquo;.  I think that was the right thing to say.  Is it not extraordinary how things can come home to roost in such a manner?</P>
        <P>It is important that I refer to the American Psychiatric Association&rsquo;s statement which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">No research has shown that the children raised by lesbians and gay men are less well adjusted than those reared within heterosexual relationships.  As the population ages, the denial of legal recognition of civil marriage has consequences for increasing numbers of older adults in same-sex relationships who face age-related health and financial concerns.  Excluding these adults from civil marriage protections of survivorship and inheritance rights, financial benefits, and legal recognition as a couple in health care settings increases the psychological burden associated with aging.  The American Psychiatric Association has historically supported equity, parity, and non-discrimination in matters that have an impact on mental health.  APA has also supported same-sex civil unions and the right of same-sex couples to adopt and co-parent children.</P>
        <P>I accept that I may have been slightly shrill and emotional earlier in this debate.  I said that some people are mean-minded and I do not take a word of it back.  The contribution made by my friend, Senator Walsh, was a classic example of what I am talking about.  Is it not mean-minded to say we cannot give tax equality to homosexuals because it would cost money?  Darling, I pay taxes too.  If fairies were exempt from paying tax, I would forget about marriage.  If the Government gets rid of income tax for gay people, I will accept Senator Walsh&rsquo;s position on this issue.  With respect, I will not take any guff from him until he does that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with responsibility for drugs strategy and community affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, and thank him for taking this Adjournment matter regarding the need to outline the reason the benchmarking pay award has not been paid to some staff who work for local drugs task forces.</P>
        <P>It has been brought to my attention that employees of the Clondalkin drugs task force, which is in my constituency, received a Labour Court decision in 2005 that, for the purposes of <Col N="1358"/>pay, they should be aligned to HSE grades and for that reason should be eligible for benchmarking payments.  Subsequent meetings held between the Department of Finance and IMPACT on behalf of the employees resulted in an agreement by the Department that the payments should be awarded to the staff members.  However, the HSE, as one of the main funding sources for drugs task forces, has proved unwilling to seriously engage in terms of facilitating the award.  The resulting uncertainty among groups which are trying to address the issue of drugs can be imagined.  It means that people who do valuable work in the community are leaving certain projects for other employment and it is a complete disincentive for recruitment.  Unease has arisen because colleagues are being paid different rates for effectively doing the same job and a number of people are on lesser salaries than more recently recruited staff.  These anomalies are creating uncertainty and unhappiness for staff of the drugs task forces.</P>
        <P>I attended a meeting at which people working on a variety of projects came together to consider their next steps.  I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to inform the House whether he hopes progress can be made.  If the Labour Court ruled that the payment should be made and if the Department of Finance, unusually, concurred with that view, there is no reason for a State body such as the HSE to stand in the way.  I urge the Minister of State to intervene with the HSE to <Col N="1359"/>facilitate the payment of the award to the relevant employees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Members will be fully conversant with the background to the establishment of local drugs taskforces, LDTFs, as a result of the Rabbitte report.  Staff were seconded to the task forces from the health boards and development workers and other staff were recruited.  At the end of the first round, some projects were mainstreamed into Departments and Government agencies.  That is the point at which the anomalies began to arise.  The situation has developed in that regional drugs taskforces, RDTFs, are in place throughout the country.  An attempt has been made to ensure the anomalies which arose in the early days are not replicated.</P>
        <P>LDTFs were established in 1997 in the areas considered to be experiencing the worst levels of opiate misuse and are an important element of the Government&rsquo;s overall response to tackling drug misuse.  Twelve areas in Dublin were identified and Cork city and Bray were added in 2000.  The work of the LDTFs is an important element of the overall national drugs strategy.  Their role is to prepare and implement local action plans which aim to identify existing and emerging gaps in services in respect of each of the pillars of the strategy and to support a range of measures for treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply.  In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services and strategies in these areas while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of services.  The measures being implemented by the LDTFs are designed to complement and add value to the range of interventions being delivered through State agencies.</P>
        <P>Membership of the LDTFs comprises representatives of all the relevant agencies, including Departments, the Health Service Executive, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the probation and welfare service, relevant local authorities, elected public representatives, the youth service, F&Aacute;S, voluntary agencies and community representatives.  More than 440 community based projects, including those under the emerging needs fund, have been established across the 14 LDTF areas, with employment of more than 300 people.  The type of projects being supported range from delivering services such as advice and support for drug misusers and their families, community drug teams offering treatment, outreach and crisis intervention services and drug training programmes for community groups.  The 2008 current allocation for the LDTFs is &euro;22 million and they can also avail of capital funding under the premises initiative.</P><Col N="1360"/>
        <P>The ten RDTFs were set up in 2003 to cover all parts of the country not covered by an LDTF and thus achieving full coverage of the country.  Following extensive consultation processes, each RDTF prepared a strategic plan and the implementation of these plans is now progressing.  With the increased level of activity at RDTF level, I am satisfied that drug task forces are making considerable progress across the country in regard to the problems of illicit drugs.</P>
        <P>My Department has started taking the initial steps that will lead to the drafting of a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009-16.  I have established a steering group comprising representatives of the key statutory, community and voluntary players to make recommendations to me on a new strategy.  Its work will include extensive consultation with various interested parties and the public at large.  Advertisements appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s national newspapers inviting submissions on the scope and direction of the new strategy by 4 April.  However, we will be happy to accept submissions from organisations subsequent to that date.  I encourage Members and everyone else with an interest in this area to take the opportunity over the coming months to make an input into the new strategy.</P>
        <P>All the LDTFs have undertaken a strategic review and planning process which is a stocktaking exercise on the needs to be addressed in their areas.  This process will help to form a view as to the extent to which current service provision meets the identified needs under the pillars of the NDS, inform partnership-collaborative working for the delivery of essential local services and determine future priorities.  In this way, the knowledge, experience and expertise of the LDTFs will continue to be acknowledged and will help shape the national drugs strategy 2009-16.</P>
        <P>I turn to the issue the Senator raised.  My Department has been working closely with the Department of Finance, IMPACT, the local drugs task force in question and other project representatives and liaising with the national drugs strategy team on the salary adjustment process for workers on interim funded LDTF projects.</P>
        <P>A productivity, flexibility, modernisation and verification template has been agreed by all the parties I mentioned.  Adjusted scales, payment of arrears and application of the Towards 2016 increases that may become due in March and September 2008 are conditional on the template being signed up to by each interim funded project.</P>
        <P>The template identifies four areas to be delivered on by the projects, such as quality service delivery covering, among others, measures such as agreeing and implementing a customer charter and a customer complaints procedure.  Under performance management, job descriptions, key competencies and objectives with target dates and performance measurement indicators would be drawn up with a commitment to increased <Col N="1361"/>flexibility in regard to working arrangements.  The effectiveness audit and value for money element relate to a process of ongoing review of services delivered to confirm their continued relevance to customer needs and whether they represent the best use of resources.  Promote Partnership Working promotes working across agencies and projects to better meet the needs of the customers.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The LDTF in question has completed the template.  In association with the Department of Finance and the NDST, my officials are examining the arrears claims for the workers involved and when they are satisfied the information provided is in order, the appropriate payments will be processed.  I expect this process to be finalised shortly.</P>
        <P>A number of other issues arise in the context of the way this process has developed over the past ten years or so.  Not all of them are at the stage of final resolution.  The national drugs strategy team, the officials in my Department and in the Department of Finance and the union concerned are extremely anxious to reach a solution in respect of all the outstanding matters.  I am very committed to ensuring they are resolved.  We will not be in a position to roll out the next phase of the strategy unless outstanding issues, such as this, are put to bed.</P>
        <P>The Senator referred to the HSE and other organisations in which projects have been mainstreamed.  I do not want to anticipate difficulties but I do not anticipate an easy resolution to some of the issues.  In so far as we can, we will be able to resolve most of them.</P>

	<P>I welcome an tAire St&aacute;it and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the issue of respite care beds in St. Laurence Cheshire Home in Cork. </P><Col N="1362"/>
        <P>There is an ongoing difficulty between the HSE and St. Laurence Cheshire Home, where there has been a reduction from three to one in the number of respite care beds.

Families which were, in some cases, in receipt of four to five periods of respite care are now in receipt of one.  The HSE has said to St. Laurence Cheshire Home and the families concerned that it is a question of funding and that the beds are there but that it does not have the resources to provide the necessary staff.</P>
        <P>I will not give the Minister of State, who is sympathetic to the issue, a lecture on the positive impact of respite care.  That is not what I am here for.  We need to support the families.  If we are serious about reducing dependency on long-stay care beds, we need to adequately resource respite care.</P>
        <P>I understand there was a meeting yesterday between St. Laurence Cheshire Home and the HSE and that there has been some tick-tacking.  To my knowledge, no undertaking has been given as to when resources will be provided for staff.  I have been led to believe the HSE has asked St. Laurence Cheshire Home to reinstate the beds but no guarantee has been given.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this important issue.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>As Senator Buttimer knows, St. Laurence Cheshire Home is part of the national group Cheshire Ireland.  The facility provides long-term residential accommodation for 30 people with a disability.  Three respite care beds are located within the facility for people with a physical and sensory disability.  St. Laurence Cheshire Home receives &euro;1.8 million on an annual basis from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I have been advised that the Health Service Executive met the regional manager of Cheshire yesterday and that the regional manager of St. Laurence Cheshire Home closed the respite beds in order to provide additional staff for the residential service at the home.  The Health Service Executive has now given an undertaking to source funding for the posts required in the residential service to provide the additional cover required.  In the meantime, the Health Service Executive is referring those people with a disability that require respite care to an alternative facility.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also requested that the respite care beds be reinstated with immediate effect.  I have been informed that the regional manager of St. Laurence has undertaken to report back to senior management at Cheshire Ireland and to <Col N="1363"/>contact the lead local health manager in regard to the reinstatement of the respite service at St. Laurence Cheshire Home.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the multi-annual investment programme 2006-09 outlines this Government&rsquo;s commitment to a programme of revenue and capital expenditure amounting in total to approximately &euro;900 million on specific disability support services.  The bulk of this funding is being spent in the health services.  As part of the multi-annual investment programme under the national disability strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional &euro;75 million in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding included moneys to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities to implement the Disability Act 2005.  The Government is also honouring its commitment to people with disabilities with a further additional &euro;50 million investment which was announced in the 2008 budget.  It is estimated that more than &euro;1.8 billion <Col N="1364"/>is spent on health and personal social services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>Again, I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this issue and I trust the response will allay the concerns he outlined.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Will he get a guarantee from the HSE that we will have the same level of entitlement to respite care and the same access as last year?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Devins, is unavoidably absent as he is away on Government business.  However, I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention upon his return.</P>
