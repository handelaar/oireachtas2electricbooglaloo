        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on the Finn Valley College building project in County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline a timeframe for the delivery of the proposed second-level school for South Lucan on lands at Kishoge Cross which she has agreed to in its submission to South Dublin County Council on variations to the Clonburris local area plan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the efforts, if any, currently being made, to pursue the provision of a cross-Border or Border business park in the north east Donegal area given the ongoing interest in this concept in the north west for many years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the length of time that capital funding will continue to be unavailable to Good Counsel College, New Ross, County Wexford, due to the on-going discussions regarding school amalgamations in the New Ross area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Diseases of Animals Act, back from committee, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No 2, Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008, Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to adjourn not later than 1 p.m. if not previously concluded and to resume at the conclusion of No. 18 if not previously concluded; No. 3 early signature motion re Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008 to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2; and No. 18, all-party motion No. 34, re cluster munitions, Senators may speak for seven minutes and may share time with agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I spoke about the reviews being done into the incidents in Portlaoise and asked for time in the House to discuss them.  Having seen and read the reports and seen the commentary on them today, I am certain this House needs to spend time as soon as possible discussing them and analysing their implications for the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE and for how our health services are run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are extraordinary reports.  John Fitzgerald&rsquo;s report, which is an investigation into the crisis in Portlaoise, shows how the HSE acted.  If this is how it behaves in a crisis how does the system work the rest of the time?  The report states clear communication problems exist within the HSE.  Too many people are doing too many jobs and do not know what are other peoples&rsquo; jobs.  There is confusion and uncertainty about roles with a lack of authority and responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Department of Health and Children are ghost-like figures.  Their roles are completely unclear as is whether they have any impact.  The report does not find anyone responsible for anything which happened and <Col N="1639"/>speaks about a systems failure.  There is no such thing as a systems failure.  Somebody somewhere is responsible.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point I made yesterday that we must discuss this as a priority.  For this House to be seen as relevant, these reports should be discussed here next week and I hope the Leader can arrange this.  In any other country, these reports would be a resigning matter for somebody somewhere.  They are not in this country and business goes on as usual.  The very least we can do is discuss it here.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise a point made today on transport.  The Government was re-elected because it told the people it could successfully manage the economy and various projects.  The lie of this is shown today in reports on Transport 21 and the delivery of projects.  Again and again, we see projects delayed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The join-up of the Luas, due to open in 2008, does not have a completion date.  The Luas extension from Connolly Station to the docklands is delayed by another year.  The Luas Tallaght to Citywest route has been delayed from 2008 to 2010 at least.  The Cork to Midleton commuter rail line has been delayed from this year to 2009.  Portlaoise train depot, which was due to open last year, is still not opened.  The completion of the M3 motorway has been put back from 2009 to 2010.  It goes on.  The metro from the city centre to Dublin Airport has been put back from 2012 to 2013 and this probably underestimates the time.</P>
        <P>Who manages the economy and infrastructure development?  Why are there no targets or proper deadlines?  It exposes the lie that the Government can manage the country and projects well.  Commuters in Dublin pay the price every day for this mismanagement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to refer to the Portlaoise report.  Looking at it from a disinterested point of view in terms of trying to take the patient and emotion out of it, extraordinary questions must be asked on both sides of the House about the process.  This is not a matter solely for the Opposition benches.  I do not want to make this into a political issue.  However, I want to know how the risk register was applied to Portlaoise hospital.  What was supposed to be happening there and what was not?  What were the key performance indicators required for that area?  I want to know if people&rsquo;s bonuses was tied into it.  Were there mid-year reviews?  How could it happen that people were using out-of-date equipment?  Management must take responsibility for that.  Someone in management was aware and decided to use out-of-date equipment.  We need to know why and who these people are.</P><Col N="1640"/>
        <P>I am interested in the Portlaoise case not because it has been dealt with badly but because I want to know about the rest of the system and how it is run.  Can we have a discussion on how the health system is run, without referring to any particular hospital, as if we were a board of directors getting a clear description of how it does its business?</P>
        <P>In any small operation in the public service &mdash; I am involved in several semi-State bodies &mdash; at every board meeting there is an outline of which checks and balances were applied every quarter.  An outside auditor is brought in to verify the system.  Fail-safe measures in the system are tested to check if they are sufficiently robust and flexible.</P>
        <P>These are expected in ordinary operations but it does not seem to be happening in the health service.  I am not having a go at the Government or advisers.  I just want to know what they are doing.  The recent higher remuneration report assessed a particular management group in the Health Service Executive and admitted it did not know what they were doing.  That cannot be in anyone&rsquo;s interests.  I want a debate on this to ensure moneys are spent properly.</P>
        <P>Many commuters living in Dublin and the surrounding counties would be delighted not to have to drive into Dublin city and use park-and-ride facilities instead.  However, there are no such facilities on the city&rsquo;s north side, the M1, M2, M3, M4 or M7.  People are forced either to drive into the city or leave their cars at pubs and hotels in the outlying areas.  Providing park-and-ride facilities is one small thing we could do.  The commitment to provide more buses and regular rail routes needs to be re-examined.  I accept Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has significantly improved many routes but much more can be done.</P>
        <P>In 2006 the House passed the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  The proposals made last October for re-opening of the Navan rail line got full clearance last week owing to this legislation.  We need to see more of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On a day when several Ministers are attending a conference on practical transport initiatives to tackle climate change, it is extraordinary that not one of the flagship transport projects referred to by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Fitzgerald will be delivered on time.  During the debates in the House on the economy and public infrastructure, we must sit through Ministers listing off initiatives and projects, allegedly under way, and the price tag to go with them.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers contain lists of flagship infrastructure projects, essential for the economy and of social benefit to communities, which the Minister for Transport acknowledges will not be delivered on time. He made the extraordinary admission that he was not concerned about the slippage on the project timelines, proclaiming the times given were indicative dates.</P><Col N="1641"/>
        <P>Why does the Government give indicative dates if they are not to be taken seriously?  Is this a signal to the people that when an indicative date is given for any project, it should be ignored as it counts for nothing?  The Minister claims he, like many others, spends two hours every day travelling in the car to Dublin, as if that would make us all feel okay and he would feel the pain of the rest of the community.  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>After ten years of prosperity, which the Leader tells us about every second day in his response to the Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is actually 11 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and all the fantastic achievements he loves to detail to us, how can it be that not one of these flagship projects will be delivered on time?  The massive economic and social impact these delays will have must be faced up to.  It is a matter for the Government, as Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Fitzgerald stated earlier.</P>
        <P>The constant attempt to off-load responsibility to other agencies, notably in the health services, is extraordinary and says something about our system.  Four months ago the House debated the health services.  Members said not to blame the Minister for Health and Children for individual problems in hospitals.  While I accept the Minister cannot be held individually responsible for such problems, she can and must be held responsible for the system itself.</P>
        <P>We were told four months ago there would be changes.  There is this constant sense that something is going to happen in the future but never does.  Instead, today we have a Kafkaesque report on the health services where no one is responsible, as Senator Fitzgerald rightly said.  One has to pinch oneself to see if there is any reality in what the Government says.  There must be ministerial and Government accountability and collective Cabinet responsibility on issues such as public transport and health.  I repeat my call for a debate on public transport.</P>
        <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 15, Protection of Employees (Agency Workers)(No. 2) Bill 2008, First Stage, be taken today.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to congratulate Dmitry Medvedev on his election to the presidency of Russia?  For Russians living in Ireland, polls were held in Limerick and Dublin at which Mr. Medvedev got more than 80% of the vote.  The OECD questioned the influence of the Russian media on the election results.  Whereas the Irish media would have given open, and in some cases not very knowledgeable, views as to what is happening in Russia, Mr. Medvedev achieved an 80% vote among Russians living here, many of them young.  It is a country with a great future and I ask the Leader to pass on our congratu<Col N="1642"/>lations and best wishes for the future to Mr. Medvedev.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my call for a debate on Northern Ireland as it would be timely with Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s announcement to step down.  Cometh the hour, cometh the man.  Without Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s support and saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, progress in the Northern Ireland process would have stalled.  While it was a dramatic conversion for the man, all Members are glad to see devolved government operating well in Northern Ireland.  All members would hope Dr. Paisley&rsquo;s successor will continue what he did in the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Bill on the Lisbon treaty will soon be published.  When will the Taoiseach set the date for the referendum?  Yesterday, Senator Regan said much information available on the treaty can be accessed at the European forum and elsewhere.  However, the ordinary man on the street knows very little about this treaty.  It is essential the Government, without delay, sends out a clear message on what this treaty is all about.</P>
        <P>Senators received correspondence today from the nephew of a gentleman who was killed recently in a collision between his car and a train at a manually operated railway crossing near Straide in County Mayo.  We should try to get rid of these manually operated crossings.  It is essential that automatic barriers be placed in these areas to negate the element of human error.  I ask that the Minister investigate this and ask Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to ensure the safety of passengers and those crossing at these points on a daily basis is of paramount importance.  I ask the Minister to act on this as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Fitzgerald to the Leader for a debate on the recently published reports on the health system, and particularly the Portlaoise report.  In addition, I fully endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Cummins about Dr. Paisley and his call for a debate on the North, which was also mentioned yesterday.  I add my voice to these and hope that the Leader can arrange such a debate as early as possible.</P>
        <P>I recently referred to the deaths of two white-tailed sea eagles in County Kerry.  Unfortunately, it has since been confirmed that they were poisoned.  Sadly, a third eagle that was thought to have died of natural causes was also found to have been poisoned.  A drug named Trodax was found in the carcasses along with a licensed poison.  I accept that these poisons were put out to catch foxes and other vermin before the lambing season, but these birds have been absent from our shores for more than 100 years and are a wonderful tourist attraction.  People are coming from far and wide to see them.  Indiscriminate poisoning is wrong, dangerous and contrary to law.  I appeal to farmers in this regard.  I have total sympathy when it comes to foxes and other vermin, but we <Col N="1643"/>have now lost three of the 15 sea eagles reintroduced to County Kerry and we do not want to lose any more.  They have been absent for too long.  I remind the Cathaoirleach and my other colleagues that they are very welcome to come to Killarney to see these eagles.  Hundreds of people are coming to see them, and it is hoped the number will soon be in the thousands.  I extend that invitation to all Senators again.</P>
        <P>When will the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which provides for a legal services ombudsman, be taken in the House?  I ask the Leader to indicate this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Cummins for a debate on Northern Ireland, as was mentioned on the Order of Business yesterday.  Over the years we have had some very significant debates on this issue but they were permeated by a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.  I wish Dr. Paisley well in his retirement.  Over the years I found little to agree with in what he said but in latter times he has shown himself to be a fine leader.  Even though we did disagree with him, I always felt he had a moral focus.  He believed what he was saying.  He was transparent to the extent that one knew what was in his mind.  I often feel that public debate would be the richer if everybody could be so transparent.</P>
        <P>Many people are stunned by the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland.  The peace process has been so successful, and in such a short time, that people are perhaps taking it for granted.  As people are jockeying for position in the new set-up in Northern Ireland there is a grave danger that new agendas will be promoted.  We must be vigilant about this and keep in touch with what is going on.  We must continue the interaction we have had and cultivate the respect that has been developed among all traditions on this island in recent years.  We cannot take anything for granted.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive debate is important.  It would be different from previous debates in that we would be dealing not just with the reality of the current situation but with the huge potential for the future.  The Seanad, in particular, must play a central role in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The quarterly national household survey was published yesterday, and it contains good news.  The number of people working in Ireland in the final quarter of 2007 was 66,800 greater than in the previous year.  We do not hear these figures often enough.  There is major success in the economy.  Yes, there were drops in construction jobs, but more jobs were created in services.  I suggest that not just in these Houses but in the country as a whole we take a much more positive, forward-looking attitude to what is happening rather than talking ourselves into pessimism and recession.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am impressed with these figures, which we do not often hear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met with the US Secretary of Commerce last year, and he said that his responsibility was to create an environment in which entrepreneurs could create jobs.  The reason I mention this is that the jobs being created in Ireland are coming from indigenous industries and services.  While we have relied to a large extent on foreign direct investment in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future, let us make sure we make our economy attractive to indigenous entrepreneurs, to those who are carrying out research and innovation, and to those who are creating those jobs and ensuring a successful economy in the future.  Let us not talk ourselves into pessimism but maintain a certain degree of optimism, because I see a great deal about which to be optimistic in the future.</P>
        <P>My family accuse me of being mean.  They accuse me of being so careful with my money that I gather up 1-cent pieces that everyone else leaves behind and pay for my newspaper with them.  I seem to be the only person who picks up 1-cent pieces.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the breakdown in community life.  We have not had the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the House since we came back.  Last night when I was walking back to my hotel I encountered eight people urinating on the streets.  I stopped and counted as I was going along.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It may seem funny but it is not a joke.  We are talking about civility and respect.  I was appalled at this behaviour.  It leads me to a point about Irish society.  Today we have major investment in the RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and Leader programmes, but we need to have a real <Col N="1645"/>debate on community life and how we can enhance this in our country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in requesting a debate on the Health Service Executive, not in any specific area but on its generic remit.  This morning in our newspapers we see that Professor Drumm is talking about another cutback of &euro;300 million.  A &euro;200 million cutback was imposed last September.  To whom is the HSE accountable?  What is it doing?  Who are all these faceless bureaucrats?  Let us have a debate on the role of the HSE and, if necessary, let us call for its disbandment and a return to the old health board system.</P>

	<P>The recent downturn in the construction sector was commented on earlier.  Yesterday the Taoiseach said the downturn was one of the reasons for the drop in tax receipts.  Senator Quinn mentioned the quarterly household survey that was published recently.  That showed that in the last quarter more than 5,500 people have left the construction sector.  Everybody knows the residential construction market is cyclical.  We now have a trained workforce and it is time we put it to use on public transport infrastructure projects.  I was particularly disappointed to learn that no major public transport infrastructure project will be delivered on time.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, might not be concerned but it appears the fast train to Navan will now resemble the slow boat to China.  There must be a programme for the implementation of new public transport infrastructure projects.  We have a trained workforce, and let us use it.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11- ?><Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This week one of my colleagues objected to the use of language by a Member on the Government side of the House because he used the word &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; regarding the situation in Israel.  I maintained it was a matter of proportion and I still do.  I know something about the use of language and when 125 people, mainly civilians and including four children, are killed by the armed forces of a legitimate government as a matter of policy and in order, according to one Israeli Minister, to send a message to Hamas, it is slaughter and a massacre.  That is the appropriate language.  It is regrettable that my colleague and friend said that this type of debate provokes unreasonable passions and anti-Israeli feeling &ldquo;which is ingrained in the minds of some Members of this House&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>It is not ingrained in my mind.  I am the only person in this House who has lived in Israel for substantial periods over the last 30 years.  I know the country very well and I have always supported its right to exist.  However, I am very concerned when an Israeli Minister uses the word <i>shoah</i> because I know what the word means to the Israelis and the Jews.  People like myself are attacked when we use words such as apartheid to describe the fact that certain roads are reserved <Col N="1646"/>for Jewish citizens of Israel and people, even Israeli citizens, can be taken to court and jailed for taking Palestinians on them.  That is apartheid.  Ghettos exist and if an Israeli Minister can use the word <i>shoah</i>, I will use the word apartheid.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>Amnesty International, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam have combined to issue a statement today about the blockade by Israel.  They say the conditions in Gaza are the worst in 40 years and that they constitute collective punishment.  That is a war crime under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.  Yesterday, I received a communication from the chairman of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, housing committee who is on a visit to Israel and Palestine and is totally neutral.  He went with some Palestinian people to make a protest at the wall, as he had gone to other events with Israelis.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The protest against the wall was festive and accompanied by music....  At the security fence a symbolic coffin was put in place and the man who had carried it turned to leave at which point, and without any provocation whatsoever, [this occurred inside Palestine] the Israeli Army who were observing the protest opened fire hitting the man and subsequently hitting several other people with some form of plastic bullet, the injured people were taken away by ambulances.  The army then advanced through a fence in front of the wall and from concealment in fields to the west (I think) of the village road, all the time firing plastic bullets, and tear gas as they advanced.  We were shocked and terrified ..... At least two live rounds appear to have been fired.  The army continued firing and advancing on us....</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is appalling.  They were then allowed to go back to their buses but this was an unprovoked attack by the Israeli army, with rubber bullets and live ammunition, on a peaceful demonstration within the state of Palestine.  The reason I and others raise these issues is that they involve the official army of the state against unarmed civilians.  We must use this type of language because the people in Palestine and Gaza are defenceless.</P>
        <P>I am not attacking the people of Israel, whom I love and among whom I lived for many years.  The restaurant we regularly went to for celebrations, Savion, at the triangle near the president&rsquo;s house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I rise to support my good friend and colleague, Senator Norris.  While I do <Col N="1647"/>not have the same command of the English language or the same knowledge about the Israeli situation as he outlined, I wholeheartedly support the view he expressed on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly the deteriorating position in Gaza.  It must stop.  In light of what has been said on the other side of the House, it is appropriate that this side of the House would sing in harmony in demanding that we be listened to and that appropriate action is taken by all the players to ensure the deteriorating situation in Gaza is halted.  My understanding, like that of Senator Norris, is that the situation is the worst that has been witnessed in Gaza in the past 40 years.  Hopefully, the Leader will echo our remarks to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and they will be conveyed along the appropriate channels.</P>

	<P>I support the call by Senator Cummins for the automation of all unmanned level crossings throughout the country.  Last week the tragic death took place of Mr. P. J. McGowan of Straide, County Mayo, at an unmanned level crossing.  I have previously called for the automation of these level crossings.  The majority of them are in the west and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should bring them to automated standard, particularly when it is putting new trains on a line.</P>
        <P>A number of the projects in Transport 21 will be behind schedule.  I recently looked at a map on which the National Roads Authority has published its programme for 2008.  There are no national primary routes or any works in the NRA programme planned for Counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Longford and most of Roscommon in 2008.  This House should have an urgent debate on the Transport 21 programme which is falling far behind schedule.  The counties I mentioned are in the BMW region and, as I have said on a number of occasions previously, the BMW region is not getting its fair share of the funding which was proposed a number of years ago.  This country got &euro;8 billion under the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, specifically for the poorer regions of the country but this is proof that they are not getting their fair share.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with my colleagues in seeking a debate on public transport and particularly Transport 21.  Two further points should be raised in that regard.  First, not only has the Minister for Transport not met the targets, which are now referred to as indicative timings, in the past, he is also refusing to set new targets for many of the projects that have been delayed.  Of the five projects that will not be delivered this year, the Minister is proposing to set new targets for only two of them.  Second, the metro north is probably the largest of these projects and will run through my constituency.  The Minister is refusing <Col N="1648"/>to give a guarantee that it will have adequate capacity to cope with the number of commuters who will use it.  Basically, he is saying that he is willing to spend up to &euro;6 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money and not learn from the mistakes that were made on projects such as the M50.  I cannot think of any greater evasion of ministerial responsibility than a refusal to set clear deadlines and objectives for the future spending of billions of our money.  </P>
        <P>The Dublin transport authority is the body that will be put in place to manage the spending on and delivery of many of the projects we are discussing this morning.  We will not and cannot allow the Dublin transport authority become to transport what the Health Service Executive is to health.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In the debate on the Dublin transport authority in this House, my party will seek to ensure that three conditions are met in creation of the new body.  First, political accountability cannot be diluted by the setting up of that body.  Second, there must be clear lines of accountability and responsibility in the new organisation.  Third, we cannot be in the position whereby in a year&rsquo;s time we are all sitting here having a discussion about the faceless bureaucrats of the Dublin transport authority who are spending billions of euro of our money to improve the quality of life of the people whom we are here to serve.  I ask that during the debate on this vital issue we make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Buttimer for a debate on community values and civic responsibility.  That is a very urgent debate, in my view.  On a weekly, if not daily, basis we are raising the issues of law and order, murders, stabbings and all sorts of terrible deeds.  These are all part of the same equation however, namely, the breakdown in civic responsibility, in a sense of community and in the values which we enjoyed in this country.  A number of Members, including Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and myself will be 21 years in the Oireachtas in a few months&rsquo; time.  Over that period, there has been a huge transformation in society.  One of the strong negatives is the decline in personal and civic responsibility and in the sense of community and shared values, which was a strong Irish trait for many generations.  Interestingly, this has coincided with a significant <Col N="1649"/>drop in religious practice, a fall in vocations and a drop in the numbers of priests, nuns and brothers in the country.  We have also seen a major attack on society and standards and values.  All of these issues should form part of the debate, which should not be exclusive to this House.  I welcome the call for such a debate.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Cummin&rsquo;s comments regarding the need for an early notification from the Taoiseach of a date for the European referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  It is interesting that an enormous number of people in the country are discussing the forthcoming United States election.  It is on the front page of almost every newspaper, on the television every second night and groups of people in pubs and clubs are discussing an election in which we have no say, good, bad or indifferent.  We have an election coming our way in a few months&rsquo; time which is of much greater long-term significance to this House and the Irish people than the election in the American presidential election, namely the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  We must engage the public.  An early announcement from the Taoiseach and a substantial debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the various committees, would be helpful and necessary if we want to engage the people in an election where they actually have a say as opposed to the November election in the United States where, despite all our bleating, we have no say whatsoever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Alex White&rsquo;s proposal on an amendment to the Order of Business.  The announcement that there will be progress on the development of a child detention centre at Lusk is very welcome.  We have heard much talk about juvenile crime and juvenile offenders, particularly in the context of the tragic deaths of two Polish men in Drimnagh recently, which horrified us all.  There is an important issue here regarding how we treat child offenders.  It is desirable that we do not detain child offenders in the same place as adult offenders.  That is why the new detention centre at Lusk is very welcome as it will basically treat the detention of young offenders as a child care issue.  </P>
        <P>I want to know &mdash; this should be the subject of a debate in this House &mdash; why it is still proposed that there would be detention of young offenders of 16 and 17 years in the proposed Thornton Hall complex.  When we detain young offenders with older offenders we provide stepping stones in the wrong direction.  People who currently have experience of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, which is on the Mountjoy Prison site, will affirm that younger offenders there are almost aspiring to be with the older offenders and the older cohort is aspiring to be in Mountjoy.  I ask for quick and speedy progress on the Lusk detention centre in order to make unnecessary the detention of young persons in the proposed Thornton Hall complex.  I call for an approach to child offending that believes in <Col N="1650"/>the potential of rehabilitating young offenders who are still at a formative stage in their lives.</P>
        <P>I wish to briefly refer to an issue covered in some newspapers today, namely the sale of bogus mass cards.  This is a matter which is not just of concern to people of faith.  Irrespective of whether people have faith, we all like to show solidarity with the bereaved at times.  People may not know that mass cards very often contribute to priests on the missions who have very low incomes and are doing great work. The sale of bogus mass cards in shops means that masses are not being said at all and the money is going into the hands of profiteers.  This is not just a private matter which is of interest to the Church.  It is an issue of solidarity and I hope when the Charities Bill comes before this House that there will be support across the House for a measure that would target something that is claiming to have a charitable purpose but which is a bogus arrangement.  That loophole should be closed and I hope it will not just be people of faith, or of one particular faith, who will support any such amendment.</P>

I know some Members were at committee meetings but I informed the House yesterday that the Taoiseach will be present for that debate, which will take place on the first sitting day that falls as close as possible to the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>I welcome the publication of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008.  This will come to the House and for those Senators who this morning called for a debate on the Lisbon treaty, this Bill will provide an opportunity to express their opinions.</P>
        <P>Some Senators, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Burke, expressed concerns relating to safety at unmanned level crossings in light of the recent fatality that occurred.  We all wish to pass on our condolences to the family concerned.  A member of my family presided over level crossings for more than 40 years so I understand it is a serious commitment that requires attention seven days a week.  I congratulate all those who have kept the level crossings of Ireland safe through the years and will pass the Senators&rsquo; views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan highlighted for the House the tragedy of tourist attractions in the beautiful town of Killarney.  Killarney is a shining example for the rest of Ireland of the tourism product that can be provided and I agree with the Senator on anything that can be done to assist with creating tourist attractions for places like Killarney.  I will enquire to see when the legal services Bill will come to the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn gave a shining example of how important one cent coins are.  Those of us old enough will know how hard it was to get them in the first place and I think Senator Norris agreed with this.  If one does not mind one&rsquo;s pennies one will not have the pounds, as they used <Col N="1653"/>to say.  This issue shows how we have progressed over the years.</P>
        <P>Senators Buttimer and Bradford called for a debate on community life and I listened attentively to Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comments as he has huge experience and has spent almost 21 years in these Houses.  I congratulate him on the service he has given because I know he is a young man with many years ahead of him.  He expressed sentiments this morning on a serious matter and this House must have a lengthy debate on where society is going, how we have achieved what we have today and what our forefathers gave us.  There is a considerable drift away from the type of upbringing we had and the younger generation must now meet a different challenge that starts at home and in school.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time for this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan expressed his concern at the drop in income to the national Exchequer of &euro;517 million for the first two months of this year.  I am an optimistic person but if I had been asked about this in October, November or December I would have been pessimistic.  However, one can now buy a three bedroom, semi-detached house within 50 miles of Dublin for &euro;199,500; this is incredible value and now is the time to buy.</P>

Over the past five years I was Chairman of the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and travelled to many countries with Ministers of State, Ministers and, on three occasions, on trade missions with the Taoiseach.  The Ireland of saints and scholars is not merely a throwaway one-liner; it took centuries to create that association and nobody has been a better ambassador for our country than our missionaries.  If the funding from mass cards is to be forwarded to missionaries and masses are being said for the dearly departed, we should do everything we can to continue the good work that has gone on for decades.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, back to the House and thank him for taking the time to discuss this matter, which I appreciate very much.  I understand that the existing habitual residence condition means that children who are living in direct provision are not entitled to child benefit payment.  While they are in receipt of &euro;9.40, that amount is inadequate.  I heard what the Minister had to say yesterday but I ask that he look at the matter on compassionate grounds.  It would not cost a huge sum of money, &euro;6 million per annum, to look after this small number of children.  It would mean that children could buy over-the-counter medicines and clothes, which are not catered for when living in asylum.</P>

	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s sentiment in this regard.  We have had extensive debate on this issue in the D&aacute;il, at the committee and in the Seanad.  My opinion is well known.  We meet all our United Nations requirements under the law in regard to looking after those in the asylum seekers system.  As the Senator rightly said we do not pay over cash but we look after these people by putting packages together and feeding and looking after them.  The habitual residence clause is an important one and has worked very well since its introduction in Ireland.  It is right that someone should be habitually resident here before he or she can access payments such as child benefit.  To remove the habitual residence clause would be to say to anyone anywhere that one can come to this country and avail of our social welfare system.  If people in the asylum seeker system are in need of special supports, they get them through various aspects of the social welfare system.  We have had no complaints and we have had no difficulties.  It is the right approach, it is fair and it is working.  Therefore, I am not minded to accept the amendment.   I thank the Senator for tabling it.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on how the Rent Supplement Scheme could be improved to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) make it more responsive to beneficiaries needs,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) reflect rental market changes.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Given that we had a detailed debate on this issue yesterday, I will not go into detail except to say that changes should be introduced whereby rent supplement would be paid in advance rather than in arrears.  It is wrong that tenants must wait up to six weeks for payment.  If they do not get the rent supplement they sometimes end up owing six weeks&rsquo; rent.  This is an issue we need to review.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the Dublin area the rental supplement is &euro;130 while the cheapest bed-sit costs &euro;150.  I ask the Minister to review this matter.  We debated the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, yesterday, the uptake of which I understand is very low.  Only 1,000 out of 33,000 eligible recipients have been transferred from rent supplement to RAS since 2005.  I note it has been administered by the community welfare offices and services of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The community welfare offices have expressed concerns regarding the transfer of this scheme to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and are questioning how the move will affect its clients.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The rent supplement scheme is an individual payment to a person who needs support within the system.  The payment is not a payment to a landlord.  On some occasions, we pay direct to the landlord on behalf of the client.  This may be for money management reasons for people who are not capable, for whatever reason, of managing the resources themselves, and happens in a small number of cases.  However, it is a payment to an individual to support that individual.</P><Col N="1657"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>The Deputy is correct with regard to the rent supplement scheme, which is why we moved to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, some time ago.  The rent supplement scheme was supposed to be a short-term benefit to individuals to assist them on a short-term basis.  Clearly, this expanded into too long-term a timeframe.  Working with the local authorities, the aim is to get people off the long-term payments of rent supplement and onto the RAS.  That process is taking time and it will probably take another year or two to get the numbers down and to return to a situation where the rent supplement is being used on a short-term basis.  That is the purpose of the scheme.</P>
        <P>We have had a review of the caps on the rent supplement scheme.  The scheme itself is under review and it should be completed in mid-year, which seems to be acceptable to everybody.  We will decide what is to be done at that stage.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the number of eligible persons and proportion thereof availing of the Family Income Supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am aware that this scheme is not availed of as much as it could be.  Despite the fact the Government wants more lone parents to return to work, the budget has not been clearly welfare-to-work-proofed.  Part-time workers stand to lose &euro;2.40 from the family income supplement payment.  Such workers can claim a reduced level of one-parent family payment as their income is so low and they will benefit from the increase in this payment.  However, because the increase in the family income threshold was lower than the increase in the basic social welfare payment, this is reflected in the family income supplement means test and the effect is that the family income supplement will be lower for this group in 2008 because of the budget.  I would like the Minister to comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The family income supplement, as all sides agree, is an important contribution to getting people back to work and out of the poverty trap by assisting families who have difficulties without keeping them entirely in the social welfare system.  If they go back to full-time work, they can avail of the family income supplement, which is very important.  What we will try to do in the years ahead is to shift the balance in favour of people going back to work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that the take-up in the early part of the scheme was quite low but it has <Col N="1658"/>increased significantly in the past year.  The figure in 2001 was approximately 11,000 but the number availing of the scheme has increased to approximately 23,000.  We have tried to get the information out to all who are potentially recipients and beneficiaries of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The family income supplement scheme is important and is one in which I intend to continue, where I can, to invest resources to benefit those who are trying to get back into society and make a contribution.  That will be the approach.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As I said on Second Stage, I appreciate the amount of money that has gone into this sector but I would ask that the Minister would report on the numbers of eligible persons availing of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance among low income families.  I note particularly that lone parents who are working part-time are not entitled to claim the allowance.  Therefore, working parents will not benefit from the minimal &euro;20 increase in this payment.  As I said to the Minister on Second Stage, I do not see how this offers any incentive to encourage lone parents to go back to work.  Will the Minister address this point?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This scheme is very significant and benefits approximately 180,000 children, which is the type of coverage one would expect, with approximately 88,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1659"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are approximately 88,000.  As the Senator knows, many different schemes which break down in many different ways are available to those who need them, who may qualify under different criteria.  This year, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance has a budget of over &euro;43.5 million, which is significant.  It is beneficial to those who avail of it.  We have gone from the position in budget 2007, where we gave &euro;180 per child for those aged two to 11 years and &euro;285 for children aged 12 to 22 years, to the position in this year&rsquo;s budget, where we have increased the payments by &euro;20 to &euro;200 and &euro;305 respectively.  This represents an increase of 67% and 61% respectively in the past two years, so there has been a significant increase in this area.  I am glad 180,000 children benefit from this.  It is achieving its target market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the amount of money that has gone into the scheme.  While I will not press the amendment, I ask the Minister to specifically consider the category of lone parents to ascertain whether they, in particular those working part-time, can be accommodated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue seems complex but is quite simple.  It affects a small number of people &mdash; no more than 100.  The effect is that people working in Ireland who have been paying into the social insurance fund can transfer the value of their payments into the European PSEC fund if they take up a job with one of the European institutions, and that those coming back from having worked in a European institution to work here can transfer the value of the fund back again.  There is freedom of movement between the two schemes so people are not disadvantaged in any way.  It is a technical amendment which affects probably less than 100 people.  Nevertheless, it is important to them that their pension rights are protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume there will be retrospective effects.  The Minister said approximately 100 people would expect to benefit.  Will the cost be paid by the social insurance fund?  This provision is overdue since our accession.  Why is it being fixed now and what was the trigger for this?  Those who are waiting may have been waiting for 35 years.  What is the estimated cost of this proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>These people have been paying into the fund so it is a movement of their own resources, not an added burden.  It is about protecting an individual&rsquo;s pension.  In the past this had been deemed valid for occupational pensions but it is now felt that it should be part of the social insurance fund as well, which is where we are moving it and putting it into play.  This is about the individual, not the State.  It relates to the rights of an individual to have access to his or her pension so that a person is not disadvantaged if he or she goes from working and paying into the insurance fund in the Irish system to a European institution or if he or she moves back again.</P>
        <P>It had previously been thought that Article 11 of annexe VIII of the staff regulations applied only to occupational and personal pension rights.  However, following successful legal proceedings brought by the Commission against a number of member states, including most recently Spain, resulting in a judgment of the European Court of Justice in July 1997, it is accepted now that the provisions of Article 11 also apply to State pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the European Commission pay the relevant amount into the social insurance fund?</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Minister shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on supports available to individuals in receipt of Illness Benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 6 provides that a person transferring back to illness benefit will be entitled to a full personal rate of illness benefit where he or she has the required number of contributions in the relevant tax year.  Is the purpose of the section to protect persons who have become disqualified from receiving invalidity benefit or is it to ensure persons who are so disqualified can easily begin claiming illness benefits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Illness benefit is an income support payment for people of working age who are unable to work owing to illness and who satisfy certain social insurance conditions.  Those who are in receipt of the personal rate of illness benefit may also be entitled to increases for dependent adults and qualified children.  In addition, they may qualify for some secondary benefits such as smokeless fuel allowances, assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance and the medical card.</P>
        <P>In recent years my Department has begun to change its focus from being concerned primarily with the passive payment of benefits to a situation where we also focus on ensuring social welfare recipients of working age are given opportunities and supports to participate in the labour market.  It is a way of ensuring people are not disadvantaged and are supported back into the labour market.</P>
        <P>For this reason, a number of supports are available for those on illness benefit and the other disability related payments, such as disability allowance and invalidity pension, to encourage participation in education, training and employment.  These include the back to work allowance, which provides a financial cushion for those returning to work, and the back to education allowance, which provides second chance education for people.  It is geared towards ensuring that people who want to go back to education or work are not disadvantaged and that they can move from one scheme to another.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;8.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the progress to date in replacing the One Parent Family Payment with the new parental allowance for all low income families.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the sentiment behind the scheme.  Is this the scheme for which &euro;6.5 million has been allocated for a dedicated liaison officer and to put facilitators in place to deal with each lone parent individually to get him or her back to work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  We have two pilot schemes running at the moment in Kilkenny and Coolock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the measure but given that there are so many lone parents, how is it proposed that 30 facilitators will be able to deal with so many lone parents case by case?  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s approach and what he is trying to achieve but does he believe &euro;6.5 million is sufficient to deal with the existing need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are significant human resources throughout the system and the country in the offices that deal with these people daily.  Senator McFadden is correct.  I welcome her support.  Cross-party support is evident for this scheme which we are trying to finalise.</P>
        <P>As Senator McFadden is aware, there are different views among stakeholders as to how we achieve our aim.  We are trying to use the experience of the pilot projects in Kilkenny and Coolock to see how best to proceed.  It is not just a question of straight financial support because other issues arise.  I refer to education in particular.  Many lone parents left school early and do not have the educational requirements necessary to get back into the workforce.  Child care is another issue that arises.  Some lone parents are more interested in training than education.  There is a mixture of needs.</P>
        <P>The aim is to get as many lone parents as possible into the system in the next year or two to try to get them back into the workforce.  Many of them are coming in voluntarily.  There was a general impression that the receipt of a letter in <Col N="1663"/>the post meant people would lose something.  The experience of people in Kilkenny and Coolock has been very positive.  We are not trying to take anything away from people.  We want to enhance the quality of people&rsquo;s lives by allowing them and helping them to do part-time work and, ultimately, full-time work.  Accordingly, we are trying to target the supports that are needed to achieve that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have grave concerns about the logistics of the operation of the scheme from the point of view of there being so many lone parents.  The Minister referred to dealing with people case by case.  I am concerned that people may not be looked after in a proper manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently, 40 facilitators are in place and another 30 will be added this year to make a total of 70.  This is a gradual process.  I will not pretend to the Senator that we can do it all overnight.  It is clear there are many people who will not be able to do some of the things at a particular point in time.  It is necessary to look at the cohort and see how one can facilitate the movement of those who are in a position to go into the workplace.  That is what we will do.  It is a learning-by-doing experience.  That is what Kilkenny and Coolock are showing us.</P>

        <P LI="1">(1)  the role being played by the Government in international efforts to secure a total prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions through its active participation in international initiatives to address the issue comprehensively, in line with its commitments in the programme for Government;</P>

        <P LI="1">(3)  the intention of the Government shortly to establish a national committee on international humanitarian law which will have, as its first task, the preparation of comprehensive draft legislation to give effect to the new instrument, thereby enabling its early introduction in the Oireachtas;</P>

        <P LI="1">(4)  to support research, publication and awareness raising initiatives on this subject nationally and internationally;</P>
        <P LI="1">(5)  to ensure that the draft legislation provides not just for the prohibition of use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions but also to make provision for assistance to victims of cluster munitions, for the clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions and for assistance in the destruction of stockpiles of cluster munitions, among other matters to be agreed in negotiations on the future instrument at the diplomatic conference in Dublin in May;</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House.  We all appreciate his efforts in this area, and we know the sincerity with which he makes them.  It is particularly heartening that this is an all-party motion, which puts a positive framework on the whole issue.  I welcome the extra comments made, to which I will refer later.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a very strong protest about the way in which this business has been ordered.  I am the originator of this motion, but I was not told about it at the time it was being changed; in fact <Col N="1668"/>I was in traffic when I found out about it half an hour ago.  I was told that all the Whips agreed, but that is not the case.  My Whip did not agree, nor did the Fine Gael Whip.  It was just bounced on us.  A serious motion that deals with people&rsquo;s lives should not be treated in this fashion.  It is a disgrace that this happened and I strongly resent it.  I was meeting somebody for lunch and a briefing, but that has now been aborted.  However, I am prepared to go ahead with this, because it is such a positive development.</P>
        <P>The motion that I have just moved is not the exact motion that went on the Order Paper originally.  That motion has been amended in the usual way to welcome the role of the Government and so on.  It has got a little bit of a massage and I do not mind that, but I would like to point out that the original motion, in my name and in the name of Deputy Higgins, was passed unanimously in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It read as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs urges the Government:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) to play an effective role towards securing a total prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions by its active participation in international initiatives to address the issue comprehensively;</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) to enact a national law prohibiting the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions as we know them;</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) to support research, publication and awareness raising initiatives on this subject nationally and internationally;</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) to follow the example that prevailed in June 1996 when Ireland, in anticipation of the text of the mine ban convention, enacted unilaterally a ban on land mines and in this regard that Ireland would now take a similar initiative in anticipation of the discussion of the text of a UN level prohibition;</P>
        <P LI="1">(5) that such legislation on the part of Ireland be as inclusive as possible in terms of definition of cluster munitions, the addressing of existing stockpiles and all aspects of production, sale, transmission and use;</P>
        <P LI="1">(6) to increase support for the clearance of contaminated land by land mines, cluster munitions and other unexploded ordinance;</P>
        <P LI="1">(7) to increase support for mine-risk education;</P>
        <P LI="1">(8) to increase support for rehabilitation of mine survivors and their socioeconomic integration pending the outlawing of land mines internationally; and</P>
        <P LI="1">(9) to ensure that no public funds are invested in any company involved in or associated with these inhuman practices.</P><Col N="1669"/>
        <P FLI="0">It is very important that we take this matter seriously and the Minister has shown evidence of doing so.  There has been correspondence in the newspapers and I know that the Minister has recently returned from a conference in New Zealand.  It is important that all this is incremental, and there will be a conference in Croke Park in May.  The Minister answered critics by saying that the Government wants to await the outcome of this conference, in order to put together the most comprehensive ban, which is fine.  However, Ms Margaretta D&rsquo;Arcy raised the fact that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has invested &euro;500 million in five companies that produce cluster bombs.  These are Raytheon, General Dynamics and 1-3 Communications from the USA, EADS from the Netherlands and Thales from France.  In today&rsquo;s newspaper the Minister said that the question of investment had been raised, and that he has contacted the Minister for Finance and the National Pensions Reserve Fund with a view to ensuring that no public funds are invested in any company involved in, or associated with the production of munitions.  That is vitally important.  I have often raised the issue of investment in some of these rather sinister companies and the need for an ethical investment provision governing the NPRF.</P>
        <P>These cluster bombs are an appalling weapon and they have been used all over the world.  It is disgraceful that a group of countries, led by the US, Russia and China, have tried to mitigate the impact of the treaties and have not signed up to them.  They have done this because they are manufacturing the bombs.  We need to know how these bombs affect people, and an example provides a human face to the issue.  This is the testimony of a Serbian woman called Gita Jovic, recalling when a bomb hit the street on which she was standing. She stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">At first, there was this noise, something I have never heard before.  And then it hit me in the leg.  And then the other leg, too.  I felt severe pain in my right leg, but I did not look at it.  I did not know what to do.  There were detonations everywhere, cars were getting hit.  I managed to cross to the other side of the street and to lie down behind a car.  A car nearby was burning.  I was in a state of shock, but I was also aware of everything that was happening.  My colleagues started coming out of the building, they were running around, looking for the injured.  I was yelling, calling them, but they could not see me.  I tried to stand up.  I was wearing trousers; I tried to pull them up a bit.  It was then that I saw what had happened for the first time.  I remember thinking clearly &mdash; so strange, a bare bone, no muscle tissue at all.  It was my right leg.  My other leg did not react at all and there were many small bomb fragments in it.  I was picked up eventually by a volunteer who collected the dead and the <Col N="1670"/>injured in the streets during attacks.  He took me to the hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">She begged him to throw her out of the window, as she was in such unbearable agony.  These bombs are not militarily precise.  In the past 72 hours of the war in Lebanon, 1 million of the bombs were dropped by the Israelis and they are often picked up in a particular form by children, long after the military conflict has ended.  Therefore, these bombs cause civilian casualties, with children the most vulnerable.  In light of the fact that there have been changes, can the Minister guarantee as positive as possible an interpretation of the articles in my original motion, such as article 5?  It states that such legislation on the part of Ireland should be as inclusive as possible in terms of the definition of cluster munitions.  No cluster munitions should be excluded on the basis of self-destruction.  This is not realistic self-destruction.  These self-destructive mechanisms often fail.  Many of the weapons systems are complicated and sometimes one of 30 things can wrong, and the self-destructive features do not work.  For sensor-fused weapons, each cluster bomb is programmed with individual guidance systems to locate the target.  The argument is that each bomb will represent a precision strike, but that is rubbish.  They seek metal mass or heat sources.  They can hit a market or a factory and they can clearly destroy civilians.</P>
        <P>The Minister may well have heard the speech of Mr. Branislav Kapetanovic at the conference in New Zealand.  He was a victim of a cluster bomb and he said in his speech:</P>
        <P LI="1">Let me remind you of why we are here today.  We are here because more than 90% of casualties caused by cluster munitions are civilians.  Thirty countries and territories of the world have a problem with contamination by unexploded sub-munitions.  In the course of just one year after the war in Lebanon ended, 45 of my fellow deminers, 45 people who were trained to work with cluster munitions, have become victims of cluster munitions while clearing unexploded sub-munitions.  All this tells us that cluster munitions do not discriminate among their victims and there are no cluster bombs that can guarantee anybody&rsquo;s safety.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If professionals are being injured, what chance do ordinary civilians have to get away from these filthy things?  The letter concludes with the comment that before 1999 none of Mr. Kapetanovic&rsquo;s compatriots considered it possible that cluster bombs would be used in their country which is, after all, a European state, rather than some remote African colony of which we know little.  Cluster munitions, therefore, affect us all.</P>
        <P>We should recall the role Ireland played in the past, of which I am proud.  It was the skill of Frank Aiken that produced the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and Ireland was among the first three or four countries to sign up to the Oslo dec<Col N="1671"/>laration.  What a pity we were not the first country to do so, particularly as we do not possess cluster munitions or the means to distribute them.  This places us in a good position from which we could have led.  I wish we had led the world but we can use our moral force now.  It is particularly important that the Minister lives up to his undertakings and ensures we do not invest in any companies that produce these devilish weapons which attack human life.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Austria, which was among the first countries, if not the first country to ban cluster munitions.  On 5 December 2007, just a few months ago, at the Vienna conference on cluster munitions, Ms Ursula Plassnik, Austrian Minister for European and International Affairs stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am proud to inform you that the Austrian Parliament will adopt tomorrow a national law that bans the possession, use, production, development and transfer of cluster munitions.  Once this law is in force, all types of cluster munitions will be illegal, including so called &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; sensor-fused munitions.  We hope that this law will become a trend setter and we stand ready to assist other states in their own legislative efforts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the way forward.  I congratulate the Minister and I know his heart is in this issue.  He should drive ahead and I wish him well in Croke Park.  It is a most important, humane issue, on which we must continue to apply pressure.</P>
        <P>We should shame countries such as Russia, China and the United States of America.  I ask the Minister to send a letter to the ambassadors of these countries expressing our deep concern that countries which pose as civilised should wish to continue to manufacture these horrible weapons.   To return to my protest, I am very angry about the way in which this debate was handled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I exonerate the Minister from any culpability in this matter.  I was in touch with his office and understand it was prepared to be flexible with regard to timing.  I should have made that clear to be fair to the Minister. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was somewhat bemused by the Senator&rsquo;s remarks in that respect.  In any event, I was pleased to be asked to consider an all-party motion, on the basis of which <Col N="1672"/>all of us should unite to condemn a horrible practice by other states.  I value the commitment of the Seanad and all parties to combating the scourge of these weapons.  I welcome support for the role the Government has played in international efforts to secure a total prohibition on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of cluster munitions, in particular, through our lead role in the upcoming diplomatic conference in Dublin, which is expected to complete negotiations on the first ever instrument of international humanitarian law specifically directed against cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>Several times during moves by a number of nations to address this issue, I offered to host the conference on cluster munitions in Dublin, even though, from a logistical point of view, it was clear that it would be difficult to host an event lasting for approximately two weeks and attended by delegates from every part of the world.  While the conference will bring substantial business to the city, it is also a significant operation and questions were asked as to whether the Department had sufficient logistical means to organise it.  I am pleased we are hosting the event and hope it will be very successful.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the support for the Government&rsquo;s plan to establish a national committee on international humanitarian law which will have, as its first task, the preparation of comprehensive draft legislation on the cluster munitions issue.  I have read commentary in the newspapers arguing that the Government should proceed with the legislation.  However, I have received strong advice that we should wait until the conference produces what I hope will be a positive resolution before framing legislation.  I understand some important non-governmental organisations have indicated we should wait until after the conference in May before introducing legislation.  I do not want to proceed with legislation before May in case we find that, as a result of the May conference, we will have to return to the drawing board and change the legislation.  I want to get it right at the first attempt.  Waiting for a few months until the issue is considered fully at the Croke Park conference is the correct way to proceed.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government 2007-2012 makes a commitment to &ldquo;campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.&rdquo;  It adds that in &ldquo;the absence of a full ban we will seek agreement on an immediate freeze on the use of cluster munitions pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns regarding their use.&rdquo;  My party&rsquo;s pre-election manifesto included a similar commitment.  I am pleased to inform the Seanad that Ireland has played an important role in international efforts to this end through its participation in the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and, more significantly, through active engagement and leadership in the Oslo process.  The Dublin diplomatic conference on cluster munitions, which the Government will <Col N="1673"/>host in Croke Park in May 2008, will be the critical stage in the process.  While difficult issues remain, I am confident that it will be possible to finalise a treaty at the conference.</P>
        <P>My officials obviously offer a view on the likely success of the conference.  We need a strong resolution and commitment from member states.  I agree with Senator Norris that certain nations should be named and shamed for using cluster munitions.  I have been reasonably vocal in that respect and will maintain that position.</P>
        <P>For several years, Ireland has been expressing its concerns at the unacceptable consequences of the use of cluster munitions in the UN context.  Two main issues arise.  First, the use of cluster munitions can be indiscriminate at the time of use, thus harming civilians who are within range.  In practice this is usually the case.  Second, the high failure rate of sub-munitions at the time of impact creates an enduring hazard of unexploded ordnance, causing casualties long after the cessation of hostilities and making much land unusable.  At present, international humanitarian law does not adequately address these concerns.  The lethal consequences of these weapons were most recently apparent in southern Lebanon but have also affected south-east Asia, the Balkans and other theatres of war.</P>
        <P>In light of the absence of progress in Geneva and inspired by the process which led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines ten years ago, Norway convened a meeting in Oslo in February 2007 of countries ready to explore ways to address the issue of cluster munitions in a determined and effective manner.  Forty-six states present adopted the Oslo declaration which committed them to conclude by 2008 a legally binding international instrument that will &rdquo;prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.&rsquo;&rsquo;  They also committed to co-operation and assistance for survivors and affected communities, clearance of affected areas and destruction of stockpiles.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of seven states driving the Oslo process.  The others are Norway, Austria, New Zealand, Mexico, Peru and the Holy See.  We have participated actively in a series of conferences in Oslo, Lima, Vienna and Wellington to identify the issues, clarify positions and formulate a draft treaty.  Political momentum has grown significantly.  When I became actively involved in this issue I was told that Ireland might be on its own and I said I do not mind if we are on our own.  I believe it was the right thing to do.  There were only a few countries involved at the start of the campaign on landmines and now most of the countries in the world have signed up to the anti-landmine treaty.</P>
        <P>At the most recent conference in Wellington two weeks ago, more than 80 states immediately endorsed the Wellington Declaration, which lays the foundation for the Dublin Diplomatic Conference.  Many more states are expected to indi<Col N="1674"/>cate their support in the coming months and to participate in the negotiations in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Significant differences remain to be resolved on key issues such as definitions, any possible period of transition to a ban and future military co-operation, including in United Nations mandated missions, with states not party to the convention.  There is also reason to believe that these can be resolved and prospective solutions for many less contentious issues have already emerged in the course of the earlier meetings in the process.</P>
        <P>I am confident we are on track for the adoption of a comprehensive and effective convention that will get on board users, producers and cluster munitions affected states.  It is also our aim to establish a new norm of international humanitarian law which will influence the behaviour of every state engaging in conflict, regardless of whether it has ratified the convention.  This has been the experience of the Ottawa Convention in stigmatising the use of landmines, even by states not party to it, and we believe that experience can be emulated.</P>
        <P>I assure the Seanad that the Government is fully seized of the other issues in the motion under discussion.  As I have stated, the key aim of the new treaty will be to prohibit the unacceptable humanitarian harm caused by cluster munitions.  However, we must also look to the past impact and the damage inflicted on societies and individuals by these horrendous weapons.  I have seen the terrible risk posed to civilian populations by unexploded cluster munitions in Lebanon, which I visited the year before last.  That visit was probably instrumental in me taking up the cudgel here in respect of these issues because I saw for myself the effects on the ground.  I spoke with the Irish military personnel working on the ground with the Finns to de-mine particular areas and saw the different types of cluster munitions.  For whatever reason they appear to be manufactured in a way that they look like toys in some instances.  I discussed the issue with the military personnel there and when I came home I discussed it again with some of the military personnel here.  It is clear these munitions are used in circumstances, as Senator Norris said, where armies are leaving a particular territory and making that territory unusable for many years to come and putting civilian lives at risk.</P>
        <P>The draft convention contains strong provisions for humanitarian assistance for victims, the clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded cluster munitions, assistance in the destruction of stockpiles of weapons and risk education.  I am hopeful that the treaty which emerges from the negotiations will be the most comprehensive of its kind in addressing those needs.</P>
        <P>It seems certain that legislation will be required to enable Ireland ratify the convention when it is agreed. While Ireland has never possessed cluster <Col N="1675"/>munitions and is therefore not in the situation of a number of states which have adopted national prohibitions, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to propose that this legislation should enact a domestic ban.  To ensure that our legislation is of the highest possible quality, the Government has therefore agreed to establish a new national committee on humanitarian law, whose first task will be to begin consideration of the measures necessary to give effect to the future convention.  We believe this is a better way to go than bringing in legislation before May and then having to come back to change it after May.</P>
        <P>In consultation with all parties in the Oireachtas, the draft legislation, when prepared, will be given the necessary priority in the Oireachtas timetable.  Ireland was one of the first countries to ratify the Ottawa Convention and it would be an honour, and in line with Government policy, for Ireland to be among the first to ratify the cluster munitions convention when it comes out in the Dublin conference.</P>
        <P>Some have suggested we should enact a national ban even in advance of the conference.  I understand the desire to demonstrate leadership in this area but it makes sense to wait and see what is required in terms of legislation to ratify the expected convention.  I assure the House there will not be any delay thereafter.  Moreover, organising the conference is itself a major task and will show in a practical way our commitment to focusing on making it a success.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Civil society has played a welcome and valuable role in the Oslo process.  The Cluster Munition Coalition, CMC, the international umbrella body representing more than 200 non-governmental organisations campaigning on this issue, has been an important partner throughout and its representatives will attend the diplomatic conference in May.  My Department remains in close contact with the CMC and with other NGOs active in this area and is working closely with them on preparations for the conference.  I am appreciative of the co-operation and mutual understanding that has prevailed with the CMC on the range of issues in play and its general support for our principled national stance.</P>
        <P>The United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross have been active in their engagement and advocacy on the cluster munitions issue and staunch in their support for the Oslo process.  Their ongoing contribution is invaluable and I look forward to welcoming them to the conference.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion urges support for research, publication and awareness raising initiatives on this subject nationally and internationally.  It also urges support for victim assistance, clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded remnants of war, destruction of stockpiles, risk education and support for rehabilitation of survivors and their socio-economic integration.  As I have outlined, these issues will be adequately addressed in the <Col N="1676"/>convention but the Government is already committed to those objectives and is working to fulfil them in close co-operation with the NGOs and with UN agencies.  Since 2000, we have provided some &euro;20 million in funding to meet needs in this area.  Irish Aid has an ongoing relationship with a number of the leading NGOs operating in this field.  I am proud to have seen for myself some of their activities on the ground, bringing some relief and support to victims and their communities.  Our partners include HALO Trust, Mine Action Group and Handicap International, and we have also provided funding for Explosive Remnants of War, ERW, relief measures in Somalia, Afghanistan, Angola, Mozambique and Iraq among other countries.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has recently approved &euro;1.875 million of funding for HALO Trust&rsquo;s de-mining activities in three countries in 2008.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that the expansion of the Irish Aid budget will result in an increase in the level of funding available to respond to proposals from suitable partners.  This will assist us in implementing the ambitious and far-reaching provisions of the convention which I expect to be agreed in Dublin in May and carried forward into national legislation.</P>
        <P>The question of investment related to the production or financing of cluster munitions has been raised also.  I am pleased the motion highlighted that issue.  As a result of it being brought to my attention some months ago I asked my Department to raise the issue.  I spoke on the issue personally with the chief executive officer of the National Pensions Reserve Fund some months ago.  My Department continues to examine best practice on ethical investment by the investment funds of like-minded countries. With that in mind, I initiated contacts some time ago with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance.  While not seeking to interfere with the independence of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which is independent under the legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, my objective was to try to ensure that no public funds are invested in any company involved in or associated with the production of cluster munitions.  While there are a number of legal and practical issues still to be teased out, the reaction from both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission has been positive and supportive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an issue for the independent National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It has signed up to ethical guidelines in that respect but when it was pointed out that there are reports that some funds have been invested in cluster munitions, it is in agreement with Government policy, which is enunciated in the programme for Government and I have indicated clearly to it that it is the desire of Government to ensure no pension funds are invested in cluster munitions manufacturing companies and, if required, legislation will be put in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure they are given cover in that respect.  The Government is determined to achieve the strongest possible prohibition on cluster munitions and to make a meaningful difference to the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable civilians around the world who have suffered from their use.</P>
        <P>I have made clear my personal and long-standing engagement on this issue.  I have been active on this for the past two and a half years, especially since I returned from Lebanon.  Ireland is playing a strong leadership role in international efforts to this end through its participation in the Oslo process and the convening of the Dublin conference in May.  We are committed to carrying forward the outcome of the conference into domestic legislation and policy and to using the resources at our disposal to support victim assistance, risk management, clearance of contaminated areas and destruction of stockpiles of cluster munitions.  I look forward to the continuing collaboration of all parties in the Oireachtas in this endeavour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I agree with Senator Norris with regard to the re-ordering of the business of the House.  It is regrettable that as the proposer of the motion, he was not informed the Order of Business had been changed.</P>
        <P>Cluster bombs are an abomination.  They pose a particular risk to civilians and often to children because, as their name suggests, they leave large numbers of dangerous explosive devices spread across the landscape.  They can remain live and dangerous for decades after they have been launched, killing not only the generation of people alive when the bomb is dropped but also their children and even their grandchildren.</P>
        <P>The dangers of one cluster bomb can be seen in a simple statistic.  The footprint of a single cluster bomb can be as large as a football pitch.  In the words of Handicap International, which has cam<Col N="1678"/>paigned against these weapons, &ldquo;Ninety-eight percent of cluster submunitions casualties are civilians killed and injured while returning home in the aftermath of conflict or while going about their daily tasks to survive.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Its comments on the use of these weapons are blunt:</P>
        <P LI="1">Despite a general lack of information on casualties both during and after strikes, it is clear unexploded cluster submunitions turn homes, livelihoods and social areas of almost 400 million people living in affected countries into de facto minefields.  A total of 13,306 casualties due to cluster submunitions are confirmed.  However, as 96% of casualties occur in countries where there is no or limited data collection, there are undoubtedly more casualties.  In high-use locations, such as Iraq there were more than 1,000 casualties during strikes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The fact that it is often people who have survived brutal conflicts and are returning home thinking they are safe who end up injured or killed by these weapons adds a particular horror to their use.  In Kosovo, 53% of casualties occurred in the two months after the conflict.  Most of the victims killed or maimed were boys aged between five and 15.</P>
        <P>It is not only the age of the victims of these abominable weapons that is shocking.  We see these weapons targeted specifically at the poor for it is often their farmlands which are littered with the bombs which, like landmines, are spread all over the place.  However, the poor have no choice but to return to their farms and to try to live there, in the process spending every day worrying that when they plough the land, herd their cattle or travel to their homes they may step on an unexploded bomb left by the clustered explosion and lose an arm or leg or perhaps their lives.  Every day they face the fear that their children may never come home from school, yet another victim of an unexploded remnant of a cluster bomb.</P>
        <P>I quote again from Handicap International which has done major work to highlight the evil of cluster bombs.</P>
        <P LI="1">The majority of victims are poor, uneducated males at work representing 76.8% of total confirmed casualties.  Many of these are boys under the age of 18.  In South Lebanon, nearly 90% of land used for farming and shepherding is contaminated with unexploded cluster submunitions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Like many modern weapons, cluster munitions owe their origins to the Second World War when they were used indiscriminately.  Remarkably, since the mid-1960s they seem to have been targeted against civilians in many areas.  They are not merely a weapon to win wars.  They are a weapon used to terrorise communities, to lay waste large tracts of land and to hit the poor in particular.</P><Col N="1679"/>
        <P>In Kosovo, cluster bombs were used by NATO without a deployment of NATO troops.  In May 1995, the Croatian capital, Zagreb, was targeted deliberately by Serb forces with cluster bombs among other weapons.  One Serb general made no secret of his tactics.  He told the press that if the Croats launched an offensive, he would attack weak points.  He stated with regard to Zagreb, &ldquo;We know who the people in the parks are: civilians.&rdquo;  One bomb fired contained 288 bomblets, each of which on explosion released 420 steel pellets, with a kill range of 10 metres.  In other words, each rocket released 120,000 pellets, designed deliberately to kill people not only when the bomblets were released but indefinitely into the future.</P>
        <P>In Vietnam, decades after the end of the Vietnam war, 300 people per year are still being killed by cluster bombs and landmines.  People died for years after 1,400 cluster bombs were dropped in Kosovo.  In 2000, the BBC reported the American cluster bombs, whether by accident or design, were visually appealing to children when they found them due to their bright yellow colour.  However, in the BBC&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;they contain an incendiary device &mdash; shrapnel &mdash; and armour piercing explosive that can pierce steel 25 cm thick&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This is why my party is passionately opposed to the use of cluster bombs.  Defence can sometimes be necessary.  However, creating weapons specifically to kill civilians &mdash; innocent men, women and children &mdash; for decades after a war is over can never be justified.  One of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s goodwill ambassadors, human rights activist, Bianca Jagger, put the scandal in context:</P>
        <P LI="1">The first proposals to ban cluster bombs were made in 1974.  Since that time the weapons have been used in some 25 countries and, most worryingly, they are now in the arsenals of 70 states world-wide.  Cluster bombs have already killed too many innocent civilians both during and after conflict.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the Oslo declaration and the countries involved in it.  It is a wonderful document and I am glad to hear from the Minister that other countries are becoming more actively involved in supporting the ending of the use of these dreadful weapons.  I assure the Minister my party will do all in its power to bring an end to the horrors and the evil of cluster bombs.</P>
        <P>We support this motion, just as we support the Dublin conference scheduled for May to push for a ban on the use of these weapons.  In the name of the generations of dead children we could not save, we commit ourselves to ensuring in whatever way we can that no more children die at the hands of these abominable weapons.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by apologising to Senator Norris.  A presumption was made on <Col N="1680"/>the basis that this is an all-party motion, that the issue is current in the media and that a window became available in the Seanad schedule &mdash; a rare commodity in itself.  If this presumption led to a lack of proper consultation with the instigator of the motion, I apologise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The date is fine.  However, it was shifted from 3.30 p.m. to 1 p.m. with no notice to any of the people participating and no consultation with the Whips despite what I was told.  What I was told was not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sometimes this happens because of the early passage of business and it cannot be avoided.</P>
        <P>On the motion, which is an all-party motion, the existence of the arms industry is morally suspect in itself.  There is often a moral relativism in debating subjects of this nature.  One of the ironies about the war in Iraq since 2003 is the pretext for beginning the war, namely, the belief in the existence of weapons of mass destruction, as though weapons which wreak less destruction are more morally acceptable.  Most people on the planet would accept the morality of weapons is something we should strive to limit and prohibit wherever possible.  The international debate, in which Ireland has participated, has concentrated on banning cluster munitions, the most pernicious, indiscriminate and most violent of weapons.  This is a timely debate because it has been preceded by a media debate to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has contributed.</P>
        <P>Several articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the first by my friend and colleague, the former MEP for Leinster, Nuala Ahern, was followed by one today by the Minister.  There was no real disagreement between the two articles.  In her article Nuala Ahern went to great pains to stress the role the Minister has played in this debate and recognised the importance his party has given it.  Whatever level of disagreement that existed between the two articles was only strategic in nature.</P>
        <P>I am glad to note from the Minister&rsquo;s contribution that there will be further commitments to the introduction of legislation that will include a national ban on cluster bombs.  This may seem like an act of moral relativism in that we do not produce cluster bombs but it is an important signal in helping to achieve international agreements of this nature.</P>
        <P>If the forthcoming Dublin conference acts as the mechanism to bring about this agreement, Irish politics should be proud of the role the Minister and the Government have played and that should be applauded.  As the Minister stated, it is a strong part of the programme for Government.  As one who helped to negotiate the programme on behalf of the Green Party, I am pleased to see this provision has been included.</P>
        <P>The Minister has highlighted the use of the Irish Aid programme to help the victims of cluster bombs as individuals and as members of their <Col N="1681"/>communities, which is laudable.  However, dealing with the effects of the bombs after they have wreaked their havoc is not the best use of our aid programme.  A possible success from the Dublin conference could be that the moneys from our aid programmes would be better directed.</P>
        <P>On the argument whether legislation should be introduced before or after the Dublin conference, I accept what the Minister has said.  It is standard practice that a convention is agreed upon, followed by legislation which has been accepted by several non-governmental organisations.  One advantage to having legislation prior to a convention is that it might help inform agreement.  It would put Ireland in a category with countries such as Austria, Belgium, Norway and Hungary.</P>
        <P>Norway&rsquo;s position is interesting in several respects.  One area in which we must ensure we are not compromised concerns our national investment programme.  In the 29th D&aacute;il I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on ethical investment to require the National Pensions Reserve Fund to present to the Minister for Finance how ethical investment for the fund could be followed.  It was not accepted at the time but the principles behind it need to be revisited.  The United Nations&rsquo; ethical guidelines on investment will not be sufficient as they are only guidelines and do not have the force of international law.  I am encouraged the Minister has suggested there will be a prohibition on certain types of investment.  A debate is needed at Cabinet level to enunciate those ethical investment principles further.  I encourage the Minister to use the example of Norway in such discussions.</P>
        <P>Norway has been a partner with Ireland in this process.  The Dublin conference will build on the Oslo Declaration.  Not only has Norway enacted legislation in banning cluster bomb production in its country, it has separate legislation regarding ethical funding guidelines for its national pension fund.  I hope the Minister, with his Norwegian counterpart, will see how a common approach can be established.  There is no dissension in the House on this issue.  We must ensure there are no compromises in this area.  The issue must be dealt with effectively, especially after the work done already in this area by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Independent Senators on tabling this motion.  I commend the Government on supporting it subsequently and bringing the issue to the fore in <Col N="1682"/>advance of the conference on munitions in Dublin in May.</P>
        <P>The motion reminds the Government of its commitment to legislate in this area.  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently that the Government will delegate responsibility on munitions to a new committee on humanitarian law to be established by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Austria, Belgium, Hungary and Norway have enacted legislation on this matter.  I hope this proposed committee ensures comprehensive, tight and timely legislation on cluster munitions is introduced.  I would hate to see the advent of the committee leading to further delays.</P>
        <P>Cluster munitions are an urgent matter requiring international action.  Cluster bombs are the most indiscriminate of all conventional bombs.  The affected area of one cluster bomb can be as wide as the combined area of three football fields.  A cluster bomb used on a military target will not just affect military personnel and installations.  It can lead to horrible deaths and injuries to innocent civilians in non-military areas.</P>
        <P>These munitions often fail to explode on impact.  The ordnance becomes less of a bomb and more a landmine.  It is estimated that after the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, 1 million unexploded bombs remain in the conflict zone waiting to injure and kill people long into the future.</P>
        <P>When in Vietnam I visited the former US base, Khe Sanh, beside the Ho Chi Minh trail which had come under attack during the Tet Offensive.  When abandoning Khe Sanh, the Americans decided to bomb the Viet Cong into submission.  As a result, the surrounding area is covered in unexploded ordnance.  Every year innocent civilians are maimed and killed by these unexploded munitions.</P>
        <P>Of the 13,000 cluster bomb casualties recorded by one international group, 98% are civilians.  I am glad the motion has been tabled and that serious clauses in it have not been amended.  It insists that any legislation on the matter will make it impossible for cluster munitions or materials for them to be produced in Ireland.  It also demands legislation should assist victims of cluster munitions.  Funds must be dedicated not just to the clearance of these unexploded munitions but to the rehabilitation of people who have been maimed by them.</P>
        <P>Countries such as Ireland can act as a leading voice in working with other European countries to help ban cluster munitions.  We must ensure Ireland is not a passive opponent of cluster munitions but an active campaigner for their removal and the mitigation of their effects.  If Ireland is an active campaigner it will demonstrate that the Government is walking the walk as well as talking the talk.  By doing this we can help to motivate other European countries to action and, it is to be hoped, embarrass some European countries into turning away from their current courses of action in the production of <Col N="1683"/>cluster munitions.  This motion ensures that any legislation that eventually arises will include action and international leadership by Ireland.  In this way we can aid the victims of cluster bombs and increase support for clearance of contaminated land.</P>
        <P>I support the motion, as does my party.  I encourage the Government to act quickly, take the motion seriously and legislate strongly against the evil of cluster munitions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand why Senator Norris was upset at the change of time.  I too was following the agenda as I had read it this morning, but then I was hauled out of the Forum on Europe to come over here.  It confuses me when I suddenly have to rush to be here, but I did want to speak on this issue.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the Seanad to discuss this very important issue.  We as a party placed in the party manifesto for last year&rsquo;s general election a clear commitment to ban cluster munitions.  That commitment was repeated in the programme for Government and forms the basis of a Government policy which is among the most progressive in the world.  We are at the vanguard of international efforts to rid the planet of these horrible weapons.  After his return from south Lebanon, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and he told me that he saw this as a personal crusade, that he had seen at first hand the awful effects of these bombs on the civilian population of Lebanon, and that Ireland would lead the way in this area.  Out of that came the commitment in our party manifesto and in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>In the weeks ahead, Ireland will host a major diplomatic conference on cluster munitions.  The conference will complete negotiations on the first ever instrument of international humanitarian law specifically directed against cluster munitions.  At the Minister&rsquo;s direction, a national committee on humanitarian law will shortly prepare comprehensive legislation on cluster bombs.  This is a national issue and we should not divide on it.  For this reason, I am happy this is a cross-party motion with all our support.</P>
        <P>I note the announcement by Ireland of a total legislative ban on cluster munitions at the Oslo process in February 2008.  This will add further dynamism to and accelerate the process towards a comprehensive ban.  In preparing the legislation, we must not forget that the key to this is the victims.  We must provide for clearance of areas contaminated by these awful bombs.  We must stand by the victims to ban these bombs and landmines forever so that children can run free in the fields and go to school, and parents can till their land and draw water from wells without fear of being blown up by a cluster bomb.  I hope in the draft legislation we provide support for education on the risks of cluster bombs, cater for the rehabilitation and medical care of survivors, <Col N="1684"/>provide psychological support and assist with social and economic inclusion.</P>
        <P>I encourage co-ordination between the governments of the concerned states and relevant governmental and non-governmental organisations in the implementation of the programme.  Ireland must become a trend-setter and assist other states in their preparation of this legislation.  Ireland is a small country but it is effective and we have a big heart.  It is time we led by example and demonstrated the skill and commitment to enact a unilateral ban to make our world free of cluster munitions.  I hope the text will be sufficiently comprehensive in its prohibition and will satisfy the expectations of civil society and those affected by cluster munitions.  I wish the Minister well in hosting the convention in May and I hope he will take the lead in pushing for a total ban on these awful weapons, as we have outlined in the House today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to support the motion.  The use of cluster bombs is quite obscene in terms of the havoc they can wreak.  Cluster bombs are designed to be sprayed over a wide area.  The principle is simple: a large container is filled with small bomblets, the container opens, and the munitions are scattered over a broad area, creating a blanket of explosions which can cover several hectares.  In fact, this type of munition is a permanent threat to a civilian population and a violation of international and humanitarian law.</P>
        <P>Ireland is well placed to hold the convention and to take a lead on this.  Ireland is one of the countries that spends very little on armaments.  Its economic and social development and its position on the human development index have risen consistently.  We may compare this with states that spend huge percentages of their gross domestic product on armaments.  Many of these are very poor countries that can least afford to spend anything on weaponry.  Even our nearest neighbours spend up to 3% of GDP on armaments.  Over the past 20 years this has amounted to a significant cumulative total being spent on an industry that is of no further benefit to the community.  I suggest the reason Ireland is high on the human development index and is among the best countries in the world in which to live, according to <i>The Economist</i>, is that we have consistently gone on the right path.  This is shown today in the fact that there is cross-party support for banning particular types of munitions.</P>
        <P>What concerns me is that even if we ban cluster bombs, the industry will come up with something else equally or more devastating.  In the future I would like to see Ireland take the lead &mdash; and the Minister is the man to do this &mdash; in encouraging all countries to focus on military spending that is used exclusively for peacekeeping purposes.  I know it is a big thing to ask.  A total of &euro;1.2 trillion was spent in 2006 on armaments.  If we consider what could have been done with this money <Col N="1685"/>in terms of education, provision of food and helping those states that are most in need of help in terms of health, we can see that we have missed some wonderful opportunities, yet this amount was spent on armaments.  In many cases it is a race to ensure a nation&rsquo;s neighbour does not have more tanks or armaments than the nation that is buying them or to maintain an equivalent level of destruction.</P>
        <P>I have been thinking about something that happened in the 1980s which certainly educated me.  My father said he had spoken to a banker who had told him that the next war would be between Iran and Iraq.  I was fascinated by this because there was no indication at that stage of a deterioration in relations.  There was nothing in the media to indicate that this would happen.  However, the banker was quite adamant.  He insisted he had seen the amounts being spent and the armaments that were being procured, not for defensive purposes but for assault purposes.  Before 1 million people died in that war, which is now almost forgotten, the bankers knew it would happen from the large transfer of funds.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have difficulty with this industry.  For that reason, I believe Ireland has a role to play.  It played a significant role in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which stands to this day.  We spend on armaments for defensive purposes, for example, for our troops in Chad and for the proper tasks Ireland has carried out during its proud record in the United Nations.  However, there are permanent risks with certain types of munitions, particularly those being discussed today.  Civilians who live and work in affected areas run the risk of being killed by cluster bombs.  Between 5% and 40% of cluster munitions do not explode on impact and remain intact on the ground, in trees or on roofs.  They become <i>de facto</i> anti-personnel landmines, waiting for the slightest movement to explode.  They create a lethal danger for the civilian population who encounter them in the course of farm work, deforestation, building and so forth.  Children are especially at risk as they are attracted by the bright colours of certain cluster munitions.  For those who are killed or maimed, sometimes years after the end of a conflict, there is no difference between an anti-personnel landmine and unexploded cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>A further reason for banning cluster munitions is that they are a violation of international and humanitarian law.  Cluster bombs violate the principle of international humanitarian law and make no distinction between civilian and military targets.  Despite this fact and the ban on landmines, cluster bombs are still widely used.  Several million cluster munitions have been dropped.  It costs approximately $1 to produce a cluster bomb but it costs $1,000 to remove it.  These figures are important when discussing developing countries or countries emerging from conflict.  The use of cluster bombs is one of the most indiscriminate and inhumane methods of fighting a war.  It rep<Col N="1686"/>resents war on the civilian population and the innocent.</P>
        <P>I recall a young child being hospitalised in Pristina for the amputation of both legs.  He had been playing with a cluster bomb.  The children found the bomb and put it down a well.  It did not explode so they continued to play with it.  One day they took the bomb out of the well.  The child&rsquo;s 14 year old friend was killed in the explosion while the child had both legs amputated.  That is cruel and unjust.  In Africa, one will hear children ask one if their arms will grow again.  That is the innocence of the people who are suffering.  However, the munitions manufacturers and the bankers continue to have the inside track.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Leader of the House is present because I feel very strongly about the disgraceful way the business was re-ordered in the House.  It is not true that the Whips of all the parties knew about it or were consulted.  Mine was not and the Fine Gael speaker had no knowledge of it.  The first speaker from Fianna F&aacute;il was hauled out of the Forum on Europe.  That is not the way to do business.  I am sorry to have to say it because the Leader and I get on well.  I attended the discussion on the Order of Business.  I had to leave to make an urgent telephone call to the foreign affairs committee&rsquo;s delegation in Palestine.  I then had to attend a briefing on landmines, which was perfectly legitimate business.  It had to be aborted and I was obliged to drive back through the traffic to get to the Chamber in time.  I wish to register that protest.</P>
        <P>I thank all speakers for their contributions.  I absolutely accept the Minister&rsquo;s credentials; I know this issue is close to his heart.  All speakers spoke eloquently, passionately and well, and showed a commitment that does honour to this country.  I also pay tribute to Tony D&rsquo;Costa from Pax Christi, who appeared before the foreign affairs committee, and Joe Murray from Afri, who also did so and briefed us on this matter.  I am pleased the Minister is opening discussions with the Minister for Finance.  There is still a long way to go.  I recall bringing a young lobbyist to meet the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to discuss ethical guidelines for the national pensions fund.</P>
        <P>I can give the Minister the further information I have received about this, the so-called &ldquo;Dossier of Shame&rdquo;.  It lists money invested in the arms trade, against which Senator Hanafin spoke so eloquently, by national pension funds on behalf of the pensioners of the State.  The amounts are so piddling, they could easily be divested.  Boeing, USA, produces aircraft, electronics, missiles and space technology and maintains and upgrades the US Air Force&rsquo;s Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile or the main element of its land based strategic nuclear weapons.  The value of <Col N="1687"/>Irish pension fund shares in the company is &euro;18,871,586.  Northrop Grumman, USA, produces aircraft, electronics, missiles, military ships and space technology and is a contractor for the upkeep and upgrading of the US force&rsquo;s main land based strategic nuclear weapons, including the Minuteman III.  The value of Irish shares in the company is &euro;2.5 million.  Lockheed Martin, USA, produces aircraft, electronics, missiles, cluster bombs and space technology.  The value of Irish shares in the company is &euro;17,124,321.</P>
        <P>BAE Systems, UK, produces artillery, aircraft, electronics, military vehicles, small arms, ammunition and so forth and the value of Irish shares in the company is &euro;14,543,571.  Raytheon, USA has a plant in Derry that was picketed some time ago, and Irish people were sent to jail for it.  This firm is on our land mass.  It should be divested of the Irish shares valued at &euro;12,392,445.  General Dynamics, USA, also manufactures cluster bombs and the value of Irish shares in the company is &euro;12.75 million.  In Finmeccanica, Italy, the value of Irish shares is &euro;9,680,000.  EADS of the Netherlands also manufactures cluster bombs and the value of the Irish shareholding is &euro;19,488,139.  L-3 Communications, USA, manufactures cluster bombs and the value of the Irish shareholding is &euro;692,916 while the Irish shares in Thales, France, is &euro;6,636,000.  All these shareholdings amount to a total of approximately &euro;60 million which could easily be divested.  I urge the Minister to try to persuade his colleague to do so.</P>
        <P>I, too, have experience with these munitions.  A family known to Ezra and me was collecting scrap and picked up some of these weapons.  One fellow, who was lucky, was killed instantly, another was blinded, another had his stomach blown up and the fourth, who was 17, had both hands blown off.  We tried to raise money to get him prosthetic arms so he could at least make an effort to survive.  However, we got a telephone call a month later to tell us he had died of delayed shock.  It suddenly hit him that he had no hands simply as a result of collecting scrap.</P>
        <P>We need a clear commitment to a timescale for the legislation.  The Minister has heard some doubts expressed, although not malicious ones, that this exercise might be put on the long finger.  I do not believe it will be and I sincerely hope not.  I congratulate my colleagues who spoke so eloquently, despite all of us suffering as a result of the short notice.  It is a good day for the Seanad to have this motion passed on an all-party basis.  That is the way these humanitarian issues should be handled.  I thank the Minister for being present until the end of the debate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach inniu.  I call on the Minister for Education and Science to examine the Finn Valley college issue.  The Stranorlar technical school, which was built in 1939 and opened in 1940, is the oldest County Donegal Vocational Educational Committee school today.  On 5 April 2007, Stranorlar technical school officially changed its name and is now known as the Finn Valley college or Col&aacute;iste Ghleann na Finne.  In 2005, the Department of Education and Science granted approval for the provision of a 3,452 sq. m. new school.  Planning permission for a new site was granted in November 2006 on the VEC site at Drumboe, Stranorlar.</P>
        <P>The school has 363 students enrolled in the current school year and on 25 February last, approval was granted for a special class encompassing 33 teaching hours on autism-specific disorder, which is due to commence in September 2008.  This is another indication of the excellent broad range of educational opportunities provided by the school.  It is also important to note that the school has a teacher who is trained in applied behavioural analysis methods.</P>
        <P>I refer specifically to the autism class because the current school accommodation and site does not have the space to provide this essential service.  The school site is very compact, comprising 0.996 acres.  Some of the prefabs on the site have been in place for more than 20 years and are inadequate to meet the accommodation needs of the school.  However, the school management and staff, in particular the principal and vice principal, do an excellent job of maintaining the school and the site in pristine condition.</P>
        <P>Tenders for the project approved in 2005 were opened by the finance committee of Donegal VEC and relevant members of the design team on 23 August 2007.  The design team, by letter dated 19 September 2007, forwarded a preliminary tender report to the Department of Education and Science for its consideration.  Subsequently, by letter dated 25 October 2007, the Department requested further or additional information on the design team tender report.  The design team has responded to this request, by letter dated 12 November 2007 and the VEC offered the existing school site to the Department, which has an approximate independent value of &euro;1.5 million, as part payment.</P>
        <P>I urge the Department to accept favourably the offer from the VEC as the site could be used in future to cater for the additional or expanding <Col N="1689"/>needs of the adjacent St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Scoil Mhuire, which has an extensive prefab complex.  I strongly impress upon the Minister the need to issue approval to accept the lowest tender, which was subsequently modified, together with the associated nominated subcontractors and to proceed to contract on this project at the earliest possible date.  The selected contractor has given an undertaking by letter to the VEC to hold the tendered price until the end of May 2008.  It is essential, therefore, that the Minister gives approval to allow this project to proceed at the earliest possible date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House my Department&rsquo;s position regarding the proposed building project for Finn Valley college, Stranorlar, County Donegal.  The existing building dates back to 1939.  The proposed new school will be constructed on a VEC-owned site at Drumboe Lower, Stranorlar, comprising 6.79 acres.</P>
        <P>The proposed project will consist of the construction of a new school building with a proposed floor area of 3,452 sq. m. to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 325 pupils.  The number of pupils enrolled for the current school year is 265.  The new school will comprise four general classrooms, two lecture rooms which are interconnected, specialist rooms, ancillary accommodation and a physical education hall.  A tender report for the proposed project is under examination by the Department.  The contract for the project has not yet been awarded.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  The Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>During the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments over the next few years.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and <Col N="1690"/>the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  The project referred to by the Senator likewise will be considered in that context.  I assure the Senator that the Minister and the Department are committed to providing suitable, high-quality accommodation for Finn Valley college at the earliest possible date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for Education and Science to outline a timeframe for the delivery of the proposed second level school for south Lucan, based on lands at Kishogue Cross, which the Department has agreed to in its submission to South Dublin County Council on the variations for the Clonburris local area action plan.  I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this issue today and to ask the Minister of State to confirm that the Minister has agreed to this secondary school and to outline the timeframe for its development.</P>
        <P>I welcome the change of heart by the Minister and her Department on this matter.  I first raised this issue some time ago on the Adjournment and through parliamentary questions.  I thank Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea who raised it as a Priority Question with the Minister for Education and Science, which was when we began to see a chink of light on the issue.  The attitude of the Department at that time was that the need for such a school had not been fully established.  I am glad to see the Minister and her Department now realise this is not the case.</P>
        <P>The figures and the statistics that have been put forward by the Lucan south secondary school action group highlight very clearly the need for the school in this rapidly growing area.  The statistics that have been gathered by parents must impress the Minister because they are better than those the Department had on its files when this matter was first examined.  I commend the action group consisting of local parents for its enthusiasm, determination and absolute commitment to obtaining a school for a rapidly growing area that has been ill-served by infrastructure, despite many houses being built in the region.</P>
        <P>I cannot over-emphasise the stress that has been caused to families unable to plan ahead because they do not know which school their children will be enrolled in.  I do not believe we would have reached this point if parents had not taken this matter into their own hands and collected the statistics and figures that create a compelling case to be put before the Department.</P>
        <P>It appears the Department has agreed to the need for such a school for the area and that it could be located on lands at Kishogue Cross.  This was stated in a submission to South Dublin County Council on variations to the Clonburris local area plan.  The council will examine this next week.  I ask the Minister to take the essential next step in setting down a timeframe for the delivery of such a school because only by doing this can parents plan and can the local community have <Col N="1691"/>confidence that this will happen.  For far too long the request for a second level school was ignored by the Department and I hope this has been rectified.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, has to say on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I wish to thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding the delivery of the proposed second level school for south Lucan.</P>
        <P>As I have already mentioned, in the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment that reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments over the next number of years.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific matter in hand, based on current demographic trends my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in Lucan in the medium term and we have asked South Dublin County Council to identify a site for this development as part of the Clonburris local area development plan.  A timeframe for the delivery of the school will be known when a suitable site has been identified and acquired by my Department.  Once a suitable site is acquired my Department will progress the project to ensure the earliest possible delivery of this school.  In the meantime, my Department has increased capacity at the four existing post-primary schools to 3,000 places.  The current combined enrolment is 2,500, which means that there is spare capacity for some 500 pupil places.</P>
        <P>A building project which is in train for Lucan Community College will further increase capacity by 200 pupil places.  In addition to this, a building project for St. Joseph&rsquo;s College has been assessed and the project brief, which will provide an additional 200 places, has been agreed.</P>
        <P>The combined total of extra places that will be available when these projects are completed will be 900, which is the equivalent of a post-primary school in its own right.  These measures will assist in reducing pressure for pupil places in the short to medium term while the process of advancing the project for a new school continues.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator for raising this matter and for allowing me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position in regard to <Col N="1692"/>the delivery of the proposed second level school for south Lucan.</P>

    <Title>Cross-Border Business Park. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the need for a cross-Border business park in east Donegal and I have in mind locations including, among others, Muff, Bridgend, Newtowncunningham, areas around Killea and Carrigans.  There is an obvious location at Bridgend that may have greater benefits than the other areas on the basis of its proximity to Buncrana, which the IDA has earmarked for focussed investment.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister of State is before the House today because he represents the Department of Education and Science.  One of the strong points of my area derives, in a funny way, from the demise of the textile industry.  People tended to leave school early when the textile industry thrived and its demise hit hard because whole families were employed in it and, therefore, were left unemployed.  There has not been great change in the level of businesses entering the region, though there is a small number of successful new enterprises, and this is why I again raise the concept of a cross-Border business park.</P>
        <P>Northern Ireland will host a major economic conference seeking investment in May but I am not sure how much the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has done with regard to developing an all-island dimension to this call from the North.  We may say that the North is a different jurisdiction with its own business but we talk about the all-island approach in other contexts.  I ask the Minister of State to inform the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that his Department should be represented at the conference, where it can push the concept of a business park in east Donegal.  This park will be above and beyond what is in Letterkenny and will support the area I am from, Inishowen, but will only be beneficial if it creates additional opportunities.  It would not be acceptable to merely relocate people from one side of the Border to the other on account of our tax policies.  If we have service sites on the Border that can be sold by the IDA there is bound to be a positive impact on both the Derry side and the Donegal side.</P>
        <P>Derry is the fourth largest city on this island so mutual collaboration is the key because it will mean east Donegal is surrounded by access points.  One of the difficulties in selling my area is that people see Ireland not as a 32 county island but a 26 county island.  Derry is accessible by air and, slowly, by train; roads are being improved and we are surrounded by water.  Letterkenny Institute of Technology is receiving serious investment from the Government, which is helping it with innovation funds and incubation units.  I hope the incubation units and the drive that comes from the innovation fund will filter into businesses but if businesses in incubation <Col N="1693"/>units create ideas they will need service sites to move into.  This is apart from the fact that we need locations for outside investors.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that the potential of my area is being maximised.  Decentralisation is to reach Buncrana, the &euro;21 million investment has begun and building work is commencing but we must sell the message that the area is as good any in which to invest.  The situation is not helped when jobs are threatened, such as those related to the Coast Guard at Malin Head.  Signals from Government on the importance of a location are crucial.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because we have spoken of a cross-Border business park for some time and Sir Reg Empey studied the location from a Northern Irish perspective a long time ago.  We have talked about this for too long and action is needed.  Someone must make a decision.  The IDA must stop examining sites and start acquiring sites, creating the basic infrastructure that is needed.  For example, if there is a good response to the investment conference in May we may be able to get some of the benefits in the north west.  If people are drawn through an investment conference in the North to looking at Derry as an option, a cross-Border business park or a business park in Donegal will attract those same people because corporation tax and other incentives will ensure they come to us rather than stay in Derry.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State has good news for me.  Given the many tours into the area I hope there will be many announcements of investment.  I come from a good location that has a good support network of education.  We are beside the fourth largest city in the country and we should exploit the potential of the May conference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to take this Adjournment matter in my capacity as a Minister of State also based at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>While the economies of Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland may have many differences the global competitive challenges faced by business enterprises in both jurisdictions are the same.  It is appropriate that we should jointly address those challenges where there is mutual benefit to be achieved.</P>
        <P>One of the outcomes from the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland is the opening up of opportunity to pursue mutually beneficial cross-Border co-operation on aspects of economic policy, infrastructure and spatial planning.  The Agreement set out a new vision for the island of Ireland and the institutions established under the Agreement have shown the benefits that can be derived from all-island collaboration.  The Agreement facilitates the development of specific initiatives that can exploit the combined attributes of &ldquo;paired&rdquo; urban centres on each side of the border.  The north west gateway initiative that was launched in 2006 is a joint North-South approach to the <Col N="1694"/>development of the north west and provides a strategic action plan to further develop this region of the island.</P>
        <P>In economic terms, Ireland is distinguished for the quality of our national capabilities, innovation, creativity and success in attracting foreign direct investment.  IDA Ireland is experienced in the work of promoting inward investment and is constantly moving its focus and direction in response to both local economic development needs in Ireland and to the changing nature of foreign direct investment globally.  To support its mission and promote balanced regional development, IDA Ireland works closely with other agencies on the island to promote the island of Ireland as an investment location for mutual benefit.</P>
        <P>Any proposal to capitalise on or to increase our ability to advance this agenda will be considered carefully by my Department and agencies under its remit.  In this context, I am aware that, only last week, a speculative outline proposal for an IDA Ireland business park, to be located on the Donegal side of the Derry-Donegal border, designed to attract foreign direct investment, was received by the Southern Joint Secretariat of the North-South Ministerial Council.  This proposal has only come to the attention of my Department and has been forwarded to IDA Ireland for examination and consideration.  The Senator can rest assured that this proposal will be given due consideration by the agency.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this regard one of the most significant developments in recent years has been the close co-operation between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland in the north west leading to the creation of the Virtual Cross Border Technology Park linking Letterkenny and Derry.  This process commenced in 2000 when both State agencies worked together to market the north west of Ireland, namely, Donegal and Derry, to prospective foreign direct investment as a cross-Border park.  This cross-Border project was approved EU Structural funding of &euro;10 million by the Interreg Steering Committee, under the Interreg IIIA Programme for Ireland and Northern Ireland, 2000 to 2006.</P>
        <P>The fundamental concept of the virtual park was to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry as an economic corridor.  The aim of the park initiative was to exploit the improved political environment in Northern Ireland to develop an economic corridor of scale in the Letterkenny-Derry area that would act as a catalyst for the economic development of the entire north west region.</P>
        <P>A key focus of the virtual park has been to generate an urban location of scale by developing initiatives that allow Letterkenny and Derry to effectively operate, as much as is practical, as one economic entity.  The corridor has a population of approximately 120,000 with a hinterland of 300,000 to  400,000.  This mirrors the Cork region in terms of population.  In addition, it aims to build a substantial resource of new high quality <Col N="1695"/>property solutions on both sides of the Border and to develop an integrated, high quality, high capacity and resilient telecoms network, capable of meeting the most demanding needs of both existing and new prospective foreign direct investment and indigenous industry companies.  The project also aims to develop a strong level of participation by the various third level education and research institutions within the Letterkenny-Derry corridor, in initiatives and projects that form close collaborative links with industry and build research and development capability in targeted areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Improvements to the road infrastructure connecting the properties are being conducted as part of the virtual park in both Letterkenny and Derry.  Some key elements of the virtual park initiative have not yet been completed, such as the completion of the property elements by both IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland before the end of 2008 Interreg deadline and the finalisation and implementation of a marketing and promotional strategy that maximises the image of the virtual park.  A comprehensive study on the all-island economy in 2006, which was commissioned by the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, recognised the need for driving North-South co-operation and identified a number of areas where co-ordinated policy intervention would prove beneficial to both jurisdictions.  The areas identified included co-operation on trade and investment promotion, research and development and the development of the knowledge economy, education and training systems to enhance human capital, and co-ordinated provision of key transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
        <P>While the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland offer different packages to attract foreign direct investment, it is in the interest of both jurisdictions to co-operate on an island of Ireland basis where there is mutual advantage, including <Col N="1696"/>through collaboration between the enterprise development agencies, North and South.  IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland agree that the ongoing development of the business environment is critical and that a common working agenda in the areas of skills enhancement and infrastructure provision should be pursued in the interests of attracting foreign direct investment to the island.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the virtual cross-Border technology park, this co-operation between the enterprise development agencies is evident in a number of ways.  Each year the boards of IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland meet to review and discuss issues of mutual concern.  On 15 February 2008 the chairmen and chief executives of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland attended a lunch meeting hosted by Dr. Martin McAleese at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  The meeting discussed potential areas for co-operation and mutual benefit and provided a useful forum for discussion of economic development and cross-Border co-operation between the agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">IDA Ireland, along with the other development agencies, is also available to assist with plans for the forthcoming conference on US investment in Northern Ireland to be held in Belfast on 8 and 9 May and IDA Ireland officials in the United States have already provided help on the ground to the Northern Ireland bureau in Washington.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am confident that the efforts and hard work of Governments, both North and South, together with the hard work and co-operation of the agencies on the ground will continue to build on the foundations that have already been laid arising from the peace dividend and will see continued improvements in terms of jobs and infrastructure for the people on both sides of the Border.</P>
