	<P>I have received notice from Senator Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the increase in the rate of unemployment in Cork in the past 12 months and to put in place job creation policies to address the issue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the Government&rsquo;s actions in imposing savage cutbacks and other negative measures on the Equality Agency, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Irish Human Rights Commission and other State established bodies which have the responsibility of representing the marginalised and vulnerable in our society.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to indicate the reason active draft net licence holders on the Foyle River lost their licences and were not offered compensation from the hardship scheme; and the amount of funding that was made available to this scheme by the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the measures that have taken place to implement Recommendation 1283 on history and the learning of history in Europe.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Buttimer, Norris and &Oacute; Domhnaill and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I announce the Order of Business, I propose to take tributes to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan before No. 1, with three minutes for leaders and constituency <Col N="176"/>colleagues.  The Order of Business is No. 1, motion on the conduct of defence of legal proceedings on behalf of named Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; and No. 2, statements on agriculture, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and to conclude not later than 7 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes and all other Senators, seven minutes, Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons or leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks I have asked again and again in this House where is the Government&rsquo;s plan for this country, our economy and public services.  I return to this because there is a crisis of leadership in the country, a lack of confidence in the Government and a need for a coherent plan on all fronts, including crime, the economy and the health services.  There is a lack of coherence in what is coming from the Government.  We see the farmers protest with  thousands of people on the streets.  We see older people taking to the streets.  Teachers, students and parents are holding huge meetings around the country.  A hospital unit in Navan has closed due to a lack of funds.  Many arbitrary cutbacks are made here and there.  We were promised a further debate in this House on the economy.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the Small Firms Association said it was extremely concerned at the threat to jobs.  Those businesses see that before Christmas they will lose jobs.  Many are unsure whether they can continue during the Christmas period and after it.   They are seriously concerned about the lack of credit.  It is very clear that the banks are not lending.  What is the Government&rsquo;s plan for the banks?  It is another example of the Government sowing confusing.  Shareholders are not investing but are withdrawing because of this vacuum.  In the interests of citizens, families and maintaining employment, we need clear Government action and capitalisation in the banks.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy as soon as possible.  We were promised such a debate some weeks ago.  It is high time we had it.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to get back to the House on the medical card issue.  We were told that a new means test form would be sent out to elderly people.  Is any further information available in that regard?  Many people are concerned that they may lose their medical cards.  There is huge concern about the implications of the recent changes for individuals and families.  I ask the Leader to get back to the House with information on when these letters will be sent out.  What will be contained in them?  What detail will be sought in the new means test forms that will be sent to thousands of people throughout the country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also disappointed that we are not addressing certain issues.  Three weeks ago, the Leader gave me a commitment that he would arrange a debate on education.  He said it would be done without a problem.  It has not happened, however.  During the same week, he assured us that the House would discuss the economy at least once a month.  Such debates are not taking place.  The discussions in question are crucial.  I could name a few more issues that need to be considered.  The Leader and I have spoken privately about the current difficulties in the economy.  An opportunity needs to be provided for us to put our opinions on the record.</P>
        <P>We need to reach an understanding of where are going with regard to the banks.  Senators stayed here all night to support the Government&rsquo;s initial response to the crisis.  The House is surely entitled to discuss the effectiveness of this country&rsquo;s approach, and the next step that will be taken, with a member of the Government.  We need to understand some issues which are not in the public domain.  I am not sure that capitalisation is the answer.  At the beginning of this period, the Financial Regulator said that the Irish banks were capitalised to the same extent as the rest of Europe, or more so.  That has proven to be the case.  Governments through<Col N="177"/>out Europe have decided to increase the level of capitalisation from 6% or 7% to 8% or 9%.  Billions of euro will be needed to do that.  The banks decided not to pay out dividends &mdash; to hold back money &mdash; for that reason.</P>
        <P>I would like to get some answers on this issue.  I may be wrong about it.  We do not have enough information to make a call on it.  I do not want to recapitalise the banks if they intend to hold those moneys in store to sort out their own problems, before carrying on as they were before.  I would like two things to happen.  We should require this country&rsquo;s banks to use the money they can draw down from the European Central Bank to fund properly risk-assessed small businesses and other entrepreneurial initiatives within the State.  The banks are choking development, in effect.  They are choking business at a time when money is available at EU level to be drawn down.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
        <P>I am afraid that the recapitalisation of the banks would amount to no more than putting money into a safe in the ground, regardless of the level of equity we might get in response.  It would never come out of that safe.  I do not think that is how we should proceed.  If money is made available to the banks from the Irish Government, rather than from Europe, for the specific purpose of oiling the economy, we should require the banks to engage in responsible and properly authorised lending.  That is what needs to be done.  I would like a debate on the matter to take place in the House.</P>
        <P>Many people in this country who have safe jobs and secure incomes are not spending their money.  That is happening because Fianna F&aacute;il is talking down the economy, which is what it accused my colleagues on this side of the House of doing over the past two years.  People are afraid to spend a shilling.  The Government needs to get its act together by encouraging people to spend money if they have it.  Two things are happening at the same time.  First, more and more people are becoming unemployed, as Senator Buttimer said last week.  Second, people who are in safe employment and have assured incomes, such as the Members of the Oireachtas, are not spending money.  We need to ensure that people do not walk away from doing the things they would have done previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The media is full of reports on failures in the health service.  The latest news is that a tragedy like that in the case of the late Susie Long could happen again.  More than 1,000 people have been on the colonoscopy waiting list for more than six months.  More than 250 people have been waiting for more than a year.  This is happening even though we were promised that it would not happen again in our health service.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund said that services of this type would be provided within three months.  Such a contradiction is appalling.  Those who have allowed this to arise expect the public to trust them.  The savings involved amount to approximately 8% and, therefore, it is difficult to have confidence.  Where savings are required, why should anyone believe the correct economies are being identified and how can we be sure the planned economies will be achieved, which is a major worry for anyone who is sick?</P>
        <P>People with acquired brain injury are the latest to be targeted because the home liaison nurse&rsquo;s mileage allowance will be discontinued.  Approximately 10,000 people will be both worried and disadvantaged by this move and I feel especially for those with serious emotional or behavioural difficulties as a result of their injuries.  They will have to find their own way to treatment centres rather than the staff visiting them and the cost of transporting those who have suffered a stroke or who, because of an accident, have serious physical impairments to a centre will increase.  While there will be a small saving, I question its benefit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should worry about the direction of the health service.  I am concerned about nursing home standards as we await the implementation of proper standards.  While I broadly welcome <Col N="178"/>the thrust of the Health Information and Quality Authority document, additional inspectors will be needed but when will they be hired?  The House should have a proper debate about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The newspapers reported today on the scheme the Health Service Executive proposes to cut costs, which includes reducing overtime by 50%, reducing on-call cover and closing wards at the weekend.  I call on the executive to make a commitment to health professionals to support them in meeting their statutory obligation with regard to safe practice under the respective codes of professional conduct and it also needs to spell out how it intends to replace the 13,000 nursing and midwifery posts lost in the past 12 months while ensuring quality of care.</P>
        <P>I cannot leave this subject without referring to the attack on the dignity of patients undergoing chemotherapy because the latest cutback in this regard involves the withdrawal of funding to patients towards the cost of a hair piece when undergoing treatment.  That will seriously affect the psychological outlook of those experiencing the trauma and uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis.  The use of a hair piece can have a significant impact by boosting the self-esteem of patients and helping to keep them going during their treatment.  Hair pieces cost between &euro;600 and &euro;1,200 and approximately 100 people per year require this aid.  The time has come for us to refocus on the effects of cutbacks.  It is an absolute tragedy to sit in front of people who are so distraught because their self-esteem has been damaged by the withdrawal of the small amount that goes towards them maintaining their dignity while facing a difficult diagnosis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions in the past few years, I raised the issue of the future of No. 16 Moore Street, the house where the leaders of the 1916 Rising made their last stand.  It represents a significant piece of our history and I am glad Dublin City Council has decided to preserve the house as an historic building and that it will become a heritage site.  I do not have all the details but ministerial approval is required and I hope that will be forthcoming.  I compliment the young lady who has translated a number of Pearse&rsquo;s writings into the Polish language.  She first had to translate them from Irish into English because we do not have an Irish-Polish dictionary yet.  However, that is good news, as it also shows interest is increasing among both Irish and non-Irish people in that period of our history and the literature and poetry of the time.  Perhaps that will be also reflected in the heritage centre planned for No. 16 Moore Street.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to a speech delivered this day last year. I will read out a few excerpts from it.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is wonderful to realise that there is a new generation in Ireland which has never faced the hardship of high levels of unemployment, or . . . the bleak depression of forced emigration . . . As a people we will resist reckless economic policies or inappropriate fiscal actions[.]</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whose speech is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know in advance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>One might ask who is this person:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland has used our exceptional growth rates to effectively manage the public finances in a way which has reinforced economic prosperity . . . I have made it clear, time and again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="179"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>To be honest, anyone can stand up in the House with any speech from anywhere.  I asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is merely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I need it to be identified for the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to identify it.  It is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, could I indicate to Senator Regan that it is a convention of the House that if something is to be quoted from, it is indicated immediately to the Cathaoirleach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was my understanding.  Just identify the source of the quote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, I respect that.  The person who delivered this speech is, in fact, Deputy Brian Cowen, the current Taoiseach, and it was delivered to the Royal Irish Academy last year.  The point is that he stated, &ldquo;As a nation we cannot progress equity without ongoing public investment in areas such as health and education which impact on our most vulnerable citizens.&rdquo;  This is just one year out from the collapse in the economy and the collapse in public finances.  To suggest at that time, with the knowledge he had, that there were a few little challenges but everything was essentially hunky dory is very worrying.  This is the man who is leading the country and is intent on leading us out of our economic difficulties.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of the emergency legislation on the guarantee to banks.  We need to have that debate which was promised on the economy.  It has been stated in this House on a number of occasions that the emergency legislation and the guarantee only resolved one issue &mdash; liquidity &mdash; but it did not resolve the issue of capitalisation.  It is a self-evident fact that if one must provide a guarantee, there must be recapitalisation of the banks before that guarantee can ever be lifted.  The markets indicate day in, day out that such action is required.  The Government has dithered on it and it only introduced the bank guarantee in a crisis.  What the Government is waiting for is another full-blown crisis in the banking sector before it acts or indicates any type of coherent policy.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance got a great deal of kudos for that bank guarantee scheme which he introduced, albeit in a crisis.  However, in a survey in the <i>Financial Times</i> today he ranks bottom of all of the Ministers of Finance in Europe.  That is very bad for this Government and for this economy.  It does not give us confidence that either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance can devise a strategy to take us out of the current economic difficulties.  I do not know if the Leader would concur with that assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that there is a great deal of business before the House and I will be brief.  In my contributions to the Seanad I have concentrated on two matters: reform of the public sector and reform of the criminal justice system.  On reform of the public sector, there is a task force report due in which I have no great confidence since it is top heavy with civil servants.  Accordingly, it would be hypocritical of me to go on criticising the public service and this need for reform and looking for pay freezes without addressing the matter myself.  I was touched by a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday from Mr. Molloy who stated that people in the public sector who have permanent pensionable jobs and who have pension schemes which are index linked should take a pay cut.  Accordingly, I have told my office to tell the Minister for Finance that he can have 10% of my salary as soon as he wants it.  Under section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, he can apply the money to any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided.  Indeed, if I could earmark it, I would not mind <Col N="180"/>it going to Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s fund for hair pieces for people with cancer who need the image.  I might be in need of it myself soon.</P>
        <P>As a former trade unionist, I hate doing this.  People should be able to keep the money they earn.  I do not think anybody understands the seriousness of the economic situation of the country.  My colleagues are under no obligation, but I would be a hypocrite, since I am one of the leaders of the charge on the public sector, if I continued to take money while asking others to take a 10% cut.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the calls made for a debate on the economy and the position of the banks.  We should have this debate rather than the debate proposed for Private Members&rsquo; time on Wednesday on tourism.  Important though that subject is, the economy should be a more pressing issue of concern for us at present.</P>
        <P>I note Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point that there may be a cycle of fear whereby people are afraid to spend, even where their money and income are secure, because of the threat of recession looming.  There is a human element of compassion to that as people do not want to be seen to be spending, or flath&uacute;lach in their spending when there is a recession and others around them are losing their jobs.  A recession anxiety has gripped the country and it is not only a matter of talking things down.  In that context we need a debate on that matter and a chance to put on the record the issues and criticisms which some Members on the other side of the House expressed about public services and the issues and criticisms those on this side of the House expressed about the banks&rsquo; guarantee.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday by a number of leading academic economists outlined for us the problems with the banks&rsquo; guarantee and the prospect that we will need an investment, a conditional investment, so banks are obliged to lend to small businesses and not sit on the assets they have.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the pressing issue of female genital mutilation and the need for legislation to prohibit that practice in Ireland.  This issue is topical today when an unfortunate decision was made by the High Court to refuse leave to remain in Ireland to a Nigerian woman who applied to stay because she is in fear that her two young daughters will be circumcised if she returns to Nigeria.  I took part in a dignified vigil at the weekend in support of this woman and her family.  She has many supporters in her local community and throughout Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a decision of the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the court&rsquo;s decision, which is about female genital mutilation and the fear of that on return to a country of origin, I call for a debate, as a matter of urgency, on our attitude to female genital mutilation, the need for legislation to prohibit the practice in Ireland and to extend jurisdiction to where it is practised elsewhere and where there is a connection to this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share in the calls for a debate on the economy, with particular emphasis on the banks.  Like other Senators, I was happy to stay up all night to put through the emergency legislation to ensure stability in the banking sector.  All Irish banks have remained solid and the banks state that they do not need recapitalisation, but, unfortunately, the banks are retrenching very significantly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In business terms, liquidity is considered to be life blood.  Liquidity is being removed from the marketplace by the banks.  Under no circumstances do I want to see a situation where, having provided stability for the banks, they increase the number of <Col N="181"/>repossessions.  That is particularly poignant at Christmas.  They should work with customers and show them the same support that we, on behalf of the people, show them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of two medium to large sized businesses where the owners are telling department heads to purchase nothing for January and that only what is in stock is to be sold over Christmas because they do not want to receive bills in January.  That was not the reason we stayed up all night, put emphasis on ensuring stability and took the risk for the State.  The last thing we want is for the banks to stop lending because then recession becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Good firms need money and they need to be capitalised now.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The question I am constantly asked in Galway is how many of our businesses will make it to Christmas.  These are perfectly fine businesses but they need cashflow to survive.  We are talking about people&rsquo;s livelihoods.  Banks are not supporting these businesses when they need it, even though we bailed out the same banks.  Businesses must pay their rates soon and have just paid their rents, which remain high, and their taxes.  At the same time, suppliers are curtailing the amount of credit they are willing to provide for businesses.</P>
        <P>Why are the banks cutting back?  This question must be answered.  Is it because they are short of capital for lending?  If so, why not recapitalise them?  The banks claim such capitalisation is not required, but this is merely a case of management protecting its own interests.  It is a sinister development.  International best practice suggests that we should recapitalise the banks, fire all senior management, clean out the boards and start afresh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Senator Tony Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who is going through the uncertainty to which Senator Prendergast referred, I support her call for the appropriate and adequate funding of certain cancer services.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader ask the appropriate Minister &mdash; I am not sure whether it is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government &mdash; whether legislation will be considered for the regulation of management companies?  These companies oversee the running of the apartment complexes which are largely occupied by young, first-time buyers.  There is no regulation of these companies, which seem able to charge whatever fee they wish.  I was contacted recently by a young woman who purchased her home in 2006 &mdash; in either the good times or the bad times, depending on how one looks at it &mdash; when she paid over the odds for an apartment that is now worth &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 less.  However, her annual management fee has increased from &euro;1,090 in 2007 to &euro;1,800 in 2008.  It seems that where apartments in a complex remain unsold, the management companies simply lump those lost fees on to the owners of the occupied apartments.  That is very unfair on first-time buyers who are already struggling to pay their mortgages and who now find themselves with annual management fees which are the equivalent or more of a monthly mortgage repayment.  Something must be done to introduce regulation in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in expressing concern about the state of our financial institutions.  We heard today that shares in two major banks, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank, are now valued at less than &euro;1.  The latter&rsquo;s current valuation of &euro;600 million is only slightly higher than that of Paddy Power.  Is it time for the Government to consider taking a stake in some of the banks to ensure that it can direct them to be lenient with home owners who fall behind in their mortgage repayments?</P>
        <P>A report in this week&rsquo;s <i>Sunday Observer</i> noted that 39 albinos in Tanzania have been killed in the past year because their corpses are considered to be lucky charms.  This is generating <Col N="182"/>much fear among albinos in that country.  The organisation representing them is calling for international pressure to be applied to the Tanzanian Government to take action in this regard.  Perhaps the Leader will convey our concerns to the excellent ambassador to Tanzania, Ms Anne Barrington, and ask her to do what she can to help the albino community in Tanzania.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Kett in expressing concern about the activities of management companies.  While &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; comes in for considerable criticism on occasion in this House, yesterday&rsquo;s show did an excellent job of exposing the difficulties experienced by residents in this regard.  In some estates in Trim, for example, the lights are being turned off because bills have not been paid.  I am aware of estates in Ashbourne where lifts are not being replaced because of financial problems with the management company.  It is a year since the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told this House that we could expect legislation on this matter from his Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The reason we have seen nothing since cannot be because we are swamped with legislation in this House.  Action must be taken and I ask the Leader to convey our concerns to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with some of the comments about the banks.  It is now a critical situation for small and medium sized businesses which are being squeezed daily and weekly for finance.  They depend on restructuring their businesses at certain times of the year, as has been made clear.  There is no question that the marketplace is telling us we have a major problem and that the banks will require capitalisation.  However, we should not be too quick to consider recapitalising them until we have the full picture, and we are only now getting that picture because the Government has put people into the banks to examine the books and establish what type of liabilities there are.  It is prudent to examine the situation first, and capitalise on the basis of the liabilities of each bank.  We are aware there are substantial liabilities with some developers.</P>
        <P>Part of the proposed debate on the economy should be about the banks.   They are key to ensuring stability in banking services.  If we do not have that, there will not be inward investment or support for small and medium businesses, which will lead to a worse recession when we will not have businesses at all.  This is what I fear.  Nevertheless, we must be careful before recapitalising the banks.  We must know what amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money will be involved.  After all, no one will thank us if we do not do our homework first and ensure the taxpayer is getting value for money if an investment is made in the banks.  That is how we should proceed.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on aviation policy?  This week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, hinted that the separation of Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports might not proceed.  I have raised this issue in a debate on the Adjournment and through requests to the Leader, but the Minister for Transport has not yet come to the House.  It is important that we have this debate.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in seeking a debate on the economy.  Unemployment is increasing, the car industry is in trouble, the number of mortgages issued has decreased by 30,000 this year and the banks are perilously close to going bust.  The response of the Government is a lack of activity.  It is six weeks or more since the banking legislation was before this House but nothing has happened with capitalisation since.  We have been misled by some in the banking profession.  They have told us untruths and misled small and medium sized enterprises which are trying to stay in business.  These enterprises are now being forced into letting their staff go and some are closing owing to liquidity problems and not having access to money.  It is time to tell the banking people: &ldquo;It is time to go; you are the weakest link.&rdquo;  Equally, it is time the Leader told <Col N="183"/>the Minister for Finance it is time to go.  Let us call a general election and let the people decide.  It is time for change and that time is now.</P>

	<P>We have established that whatever debate we have on the economy will also include the issue of the banks.  I agree with the sentiments expressed in the House about what has been happening.  The banks also include the building societies because they have also been bailed out by the Government.  We should realise when we talk about recapitalisation, which will undoubtedly happen very shortly because it will be forced on them, that the banks have been deliberately misleading the people about what they must do.  I was lucky over the weekend to come across a report prepared at enormous cost for the EBS by its public relations personnel.  There are two very dangerous trends running through the report.  It is quite clear the building society was advised of the need to get itself bought by someone before it had to tell its members, who are its owners, what was happening.  It was suggested to get out of the existing position quickly, because the financial results, which must be produced by the end of the year, would be deeply embarrassing.  That represents dishonesty of the most appalling nature.  It is in the report in black and white and is not disputable.  The second trend running through this brief report, which we must debate, is the absolute desire to protect the reputations of the board and the management.  It appears this was all that mattered.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader organise a debate on a recent publication from the National Consumer Agency dealing with buying and living in multi-unit development properties in Ireland.  I support the comments of Senators Kett and Hannigan in seeking a debate, especially on management charges.  I have met with many young people in recent months who have, unfortunately, found themselves made redundant.  Such people are living in properties, as Senator Kett pointed out, that are no longer worth the same as their mortgages.  They find that management charges have increased, in some cases by 80%.  I am familiar with people who have found themselves paying a charge 80% in excess of the charges of previous years.  If such people do not pay the charge on time, interest is charged by the management company, which is very unfair.  This practice is putting them under significant pressure and deeper and deeper into debt.  I support the calls for a debate and perhaps it could be held in the wider context of the contents of the National Consumer Agency publication.</P>

	<P>I share the views of Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and many others regarding the economy and the banking system.  The collapse of bank share prices reinforces the need for Government action if we are to oil the wheels of industry and commerce once more.  As many Senators have said, matters are simply not progressing.  The do nothing or wait-and-see policies of the Government are clearly costing jobs in small industries throughout the country daily.</P><Col N="184"/>
        <P>The markets have decided that recapitalisation of the banks is very urgent.  I share the concern of Senator O&rsquo;Toole that recapitalisation of the banks might simply add to the their cash reserves to enable them to exceed Basel capital requirements, which appears to be a <i>sine qua non </i>for the banks at present.  I believe there must be a firm direction built into the preference shareholding, or whatever system the Government chooses.  I share the concern of others regarding why the process of recapitalisation is taking so long.  The banks now operate a very strict lending policy.  Prospective commercial borrowers must produce not only a good business idea, but any loans must be more than amply secure.  The banks have more conservative values attached to the security offered than ever before.  This is the reason we are at a standstill.  Many people are not being paid and people are not allowed any working capital.</P>

	<P>I agree with my colleagues who want an urgent debate on the economy.  Before I left Athlone this morning, I bought a takeaway coffee from a kiosk.  The chap behind the counter told me that he might just last until Christmas, as his takings were down 20%.  I was talking to a friend of mine who runs a small factory, and he said it was not just that the banks will not give him credit but also that they will not give it to the people who owe him money, such as the small builders, the small developers and so on.  He said that there was no point in the banks giving him money if money is not being circulated.  I agree with Senator Hanafin and those who spoke about the banks.  We cannot allow them to put money aside so that they will not lose face.  We urgently need a debate on the economy, and I call on the Leader to allow it.</P>
        <P>I am the Fine Gael spokesperson on social and family affairs.  Yesterday, a story about a family shattered the popular misconception that young, unmarried people make up the vast number of lone parents.  I highlight the fact that 84% of lone parents work.  That is a shocking statistic for the wider public, although I have known it for a long time.  Only 2% of lone parents are in their teens, which disproves another misconception.  People think lone parents are lazily sitting around waiting for their benefits, but that is not true.  More than 60% of lone parents in receipt of welfare also work.</P>
        <P>In her response to this survey, the Minister stated that it was about motivating young lone parents and getting them back into work.  I do not think it is about motivation at all but about concrete support and practical issues.  The Minister is moving towards compulsory welfare payments, and I am really concerned about that.  She has not provided proper child care.</P>

	<P>Can the Leader request the Minister for Transport to come to the House to explain the visa waiver scheme and his discussions with Mr. Michael Chertoff?  According to this morning&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, he will be required to transmit information about Irish citizens, including fingerprints, information about their religious views, sexual orientation and so on.  It did not say that this was confined to members of the criminal class.  The sharing of information on the fingerprints of criminals is reasonable and legitimate, but I cannot think why religious views or sexual orientation should be made available to the United States Government, which has a notorious record in maintaining these things privately.</P>
        <P>Mr. Ganley of Libertas was before an Oireachtas committee today.  I will be very interested to read the transcripts and see if he was probed about associations with the American defence establishment that have been widely suggested in the newspapers.  If he was, this might well explain some of his opposition to the Lisbon treaty.  It would also confirm me in my view about the increasing militarisation proposed under the treaty.  I repeatedly asked in this House about the status of the European armaments group, which was renamed the European Defence Agency and which for the first time is statutorily included in the architecture of the European Union under this treaty, but I failed to get any answer to it.  The American arms industry would not welcome the establishment of a concentrated and effective European munitions industry with a strong export potential, which has been envisaged.  If this continues in the Lisbon treaty, I will very reluctantly have to campaign against the second referendum.</P>
        <P>We have raised the issue of management committees on this side of the House many times and I am glad to see the Government is now coming on board.  One of the sinister things that could perhaps be addressed by legislation is that developers can refuse to hand over to a democratically elected tenants&rsquo; management committee as long as they retain one unsold unit.  They regularly do this so that they can hand out contracts to their friends and charge whatever they like.  This is something about which we should legitimately be worried.</P>
        <P>Although the issue of the banks has been widely discussed, we are due another debate on that.  Bank of Ireland shares have collapsed and are below &euro;1, while a year ago they were valued at &euro;18.  What about the people who have invested their life savings in this?  I was chairman of the board of a number of charitable companies.  I received nothing from them but I made very sure that I did not trade recklessly.  That is an offence under law.  These people clearly traded recklessly but what is happening to them?  If we are going to capitalise, will we give them more money and leave them there?  I certainly would not be happy handing out money to capitalise people who obviously traded recklessly in the past.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast. Regan, Harris, Bacik, Hanafin, Healy Eames, Hannigan, Buttimer, Butler, Ross, Coghlan and Norris expressed their views on the economy.  There are great concerns about the changing face of the economy on a week by week basis.  I had intended to have a debate on the economy the week after the Finance Bill is published on 3 December, but I will review the situation after these calls and similar calls last week to see how an earlier debate may be facilitated.  Senator Regan quoted an address the Taoiseach gave some months ago, but the situation is changing weekly rather than monthly or annually.  It is unprecedented.  Those of us who have been in business long enough know that what is happening is unprecedented.  World leaders have never faced such a challenge to the global economy, which affects everyone, as we are witnessing now.  I remember the recession in the 1970s and the 1980s.  I was involved in the terrible struggle to keep paying <Col N="186"/>staff wages and maintain employment.  No one has all the answers, and I want colleagues to exercise their minds on this and perhaps come up with a unified suggestion for the Government.</P>
        <P>In times of previous economic downturn, farmers had resort to the ACC, which was a Government-backed bank, while the manufacturing sector and small family businesses had recourse to the ICC, but those institutions are no longer there.  People who were struggling could discuss their problems with a bank and it gave them a break because it was Government-backed.  On this occasion, however, that does not arise.  The difficulty now is that the Government must protect small firms, including family businesses, those who employ approximately 150,000 people.  Those people are very concerned about the challenges they will have to face in the next 18 months.  That being the case, legislators must ensure that some provision is made in the banks&rsquo; guarantee to replace the good work previously done by the ACC and the ICC.  I can certainly say, addressing the Upper House as Leader, that I know dozens and dozens of friends who would not be in employment or would not be giving employment today in a huge way, particularly in the midlands where I am from, were it not for the assistance of those two Government-backed banks in the 1970s and 1980s.  I will do anything I can to assist colleagues in regard to having this debate take place.  I want to help in every way possible in order that we, as Members of the Upper House, play our part.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked the up-to-date position regarding medical cards and I will come back to the House tomorrow morning with that information.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has on numerous occasions requested a debate on education.  I am endeavouring to have this debate take place but, as colleagues know, legislation, which has priority, is being dealt with all day tomorrow and all day Thursday.  I know how seriously colleagues take legislation when it is offered to the House and I look forward to their participation over the next two days.  I have taken on board the strong views expressed in the House last week with regard to legislation getting preference over statements and other debates.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast outlined something really important to the House, namely, the unfortunate plight of the late Susie Long.  Going home from the House one afternoon I heard a re-run on the radio on what poor Susie Long had said and experienced over the seven or eight months she had waited to get into hospital.  Had she been diagnosed with cancer in time, she might be alive today.  Surely it would be the wish of every Member of this House, under your stewardship, a Chathoirleach, that we would learn from the advice and example of the late Susie Long and do whatever we can in order that this can be addressed.</P>
        <P>It is unacceptable that someone is told he or she has cancer but cannot be taken into hospital for three or four months.  If there is a priority to be given to expenditure, surely it must be given to those who are suffering the dreaded plague of cancer.  We should make it one of our principal fights and priorities, as Members of the 23rd Seanad, to seek to do all we possibly can to ensure cancer is made one of the top priorities of the HSE.  No one should be told he or she has cancer and must stay at home for three months.  That is not acceptable.  I will certainly have the Minister to the House to discuss this issue.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has been very co-operative with the House since she was appointed to her portfolio in the current Government.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to penny-pinching cutbacks and the need for self esteem and respect for the unfortunate people who were suffering from the treatment of cancer.  I will certainly have this addressed and will speak to the Minister personally about it.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; welcomed the decision of the city council that No. 16 Moore Street would be preserved.  The building was closely associated with the leaders of 1916.  I join with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in welcoming the decision and we look forward to anything that can be done to <Col N="187"/>enhance the property.  I congratulate the city manager, councillors and the Lord Mayor for this decision.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris referred to the task force on the reform of the public service, which he is making one of his priorities.  My understanding is that this report will be published about 26 November.  I also commend the Senator with regard to taking a reduction of 10% in his salary as his commitment to the plight of the economy at present.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on female genital mutilation, which I can certainly allow to take place.  Senators Kett, Hannigan, Feeney and Norris called for an update on the regulation of apartments and management charges.  I understand from the Deputy Leader, Senator Dan Boyle, that legislation is coming forward and will be in the House in the very near future.  I join the Senators in their call in that regard.  I heard on the radio that 180,000 apartments are now available or are being rented here.  That means that in excess of 250,000 people live in apartments.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan expressed his views on the unfortunate 39 albinos who were killed in Tanzania.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer asked the up-to-date position on the intention of the Government regarding aviation, particularly in respect of the three airports in Cork, Shannon and Dublin.  I made a commitment to have a debate on that.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden called for support for lone parents, working lone parents and lone parents in their teens.  I support the Senator&rsquo;s call and will do anything I possibly can to have a debate on that issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, to come into the House and explain the United States-Ireland agreement that has been successfully concluded.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on what he has done for the Irish who travel to the US in terms of customs clearance.  We all remember the bad old days when we would arrive in New York or some other destination in the US after a long flight and would have to stand for three or three and a half hours while waiting for customs clearance, and there was no air conditioning in those days.  I congratulate the Minister.  I will pass on Senator Norris&rsquo;s strong views on the other issues he raised.</P>

	<P>Today we pay tribute to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, an exceptional figure in Irish public life.  For more than four decades he was at the cutting edge of Irish politics and his achievements, as we all know, were many.  He was driven by a deep desire to serve our country and was instrumental in shaping the modern, outward-looking Ireland of today.</P>
        <P>In the months since S&eacute;amus Brennan left us, very many well deserved tributes have been paid to him and I, too, add my voice to those tributes on behalf of all Members of this House and of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on the passing of one of our top legislators.</P>
        <P>I welcome S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife, Ann, and her family to the Chamber.  I am pleased they can be with us today to hear of the high regard in which S&eacute;amus was held by Members of this House.  I also welcome Frank, who we all know was the hard-working, dedicated private secretary to the late S&eacute;amus.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus had very many friends and admirers on all sides of the political spectrum.  His sad passing at the age of 60 has been deeply felt by many.  He will be long remembered as a <Col N="188"/>brilliant political strategist, a dedicated constituency Deputy, an effective Minister and a great family man.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s interests in politics were cultivated at a tender age by his late father, who had been a prominent Fianna F&aacute;il man and director of elections in County Galway.  It was no surprise when S&eacute;amus became active in Fianna F&aacute;il during his student days in UCG.  Coming to national prominence when he was appointed as General Secretary of the party in the mid-1970s, he was the youngest person to hold that office.  It was the late Jack Lynch who made the inspired decision to appoint S&eacute;amus Brennan as Secretary General of Fianna F&aacute;il.  As a former secretary of a cumann and a comhairle cheantar, he was the person who was in contact with one on a bi-monthly basis.  He was one&rsquo;s inspiration.  He was the person one took the lead from and it was people like S&eacute;amus Brennan who inspired me to become more active in public life.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was appointed to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1977 by the then Taoiseach, the late Jack Lynch.  That appointment sowed the seeds of a long and distinguished career in the politics of our country.  In 1981, S&eacute;amus successfully contested his first general election and was elected in nine successive elections by the people of Dublin South, topping the poll on many occasions.  His great commitment to his constituents and to the service of the people of Ireland made him a formidable vote-getter.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus served with distinction in a wide range of portfolios at senior and junior ministerial level and threw himself into whatever post he held with great enthusiasm.  He first served as Minister of State with responsibility for trade in 1987 before being appointed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications by the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, in 1989.  In a long and distinguished ministerial career, he also held ministerial portfolios in education, communications, transport and social and family affairs.  The penalty points system, which he introduced as the Minister in charge, has saved many lives and many thousands of people from serious injuries.</P>
        <P>As a Minister, S&eacute;amus worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of Ireland and succeeded in bringing forward possible solutions to the many challenges this country faced.  When S&eacute;amus moved from an economic Ministry to social welfare, many wondered how he would cope.  He was passionate about the economy and had a significant interest in economic matters, particularly those relating to transport.  He took on the cause of the less well-off in our society with a passion and a commitment that was truly remarkable.  It is difficult to believe he had not spent his lifetime in that Department.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus gave everything to every job he ever had.  His achievements were numerous and were of a lasting effect.  He established the Forum on Small Business and negotiated significant welfare increases for the most vulnerable in our society.  He published a Green Paper on Education, which placed special emphasis on giving priority to disadvantaged students, and brought forward many new initiatives in air passenger services.</P>
        <P>He also served with great distinction as Government Chief Whip from 1997 to 2002 and played a significant role in ensuring that that Administration completed its full term.  In that role in particular, his natural talent for conciliation, accommodation and managing pressures served him and the Government of the day very well.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus had a strategic mind and a good grasp of public policy.  Ultimately, he believed in doing the right thing by the country and in using his objective political skills to bring the people with us.  I acknowledge the key role he played in the negotiations that led to the formation of the current Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrats Government, with the support of Independent Deputies.</P><Col N="189"/>
        <P>S&eacute;amus was a man of great courtesy and dignity who never uttered a nasty word or comment about anyone because he did not believe it had any role in the political process.  I believe that is the reason he got on so well with everybody and was so successful in persuading people.  Despite his illness and declining health, S&eacute;amus continued to work for his constituents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On behalf of all Members of the House and of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I offer my heartfelt condolences to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife, Ann, who comes from my county, Athlone, and particularly to those on the Ballymahon Road.  I first met Ann and S&eacute;amus in 1971 when the first Ard Fheis was moved to the RDS.  That was a memorable Ard Fheis.  S&eacute;amus was canvassing for the committee of 15 for the National Executive at that time.  It is a long time ago but what a commitment Ann and her family, and her husband S&eacute;amus, have made to this country.  I express condolences on behalf of the people of Ireland, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  To Ann and all her family, go mbeanna&iacute; Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

	<P>I am honoured to speak today on behalf of the Fine Gael group in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to pay tribute to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, Minister, Chief Whip, Deputy and Senator.  He served for over 40 years in public service and, as the Leader of the House said, often he was at the cutting edge of Irish politics.</P>
        <P>I extend my sincere sympathy and condolences to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife, Ann, his children, who are here with us, and his extended family and friends.  I hope they can take some small consolation from the words spoken here today about a much admired politician and man.  S&eacute;amus served in many Ministries under three taoisigh, including Chief Whip, Education, Communications, Transport, Trade, Social and Family Affairs and, most recently, Arts, Sport and Tourism.  What a wonderful record he has had of public service in so many Ministries and as a constituency Deputy.  In all his Ministries he went about his business in a diligent, determined and effective manner.  When he passed away I said how difficult it was to appear on a radio or television programme with S&eacute;amus because one could not argue with him.  He explained his position and policy in such a gentle, calm and reasonable manner, always with a smile and always so courteous.</P>
        <P>To succeed in politics requires a certain temperament.  S&eacute;amus met and exceeded this requirement.  We all saw the effectiveness of his people skills when he kept together a Government supported by a variety of independent Deputies from 1997 until 2002.  This takes a certain character and understanding and S&eacute;amus had such traits in abundance.  Towards the end of his life he showed a steeliness and determination as he battled his illness with such courage, doing his utmost to continue his public duties right up to the end.  It is most sad that this courteous man, a true gent of Irish politics, passed away at such a young age.</P>
        <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I again extend my sympathies and condolences to Ann, her children, Fianna F&aacute;il and all S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s Dublin South constituents, friends and colleagues.  Ireland has lost a decent, honourable man who served this country well.  He is missed and will continue to be missed.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; gur t&oacute;gadh uainn S&eacute;amus agus &eacute; chomh h&oacute;g.</P>
        <P>I first met S&eacute;amus Brennan way back before I had any involvement in politics.  It was 1968 at a party in Galway with some of my family.  I met this young man who was involved in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Some 15 years or more after that when the discussion on the Progressive Democrats was taking place I met one of the people who was at that party and said I wondered whether <Col N="190"/>Seamie Brennan would jump to the Progressive Democrats.  The answer came back quickly that no way would it happen because Fianna F&aacute;il was in his blood and he would never walk away from it.  Those were very sincere words.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ba fear &eacute;, gan amhras, &oacute; iarthar na t&iacute;re, and he brought that west of Ireland attitude &mdash; can do, survive, move it on &mdash; with him nuair a th&aacute;inig s&eacute; isteach i saol polait&iacute;ochta na t&iacute;re seo.  He had those great qualities that trade unionists appreciate more than anything else.  If Fianna F&aacute;il ever writes the ballad of S&eacute;amus Brennan it will be to say that he &ldquo;went on to organise&rdquo;.  He understood the importance of organising more than any trade unionist I ever met.  He was committed to restructuring, remarketing, recreating and bringing forward a new approach, and this was the measure of the man at all times.</P>
        <P>He had extraordinary skills of negotiation and mediation which are the essence of development and creativity.  He showed that time and again in dealing with the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party and the Green Party on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He put matters in context, always opened things up and has left an extraordinary legacy.  He will be remembered as a person who understood the importance of structures, marketing, being a tactician and strategist in political life and, above all, continually changing, refining and advancing the techniques that were important to remain at the top of the tree.  That is how he will be remembered.  If anyone takes the trouble to make a biopic, that will come through.</P>
        <P>I always found him to be courteous and approachable.  Politics was in his blood as he went through the political steps of party general secretary, Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Deputy in the Lower House and Minister.  That was his commitment and he was always going to achieve it.  Over the years I found him a man with whom one could engage.  Many times we on these benches opposed him.  At other times we supported things he did.  I remember having vicious arguments with him on the establishment of Ryanair when he gave away the Stansted slots and the Geneva and Liverpool routes, which were among the first Aer Lingus routes, to Ryanair to get it started.  They were strategic and important issues.  He and I differed fundamentally about the Green Paper on education which he produced as Minister for Education in 1992.  However, that was the essence of his political life.  Politics is about creative difference, argument and engagement.  That was always to be done and one could always engage with him.  His loyalty to his party was unwavering; it was 100% at all times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I began by alluding to Joe Hill and we might finish with the words: &ldquo;Where [Fianna F&aacute;il] defend[s its] rights, it&rsquo;s there you find [S&eacute;amus Brennan].&rdquo;  He will never be far from that discussion, wherever it should take place.  We stand here to tell his family we appreciate, value and remember his great contribution and we say it with thanks from Irish public life for his commitment to the democratic process and giving that great, full life of involvement in democracy, which is to the benefit of every citizen, even those who disagree.  This is an important part of it.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;.  Caithfidh m&eacute; cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; le comhbhr&oacute;n a dh&eacute;anamh lena phairt&iacute;, lena chlann agus, go speisialta, lena bhean ch&eacute;ile, Ann.

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I extend my sympathies to Ann, their children and Seamus&rsquo;s colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Seamus&rsquo;s death was very untimely at the young age of 60 years.  S&eacute;amus was young when former Taoiseach Jack Lynch appointed him general secretary.  He led the modernisation of the party in the 1970s.  He would have enjoyed the recent presidential election in the United States because so many new tactics were used.  When he was over there studying the 1976 election he learned much, which he brought back and used very successfully in the election campaign of 1977 when Fianna F&aacute;il was returned to power with an increase of 20 seats.  He was well known as a master tactician and had a lifelong <Col N="191"/>interest in the study of politics.  He first ran for election in 1981 and since then he fought and won nine consecutive general elections.  His election machine was formidable and my colleagues who have run against him tell me one had to be up very early in the morning to catch S&eacute;amus out.  He recently got a result as high as 13,000 votes.  It is a testament to his ability as a politician, his dedication to his job, the support and commitment of his family and his commitment to his constituency of Dublin South.</P>
        <P>My colleagues found him very willing to engage in discussions and liaise with us on various levels and to discuss differences of opinion, especially when he was Chief Whip.  He never had a bad word to say about his colleagues in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad and he will be remembered for that.  He took on his Government duties with dignity, panache and enthusiasm.  He will also be remembered for that.  He will be sadly missed by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, as he will be in his constituency.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has passed into legend that at the negotiations on the programme for Government last year, S&eacute;amus Brennan turned to those of us who were sitting on the other side of the table and said: &ldquo;You are playing senior hurling now lads.&rdquo;  It might seem like a very condescending comment in cold print, but it was meant as a statement of encouragement.  The role he played in those negotiations was that of an enabler and facilitator.  I presume he played a similar role in other negotiations for other Governments.  He smoothed over any difficulties that arose.  During the negotiations I had with him, he never played the part of the bad cop.  I do not think it would have fitted his personality, in any sense, to raise hackles or cause dissension among those he was dealing with.  It was in the nature of the man to bring about solutions, wherever possible.</P>
        <P>That S&eacute;amus Brennan succeeded greatly in his career as a public representative and as a member of the Government is probably the best dedication we can give him.  He was probably single-handedly responsible for the introduction of modern campaigning techniques to Irish politics.  He represented the bridge between traditional Irish politics and modern politics, which is based on design ethics.  He emphasised the look of leaflets and posters and the use of colour, for example.  Campaign songs were introduced for the first time, in a real sense, when he was Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary during the 1977 general election campaign.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the difficulties people always had when debating with S&eacute;amus Brennan.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, his personality as a winning person meant that the way he constructed an argument made it hard to argue against him.  He was a more engaging Minister than most of his colleagues in any Government of which he was a member.  He was willing to engage with both Houses of the Oireachtas.  He took reasoned arguments on board.  He accepted amendments to legislation more readily than other Ministers.  That contributed to the warmth many Members of the Oireachtas felt for him and the reputation he subsequently gathered.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan has many legacies.  I have already mentioned his contribution to political campaigning.  If he has a legacy that is even more long lasting, I think it will be the nature of his political personality.  In a political culture in which there is far too much name-calling and cheap points scoring, he achieved without causing offence.  We should remember him most for the manner in which he conducted his politics.  On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I offer my sympathies to his wife Ann, his family, his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and the people he served in such a dedicated manner over the course of his long and successful political career.

	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to offer my deepest sympathy, and that of my party, to S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s wife, Ann, his family and his colleagues in Fianna <Col N="192"/>F&aacute;il.  I did not have the privilege, as I am sure it would have been, of knowing my fellow Galwegian, S&eacute;amus Brennan, personally.  My perception of him was always driven principally by my knowledge of his achievements as a politician and his appearances in the public domain.  I have to say that he had a unique approach.  Over the years, I built up a perception of S&eacute;amus as a warm, considerate and thoughtful human being who worked long and hard for his community, which repeatedly chose him as its leader, and for his country which he obviously loved so much.  He brought his intelligence, courage, innovation and commitment to every Ministry in which he served over his long career.  His superb organisational skills were more than apparent at local and national level.</P>
        <P>I am informed by my colleague, Deputy Harney, that her experience of S&eacute;amus Brennan at a personal level was that he was an extremely decent and warm gentleman.  She told me that S&eacute;amus had the capacity to bring people together and to encourage them to stay working with a common sense of purpose.  I do not doubt, as Deputy Harney has told me, that at especially difficult times, S&eacute;amus Brennan was the glue that held the coalition structures together.  He was able to refocus everyone&rsquo;s attention on the real job at hand &mdash; the successful governing of our country.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s approach that always impressed me was his appetite for reform and change.  He was not satisfied to stick with the <i>status quo</i>.  He was always seeking to change things for the better, sometimes with a bravery that is seldom seen in politics today.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s term as Minister for Transport when he showed an appetite for reform and change that led to the opening of Irish skies to real and open competition in the aviation sector.  S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s most enduring legacy will be the lasting impression he made at a personal level on all those who met him.  He disproved once and for all the theory that nice guys always finish last.</P>
        <P>My own father passed away in July 1996 at 60 years of age, the same age S&eacute;amus Brennan was when he died this year.  I am sure everyone will agree that it is far too young an age for any father to bid farewell to his family.  The many fond memories we had of my father helped us to get through the difficult time we endured in the immediate aftermath of his death.  Equally, I am sure the Brennan family has many fond memories of S&eacute;amus as a father, a husband and a friend.  I know those memories will provide solace to them over the difficult weeks and months ahead.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise today to pay tribute to my constituency colleague, S&eacute;amus Brennan, and once again express my deepest sympathy to Ann and her family, and S&eacute;amus Brennan&rsquo;s extended family and friends.  The death of S&eacute;amus has saddened us all.  He was a hugely significant figure in Irish politics.  He was a true professional and was greatly respected and loved by his constituents.  It was only recently, at one of our monthly meetings, that it hit me forcefully that he is no longer among us.  Having run with S&eacute;amus at many elections in Dublin South, I got to know him very well.  As our political careers developed, we became close friends.  I was always available to help him out at election time.  Likewise, he supported me.  S&eacute;amus was viewed with great affection in Dublin South and people loved him.  The esteem in which he was held was reflected in the size of the vote he managed to attract at successive general elections.  He had the ability to reach out to people, using such attributes as his personal touch, dignity, calmness and friendship.  He was always calm and dignified at public meetings, <Col N="193"/>no matter how rough the meeting might be.  He often disarmed political opponents in the process.  He had the common touch.  He saw politics as the art of solving problems.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus Brennan was often described as a master politician, which is what he was.  He was a good listener.  His gentle manner meant that it was impossible to have a fight with him.  He believed that everyone had a point of view.  No opposing view was ever shot down with personal political attacks.  S&eacute;amus was a consummate politician.  It was a pleasure to canvass on his behalf during election campaigns.  He had the most professional political organisation in the country.  His election machine was legendary.  When an election came around, one would be given an area on which to focus one&rsquo;s canvassing.  One would remain in that area until each house had been canvassed before reporting back to base.  S&eacute;amus had a highly effective frontline team, comprising Mary Browne, Frank Lahiffe and Bobby Holland, throughout his political career.  He benefitted not only from the exceptional loyalty his frontline team showed in working with him on a professional basis, but also from the assistance of others who helped his election campaigns so successfully.  His family can be proud of his achievements in government, as can the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and his constituents.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As an astute, capable and experienced Minister, his ability was beyond question in the many roles in which he served with distinction.  He gave it his best no matter what Ministry he held.  He served as Minister in the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Social and Family Affairs, Transport and Tourism, Transport, Tourism and Communications and Education, as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing.  As Minister for Transport, he completed the work on the roll-out of the Luas and bringing the Luas to Dundrum was a proud moment for S&eacute;amus.  That his final resting place is in St. Naghi&rsquo;s cemetery, Dundrum, in the shadow of the Luas bridge must have been one of S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s final wishes.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus faced his illness with great dignity and he never complained.  He continued to work for his constituents in spite of his declining health.  The measure of the man was reflected in him turning up at Dundrum shopping centre to support the Taoiseach as he canvassed on the Lisbon treaty referendum.  That also indicated his loyalty to Fianna F&aacute;il supporters and his constituents.  S&eacute;amus is missed in Leinster House and in the Government but he will also be missed in the constituency as well as in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  He will be missed throughout the country but, above all, the real sadness is felt by Ann and the Brennan family.  They have to come to terms with the great loss they are experiencing.

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fitting that we should pay tribute to our late colleague, S&eacute;amus Brennan, in the Chamber that marked the start of his life as a public representative.  It is difficult to say more than has been said about S&eacute;amus.  He was a man who touched all our lives and he devoted his entire professional life to politics.  In the course of that time, he served the Fianna F&aacute;il Party as general secretary, the Dublin South people as their TD and the people of Ireland as a Minister.  During the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign, as people became aware of S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s illness, I was approached by constituents who recalled their dealings with him.  They spoke of the occasions he assisted them in times of trouble and the occasions he had been with them in times of adversity and made a difference to them and their families.  They recalled those moments with genuine affection for him.</P>
        <P>When one reflects on the many tributes paid, one cannot but be struck by the deep unspoken respect in which S&eacute;amus was held by colleagues across the political spectrum throughout the years.  While I, like others, will remember many things about S&eacute;amus, a particular characteristic became his trademark, which was a calm and determined approach to public affairs, always seeking to rationalise between the most strongly held opinions in the most heated of debates. <Col N="194"/> This sense of calm was always effective, even in very difficult circumstances, and on many occasions he went before the public and defended the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and the Government.</P>
        <P>This tribute provides us with a fitting opportunity to reflect on S&eacute;amus, the public service he undertook and the contribution he made.  Therein lies the necessity to appreciate the importance of public service and the contribution each of us has the potential to make.  Most significantly, occasions such as this, particularly given the untimely nature of S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s passing, bring home to us the preciousness of life and the importance of us valuing and making the most of every moment we are blessed to have because those moments will pass and we will all be no more.</P>
        <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife, Ann, and to Shay, Daire, Aoife, Breffni, Sine and &Eacute;anna, his brothers and sister, his extended family, his friends, his loyal team of staff, including Frank, Bobby and Mary, and his supporters.  This year has brought an immeasurable loss and sadness to them.  May S&eacute;amus rest in peace.</P>

	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to commiserate with the Brennan family on the death of a man I knew all my life.  As I look at all the Brennan children, I am reminded of the times I baby-sat for the family, which highlights how long our families have known each other.  S&eacute;amus was a great man, as Senator Feeney reminded me, for giving a person a job, which was usually to baby-sit or caddy.  I got to know S&eacute;amus first during the great holidays in Connemara which we all shared.  It is testament to the public service he gave that I did not realise he was also a Senator because his career in the public service was very long.  Many people have referred to his time in the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation and the way he transformed politics and the election winning organisation that is Fianna F&aacute;il.  He had a great deal to do with that.  More important, he gave great public service when he was called to serve as a Minister.  His legacy remains in every Department in which he served and I regret he was not left more often to do what came naturally to him, which was to reform.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to him opening up the country to competition through the transport sector and aviation.  There was a touch of Lemass about S&eacute;amus Brennan and the contribution he made.  He was as significant as Lemass as he moved us out of a more insular era into something new.  He embraced competition and, in doing so, transformed Irish life.  I am sorry he was not given the opportunity to do that in the bus sector and other areas.  Reform and public service were the bywords of what he did.</P>
        <P>It is lovely that the team who were always with him are present, particularly Frank Lahiffe.  When I started out in politics, we were always at events together and wherever Frank was, S&eacute;amus was never far behind.  He was served by a dedicated team and a dedicated family.</P>
        <P>Since S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s death, the closeness of his family has emerged.  I hope it offers some comfort to them to be present for these tributes.  While he is not with us, he will never be forgotten in the House because of the exceptional figure he was.  It is nice to reflect on and be reminded of him again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the extraordinary contribution S&eacute;amus Brennan made in the constituency of Dublin South and nationally, it is not surprising that many people I meet on a daily basis in the constituency refer to how sad it is he has passed.  It is striking the number of times people of all parties and of all persuasions and none repeatedly express their sadness about this to me, a political opponent of his, almost as if they want to express that feeling to anybody in political life because they had so much trust in him and relied on him for many years.</P><Col N="195"/>
        <P>I am a relative newcomer to politics but my experience of meeting S&eacute;amus Brennan first and dealing with him subsequently was always positive.  He was welcoming and friendly.  He was a political opponent and people are always watching out for what is important in that regard but, on a human level, he was extremely helpful to me and extremely amiable and decent as an individual.  He was an extraordinarily successful representative of the people of Dublin South and many people remark on that regularly.  He has left an extraordinary gap at local and national level.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was a significant figure on the political landscape for more than 30 years, going back to the 1970s, which is an amazing stretch.  To have died at such a relatively young age while having been around politics for so long and having achieved so much as a Minister, in his party and in both Houses is extraordinary.  I hope that is some consolation to his wife and family on their sad loss earlier this year.</P>
        <P>I first got to know S&eacute;amus Brennan when I was a programme and radio producer in RTE covering general elections.  One thing that always struck me about him was that while most, although not all, politicians were quite happy to be invited to go on radio and television, some were not very accommodating.  I found him to be most accommodating; he was always available.  One could have a late night programme with coverage of election results, from which people would go home very tired and perhaps a little grumpy because of the result, and it was always very difficult to get people to speak the following morning at ten o&rsquo;clock when the public wanted to know what had happened over night.  S&eacute;amus was somebody on whom one could rely.  He would come in and, as broadcasters would say, was always good value.  He always had an observation, an insight.  Whereas he of course was partisan in the sense that we all are called upon to be partisan in this business, he also was capable of rising above that partisanship and being able to see the big picture.</P>
        <P>When listening to Senator Boyle I recalled the television coverage of the 2007 election results when the wooing, if I can call it that, was starting to happen &mdash; some people can notice that more easily than others &mdash; and there were exchanges of glances across the table at some of Senator Boyle&rsquo;s colleagues coming from the Fianna F&aacute;il side in the studio.  S&eacute;amus, even then, was doing what he did so well and did best, which was, as somebody said recently, not closing any doors, keeping all doors open.  He was very good at that.</P>
        <P>I, personally, am very sad that S&eacute;amus has gone from us at such a young age.  I am very much conscious of what my colleague Senator Corrigan said.  S&eacute;amus Brennan made an extremely positive contribution to the people in Dublin South, to politics nationally and, I am sure, and most importantly of all, as a father and as a husband.  I wish to be associated most sincerely with the expressions of sympathy to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s family on his sad loss.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike most people here, I would consider myself to have known S&eacute;amus Brennan as a political understudy.  He came to me &mdash; this tells you much about his consummate grasp of politics &mdash; just after the 1977 general election.  He picked me out in RTE and asked if I would like to do a programme on how they won the 1977 election.  He was approaching someone he knew was a Workers&rsquo; Party supporter, somebody who was incredibly hostile to his party as it stood and, indeed, with grandiose ambitions to put it out of business if we could.  He picked me because he knew I shared his passion for politics as an art form.  There are two kinds of politician &mdash; butchers and artists.  There are some people who just want to get into politics to be there and to draw their salaries and there others who want to get into politics to do something and to do it elegantly. He was the most elegant political operator.  He had an elegant mind.  He had a likeness.  Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; hEithir and I used to watch him in The Goatstown Inn and call him &ldquo;an buachaill caoldubh&rdquo;.  He sat there, the dark slender boy, and inside that slight frame was this amazing political brain.</P><Col N="196"/>
        <P>He picked me because he knew I would love what he was going to show me and that I would be seduced by it, which is true.  He laid out the internal structure of the 13 directors of elections who had targeted the 13 marginal constituencies and he gave me full access to the background.  He knew I was taking a technical and professional interest in it, and I put many of the lessons to work later.  What I was struck by was the band of brothers, the clarity, passion and belief of all those who worked with him, not just that he was a decent man, an elegant man and a man of vision, but that they had the same kind of vision.  They were a very attractive bunch of people and they had his passion for a politics of public service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not labour the point but, at a time when we are talking about reform of the public sector, S&eacute;amus Brennan gave value for money.  He worked hard as a public servant, but not just in that pedestrian way.  I was very struck by what someone said about Lemass, that he worked as a public servant in the great Whitaker tradition where it was not enough just to put down a day&rsquo;s work but one had to bring something extra, something visionary, something passionate and something patriotic to it.  No doubt S&eacute;amus had that Lemass-Whitaker touch and he was a very underestimated man.  He left an indelible mark on Irish life in that he modernised Irish politics.</P>
        <P>I did not meet anybody in Fianna F&aacute;il in these years &mdash; except Jack Lynch &mdash; who impressed me the way Brennan impressed me.  He was a modern mind and a modern person.  He had the great last gift of a great politician and a great artist, he had great manners, and one needs that too in politics.</P>

	<P>I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to Ann and her family.  I have the unique distinction of the membership of this House as being the one who came into this House on the same day as S&eacute;amus Brennan 31 years ago in 1977.  We all came in here full of joy and full of hope, a young new group of people. However, many of us had come here only because of the previous four years&rsquo; work of the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He totally modernised the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, from approximately 1974 until the 1977 election.  He took us all, root and branch, and remodernised the party.  His work is still to be seen in how politics have moved on in this country.</P>
        <P>He will be remembered also as being the ultimate politician.  Everything was possible if one went about it the right way.  That was the approach that S&eacute;amus Brennan took, first, as general secretary of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, then as a politician here in the Seanad, and when he moved to the D&aacute;il in 1981 and into the various ministries.</P>
        <P>As a Minister, if one approached him with a problem, it was not a matter of what he could not do for you but that he would see what could be done for you.  That epitomised S&eacute;amus as well, I believe, with his constituents who found his approach to be that if he could, he would and if it was possible, it would be done.  That is what politics is all about.  Politics is the art of the possible.  We can talk about matters impossible and we can talk about the dreams, and everyone who comes into politics has a dream.</P>
        <P>S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s biggest contribution, as far as the Oireachtas is concerned, is the way he served in all the ministries in which he had the honour to serve.  He left a mark everywhere he went.  It did not matter whether he was a long or a short period in that ministry, he took action that remains to this day.</P>
        <P>To his wife Ann and to his family, it is a tragic loss that somebody should be taken away at the age of 60.  I suppose it is the way of the Lord.  We do not have any say.  We live for today <Col N="197"/>and we hope that we see tomorrow.  I want to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife Ann and to her family, and to his close colleagues, Frank and Mary, whom I have known for practically as long as being S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s back-up team.  Everybody, right across this House and this country, was saddened by the untimely passing of a true and loyal Irishman.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba bhre&aacute; liom, mar ionada&iacute; &oacute; Chontae na Gaillimhe &oacute; dh&uacute;chas, c&uacute;pla focal a chur leis na focail &aacute;lainne at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhghleacaithe.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, d&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n le muintir U&iacute; Bhraon&aacute;in, Ann agus a clann uilig.</P>
        <P>I am a relatively new addition to this House.  I spoke with S&eacute;amus Brennan only once but growing up in Galway, he was a very familiar name and face.  First, we are all aware that he was a Galway man and we are proud of all he achieved.  Also, as I grew to have a deep interest in politics, I remember enjoying &mdash; I am glad Senator Alex White mentioned it &mdash; his great analysis on television, particularly at election times.  He was one of those voices, one of those people who was brought on to speak at those times.  He had a forensic approach and he had something interesting to say.  He had a great knowledge of all that had gone on and could crutch numbers with the best of them.</P>
        <P>What was also attractive about him was that he gave service from a very young age.  He was one of those public servants, one of those politicians, who started young and, sadly, the service ended far too soon.  His analysis always struck me as impressive and reasoned.  On that reasonableness that he exuded, I often thought, looking at him on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; and other programmes, that he sometimes developed a pained look when he was in disagreement with colleagues, perhaps from a different political viewpoint.  It struck me often that this look of pain served him well because it communicated that here was a reasonable man.  As was appropriate for a man from the city of the tribes, he loved his tribe and supported it but he could do so without being tribal and that was to his great benefit and was one of his attractive political characteristics.</P>
        <P>I was working for the Dublin diocese during the jubilee millennium year, in which he played a major role.  He was an imaginative and supportive figure in his role as Minister in enabling, supporting and providing for the various celebrations by Church and State during the great jubilee year of 2000.</P>
        <P>I only met him once but it was an interesting encounter.  I found myself in Galway by accident when I was canvassing for the Seanad election.  I saw him in a hotel and decided I would canvass him.  What I did not notice was the television camera coming in behind him.  I realised it might compromise my independent status if people saw me canvassing him as they would not know why I was in the hotel.  He must have sensed my discomfiture because he steered me to one side and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to be here, are you?&rdquo;  I do not know whether I got the vote but I was struck by his gentleness, politeness and courtesy.</P>
        <P>The last time I saw him I could not help feeling sad but I admired his bravery as he sat in this House eager to continue the business that was his as a Minister.  I know it is a matter of pride and sorrow for his family to be here today.  They would rather not be here but I am sure it is with pride that they hear these well deserved tributes to their beloved father and husband.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam uasal agus suaimhneas s&iacute;ora&iacute; d&oacute;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I deeply appreciate the opportunity to say a few words as a fellow Galway person.  I would like to be associated with the sympathy and condolences offered to S&eacute;amus&rsquo;s wife Ann and his family and friends today.  Growing up, I was not aware that S&eacute;amus Brennan was a Galway man when I watched him on television.  I came to know his sister Carmel and served on the board of GMIT and Network with her.  I also got to know his <Col N="198"/>brother Terry.  I saw they were movers and shakers in Galway and I was not a bit surprised to see the family link with S&eacute;amus Brennan.</P>
        <P>As a new Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, it is interesting to hear about the contribution he made over 40 years in public life.  The word &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; comes to mind because few make such a contribution.  It must be remarked on as outstanding in its own right.  His contribution was significant when one considers all the portfolios he held.  As a political watcher, I also noticed what Senator Mullen said.  Fianna F&aacute;il was lucky to have S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He had a wonderful way of explaining away difficult decisions in difficult times, particularly on programmes such as &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>My personal meeting with S&eacute;amus Brennan was what impressed me most.  It occurred when he held his final portfolio as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I proposed an awards night for Galway basketball, which has been impressive in its growth.  I saw how he listened to me and it impressed me as I rarely experienced it.  No doubt he was listened in that way through his entire life.  His family was lucky because that is a special trait.  His party and colleagues were also lucky.</P>
        <P>He was impressed with my proposal.  He told me he saw no difficulty with it and asked me to write it up.  I did so but, sadly, it was just before he passed away and his successor did not see it in the same light.  The memory stays with me as a powerful demonstration of how all-embracing he was.  Although I was a member of the Opposition, the Galway links made a major difference to him.  I agree with what most people said, that his death was most untimely and he is missed.

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I got to know S&eacute;amus in 1973 when he became secretary general of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am the only Member of this House who was a Deputy in 1977.  I pay tribute to his fantastic work for the party.  He was selected by Jack Lynch on the recommendation of his father, who was a member of the national executive.  He was the most outstanding secretary general we ever had in Fianna F&aacute;il.  He reorganised the entire party.  He had an arrangement in the constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim where John Ellis, Se&aacute;n Doherty and I were the three candidates.  We were all in our late 20s and early 30s and we won two out of three seats in the election.  He did not have to contact us much during the campaign and he left us at it to get the votes and seats, which we did.</P>
        <P>I sympathise with Ann and the family.  Ann met S&eacute;amus at NUI, Galway, where S&eacute;amus was a member of the cumann.  He was the most outstanding public representative this country has ever had.  The tributes today are the finest I have heard from the Leader, the Opposition and everybody else.  Never have I heard finer or more sincere or honest tributes to any politician at any time than those I heard to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  I want to be associated with all the fine comments that were made.  They are all genuine, true and factual.  He is a terrible loss to Ann and the family at such an early age.  He is a loss to everyone in this House where he was so willing to come and work with us.  We will all miss him sadly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also wish to be associated with the tributes to the late S&eacute;amus Brennan who, as was stated, was a Member of this House from 1977 to 1981 having been nominated by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.  My first meeting with S&eacute;amus was in April 1976 when I was first elected to Offaly County Council.  He was general secretary and I attended a meeting of young councillors.  I have always considered that the advice he gave at that time has stood me in good stead in all this time.</P><Col N="199"/>
        <P>It came across always that S&eacute;amus was an extremely safe pair of hands on television and radio and in any portfolio he held.  He made an outstanding contribution to Irish political life, in both Houses of the Oireachtas and as a Minister in many portfolios.  I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife Ann, his sons and daughters and all family members on a very sad loss.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate on agriculture which takes place on the eve of the European Union Agriculture Council at which we will finalise the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, health check.  Last week, Senators had the opportunity to discuss the recent budget.  I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, who took the debate in my absence in the United States on an important trade mission, as well as all Senators who contributed to that debate.  I do not intend to cover the ground discussed last week other than to make some general comments about the budget and the 2009 Estimates and to refer briefly to some of the contributions to that debate.</P>
        <P>I intend to set out the dynamic global environment within which the Irish agrifood sector is operating and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.  There are several events on the horizon which have potentially significant consequences for Irish agriculture and the Irish agrifood sector.  I will comment on those and give the House some sense of the approach we have taken to date to protect and promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s support for the agrifood sector as the most important indigenous sector in the economy.</P>
        <P>Without repeating what was said during last week&rsquo;s budget debate, I wish to make some general points on the budget, respond to some of the comments made by Senators and, in particular, correct some inaccuracies and misrepresentations.  Despite the necessity for the Government to take decisive, corrective action in recognition of the rapidly deteriorating economic and fiscal situation, it is worth bearing in mind that we will spend &euro;64 billion on public services in 2009.  My Department will be allocated &euro;1.8 billion of Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money and &euro;1.4 billion of European Union funding next year, bringing to &euro;3.2 billion the Department&rsquo;s total expenditure in support of the agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry sectors in 2009.</P>
        <P>However, the agriculture sector could not be exempted from the general necessity to reduce public spending.  Despite persistent attempts to suggest otherwise, the reality is that my Department&rsquo;s budget for 2009 is 2.6% less than it was this year when account is properly taken of the <Col N="200"/>exceptional Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million we received this year to ensure thousands of farmers could be paid their farm waste management grants promptly.  Contrary to certain suggestions, the farm waste management scheme is the most ambitious and generous on-farm capital investment scheme in the history of the State which, by 2009, will have seen well in excess of &euro;600 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money invested in thousands of Irish farms.  The scheme is fully funded by the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I also refute suggestions that the suckler welfare scheme is being cut or, as I read in one prominent publication last week, that the commitment to the scheme is being reneged upon.  This is blatantly untrue and inaccurate and a complete misrepresentation of the facts.  A commitment was entered into under the social partnership process that &euro;250 million would be provided in funding over five years.  That commitment is being honoured in full.  In regard to the budget, I have made clear that the decisions we took were difficult.  I acknowledge the difficulties they will pose to farmers but I have made clear also that I intend to review those decisions as soon as the budgetary conditions permit.  I reiterate that I will do so.</P>
        <P>Over the next two days I will attend a meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in Brussels during which efforts will be made to reach political conclusion on the CAP health check based on the draft legislative proposals published in May.  Given that these proposals comprise a large and complex set of detailed measures, I will confine my remarks to some of the principal issues.  In regard to milk quotas, which are due to end in 2015, the proposals provide for a smooth transition with a modest annual increase in quota for five years beginning in 2009-10.  This proposal is somewhat conservative.  As such, I have argued for a genuine soft landing with progressive quota increases which should be frontloaded to take account of our capacity to increase production.</P>
        <P>I and my officials also have defended the need for quota increases to be matched with effective dairy market management mechanisms and have called for the continuation of such measures.  We are especially anxious to retain effective measures for the support of the butter market and, in that regard, I welcome the decision taken last week to introduce private storage aid for butter with effect from 1 January 2009.  This decision reflects my serious concerns regarding the current weakness in dairy product prices about which I have contacted the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Mariann Fischer Boel.  The importance of retaining critical market instruments and using them effectively to respond to price volatility in the period of transition to quota abolition is a key priority for us during this week&rsquo;s negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently opposed the proposed modulation increases on the grounds that they run counter to the expectations of Irish farmers who accepted decoupling only three years ago and who are still in the process of adapting to that fundamental change.  Modulation is the process by which a proportion of each farmer&rsquo;s single farm payment is transferred to rural development in pillar two of the CAP.  The current rate of compulsory modulation is 5%.  Additional compulsory modulation is proposed to bring the rate to 13% by 2012, with further progressive rates of modulation of an additional 3% on payments in excess of &euro;100,000, 6% on payments in excess of &euro;200,000 and 9% on payments in excess of &euro;300,000.  We will continue to oppose the current proposals notwithstanding that, as they stand, in excess of 55,000 Irish farmers would be exempt from any modulation proposals.</P>
        <P>I have always maintained that the issue of simplification should be a key focus of the health check and we have made several suggestions as to how this could be achieved.  All Members share the desire for real and measurable simplification for farmers and the administration alike.  As Ireland is fully decoupled, we would support further decoupling elsewhere, although I do not have any great difficulty with allowing member states some freedom to continue coupled <Col N="201"/>schemes to support vulnerable areas or sectors provided this does not distort competition.  While there are proposals to allow member states to move to a flatter rate of payment per hectare, I have consistently made clear that I have no plans to alter our system of single payments and while I am pleased that the option of moving to the flatter rate is available, I will strongly object to any move towards a mandatory change at this time.</P>
        <P>The final issue in the context of the health check to which I will refer is the Article 68 proposals.  The intention is to broaden the existing provision such that up to 10% of single payment funds may be targeted at specific measures by removing some restrictions and providing an enlarged menu of options for use of these funds.  This represents a potential means of supporting regions or sectors facing particular challenges.  I have sought an increase in available EU funding under this provision.  As a result of the complex and restrictive rules governing the single farm payment scheme, we have been unable to utilise fully the funding allocated for it.  Therefore, I am seeking greater national discretion in the use of these funds.  This has been my consistent position since the proposals were published.</P>
        <P>The CAP health check is part of the dynamic environment to which I referred at the outset and the negotiations over the coming days certainly will influence the direction of the Irish and EU agrifood sectors in the coming years.  It is my firm intention to negotiate to achieve the best outcome for Irish agriculture and to achieve a deal that will secure its future growth potential.</P>
        <P>Recent speculation, together with the G20 economic summit that took place in Washington at the weekend, have raised the possibility of a fresh World Trade Organisation, WTO, ministerial meeting being convened next month.  The most recent effort at achieving agreement on the agriculture and non-agricultural market access, NAMA, modalities failed after the longest ministerial meeting in WTO history in Geneva in July.</P>
        <P>It is evident that the WTO director general, Pascal Lamy, encouraged by various constituent members of the WTO, is enthusiastic about the prospects for agreement.  We fail to see the basis for such optimism.  There has been little or no progress on resolving the outstanding issues that ultimately resulted in the failure of the July negotiations.  We further take the view that in the absence of any significant progress in these areas, there is little or no point in proceeding with a further ministerial meeting.  We hold the view that another failed attempt at this stage could do nothing but damage the entire process.</P>
        <P>We remain consistent in our position.  We support a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced deal.  The proposals on the table at the time of the collapse of the July ministerial meeting did not meet the requirements for such a deal.  The Government remains committed to achieving an acceptable trade deal but does not believe that those conditions exist at the moment and, on that basis, does not accept that the conditions exist to warrant calling a ministerial meeting next month.  In the event of a ministerial meeting taking place, the Irish Government team will continue to advocate and defend Irish interests and, at every opportunity, to highlight our real concerns relating to agriculture.  My objective continues to be to ensure the best possible tariff protection for key Irish agricultural products &mdash; beef, dairy, sheepmeat and so forth.</P>
        <P>I spoke recently about the issue of climate change and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards the European Council target of a 20% reduction in the EU&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.  I pointed out that these targets present particular challenges for Irish agriculture.  When reading last week&rsquo;s Seanad debate, I noted that a couple of the contributions, notably those of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator McFadden, referred to these challenges, but perhaps that is something for another debate on another day.  However, I wish to comment on and correct something Senator McFadden said when she suggested that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, &ldquo;expects the agricultural sector to cull the dairy herd to reach <Col N="202"/>these targets&rdquo;.  At no point did the Minister, Deputy Gormley, make any such suggestion and, indeed, like me, he recognises the challenges presented to the agriculture sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agriculture sector is already contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions and the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s most recent figures on actual emission levels indicate that emissions from agriculture decreased by 3.8% in 2007 on the previous year&rsquo;s figures, continuing the downward trend since 1998.  Through successive Rural Environment Protection Schemes, my Department is further contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by promoting specific measures, including willow plantations, establishment of farm woodlands, the protection of the carbon storage potential of Ireland&rsquo;s wetlands and, in 2009, the provision of record funding of &euro;355 million for REPS.  Despite efforts to suggest that there are differences on the greenhouse emissions reduction issue, the Government, including Deputy Gormley and me, recognises the need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and that the scale of reductions will be very challenging for Ireland.  Equally, though, we all accept that every sector will have to play its part in the national effort to reduce emissions.</P>
        <P>This week&rsquo;s negotiations on the CAP health check will determine the shape of the CAP until 2013 while discussions on the post-2013 situation will take place in parallel with a wider discussion on the EU budget for the new financial perspective period 2014-20.  Not only is there a continuing very strong case for an effective and well resourced EU Common Agricultural Policy, but the case is now stronger than ever.  Ireland is a major food producing and exporting country, with agrifood and drink exports of approximately &euro;8.6 billion last year.  Gross agriculture output in 2007 was valued at &euro;5.67 billion, with milk accounting for the largest share at 29% or &euro;1.6 billion and beef accounting for 26% or &euro;1.5 billion.  Significantly, global demand for meat and milk is projected to more than double over the next 40 years and we now have a unique opportunity to play to our strengths.  The future viability of the industry is heavily dependent on us growing our market share of lucrative continental outlets, given that we currently export 90% of our beef output and 80% of our dairy output.</P>
        <P>The Irish agrifood sector is a vibrant, dynamic and resilient sector, capable of reacting and adapting quickly and positively to changing circumstances and the demands of a global market.  The sector is one of the most important indigenous elements in the Irish economy, both from an employment point of view and as a major contributor to regional development.  For what is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;declining&rdquo; industry, the sector contributed up to 39% of net foreign earnings in the primary manufacturing sector, according to the recently published Riordan report.</P>
        <P>Having unfortunately missed last week&rsquo;s debate, I am pleased to have the opportunity to partake in this debate and to set the scene, as I see it, for the Irish agrifood sector and to outline both the challenges and opportunities that confront the sector.  It is true that I had to make some difficult decisions in the recent budget, but, as I said then, in making these choices my strategy was to focus available resources on the measures that allow us to maintain and grow the productive capacity of the agrifood sector and to ensure that the sector is well positioned to get through this challenging period.  My overall objective is to allow the sector continue towards achieving its full potential as our most important indigenous industry.</P>
        <P>There is every reason to be confident about the future of the agrifood sector.  Last week, I was in the United States on an Enterprise Ireland trade mission and I was particularly struck by the clear and growing confidence on the part of US companies in the quality, safety and commercial potential of Irish food ingredients and the companies producing them.  I also saw at first hand clear evidence of the internationalisation of Irish food companies and of their ability to compete with the best on the world markets.  All this is very encouraging for Irish <Col N="203"/>food processors, their employees and, equally important, for the tens of thousands of Irish producers who supply them.</P>
        <P>The next immediate step in charting the future course of Irish agriculture is the CAP health check negotiations in Brussels, which commence tomorrow morning, at which I will defend Ireland&rsquo;s interests to ensure that we maximise the benefits available from the CAP between now and 2013.  The reality is that agriculture is at the centre of the main global challenges, such as food, energy security and climate change.  Together with all stakeholders, there is tremendous opportunity to further develop and enhance the Irish agrifood sector given its undoubted potential to meet increasing demands.</P>
        <P>I thank the Members for the opportunity to outline the challenges and opportunities facing farming and the agrifood sector.  The important meetings commence at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I have some important preparatory meetings in advance of those discussions, which will begin in Brussels in the morning.  I will not be able to stay for all the debate but I will be happy to read the comments of all Senators later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I understand the reason for his absence from last week&rsquo;s debate and why he must leave this debate early to prepare for tomorrow&rsquo;s important meetings.  We recognise that with the ongoing meetings on the CAP health check, the Minister is significantly involved in planning for the future of Irish agriculture.  We sincerely wish him well in that regard.  The debate on agriculture at European level is not a question of the Government side or the Opposition side, it is one in which we are anxious to support and encourage the Minister because we are of one mind on the future of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The CAP health check is obviously important.  The period between now and 2013 is of immediate concern but the period beyond 2013 and planning for that, when the European budgetary strategy will be very challenging, is also important and the Minister should put down early markers in so far as he can.  Ireland must again demand a fair and full share of the European budget for European agriculture and, indeed, Irish agriculture.  The Minister referred briefly to the issue of food security.  We must keep to the fore of our arguments that the demand for food, in Europe and worldwide, is increasing significantly each year.  There is a political onus on us and the European Union to ensure that, at a minimum, the Continent of Europe produces sufficient food for its population. We recall from studying history of the European Union in the history books that at the very core of the creation of the European Economic Community was a desire to ensure the land of Europe would produce a plentiful food supply for the people of Europe.  This argument is more important now than ever.  The concept of global food security should be very much to the fore in this debate.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to energy security and Irish and European agriculture have a very significant role to play in its provision.  In the past 12 months or two years, we have fallen out of love, politically speaking, with the contribution agriculture can make to energy supply.  Some three or four years ago there was a coalition of like minds on the question of support and subsidies for energy crops.  However, in recent times the debate on energy versus food has perhaps become too lopsided in the other direction.  I hope we may again consider the very positive measures which agriculture can contribute to energy supply and that we can balance the debate somewhat, because from a policy perspective we have lost the battle in the past two years.  We must try to refocus on the possibility of substantial growth &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; in energy crops.  We must recognise that the primary use of the lands of Ireland and Europe should be for food production, but there is a good deal of spare capacity at present and we must try to refocus the debate towards using some of that spare capacity for energy crops and the supply of energy.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>We must revisit last week&rsquo;s debate on the post-budget situation.  I recognise the Minister is involved in the CAP health check.  The Minister will be involved in the initial debate on the post-2013 situation.  However, we must regenerate confidence for the sake of Irish agriculture.  Everyone should concede that the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance dashed the confidence of many farmers and especially young farmers.  Last week in the Houses we debated at length the suspension of the farm installation aid grant, the farm retirement pension scheme and the very significant cutbacks in funding for disadvantaged areas.  The Minister in his initial comments did not refer to those issues, but I hope they are at the core of his thoughts.</P>
        <P>The words &ldquo;temporary suspension&rdquo; were used regularly and liberally by those in the Government benches last week and I hope the cutbacks or suspensions are temporary.  Will the Minister consider the people who, even if the cutbacks or suspensions are temporary, will fall between two stools &mdash; excuse the agricultural pun again &mdash; because the timeframe for the installation aid grant applications and the farm retirement pensions applications are tight?  Those who may be eligible for these schemes today, tomorrow, next week or next month may not be eligible in six or 12 months&rsquo; time.  I hope there will be a reversal of Government policy on these two schemes.  I recognise it may not happen this week, this month or next month, but will the Minister put a structure in place to allow those who would have been eligible to apply today, tomorrow or next month to come within the reconstituted scheme as soon as it returns?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>This would at least allow those contemplating retirement in six or 12 months&rsquo; time to pause and restructure their plans.  However, those who completed the paperwork and whose expectations of income streams are based on retirement and installation aid grant applications are severely disadvantaged and we must put some structures in place to assist them.  I recognise the Minister&rsquo;s comments concerning the success of the farm waste management scheme and the significant associated investment.  I recognise we are dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money, but will the Minister reflect on the 31 December closing date, not only on behalf of farmers with work remaining but on behalf of builders and agricultural suppliers whose income stream in the past 12 months has been very dependent on this work?  Notwithstanding that the taxpayer will foot the bill in its entirety for the scheme, much of the money will flow back into the Government coffers by way of VAT and income tax and so on.  Some people are genuinely unable to complete the works and obtain the grant by 31 December because of difficulties with planning and suppliers.  It could be a win-win situation for the Government, the agricultural community and those in the construction industry if an extension to the deadline were allowed.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s ongoing work on the CAP health check.  I note with interest his comments on the milk quota regime.  We all recognise a decision appears to have been taken that the use of milk quotas as a policy mechanism will disappear in the coming years and this is, presumably, irreversible.  I welcome the decision because since 1983, we have been very much aware that while the milk quota regime provided a degree of regulation and certainty to farmers, there was also a capacity among the majority of farmers to increase the quota substantially if the opportunity arose.  The opportunity now seems set to arise.</P>
        <P>However, notwithstanding my general support for the concept of quota increases, I was impressed and taken aback to a degree by the contribution last week at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food, at which Senator Carty was also present, of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers&rsquo; Association, ICMSA.  It pointed out some of the very profound short-term pitfalls of a rush to quota removal.  There has been a significant drop in the price <Col N="205"/>of milk in the past 12 months.  If this drop in price continues, it will make the business of a significant number of dairy farmers impossible.  We must balance the need for allowing expansion with the need for a degree of certainty and price support in its traditional sense.  The Minister appears to have made a degree of progress on the butter market front, which is welcome.  However, before we rush headlong into opening the quota floodgates, we need a degree of certainty.</P>
        <P>I posed the question at that committee meeting last week and, because of a simultaneous debate in this House on an agricultural matter, I was not in a position to wait for the answer.  Once the quota regime is removed, does the Department, the co-operatives or whoever is responsible have a plan to provide for licensing of milk producers?  Once the quota regime disappears, can a given tillage farmer, for example, become a dairy farmer if he or she has the wherewithal and the investment potential?  Is there a departmental view that there should be licensing of milk producers which may in itself produce a degree of control?  Will the Minister respond to these questions?</P>
        <P>I accept the remarks of the Minister on the matter of modulation.  This is a new and fancy word which, when inserted in a debate on rural development, is seen in a positive light.  However, as currently proposed under the CAP health check, modulation takes money out of farmers&rsquo; pockets.  We cannot support it as currently constructed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must remain cognisant in any debate on Irish agriculture that without a European Union structure in place, Irish agriculture would not exist.  Ireland would be Iceland without the European Union.  Notwithstanding that a poll is a poll and we are always told to say it is only a snapshot, especially when the results are bad, I take some solace from the most recent opinion poll.  It reflects support for the European Union and the possibility of a Lisbon treaty rerun and there is a new realism among those in Irish agriculture.  I hope the Irish farming community and farm leaders recognise that without Europe and without our close involvement at the heart of European decision making, there would be no future for Irish agriculture.  No matter how big our challenges and no matter how deep our difficulties, and big and deep they are, there is no way forward without Europe.  That is something we need to keep to the fore of our arguments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House.  I now call on Senator John Carty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for coming to the House and taking time out from a busy schedule on his way to Brussels to negotiate on the Common Agricultural Policy health check.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with Senator Bradford on the importance of Europe to Irish agriculture.  I would also like to remind certain farming organisations that they were a little less than genuine in the recent campaign.  I hope that if it is rerun, they will come out in a more positive light.  Last time they came out to support the treaty in the end, but it was a little too late when they did so.  The winds are pretty cold in Europe at the moment.</P>
        <P>The Minister is on his way to Europe, and I wish him well.  He will be dealing with very important issues, especially for Ireland.  One of these issues is the Council regulation on the implementation of the single payment scheme.  That is very important to us, and he mentioned in his speech that the Government wants it simplified.  Farmers are overburdened with paperwork and any simplification would be of great benefit.  Ministers from other member states are of a similar mind on many of the proposals, but it is clear that progress will be made on this in the health check.  When this is done, I hope there will be less paperwork for farmers and that <Col N="206"/>the Department will put simplified measures in place that will entitle the farming community to get on with their work rather than being accountants who must justify the draw down of grants.</P>
        <P>Milk quotas are also important to us.  At a meeting last week, the ICMSA looked for different options.  What is being proposed is okay.  It gives us plenty of time &mdash; up until 2015 &mdash; to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>One sector that has not got much of a mention is the sheep sector.  Much work remains to be done as confidence in the sheep trade is at an all-time low.  Producers are getting out of the sheep sector owing to the low income involved.  It is true to say that lamb prices are as low as they were 25 years ago when they cost a lot less to produce.  I hope the Minister will try to implement the Malone report and the report of Liam Aylward, MEP.  This sector is badly in need of an lift.  The hill sheep sector is nearly finished.  Destocking occurred and there is no market for the lightweight lamb in Italy and Spain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senator Healy Eames says &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;, destocking had to take place.  At the time it had to be severe, but it should have been reviewed.  Within another couple of years, grants will be given to hill sheep farmers to get back into hill sheep from an environmental point of view rather than from an agricultural point of view.  Vegetation is occurring at a high rate, so there is a problem with its control on some of the hills.  If the hill sheep farmer is gone, huge compensation will have to be provided to bring back that balance.  No stock other than sheep can control vegetation on the hills.  During the destocking programme, environmentalists wanted to save rare grasses and other vegetation.  They will not now be saved, because other progressive grasses will kill those that we want to save and we will be at a disadvantage again.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on what he has done so far.  We are coming through a tough time, but it is very important that he pointed out that Ireland is a major food producing and exporting country.  I mentioned last week in my speech that food and drink exports last year were worth approximately &euro;8.6 billion.  That is a hugely significant figure, at about 9% of our total exports.  At the moment, 80% to 85% of our agricultural produce must be exported.</P>
        <P>The Minister also pointed out that global demand for meat and milk is projected to more than double over the next 40 years.  We have a unique opportunity now to play to our strengths.  It is very important that we manage our farming so that our milk and meat are the envy of the rest of the world.  We are able to produce it in an environmentally friendly way because we have a grass-based agricultural economy.  We must ensure our farming community is always made aware of this, as we must play to our strengths.  The world population is rising but the food basket is getting smaller as many countries are not producing much in agriculture anymore.  We would be able to fill this market provided we maintain a high quality meat and milk product for export.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well during the important negotiations in the next couple of days, which are vital to Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  I know that he and his team will do everything to ensure that we get the best possible deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  There are many difficulties facing Irish farming at present, including the free-fall in farm incomes, the collapse in milk prices, problems with food labelling, ever-changing deadlines imposed by the Department for applications for grant aid and the world trade talks.  The list goes on.  I will limit my comments to the issues arising from the budget.  It is agreed by most reasonable commentators <Col N="207"/>that budget 2009 has been a disaster in many ways.  It took from the poor and vulnerable in our society.  It lacked vision and any sense of direction.  It was a document from a Government with no eye on the future.  Nowhere in the budget was that more evident than in the section dealing with agriculture.  No industry has a future as long as it fails to entice new blood and new ideas into it.</P>
        <P>This Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government has done more to harm that industry than any group of bureaucrats in Europe or Doha.  The cry that rose up from Carrick-on-Shannon on Sunday was that Fianna F&aacute;il has forgotten its roots, and I believe that is true.  This budget confirmed the belief that the Government has lost touch with rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The abolition of the farm retirement scheme and the installation scheme will have a detrimental effect on the rural way of life.  These measures will make farming an unviable option for most, if not all, young people.  Farmers in their late 50s and early 60s will not be able to afford to retire.  In turn, without installation aid, their sons and daughters will not be able to afford to start up in farming.  These schemes were meant to assist and entice new people &mdash; the next generation &mdash; into the industry.  Without these schemes it is not an option.</P>
        <P>The Government is going to let an entire indigenous industry and way of life die out.  It is an industry that has been the backbone of the economy for generations.  The Government is now driving the final nail into the coffin.  The removal of these schemes is a vote of no confidence in rural Ireland.  The rug is being pulled out from under many farmers who worked hard in poor times to ensure that they would have something to hand on to the next generation.</P>
        <P>A former member of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party recently stated that de Valera and Lemass would be turning in their graves as a result of this budget and its measures.  He was accurate in his analysis.  People are tired of the hypocrisy of Fianna F&aacute;il Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas regarding many issues, particularly rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments of my colleague, Deputy Penrose, which he expressed during a Private Members&rsquo; debate in the Lower House, as follows</P>
        <P LI="1">We will no longer tolerate Deputies and Senators who are all things to all people in their constituencies, but do not express the views of their constituents when they get an opportunity to make decisions on important matters here in this House.  We do not want any nice token speeches from Members on the Government side &mdash; we want action.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is not good enough to go off down to a constituency or head to the plinth outside Leinster House and say one thing, while doing the exact opposite in here by following the party line.  The soldiers of destiny are fast becoming the soldiers of hypocrisy and the Government is marching rural Ireland to destruction and isolation.</P>
        <P>Since coming into Government over 11 years ago, this Fianna F&aacute;il Administration has activated policies that are slowly but surely closing the lid on rural Ireland.  Rural creameries are now a thing of the past, while rural pubs and post offices are almost extinct.  Never has the fishing industry been in such a disastrous situation.  Rising fuel costs, reduced quotas and poor investment have left this once thriving industry on its knees.  All this has happened on Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s watch.</P>
        <P>The Government has failed rural Ireland because it failed to show leadership or vision.  The cancellation of these two schemes is a fitting testament to the failed policies of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Rural Ireland will remember this, just as pensioners will remember who stole their medical cards.  The cuts in agriculture did not stop with the abolition of the farm retirement and installation schemes.  The Government went on to cut livestock and disadvantaged area payments also.  This will mean that some farmers could lose up to 50% of their income in one go.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P>I am particularly disappointed that there has been a cut, from 45 to 34, in the number of hectares for which the disadvantaged areas payment can be made.  This is devastating for farmers in the most disadvantaged areas of the country.  Rural Ireland relies almost entirely on agriculture.  This, of course, is because the Government has failed to invest in these areas.  It has shown no vision in attracting other industries there and, therefore, if farming dies away, so will rural Ireland.  The effects of these cuts will be felt most of all in the north west, west and south west, the most rural parts of the country.  This budget will drive people off the land.</P>
        <P>Communities will be decimated and emigration will become commonplace.  Rural GAA clubs will again be unable to field teams.  This is the vision of Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is the legacy of a boom that was squandered during a time of unparalleled wealth that was wasted.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party fully supports the campaign to have these cuts reversed.  We ask the Minister to consider rural Ireland, including coastal communities that are being put to the pin of their collar in an uphill battle for survival.  He should consider farming families that do not currently see a future on the land.  We ask him to make a stand against the anti-rural bias that is so clearly evidenced in so many Government decisions.</P>
        <P>There is justifiable anger in the farming community, in addition to a fear for the future and what it holds for farming.  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to provide the necessary leadership to allay that fear and uncertainty, which is clearly evident.  The Minister is failing that test, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate provides us with an opportunity to discuss agriculture in a more rounded sense.  Last week, we debated a Private Members&rsquo; motion concerning the effects of budgetary decisions on the agriculture sector and today&rsquo;s debate should consider the wider picture.  There is no doubt that Ireland can still gain much from its ability to produce good quality food.  In that regard, we need to debate the ability of the agricultural system to deliver that into the future.  The country has changed sociologically since entering the European Union.  In addition, the number of people engaged in agriculture, the size of holdings and the diversity of agricultural practices have changed dramatically.  Much of it has been for the better.  We have moved away from a mono-cultural farm sector, seeking instead to produce high quality food rather than large quantities of it.  This is where our niche market lies and how we can prosper in future.  </P>
        <P>Concerns have been expressed about rising food prices which have been a factor both this year and last.  The situation seems to be stabilising now, however, but we need to reposition Irish agriculture to take full advantage of that.  We have chosen to exercise our competitive advantage in agriculture by promoting the rearing of ruminant animals for meat and dairy produce.  While we have achieved a high level of quality in that respect, we also need to reach an appropriate balance in the agrisector in future.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, it has been mentioned that the opening up of markets to more red meat and dairy produce, particularly in China, means we must increase production in these areas to take advantage of growing world markets.  I would strike a note of caution, however, in that it is not the quantity but the quality that matters.  We have already seen a scandal in China over powdered milk.  In addition, an increasing number of studies have been undertaken into the effect on countries like China of introducing new food products such as red meat.  Therefore, such markets are not presenting as open a door as we might like to think they are.  We must first concentrate on the markets we have already developed to ensure that we can keep selling quality food to them in significant quantities.</P>
        <P>The real issue for agriculture is to make it as diversified as possible.  We have an imbalance in terms of our concentration on meat and dairy products, with less food grown from tillage. <Col N="209"/> We have growing areas such as by-products from dairy, in particular cheese, including farmyard cheeses, which have become very successful.  The farming community and farm enterprises are also becoming increasingly involved in elements of environmental policy such as forestry and energy generation, whether through bio-energy, as can be seen in the last budget submission of the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, or the idea of microgeneration of electricity through wind.</P>
        <P>The prosperity of agriculture depends on meeting this diversity.  In ten or 20 years we cannot be a country whose agriculture depends so much on beef and dairy.  We must be a country which uses all the potential within our agricultural sector.  If we keep going down the road that we think will lead to prosperity by doing things as we have done them in the recent past, this will be dangerous for agriculture.  I sense a growing engagement among farmers and farming organisations to face up to this reality.</P>
        <P>In recent years, there was an unfortunate tie-up with the Lisbon treaty campaign and the discussions on the Doha round of the world trade talks.  Because of that confusion, we have lost influence in terms of the agricultural debate within Europe and our ability to put our mark on developing our agricultural sector.  Farm organisations need to take a responsibility for the confusion that was shown but, at the same time, they should be encouraged into the type of thinking shown in the budget submission, particularly with regard to the micro-energy from wind.</P>
        <P>I know the farm organisations are pushing hard to have measures included in the Finance Bill.  I do not know whether that is possible but if it can be favourably thought of, if not in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill then in those of coming years, it would be an interesting building block towards making full use of the capacity of our farm enterprises.  This is the real difference between farming in Ireland in the 21st century and the type of subsistence agriculture we had on becoming a State in the 1920s &mdash; these are enterprises, this is business, this is agribusiness.  In terms of where we go from here as a country, it is by keeping firm to business principles that the agriculture sector of our economy will prosper.</P>
        <P>We are still quite poor in adding proper value in terms of our direct agriculture produce.  Where Government policy and direction needs to go &mdash; I noted the contribution of Senator Ryan &mdash; is in making sure there are employment opportunities in food treatment prior to its sale and distribution.  This is an area in which, particularly at a time when our economy is at a low ebb and has need of rejuvenation, agriculture can play an important role with regard to getting us back to the levels of growth we have enjoyed in recent years.</P>
        <P>Overall, I am optimistic about where Irish agriculture is and where it is going.  However, I would add some notes of concern in that if Irish agriculture is to develop, it must evolve, change and make use of the potential that exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House.  I ask that he would take back the concerns and issues I will raise to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>We pride ourselves on our reputation as a top, green food producing country.  However, recent budget and policy decisions by the Government will work to prevent this and &mdash; this is difficult to say &mdash; will actively work towards the wiping out of farming, particularly in the west.</P>
        <P>I was struck by the vagueness of the presentation by the last speaker, the Green Senator.  He is certainly green when it comes to farming.  He spoke about his optimism and how we need to broaden the debate beyond what is currently happening.  Does he want these people to still be in farming?  These people &mdash; the beef, dairy and sheep farmers &mdash; have contributed their way of life and their whole tradition to pure farming.  Of course, I agree with broadening it out but let us not forget those who are dedicated to it.</P><Col N="210"/>
        <P>I wish to raise particular issues with the Minister of State.  I hope his officials will be able to answer the questions today if they are not within his own remit.  The first issue concerns the de-stocking of sheep on the Connemara mountains, particularly with regard to the hill farmers.  The deal put forward by the National Parks and Wildlife Service promised farmers &euro;2,000 a year for five years.  I want confirmation as to whether this deal is still intact.  I ask this in light of the recent budgetary cuts.  While there has been no mention of this grant being cut, I am hearing of huge worry among farmers who are expecting this because of the way the Government cut the suckler cow grant.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, with great aplomb brought out the suckler cow grant of &euro;80 a head.  This has now been cut to &euro;40 a head despite it being part of the social partnership deal, which I often hear the Minister of State support.  We now have a breach of that social partnership deal with regard to the suckler cow grant.  Can I confirm that for the hill farmers, whose income is so minuscule I do not know how they manage, the compensation deal around de-stocking is safe?</P>
        <P>We already have had breaches of that deal.  I was at the public meeting in Maam in Connemara where the farmers were told they would be asked to de-stock to 1.5 ewes per hectare.  When they are working out their plans with the individual planners, they are now being asked to de-stock to 42% less in reality &mdash; to approximately 0.75 ewes per hectare.  To give one practical and actual example, a farmer with 50 acres is allowed 15 ewes.  This is a joke.  Just how much money does the Minister of State think one ewe is worth?  It is not worth even &euro;50.  Who can live on that?  It is outrageous.</P>
        <P>To make matters even worse, once a lamb passes 1 January, it will be called a ewe although it might be only six months old.  This is killing enterprise.  I have listened to what the Minister and the Green Senator said about promoting enterprise but the farmers need at the very least to be able to replace ewes with ewes.  Lambs that are only six months old cannot reproduce until they are at least two years old.  The Government should get rid of the ridiculous rule whereby they are called ewes after 1 January.</P>
        <P>Let us focus on these Connemara farmers.  They are also hit by a 25% cut in area-based disadvantaged aid, which amounts to &euro;1,000 or one quarter of their income.  As I said, the suckler cow grant had given a legitimate expectation of &euro;80 per head but this was cut in half.  It was a legitimate expectation that farmers had this grant to invest in creep feeders and stock proof fencing in order to be able to mind their animals, but it has now been reduced by 50%.  Some 60% of all the suckler herd is in the west and the average size of a herd is 16 cows.  While that grant had been 16 multiplied by &euro;80, it is now reduced to 16 multiplied by &euro;40.  If one works it out, that is very little.</P>
        <P>On top of this, farmers are being asked to pay a 1% income levy on gross income.  This must be changed to net income or the Government will be asking farmers to pay a 1% levy on their expenses.  For example, if I have 16 suckler cows and get &euro;40 a head, I need to be able to take into account that I had to buy in creep feeders and stock proof fencing.  I should not be asked to pay a 1% income levy on the gross amount.  I need to be able to take off the cost of the stock proof fencing and the creep feeders to get my net figure, which is my take home pay after my expenses.  It is on that figure only that the 1% levy should be imposed.  Will that be reversed?</P>
        <P>My final point &mdash; this is probably the nail in the coffin in terms of the future of farming &mdash; concerns the suspending, as the Minister of State calls it, or the abolition of the &euro;15,000 installation aid for young farmers.  That is grossly unfair.  IDA Ireland can give &euro;17,000 per job to attract a new job to this country.  Is the Minister of State saying that a job in farming, which is <Col N="211"/>our traditional way of life, is worth less?  Is he diminishing it?  When will that scheme be reinstated?  The way young farmers who have done the course and all the legal work are being treated is outrageous.</P>
        <P>To return to the overall point about social partnership, the Government has breached social partnership by cutting the suckler cow grant from &euro;80 to &euro;40.  That was a plank upon which the social partnership deal was agreed.  Is that move legal?  The Minister of State wants us to buy into it at many levels, yet he treats farmers in this way.</P>
        <P>I am angry.  I represent the legitimate views of farmers as expressed to me.  Part of our family income is from farming.  I grew up on a farm and I am involved in farming today.  Everything I have explained is real.  It is not, as expressed by the previous speaker, something that is vague or that he hopes will happen in 15 or 20 years&rsquo; time.  I am talking about what is happening today.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for listening and making some notes as I spoke.  I look forward to getting clarification on some of the questions I posed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the second week in a row we are having a discussion on agriculture.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, for his efforts in the past week in particular, and this week, when he will represent Irish farmers abroad and try to get a better deal for Irish farmers and fight for their future.  We should all acknowledge the work that is being done.</P>
        <P>I want to examine the issue and put a few aspects into context in terms of farming in Ireland.  European Union statistics and data going back to 2006 show that farm households have an average total income of &euro;58,031, or &euro;47,703, depending on whether a broad or narrow definition of &ldquo;farm households&rdquo; is utilised.  That compares with a State average of approximately &euro;54,000.</P>
        <P>The Irish national farm survey undertaken by Teagasc estimated that average farm income, excluding off-farm income, increased by 18% in 2007 alone, to &euro;19,687.  The predominant reason for that 18% increase, which was almost one fifth of an increase in overall farm income in one year, was the increase in milk and cereal prices that occurred during that year.  Full-time farms as defined by Teagasc had an average farm income of &euro;43,938 in 2007 while part-time farms had an average income of &euro;7,993.</P>
        <P>I come from a rural area, and those areas were referred to by the previous Senator.  The national farm survey estimated that 80% of farmers and-or their spouses had off-farm incomes and most of those farmers come from rural parts of Ireland.  I grew up on a farm and my parents would have had an off-farm income because one could not survive on a full-time farm income, given that the land may not be good.  Trying to make money from farming activity alone is not economically viable and therefore the cheque in the post was vitally important to farm families.</P>
        <P>It is important we say that because there has been much debate in the past few weeks on the budgetary decisions taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but as I said in this House last week, the decision taken by the Government under the farm waste management scheme was a brave step in the right direction in investing in farm buildings, the future of farming and protecting livestock on our farms.  I commend the Government on that.  A total of &euro;377 million is being provided under that scheme this year with an additional provision of &euro;195 million next year.  We welcome that.  Had it not been for that decision which was taken at that time, many farmers throughout the country would not be in a position to develop their farms to their full potential.  That may have a detrimental effect on other decisions the Minister had to take but he had to be brave in taking those decisions.</P>
        <P>We talk about disadvantaged areas but we should also note the huge increase of 17% in funding now available under REPS 4, which is a phenomenal scheme.  I acknowledge the <Col N="212"/>tremendous work of my constituency colleague, the former Minister for Agriculture and Food and now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, who did tremendous work in promoting and developing the REPS and in ensuring that REPS 4 was available to farmers with the 17% increase.</P>
        <P>While farmers in disadvantaged areas will find difficulty with the reduction in the requirement from 45 to 34 hectares, we must look at the bigger picture, but the bigger picture is outside our control here.  The Minister said that he was travelling to Brussels to negotiate the health check on the Common Agricultural Policy.  I call on other farm organisations representing farmers up and down the country to engage positively with the Minister in trying to fight for the rights of farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy health check because while we can play politics within the country we could be doing damage to farm families outside the country if we do not support the Minister in the efforts he is undertaking this week.</P>
        <P>I appeal to Senators across the House and to the farm organisations outside it to engage with the Minister, as I am sure they will, given that they are responsible organisations.  This week, as the Minister mentioned in the Chamber earlier, the health check is being negotiated and he will represent Irish farmers in Brussels.  The Minister stated today that his priorities for the health check include seeking sufficient milk quota increases; appropriate market management arrangements to ensure a soft landing in preparation for the expiry of the quotas in 2015; ensuring clear, predictable decisions that can be taken on the milk quotas to give policies certainty; and other areas, including the future viability of farms in Ireland and the direct transfers available to farmers on which they so highly depend.</P>
        <P>The sheep sector was referred to earlier.  I come from a sheep farm and the future for sheep farming here is positive because of the work being done by our MEP, Liam Aylward, on bringing together clear and firm proposals for the sheep sector, not only here but across the EU.  Sheep farmers, the Irish Farmers Association and other farm organisations should support those steps because it will benefit sheep farmers long into the future.</P>
        <P>The suckler welfare scheme was referred to earlier.  More than 47,000 participants will benefit from that scheme, which is a new stream of income for Irish farmers.  In the next couple of months &euro;77 million will be paid out under that scheme.  Senator Carty pointed out to me earlier that &euro;250 million is ring fenced for that scheme over the next five years and it is important to acknowledge that.  We need to look in a very logical manner at the domestic situation, the budget available to farming next year and the difficulties with which the Minister has had to deal in trying to balance the future investment provision that is available to agriculture in the 2008 and 2009 budget against the money being paid out under the various schemes.  At the same time we must not take our eyes off the ball in terms of the CAP health check, which is so important to the future of agriculture.  I appeal to farming organisations to work with the Minister in a constructive manner to defend Irish agriculture under the review of CAP.  If we do not do that, the future of Irish agriculture could be in jeopardy.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, his officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent are working to defend Irish agriculture at that level.  It is important we back the Minister to the full in bringing about the best available opportunities to Irish farming by protecting all our interests under the CAP reform health check.</P>

	<P>In his statement the Minister, Deputy Smith said it was unfortunate that he missed last week&rsquo;s debate.  I imagine he means it was fortunate he missed it because it was a very robust debate on the budget.  The Minister&rsquo;s statement says precious little about the budget.  He speaks about everything but the budget cutbacks in Irish agriculture, with a few general statements on the budget.  He talked about the CAP health check, modulation, a soft <Col N="213"/>landing and simplification, and then moved on to the WTO and climate change.  We have statements on agriculture this week, having had this robust debate last week when the budget was the issue of primary concern to farmers.  Any Minister negotiating in any external forum, whether the EU or the WTO, has an obligation to do his best for Irish agriculture.  That is a given and one expects it.  The Minister does not need a clap on the back for that.</P>
        <P>No matter how bad things are, one must invest for the future and ensure the sector is efficient.  The Minister points out in his speech how important agriculture still is to this economy.  He points out that the sector contributes up to 39% of net foreign earning in the primary manufacturing sector, according to the recently published Reardon report.  It is still a very important sector and is vital to the incomes in rural areas in general.  However the Government must encourage structural changes.  The ending of the young farmers installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme and the cutbacks in the disadvantaged area schemes are false economies.  They are detrimental not just to farmers now but to the future and the structure of farming given the age profile of Irish agriculture and the need to encourage to the maximum the transfers of farms into the ownership of young, qualified farmers.  The budget is very negative and detrimental to that movement and that constant process of structural adjustment required.  Given the IFA&rsquo;s position on the WTO, the Minister adopted a vindictive approach in the budget.  It was payback time for the IFA and other farming organisations that created difficulties for the Taoiseach and the Government during the Lisbon referendum.  The Government has got its own back on farmers with the measures it has adopted in this budget.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle said we need diversity in Irish agriculture.  Our climatic conditions favour two major sectors, dairy and beef.  One cannot change the nature of Irish agriculture and the comparative advantage this country has in livestock.  Oddly, Senator Boyle talked about farmhouse cheeses in the same breath, perhaps not realising that this comes from the dairy sector.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill talked about how well farmers have done, as if farmers should be lucky to earn a living from farming.  Farming has become very specialised.  People work very hard and if they have one good year in prices for their products, that should not be used to justify the type of cutbacks the Minister imposed in this budget.</P>

To speak about issues that are, and will be for some time, the subject of ongoing negotiations in Brussels, such as the CAP health check and the WTO, is to avoid the issue and that is what the Minister has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of this opportunity to discuss agriculture and I want to talk specifically about the future of Irish agriculture.  We had a very interesting day last week in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in the committees.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and many farming organisations were in for much of the day, there was a Private Members&rsquo; motion here and it gave us an opportunity to hear about the future of Irish farming.  We on the climate change committee were looking at it from the perspective of climate change and it got me asking what is the future of Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to other contributors.  Coming from an urban centre I am not very familiar with all the grants and schemes, however being familiar with the west I know about the hardship of trying to make a living from small farming.  It is most interesting and deserves a little thought.  Having a vibrant agricultural base is so important to rural Ireland and it demands that we examine the future of Irish agriculture.  I accept that I am not the most familiar with agriculture.  There has been a major problem of examining only the short term <Col N="214"/>rather than the fundamentals of Irish agriculture.  Farmers have taken much change, such as the CAP reform.  We are still in a transitional phase.  We need to look beyond this immediate term.  That struck me when we had discussions with the Department and the farming organisations.  There is no long-term thought going into it.  I was glad to hear that Teagasc is involved with a group that is engaging in futuristic modelling for Irish farming.  The group in question is looking at the present circumstances and deciding what is needed.  Agriculture is definitely going to change.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand.  We have to accept that it is going to be different.  As farmers are very entrepreneurial, they will adapt to that change.  There is no point in sticking with something that no longer works or no longer meets our requirements.</P>
        <P>As we live in a globalised world, we need to be conscious of what Ireland can do in the agriculture industry.  I understand that one of the things Irish agriculture does most efficiently is rear cows.  It is understandable that we should focus on that area if that is what we are good at.  The threat of the climate change issue is hanging over the cattle sector, however.  I find that the agriculture sector is blamed unfairly for carbon burden associated with it.  The three main sectors that contribute to carbon emissions are transport, energy production and agriculture.  Last week, statistics were published to show that there has been a decline in the carbon output of the agriculture sector.  The benefit of such improvements is often transferred to the transport sector.  The development of biofuels is a case in point.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has defended the good work that is being done in the agriculture sector.  The agriculture sector is getting its house in order, but it is not able to claim the credit for it.  That is an important point.</P>
        <P>Having said that, we need to think about issues like climate change and the carbon cost of the production of food.  If Irish agriculture is to change, we will need to prepare people in advance.  This is a sensitive time, as negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy health check continue.  We need to look beyond that.  Farmers will be involved in a totally different type of work in the future.  We need to project ourselves forward by ten years to see what farmers will need to do.  We should get farmers to prepare for the change that is to come.  I appreciate that a certain amount of work is being done in that regard, but I would love to see more of it.  There needs to be a much more open debate on how much change is needed in this sector.  There are big opportunities for farming.  Farmers have proven in the past that they can adapt to change and we need to give them the confidence to do so again.  I would love a big seminar to be organised to address the changes in the agriculture sector.  People have nothing to fear from such changes.  If change happens in a cold and undercover way, people may get anxious.  We need to openly prepare people for it.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the name of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be changed to the Department of food security.  That would focus minds on the role of the Department in providing food for the European and world markets and dealing with other issues like climate change.  The term &ldquo;Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&rdquo; is too all-embracing.  It needs to be a little more focused.  I would like it to be renamed as the Department of food security, as I have suggested.  Such a change would ensure that we would know exactly what the Department is about.   We should acknowledge that Ireland has to play an important part in feeding the European community.  We should not be penalised for the carbon costs we incur in so doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words on the agriculture industry.</P><Col N="215"/>
        <P>I am worried about the performance of Bord Bia in the export market.  When I was in southern Spain and Portugal during the summer, I found it hard to get Irish dairy products.  One will see Dairygold butter for sale overseas, but other Irish dairy products cannot be bought.  I presume that the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s substantial exports in this sector are sent to Great Britain.  There is a huge market for Irish products in other European countries.  With the exception of Dairygold butter, I could not see such products when I was abroad.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the importation of Brazilian and Argentinian beef.  I am concerned about the accredited farms such beef comes from.  It has been brought to my attention that, in some cases, accredited farms are selling beef from neighbouring farms that do not have such accreditation.  There are no checks in the system to stop such farms from buying cattle or beef from other farms in the area.  I urge the Minister of State to investigate this phenomenon as a matter of urgency.  What controls are in place on the accredited farms?  How can we be sure that the beef that comes through such farms has not been purchased from other farms in the neighbourhood?  How do we know its sole origin is an accredited farm?</P>
        <P>A recent Sunday newspaper article suggested that the Government, for some peculiar reason, decided not to avail of a &euro;200 million grant for the forestry industry, which it had been offered by the EU.  It seems that the Government decided instead to support the industry from the national Exchequer.  Can the Minister say whether that is the case and, if so, why?  If the EU offers Ireland a grant of &euro;200 million, would it not be foolish to refuse it?  Why should the taxpayer have to stump up &euro;200 million?  Why is the Government not availing of the EU moneys?  Has it decided, for some reason, that we have too much money in the coffers here?  Does it think it is preferable for us to stump up the &euro;200 million ourselves?  That was the implication in the newspaper article I mentioned.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why Ireland has refused a grant of &euro;200 million that was available from the EU.  We have fallen far behind in respect of plantations etc. in the forestry industry.  For some reason, our Exchequer moneys are being used instead of a grant from the EU.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I would like to talk about education for young farmers.  We have seen more farmers entering agricultural colleges and availing of farming education initiatives this year than we have for many years.  It is a grave error on the part of the Government to cut installation aid, as well as the retirement pension for farmers who are handing over their farms to their sons, in a year when our agricultural colleges are overflowing with students.  As previous speakers have said, the jobs that are being created in the agriculture industry are as valuable as those in other industries, including those IDA Ireland is trying to attract as it scurries around the world.  For some strange reason, the Government has decided to save a small amount of money by cutting the retirement pension and taking away the installation aid scheme.  Such forms of assistance are badly needed by young farmers who have decided that the best way forward for them is to take a risk by going to agricultural college, or availing of some other form of education, with a view to having a career in agriculture on the family farm or some other farm.  In addition, the withdrawal of a number of disadvantaged area payments is a grave injustice to farmers, especially when this is coupled with the 1% levy on their gross income.  That will create hardship on many farms and I am disappointed with the Government&rsquo;s decision to single out agriculture and the low paid in the industry.  This issue should be examined.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, t&aacute; m&eacute; ag fanacht le haghaidh n&oacute;ta&iacute; os rud &eacute; nach raibh m&eacute; anseo i rith <Col N="216"/>na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar fad.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm faoi sin.  Leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh mar at&aacute; m&eacute;.  Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas, agus bu&iacute;ochas an Aire, an Teachta Smith, a thosaigh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht, leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; a labhair i rith na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for granting time to discuss the future prospects for agriculture.  As the Minister outlined earlier, the industry as a whole is well placed to address the wide range of challenges confronting it, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary scenario in which the country finds itself.</P>
        <P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s analysis that we need to focus much more clearly on food security as well as fuel security and other aspects within the Department&rsquo;s remit.  I may be biased but if the Department were the only one left standing, it would do a good job in taking on many of the responsibilities of other Departments, including the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Foreign Affairs.  Everything goes through my Department one way or the other.  For example, Senator Burke referred to Bord Bia and how our international relations are connected to our agricultural base.  I have had the good fortune to accompany Bord Bia representatives at a number of international meetings and on trade missions to France and Germany.  We attended Anuga, an international food fair in Germany, and the Terra Madre conference in Turin, Italy.</P>
        <P>Irish products worth approximately &euro;600 million are sold on the German market while the value of products sold on the French market is &euro;400 million with hundreds of millions of euro more sold in Italy.  Domestic companies have relations with one or all members of the EU and Russia and so on.  The EU is our key market and that is positive from a sustainability point of view because this is the closest market to us in the context of transportation.  Kepak, for example, does great business with Coop Italia, one of the large Italian supermarket chains, Carrefour in France and SPAR and other large chains in Germany.  Clare Island organic salmon worth &euro;20 million is sold in Germany annually.  Significant business is being done internationally thanks to Bord Bia&rsquo;s excellent ability to nurture and maintain markets.</P>
        <P>The Ministerial Council commencing in Brussels tomorrow is vital for the agricultural sector and everyone has wished the Minister well in his endeavours, in particular, Senator Bradford.  This week&rsquo;s negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy health check will determine the shape of the policy until 2013 while discussions on the post-2013 scenario will take place in parallel with a wider discussion on the EU budget for the new financial perspective for the period 2014 to 2020.  There is a continuing strong case for an effective and well-resourced Union CAP, especially given the central importance of agriculture in current global challenges.</P>
        <P>Central to the negotiations over the coming days will be the subject of the milk quota, which was raised by a number of Senators.  Ireland would like the implementation of a soft landing approach to increases in milk quota in the lead-up to their removal in 2015 to avoid shocks, with appropriate market support in place to underpin the process.  We are anxious that these pragmatic proposals and measures be adopted.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in seeking to develop mechanisms for the measurable simplification of the various processes with which domestic farmers must comply, especially in regard to cross-compliance.  All farmers in receipt of direct payments must practise farming in accordance with specific environmental requirements meeting broader sectoral demands.  I accept farmers generally employ good farming practices in operating their farms.  As part of the simplification process, it must be ensured the administrative burden on them is reduced while maintaining environmental standards.</P>
        <P>The proposal before Council on modulation remains of concern for Ireland and runs contrary to the expectations of our farmers who are still adjusting to the introduction of decoupling <Col N="217"/>three years ago.  The Minister has put in great effort over recent months in working with the Commission, the Presidency and other member states to find a meaningful resolution having regard to these concerns.  Last week we had a full debate, notwithstanding disagreements, on the budgetary measures.  The Minister clarified earlier, as I attempted to last week, the need to protect as best we can the areas of greatest need and the productive capacity of the industry.  We want to ensure sectors that can stand on their own two feet do not suffer handicaps or obstacles.  As Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, farmers who are traditionally resourceful, resilient and able to adapt should be given every opportunity to adjust to the changing circumstances we face nationally and internationally.</P>
        <P>I refer to forestry and funding, which can sometimes raise unintended obstacles.  It was incorrectly reported in one newspaper that the Department did not avail of full EU funding for the forestry sector.  The Department wrote to the newspaper explaining the position.  The position is that one forestry scheme which was eligible for EU funding was included among others in a submission to the EU under the Rural Development Programme.  However, under the EU rules grants could amount to only 80% of total cost to farmers for the forestry scheme.  The Department, in order to increase forestry planting, had a policy of 100% funding for the scheme and withdrew the scheme from its submission to the EU.  However, the full amount of EU funds available was drawn down in the other elements of the rural development plan and the forestry scheme was paid for by the Exchequer.  Often there can be different ways of drawing down that money.  If it means we lose money, we will find another way of drawing it down.</P>
        <P>The House will note, as it has been acknowledged, that forestry generally has been one of the beneficiaries of the budget.  This also stresses the point I made, that the productive side of the sector is what we want to continue to encourage and ensure that we are able to maintain a sustainable sector which is resilient enough to withstand the changing circumstances, world wide as well as nationally.  We will continue to ensure that forestry and all aspects of agriculture are central to the Irish economy given that they are our largest indigenous resource.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I have three brief questions and I appreciate the time constraints he is under.</P>
        <P>As a reflection on last week&rsquo;s debate, has there been any further work done by the Minister of State&rsquo;s office and his ministerial colleagues on all of those applicants for either farm insulation grants or farm retirement schemes whose applications were being processed but, unfortunately, due to the budgetary announcement, are now suspended?  I appreciate that the long-term future of the scheme is, hopefully, secure, but is the plight of the applicants whose projections were based on receiving these grants and who are now left out in the cold being considered?  Has any further consideration been given to the extension, beyond the 13 December deadline, of the farm waste management scheme?</P>
        <P>I referred in my brief contribution earlier to the ongoing debate on food versus energy and how in one sense it rebalanced almost to an extreme degree.  The plans, both within the country and at European Union level, for a significant investment in energy crops appear to have slowed down significantly.  Perhaps we had gone too far down that road and had too high a level of expectation.  Could we reflect a little further, take note of the energy crop opportunities that are still available and try to get it back on the political agenda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I note Senator Bradford raised that issue earlier.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned last week, the introduction of the young farmers&rsquo; installation scheme in June 2007 under the Rural Development Programme provided a grant level of &euro;15,000, an increase of 58% compared to the preceding scheme, to farmers between the ages of 18 and 35.  When all of the requirements under the scheme were satisfied, 941 applications were received by the <Col N="218"/>Department under the scheme prior to its suspension on budget day.  Of these, 315 applications have been already paid, totalling &euro;4.725 million.  All fully completed applications entered into under the scheme up to and including budget day will be processed by the Department and, if in order, payment will be made.  That was the undertaking that was given.</P>
        <P>As Senator Bradford rightly pointed out, the suspension that is in operation means all applicants will be processed in accordance with the rules that are laid down but it is, unfortunately, the case that we cannot take further applicants until the suspension is lifted.  However, the payments are proceeding and, as I mentioned, there already has been &euro;4.725 million paid out.</P>
        <P>On the farm waste management scheme, it has been well and truly stated in as clear a manner as possible which leaves no room for ambiguity that the European Commission has told us without any doubt that the deadline stands.  Based on its long tolerance of Ireland not complying with the Nitrates Directive over many years, the Commission basically asked us not to stretch its tolerance any further and it is at the end of the line.  That message, I hope, has been stated clearly.  It is not fair to give any impression otherwise.  Politically, I would like to state that there is scope or wriggle room but if I were to say that, it would not only be dishonest but would also send out a message that people who are working towards the deadline may have a plan B.  Unfortunately, there is not a plan B.  I do not want to give any such false impression.  I hope that all things considered &mdash; the downturn in construction and reasonable weather over which we have no control &mdash; ultimately we will be able to ensure the schemes are completed by the due date.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford also mentioned energy.  This is one of those global debates.  There is a clear conflict world wide due to difficult choices.  I believe, however, there is a clear choice.  The choice people tend to make is between whether one feeds the petrol tank or the stomach.  It is not a question of either-or because there are different types of land, there are different rotations in farming that can complement both serving a food need and an energy need, and then there is the addition of forestry and other aspects that perhaps would not have a food element.</P>
        <P>In this country we are focussing on not being exclusive about it but ensuring they complement each other.  For example, in my area of north County Dublin many brassica farmers are not particularly keen to see nearby rape seed growing because it is a brassica and they do not want to be affected by any of the disease problems that might come with a brassica.  Whether grown for energy or for food is beside the point.  These are technical aspects of the issue that need to be kept to the forefront as well.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this motion on the Adjournment.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  I hope he has good news for the people of Cork, which is becoming a severe unemployment black spot.  It is an economic black spot as well.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Cork region requires an economic stimulus and a programme of promotion by Government.  Unemployment, as the Minister of State will be aware, has affected both the northside and southside of Cork city.  Hormann Electronics, Tyco Sensormatic, Bourne Electronics and a host of other electronics companies have gone to the wall, not to mention the small building construction companies and ancillary service companies.</P>
        <P>This needs clear Government action in a number of spheres, most importantly, on the development of the airport, on the provision of a car ferry and on the docklands.  The docklands project is a major vehicle by which we can promote and encourage employment in Cork and which requires support for the eastern gateway bridge and other related activities.  We also need support for the pharmaceutical industry which is the largest supplier in the Cork region.</P>
        <P>I call for urgent action to stop the rising tide of unemployment in Cork.  I refer to Cork because Cork is the capital of Ireland in my mind.  It is the most important area, the primary area of the southern region.  We need to help small and medium enterprises.  The cost of doing business has risen exponentially.  I hope we will encourage local authorities to keep down rates in the forthcoming budget and that we will not use local authority budgets to penalise small enterprises which are struggling.  We need to tackle the issue of competitiveness and the cost of doing business in the Cork area.  We must encourage people to employ and attract them to Cork.  This can be done through the airport, the docklands and the ferry.</P>
        <P>The jobless figure in Cork has increased by 56%, with 8,762 new people added to unemployment queues.  Last week, the Minister of State was quoted on the front page of the <i>Evening Echo</i> with regard to unemployment, which had a vivid image of people queuing on Hanover Quay and over Clarke&rsquo;s Bridge.  I know of somebody who joined the queue at the unemployment exchange at 9.45 a.m. today and did not leave until 12.45 p.m.  There were no staff to cater for the demand of people.  That is a separate issue but staffing at the unemployment office must be examined.</P>
        <P>In October 2007 the number of people on the live register in Cork was 15,448 and that increased to 24,210 in October 2008.  That is a soul-destroying figure which, as the Minister of State said last week, is affecting the ordinary citizens of Cork.  We also have the issue of the length of time people are waiting for their applications to be processed and payment to be handed out.  In Cork city, the number of people claiming the dole has increased by approximately 50% to 11,295.  Carrigaline has seen an 86% increase.  The Cork region is in crisis with regard to unemployment and needs Government action and a stimulus package.  What will the Government tell us?  What about retraining?  The Minister of State has responsibility for F&Aacute;S which must come into the equation with regard to upskilling.</P>
        <P>The Cork Economic Monitor published by Cork City Council mentions a marked slowdown in the Cork area.  We need the region of Cork to be vibrant and attractive and one to which people come and are employed.  We need to encourage people to establish business there and retain existing businesses.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom and gloom but a 56.6% increase in unemployment, with an increase of 70.6% in those aged under 25 years of age, in 12 months paints a picture.  Nationally, one person loses his or her job every three minutes.  Recently we saw the largest monthly increase in history.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State has a response which will encourage an economic stimulus for Cork and that we will target young people, particularly those with limited work experience and those who are under pressure academically and who leave school not as qualified as they should be.  We need initiatives to deal with unemployment in the Cork region urgently.  Cork is a forgotten area.  We see it in the flip-flop over the airport where we do not know whether it will <Col N="220"/>remain independent.  We have no ferry connection with England or France and we need that.  We need the completion of the motorway to Dublin.  The docklands is the vehicle by which we can encourage developers to enter through the eastern gateway bridge.</P>

As a practising politician, I appreciate that behind the statistics are individuals and families who have had their hopes and aspirations dashed.  They are often in difficulty with mortgage repayments.  When people lose their jobs it has a devastating impact on the individual.  With this is mind, as a Government we are trying to take specific measures to address these challenges and ensure job losses are minimised as much as possible.  Our priority is to create an environment which would allow those who lose their jobs to return quickly to the labour market.</P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies, with F&Aacute;S, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Cork.  IDA Ireland is concentrating its efforts in Cork city and Mallow.  It is also targeting the towns of Fermoy, Clonakilty and Youghal.  The attractions of the region include a young skilled population, the presence of a university and institute of technology and the availability of first-class business parks, good infrastructure and an international airport.</P>
        <P>The emergence of an economic corridor along the N25 with the initial development of Little Island followed by new developments at Eastgate, Fota Business Park, Carrigtwohill and Midleton have proved opportune.  IDA Ireland has found that the availability of quality property solutions combined with excellent infrastructure and the proximity of Little Island to the city, airport and residential areas has made the area an attractive location for IDA Ireland clients.</P>
        <P>Cork has benefited greatly from a number of important investment announcements recently, which demonstrates the attractiveness of the county as a location for investment, by existing companies already located there as well as new overseas client companies choosing Cork as their location of choice.</P>
        <P>At present, Cork city and county have 134 IDA Ireland supported enterprises.  Over the past ten years, direct employment in IDA Ireland supported companies has increased from 13,838 in 1998 to more than 20,110 in 2007.  The sectors contributing to this growth are ICT, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and globally traded business.</P>
        <P>In the past three years, IDA Ireland has approved projects of new companies establishing in the Cork area with a job potential of more than 3,100 people at full operation.  At the beginning of this month, Marriott International Incorporated, one of the world&rsquo;s largest hoteliers, announced that it is to establish its second operation in Cork, creating 220 new high quality jobs over five years.  In March 2008, DePuy Johnson &amp; Johnson announced that it is to carry out next generation product and process development at its Ringaskiddy facility, with the establishment of an innovation centre.  In February of this year, Citco Fund Services Limited, which is based in Dublin, announced the expansion of its Cork hedge fund administration operation, which will create an additional 150 jobs at its Blackrock site.</P><Col N="221"/>
        <P>In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage them to expand their operations.  The success of this is demonstrated by the recent expansion of several companies in the county, including Trend Micro, GlaxoSmithKline, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Sanmina-SCI, the research and development section of EMC, Siemens, Arris and Alcon.</P>
        <P>New indigenous companies have also been established and have created new employment in the county.  In July of this year funding of &euro;20 million was announced for the establishment of a national functional foods research centre for a unique partnership between four of Ireland&rsquo;s leading dairy companies, namely, Glanbia Nutritionals, Dairygold Food Ingredients, Carberry and Kerry Ingredients Ireland.  It is expected that 50 people will be trained and employed by the companies in research over the next five years.  Research and development in indigenous industries is important, particularly in the area of food research.</P>
        <P>In September 2007, Eirebloc Limited announced it would invest &euro;16 million over a three year period in establishing a manufacturing facility in Macroom, County Cork, with the creation of 73 high value jobs over the next two years.  In January 2007, Global Shares Public Limited opened its new headquarters in Clonakilty, County Cork, and it is projected that it will employ 32 people by the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>A significant initiative was developed for north Cork in 2007 with the launch of the &euro;500 million development plan for the Irish Sugar site in Mallow.  The plan includes enterprise space of 800,000 sq. ft., a four star conference hotel, a golf course and recreational amenities and the creation of up to 1,000 jobs.</P>
        <P>Envisaged in the Cork docklands development strategy is a new urban quarter with residential, employment and leisure opportunities in a high density urban setting.  This regeneration of docklands is a priority for the city council.  The massive regeneration programme will take about 15 years to complete and involves an employment target of 25,000 for the area.  The budget includes a commitment in the context of tax relief for the Seveso sites.  The Government is committed to progress the project.  In the context of the economic backdrop we now face, there are additional challenges for those charged with progressing this and other projects, but I am certain development will take place in the docklands in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>Employment services are available through F&Aacute;S offices in several locations in Cork city, as well as in Mallow and Bantry.  These offices are further supported in service provision via fortnightly clinics in all the principal towns in the county.  F&Aacute;S is also working closely with the Cork city local employment service to support the unemployed further, through training and other means, with a particular emphasis on those who are most distant from the labour market.  There are approximately 2,898 people currently participating in F&Aacute;S training programmes in County Cork, with more than 2,000 participating in community employment projects.  The other programmes in the region include the job initiative programme, local training initiatives, supported employment, specialist training providers and community training centres.</P>
        <P>For those who have lost their jobs and for those in employment, upskilling is vital in the context of ensuring a competitive economy.  Workers must be able to adapt their skills quickly to meet the challenges posed by a rapidly shifting global economic market.  The participation of ever greater numbers of our population in lifelong learning is essential to ensuring our economy remains adaptable against the background of the types of economic challenges we and most other developed nations are facing.  It was recently confirmed that the eurozone has slipped into recession, creating major challenges for us.  As a small open economy, selling to the global market, we are very dependent on exports.  We will survive by remaining competitive <Col N="222"/>and by ensuring we have a flexible, highly educated and mobile workforce.  These are the two vital ingredients in enhancing our competitiveness on global markets.</P>
        <P>We must, however, be under no illusions.  The international credit crisis and the downturn in the major economies of Europe and in the United States has affected us significantly.  We now see that Japan is in difficulty, while China, until recently the powerhouse of the global economy, has announced an investment package to stimulate its economy.  There is no doubt we are in a very challenging situation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure those who fall into unemployment will have the opportunity to seek training in other areas through F&Aacute;S.  Given the downturn in the construction industry, we are placing particular emphasis on ensuring apprentices have an opportunity to complete their training and attain their qualification.  The worst case scenario is that apprentices who have spent time training to be craftspeople would find themselves unemployed, without a sponsor and unable to obtain their qualifications.  We are working actively with F&Aacute;S to ensure they can avail of their next off-the-job training block release.  In other words, if they cannot find a sponsor, they can return to F&Aacute;S and take their eight-week training module off-site.  In addition, we are seeking to put in place measures whereby employers will receive assistance to take on apprentices and thus allow them to complete their training.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that we are very conscious of the difficulties that exist.  As a public representative, I recognise the impact the downturn is having on individuals.  Even in the context of the difficult choices and challenges arising in the budget, the Government took strategic decisions to ensure we do not overburden businesses with increased costs and taxation.  All the budgetary measures were necessary to ensure that we stabilise the public finances in the first instance.  The objective now is to ensure we remain competitive and that we have a stable banking system.  All these issues were taken into account and we are seeking to address them in a rapidly changing economic climate, both nationally and globally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The Cork docklands is a primary vehicle for the development of the city.  As the Minister of State said, the Government gave a commitment to a Seveso site.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Finance and to the banks the need to allow liquidity to flow to small enterprises, many of which are struggling?  There are small businesses in Cork which need &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 and which are being choked by the banks.  That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said last week in response to Senator Ross on a related Adjournment matter, banks now have a new relationship with the public.  They also have a new relationship with the Houses of the Oireachtas, which passed the guarantee scheme.  They should be conscious of the importance of not denying credit to the most productive areas of the economy, which are primarily small and medium businesses.  In particular, withdrawing overdrafts and other short-term credit facilities is putting great pressure on small companies.  If the banks are trying to rebalance their books for the benefit of the regulator and the stock market, I urge that they do not target those businesses which are vulnerable but also viable.  Credit must be allowed to flow to small and medium enterprises.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his recent happy news. </P>
        <P>It is only a few weeks since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, introduced his first budget.  The financial climate both nationally and internationally is bleak and one understands the necessity for cutbacks.  Some of the measures outlined were insensitive, such as the removal of the universal entitlement to medical cards for the over 70s and the universal 1% levy.  These have been remedied. However, by far the most sinister cuts were those whose impact was not immediately obvious.  I refer to the deliberate and specific hobbling of virtually every agency in the State representing the marginalised and disadvantaged.  The Equality Authority, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Irish Human Rights Commission and others have been selectively targeted and victimised.  In some cases, there is no saving in so doing.  In others, the savings are minimal but the very efficiency and relevance of these agencies has been effectively destroyed.  This is the dagger under the cloak.  Having reviewed the situation in detail, I have no doubt these groups are being punished because they were troublesome to the Government and, in particular, because they criticised the operation of Departments.</P>
        <P>This whole sorry business calls into question the Government&rsquo;s commitment to equal rights for the citizens of this State and human rights in general.  The Combat Poverty Agency has been abolished in circumstances where there can be no question whatever that there will be a massive increase in poverty levels in this State.  In these conditions, the agency should have been strengthened.  Instead of acting to protect the poor and the disadvantaged, the Government has ensured they will be left virtually powerless.  Moreover, the absorption of the lifeless corpse of the Combat Poverty Agency into the office for social inclusion, which effectively means its absorption into the Department of Social and Family Affairs, means it will lose its critical independent aspect.  There is no doubt in my mind this was the specific intention of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Government must take several steps as a minimum requirement.  The board of the Combat Poverty Agency must remain in place until the roles, remit and structures of a new and strengthened division is agreed and the board&rsquo;s responsibilities as an employer are satisfactorily met.  The Minister must give an undertaking for a consultation process with the social partners and other key stakeholders on the formation of a new division.  There must be an explicit focus on poverty in the new division.  It must be empowered to undertake and publish research and policy analysis, support and evaluate programmes and initiatives to reduce and eliminate poverty, and promote an understanding of poverty and ways to tackle and build social inclusion.</P>
        <P>A parallel and even more swingeing attack has been made on the Equality Authority.  The overall departmental cut was 4% as against 2008.  However, the budget of the Equality Authority has been slashed by a massive 43%.  Moreover, it is unique in being targeted for further participation in the discredited decentralisation programme.  Fifteen staff are already situated in Roscrea, but many of these are not original members of the Equality Authority.  In order to get the numbers right, people were reallocated within Departments.  The same is likely to happen with the additional 15.  There will be 30 people in Roscrea with little or no professional acquaintance with the equality legislation in a building that does not have disabled access.  This is a disgraceful farce and one that is likely to lead to wastage and inefficiency instead of budget savings.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>Why is this happening?  Again, this is an agency that has been critical of the Government.  The figures are revealing.  Departments, State agencies, local authorities and educational institutions made up 54% of the case files under the Equal Status Act in 2005, 60%  in 2006 and 69% in 2007.  There is no question that the Equality Authority lived up to its responsibility to be a critical voice.  For this reason it has been neutered.  The Equality Authority itself has concluded that budget 2009, if fully implemented, may render it unable fully or effectively to carry out the full range of its core functions under the equality legislation and relevant EU directives.</P>
        <P>In the past, the Government has ignored or treated with contempt decisions made by the Equality Authority with which it was uncomfortable.  A classic example is in the case of a same-sex couple who applied for equal transport rights with opposite-sex couples, married or unmarried, as granted by a particular firm.  The firm&rsquo;s refusal to make this provision was found to be a gross discrimination and violation of the Equality Act.  The Government, however, acted not to correct this discrimination but to copperfasten it by introducing legislation to redefine the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; in order to negate the rights of same sex couples.</P>
        <P>Also under attack is the Irish Human Rights Commission.  This is a quite astonishing piece of political brigandage.  The Irish Human Rights Commission was established in concert with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  It was intended to be in direct tandem with and parallel to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.  By acting in the manner it acted, the Government has violated all its commitments under this Agreement and effectively rendered the Human Rights Commission incapable of carrying out its remit.</P>
        <P>Like the Equality Authority, the Human Rights Commission has been subject to cuts that are quite disproportionate when viewed in the light of other cuts even within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Under these cuts the Human Rights Commission will be unable to pay staff, salaries and basic operational costs.  In a statement the Commission said to the press that, &ldquo;A cut of the scale proposed would leave the Irish Human Rights Commission completely unable to perform its function.  It would put its survival in doubt.&rdquo;  In July of this year the United Nations explicitly called on the Government to strengthen the independence and capacity of the IHRC by giving it adequate and sufficient resources to do its job properly for the Irish people.  Look at how the Government responded.  The work of the commission is critical, especially during this difficult financial time.  The Government&rsquo;s action is also in violation of the expressed wish of the people of Ireland, North and South, who gave their full backing to the Good Friday Agreement under which the Human Rights Commission was established.</P>
        <P>In October, I attended the headquarters of the Irish Human Rights Commission in central Dublin for the launch of its report.  The chairman at that meeting was optimistic and, in fact, was calling for further work to be entrusted to the Human Rights Commission.  This indeed may be a way for the Government to allow the Human Rights Commission to survive by providing it with extra work in a clear example of a productivity agreement.  The chairman on that occasion expressed the desire that the commission should be used by the Government to human rights proof proposed legislation.  This would be valuable, helpful and an efficient use of the commission.  There is also a role for the commission to play in monitoring international covenants, conventions and agreements such as the disability convention and the convention on torture.  Additional funding could be afforded in return for work undertaken in this area, thus guaranteeing the survival of this important body.</P><Col N="225"/>
        <P>This country is not unique in facing the economic crisis.  However, to our shame, it is unique in specifically and savagely targeting those bodies which protect the rights of the weakest members of society.  I bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the opening paragraph of a statement issued in Paris on 16 November, two days ago, at the European Disability Forum, which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The European Disability Forum which is the voice of more than fifty million European people with disabilities, calls on the European Council, Commission and Parliament and other European institutions and all the Governments of Europe to ensure disabled people and their families do not pay for the world wide economic crisis by the reduction in their income, benefits, employment opportunities or in cuts in support to our representative organisations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It remains to be seen whether this Government has the moral capacity to respond positively to that call.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his kind words.  The context in which financial provisions have been made by the Government for the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Equality Authority and the Combat Poverty Agency, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, was outlined in the Budget Statement of 14 October.  That context is the wholly exceptional circumstances in which decisions on the spend for 2009 have been made having regard to the need for substantial savings.  While the Minister has always accepted that the reduced budgets will cause some difficulties for the commission and the authority, he is satisfied that sufficient funding has been provided to the bodies to enable them to discharge their core activities in 2009.  He has decided that the main priority in the justice area in 2009 will be to tackle crime and the funding decisions in the Department broadly reflect that priority.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes it is unarguable, and well recognised, that the budget announcement to integrate the administrative and back office facilities of the Equality Authority and Irish Human Rights Commission will go some way to reducing costs in 2009.  Further substantial saving of approximately &euro;300,000 or 10% of the authority&rsquo;s budget will be realised by the completion of the transfer of the Equality Authority staff to Roscrea.  In line with Government policy, the Minister has also asked the bodies to reduce significantly their spending on consultants, advertising, promotional activities and other non-core items.  A similar request has been made to all other bodies under the aegis of the Department.</P>
        <P>The Minister has informed the bodies in question that any savings made in meeting the costs of discharging their core functions can be used to supplement their budgets.  This does not mean there will be an increase in the published budget of either body, or that the savings can be used for advertising or other public relations activities.  In other words, the Minister does not propose to use the savings they might make to meet other expenditure requirement across his Vote group.</P>
        <P>The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority currently operate from separate Dublin city centre office premises which have a cumulative per annum rental cost of more than &euro;800,000.  The Equality Authority is paying an annual rent of &euro;402,000 for its premises on Harcourt Street and it spends a further &euro;40,000 on parking facilities.  On the other hand, the annual rent in Roscrea is &euro;102,000.  To those who think the Equality Authority, by being in Roscrea, will somehow not function as well as in Dublin, the Minister asked me to make the point that other offices in the Department that have decentralised have managed the change admirably.  The authority is staffed by civil servants who are accustomed to changes of role <Col N="226"/>within an organisation and are well suited to meeting the challenge of new work in a new working environment.</P>
        <P>The Minister firmly believes that significant efficiencies and savings can be realised by both bodies, and possibly others, sharing office facilities.  Other areas where savings can be made are likely to include shared IT and telecommunications facilities.  In the case of the authority, more than &euro;30,000 will be saved from the reduction in the use of public relations and consultants.  The Equality Authority recently spent &euro;230,000 on an anti-ageism campaign.  There are good and sound reasons in the current economic climate to question expenditure of this kind.  Finally, the Minister asked me to remind the House that the 2009 provision for the Equality Tribunal, which adjudicates on individual claims of inequality, has been increased by 15%, to reflect the priority that should be given to people who have a grievance in this respect.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to integrate the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion within the Department of Social and Family Affairs was informed by the findings of a review of the Combat Poverty Agency which was undertaken on foot of a Government Decision on 6 June 2007.  As the Combat Poverty Agency is established under statute, legislative changes will be required to alter its status.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs intends to bring proposals in this regard to Government in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not her intention that the Combat Poverty Agency will be simply absorbed into the Office for Social Inclusion in its existing form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Huh.  That is spelt &ldquo;h-u-h&rdquo; for the information of the parliamentary reporter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew I would bring the Senator good news.  Instead, a new strengthened division will be created which will make the best use of the considerable experience and expertise of the staff of both existing bodies and will seek to address the weaknesses identified by the review in both bodies.  This new division will provide a stronger voice for those affected by poverty and social inclusion issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are all conscious of the concerns about the need for independent scrutiny of public policy that have been expressed by some interest groups.  The Minister absolutely agrees that independent critique is very important and the various budget announcements are in no way intended to reduce the scope for such work.  In the case of poverty, the function of independent reporting is no longer as dependent on the Combat Poverty Agency as it was in earlier years.  This is due, for example, to the emergence of other independent data sources such as the statistics on poverty reported by the Central Statistics Office, and independent analysis by bodies such as the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council in this country and on the international front by the EU and OECD.  Ireland is also well served by the social partners and a wide range of non-governmental organisations as well as by both Houses of the Oireachtas, where Deputies and Senators frequently raise social inclusion issues.  There are many voices ensuring that those who are socially excluded have a voice.  The Senator represents them quite well in this House as well.</P>
        <P>The Minister and other members of the Government are keenly aware of the difficulties facing the marginalised and vulnerable in society.  For this reason in 2009 the Department will retain funding under the disability Vote and the civil legal aid Vote close to what it was in 2008.  The Minister assures the House that the Government is committed to helping all citizens in these difficult times.  His officials have met with both the Equality Authority and the Irish <Col N="227"/>Human Rights Commission and he is available to meet with both bodies to discuss issues of concern to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sorry a decent Minister of State has been entrusted with such a squalid and disgraceful reply, which is riddled with intellectual holes.  The Minister of State said civil servants are accustomed to changes of role within an organisation.  That is a most extraordinary insult to the professionalism and expertise of such people.  I have never heard anything like it.  Are they dumbbells that can be switched around willy nilly all over the place?  Is there no professional expertise?  Have they no qualifications?  That is plain nonsense.  I do not believe this is the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion.  I believe this is some of the apparatchiks sticking the knife into organisations which have raised serious questions.  With regard to the anti-ageing measures, the recipients are a very easy target and it is a classic tactic.  It would be interesting news for Senator Mary White of the Minister of State&rsquo;s own party.  These issues, to adapt Mr. Gerry Adams, will not go away, you know.  There are those of us, not only on the Opposition side of the House, committed to ensuring the Government does not get away with this, the nastiest trick of all, and especially cutbacks in the public relations area.  I remember, as possibly does the Minister of State, as I believe he was in the House at that time, when a previous administration cut back on citizens&rsquo; information services.  The reason behind this was that the Government said people already had rights, but it destroyed their capacity to exercise those rights.</P>
        <P>With regard to savings on buildings, on numerous occasions in the past year I informed the House of  buildings throughout the city which were empty, but nothing was done about it.  The Government is not fooling anybody and it is a shame that it should behave in this way, attacking the most vulnerable people in our society.  It will come back to haunt this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>

	<P>In the context of decentralisation, those in the Civil Service in general change roles within an organisation.  They do not simply enter a silo and stay there for an entire career.  Civil servants move within and among Departments.  This is good for corporate knowledge and the transfer of knowledge from one Department to another and it is admirable in the Civil Service.  It is a very adaptable organisation and well capable of transferring and providing the facilities and the services to those who need them most.  I suggest the Civil Service is capable of doing this as it has shown in many other decentralised locations throughout the country.  I will relay to the Government other issues the Senator raised, but I emphasise again that the relevant Minister has met with the organisations and has said he is available to meet them again, and could meet others which may have concerns in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to hear the Minister will meet these organisations, but I do not accept the point with regard to the professionalism of people and moving them around, and neither do the bodies concerned.  They know expertise is picked up in this way.  That assertion does not work.  It might have a small chance of working had we not seen in the case of the Equality Authority the way in which the Government deliberately turned its face against the decisions of the body, established by it, and reversed that body&rsquo;s decisions.  It was an astonishing <i>volte-face</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter on behalf of draft net fishermen who fish the River Foyle in County Donegal.  Licences in the draft net fishery on the tidal River Foyle are applied for annually and are, therefore, not owned or traded.  I understand from anecdotal evidence that there are approximately 50 draft net fishermen who have fished the River Foyle on the upper stretch alone.  Approximately 40 of these availed of the buy-out or hardship package available and the remaining ten men continued to fish.  However, my grievance is on behalf of approximately 15 licence holders or fishermen who were refused licences.  Most are elderly and some are pensioners who have fished this stretch throughout the years during very difficult times.  They were refused licences by the Loughs Agency in Derry, which is responsible for that fishery.  Why were the fishermen not properly consulted when the guidelines on the dispersal of the licences were being drawn up?</P>
        <P>I refer to the hardship package.  This package was compiled and specifically designed to facilitate a diversification of effort from commercial salmon fishing to other activities.  The hardship package developed for the Foyle area had two fundamental pillars.  It would be made available only on a voluntary basis in the draft net fishery to those who would have qualified for a licence in the 2007 season.  However, several of those fishermen did not qualify in the 2007 season and the reasons were not properly explained to them.  They were not consulted prior to the refusal of a licence and this is the nature of their query.</P>
        <P>Fishermen were refused in two areas.  New applicants in 2007 were refused under the scheme because they did not have a history of fishing.  In addition, licences were refused for previous licence holders who according to section 4c of the regulations had not fished for reasons covered under points 3 to 5 of the regulations, or whose nets were operated by an unapproved senior helper.  Such people would, in previous years, have been considered for approval.  Let us consider points 3 to 5 which refer to people with chronic illnesses, or people with unapproved senior helpers.  These so-called unapproved senior helpers had been fishing that fishery previously without question, so why were they being refused in 2007?  These questions have been raised by fishermen in recent years and, more recently, with me.</P>
        <P>It is important to raise the matter in the House because the Government provided financial assistance to the Loughs Agency for the compensation package.  How much assistance was provided by it?  While the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, may not have the answers tonight, I would be glad to wait until the answers are provided.  How much money or funding is left in the compensation package and has not been dispersed to the fishermen who have fished there for more than 60 years?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consult with the Loughs Agency to begin a process of negotiation with the affected fishermen, to allow their grievances to be heard, because they clearly feel they have been wronged.  They are fishermen of this jurisdiction and they believe they have been wronged by the Loughs Agency which is based in Derry city in the North.  Will the Government consult with the Loughs Agency and clearly outline to it that the fishermen I represent are not happy, and that a mechanism for listening to the concerns of those fishermen should be established?  Will the Government seek to find a mechanism either to allow the fishermen to continue to fish, or allow them to avail of the hardship package?  It is wrong that such fishermen who have been fishing there for more than 60 years cannot avail of such a package.  The fishermen have many questions.  While I am not an expert in relaying some of their queries, I do so tonight to the best of my ability in the hope that we can provide the answers the fishermen seek.</P><Col N="229"/>
        <P>I recognise the Minister will listen and I appreciate that he may not have the specific answers tonight.  I would be happy to wait for those responses, as would the fishermen.  I hope we can bring clarity and a conclusion to this matter which is frustrating to the community in Lifford and St. Johnston.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this matter.  I am pleased to provide as much information as possible.  If there are particular issues raised by the Senator to which I cannot respond tonight, I would be please to follow up on the matter.</P>
        <P>In May 2007, approval was given by the North-South Ministerial Council for the introduction of salmon conservation measures to be administered by the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The agency is a North-South body established under the British Irish Agreement Acts, responsible for, among other things, the protection and conservation of inland fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.</P>
        <P>Regulations agreed by the North-South Ministerial Council provided the Loughs Agency with the necessary powers to manage wild salmon stocks in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, in compliance with the EU habitats directive and the recommendations of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation.  Recognising the impact that cessation of the mixed stock fishery at sea would have on traditional salmon fishermen, approval was also given for a hardship scheme for former drift and draft net licence holders who were active between 2002 and 2006.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Commercial salmon fishing has traditionally involved the use of drift and draft nets.  Drift net fisheries have operated in the Foyle area and in the area seaward of Lough Foyle.  Draft net activity has been concentrated in recent years in the tidal River Foyle, between Derry and Strabane.  As the stocks exploited seawards of Lough Foyle are mixed and include stock from rivers not achieving their conservation limits, the agency introduced regulations to prohibit fishing of salmon in this area.  The stocks exploited in the Foyle by the commercial fishery had previously been achieving their conservation limits, but were unlikely to continue to do so if a rationalisation of the fishing effort was not achieved.  In 2006, evidence indicated that a rationalisation was necessary for stock levels to continue to meet conservation limits and for the future viability of the commercial fishery.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Loughs Agency, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, introduced a hardship package for salmon fishermen no longer able to fish in the drift net fishery.  The scheme was extended, on a voluntary basis, to the existing draft net fishery operators who fished their licences in 2006.  The salmon hardship scheme was intended to provide a measure of relief to individual licence holders in line with the degree of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of salmon fishing arising from the closure of the interceptory fishery seaward of Lough Foyle.</P>
        <P>Payments under the scheme were calculated on the basis of the average catch of the individual licensee between 2002 and 2006, as declared in catch returns.  The value to the licensee of these fish after expenditure on fishing operations was calculated at &euro;24.50 per salmon.  The licensee&rsquo;s hardship payment equates to five times the average catch multiplied by this value per fish.  In recognition of the investment that fishermen have made in fishing gear, an additional sum of six times the value of the 2007 licence fee was also paid.</P>
        <P>To qualify for payment under this scheme, therefore, applicants would have had to have been awarded a licence between 2002 and 2006 and have operated in the fishery themselves as <Col N="230"/>licence holders.  Payments would only be made once the fishermen had signed an undertaking that they would not apply for a licence again and that their fishing gear had been decommissioned in a certified manner.</P>
        <P>The scheme is funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.  State aid approval was obtained for the scheme from the European Commission.  There were 130 successful applications under the Loughs Agency scheme consisting of 90 former drift net licensees and 40 former draft net licensees.  A number of applications were unsuccessful as they did not meet the eligibility criteria because they were unable to show evidence of active fishing between 2002 and 2006.  The total cost of the scheme administered by the Loughs Agency is expected to be around &euro;3.8 million.  A total of &euro;3.2 million has been paid to date, of which 50% was Exchequer funded.  The remaining &euro;600,000 will be paid out in 2009.  The number of drift nets that operated in the Foyle area has been reduced from 112 to 18 and the number of draft nets which operated within the lough and River Foyle decreased from 50 to 12.  The management and operation of the wild salmon fishery in Lough Foyle is now consistent with the habitats directive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He has answered two of my three questions.  Can he engage with his Department to get the Loughs Agency to discuss the concerns of the local fishermen?  I am not sure if that is possible but it is vital and the fishermen feel the same way.  I would like to see some consultation initiated so that we could listen to the concerns of the fishermen affected who feel that they have been wronged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>There are always qualifying criteria to any scheme.  It is only natural that those who do not meet the criteria will feel disappointed.  In view of what the Senator said, I will be happy to consult officials in my Department and get back to him.</P>
