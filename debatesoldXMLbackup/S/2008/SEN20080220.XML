	<P>I have notice from Senator John Ellis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position with regard to the provision of a community hospital-primary care centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Education and Science to make a statement on the urgent need for the provision of a new national school at Ballintemple national school, Crab Lane, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to clarify the efforts being made at North-South Ministerial Council level to advance an all-Ireland train service, particularly the upgrading of the Derry to Coleraine section of the Derry to Dublin line.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to commit formally to a plan to develop a rail line from Sligo to the city of Derry, creating an all-Ireland rail loop.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to provide funding to prevent the imminent collapse of one of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest national cultural institutions, the Feis Ceoil.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators John Ellis, Jerry Buttimer, Cecilia Keaveney and Pearse Doherty as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised <Col N="950"/>Senators John Ellis, Jerry Buttimer and Cecilia Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Pearse Doherty may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.  I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator David Norris as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Control of Exports Bill 2007 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il</i>] &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, statements regarding the reports of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on violent incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland, to be taken at 12.15 p.m. and to conclude not later than 2.15 p.m., if not previously concluded, with spokespersons having 12 minutes, other Senators having eight minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 3, statements on forestry, to commence at 2.45 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes, other Senators having eight minutes, on which Senators may share time, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end for concluding comments; and No. 16, motion 34 re economic outlook, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3.  The business of the House is to be interrupted between 2.15 p.m. and 2.45 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss the pharmacy dispute.  A deadline of 1 March has been set for changes to the contracts.  When I asked for this debate last week, I noted Senator Feeney felt we should keep it in the health committee.  I note from reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers, however, that there seems to be much disquiet in Fianna F&aacute;il about this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are raising the issues I brought up, that the deadline be taken away and an independent arbitrator appointed to deal with the issues before 1 March.</P>

	<P>And Fianna F&aacute;il Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, like everyone, are unhappy about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Senator Fitzgerald on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="951"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the Minister for Health and Children attends the House.  Many Senators, such as Senator Ross, have asked for this.  There should be a debate to hear why the Minister is sticking to the deadline of 1 March and why preconditions are being imposed on the pharmacists.  I will move an amendment to the Order of Business to ensure this happens.</P>
        <P>Many Members will have seen a recent television report on a unique course in Trinity College Dublin.  We often speak about what is wrong with institutions, political and social life and the special needs of people with a disability.  It was encouraging to see 19 students graduate from Trinity College Dublin with a certificate in contemporary living.  It was the first class to graduate in a pioneering university course for people with intellectual disabilities.  I offer congratulations to all the graduates, their families and their lecturers and pay tribute to Trinity College for leading the way with such an innovative course.  It is marvellous to see young people who in the past would not even have got to primary or secondary school graduating from a special course in Trinity College that was set up and designed specifically for them.  This is a welcome step given the serious difficulties still faced by many youngsters in obtaining resources, a problem which we have highlighted recently in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  It is a real good news story which is worthy of congratulations from this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Tomorrow&rsquo;s debate on education for persons with special educational needs should raise a number of interesting issues.  In the lead-up to this, however, we should recognise the story in last night&rsquo;s news of an empty school facility for autistic children and an autistic child who cannot get in.  The school in question has stated that the facility cannot open owing to a lack of therapists but the Minister argued that the school should enrol the child for educational purposes only.  We must add to this to the fact the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family is facing bankruptcy because of having to go through an appeal in the courts.  I was happy to praise the Minister for Education and Science yesterday for what she has done.  However, there is a simple answer to this.  The reason the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins are facing bankruptcy and the reason there are empty classrooms in Castleknock is very simple.  It is that the Minister has not yet commenced certain provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</P>
        <P>Every speaker tomorrow should ask the Minister to explain herself.  They should simply ask one question.  Why has she not commenced the relevant sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which has been approved by both Houses and signed into law by the Government and which would solve all <Col N="952"/>these problems?  If this was done there no longer would be an argument.  These sections would decide the matter of therapists and education and the question of the appeals structure.  Parents would have the right to appeal at every level.  The Act provides for appeals, assessment, resources and implementation.  It is all in it.  This Act was welcomed on all sides in both Houses.  I ask that we do not let tomorrow&rsquo;s debate fall into simple political division.  Senators on both sides should ask the Minister why she has not done what we asked her to do and commenced the Act.  It has not been done.  I ask that the debate be focused on that point.  No one needs to justify anything beyond that.  The debate should be allowed to continue for as long as necessary because there are many speakers in every group who wish to speak on this issue.</P>
        <P>On a lighter note, people will be aware there has been a tourist debacle in Cork with the exposure of the story about the Blarney Stone.  It would appear that people in Cork have been carrying out unscrupulous fraud.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has kissed one of them anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Vulnerable tourists, naive native holidaymakers and innocent Kerry people have been defrauded.  I ask that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism come to the House and tell Senators the truth about the Blarney Stone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Before Christmas emergency legislation was introduced in this House by the Minister for Health and Children to deal with the Attorney General&rsquo;s concerns about the constitutional status of various bodies.  I am not sure whether assurances were given, but I and many of my colleagues had an understanding that this type of approach to legislation would not be repeated except <i>in extremis</i>.  There is a report in today&rsquo;s newspapers, however, of an intention on the part of the Government to introduce a Bill in the House next week to do the same thing for bodies set up under local government legislation.  Interestingly, it seems we find out what happens in these Houses in <i>The Irish Times</i> and on RTE rather than in the House.  The newspapers report that not only is it intended to introduce this legislation but that it is expected to pass all Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad by the end of next week.</P>
        <P>Journalists do not always get things right, but I ask the Leader to confirm to the House whether it is intended to introduce this legislation next week.  If this is the case will he explain why there was no mention of such emergency legislation when a question was raised yesterday about next week&rsquo;s business, as often occurs?  I ask this question tentatively and without any intention to criti<Col N="953"/>cise the Leader or anyone else.  I expect he was not aware of the legislation.  If this is the case, what is the state of affairs in these Houses when the newspapers know before the Members what legislation is to be introduced and passed on all Stages?  Where does that leave any debate about the relevance of these Houses?  I would like a direct answer to this question from the Leader.</P>
        <P>I wish to pick up on a related matter mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald about the ongoing debate and concerns among Fianna F&aacute;il and other Government party Senators and Deputies in respect of various issues of public controversy.  I respectfully say to the House that it is wrong that public debate is shifting, as appears to be the case, from these Houses to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Those opposite may groan but they will say something different to me outside in a few minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of parliamentary party meetings is not relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is pathetic.  We are not allowed to speak or discuss anything now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is relevant.  The Senators opposite can have all the din and shouting they want, but I will finish my point.  I have been told by my colleagues opposite on more than one occasion, for example, in the matter of the child care subvention scheme, not to waste my breath in the House as the issue would be solved by the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly the reaction I expected.  This is the position we have come to in these Houses.  The Government abrogates the role and functions of these Houses and transfers them behind closed doors to smoke-filled rooms where people clap each other on the back because they, and not the Members of these Houses, have the power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.  There are very few smoke-filled rooms now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader once again, if I can beg his patience, to liaise with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, for two reasons.  First, I wish to congratulate her on her recent success in carrying out in-depth negotiations with the Euro<Col N="954"/>pean Commissioner in the matter of speedy transfer of rural environment protection scheme payments to those farmers on REPS 2 and 3.  Those negotiations have been concluded and I understand the payments are being processed as we speak.  Approximately 6,000 farmers will receive their payments by post soon.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Leader ask the Minister to carry on in this vein and secure a similar commitment for those farmers in the REP 4 scheme.  There has been a suggestion that their payments may be lumped in with the end of year single farm support payment.  The farmers in REPS 4 will face a cash flow crisis if they receive all their off-farm income in one single payment at the end of the year.  I ask the Leader to ensure the negotiations continue<b> </b>to allow two separate payments to occur during the calendar year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the proposal of Senator Frances Fitzgerald.  This so-called independent body which is to be appointed to deal with the issue of pharmacists&rsquo; fees is not really independent, as we know, and the end result is predetermined.  We also know there was no consultation with the pharmacists on the terms of reference.  In fact, it was a unilateral action which was in essence a breach of contract.  I strongly support everything Senator Fitzgerald has said.</P>
        <P>We learned this morning of the loss of two of our rare white-tailed sea eagles in Killarney.  This is a sad occurrence and a blow to our tourism industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it is.  I share the disappointment of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, Dr. Allen Mee, everyone in the national parks and wildlife service, and everybody associated with Irish tourism.  These birds were absent for more than 100 years.  The Minister came to Killarney to release these chicks into the wild last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not funny.  Come on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators are laughing, but it is a serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Senator Coghlan to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This was a great boon to our tourism industry.  They are a most majestic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?  We could discuss this issue if he agrees.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="955"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The sea eagle is a most majestic bird in flight.  I would love Members to come down to Dundag Bay with me, go across Muckross Lake to Brickeen Bridge, out into Lough Leane and over to the shores of Glena under the eagles&rsquo; nest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I appreciate what the Cathaoirleach is saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator appreciates what I am saying he should obey what I say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want people to appreciate how important and serious this matter is for tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Blarney Stone?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in a neighbouring county.  Indiscriminate poisoning is no longer acceptable.  I accept that this was possibly an inadvertent occurrence but an educational process is required here.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coghlan has made his point.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is wonderful support for this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the Senator considerable latitude on this.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Leader and I could have a word about how we might improve the educational aspects  in respect of this wonderful project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, many Senators spoke about the role of the Seanad, the portrayal by the media of it as irrelevant and the slant put on it over the weekend.  I also raised the leadership role this Chamber can play in respect of why we should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the EU reform treaty.  Over the weekend, two major organisations overwhelmingly came out in support of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, based on business and farming perspectives.  We have a golden opportunity to set out our platform and relay to the public why it should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in this referendum.  </P>
        <P>I hope the media will take note that we are doing very well in this Chamber and are raising issues.  We want to be noted in that fashion rather than in the negative way that has been depicted over the past few weeks, including last weekend.  I was offended at being classed as a non-person in this Chamber and I would like the media to take note of that.  We want to play a leadership <Col N="956"/>role and I would like the media to take note, be present and to listen to our debates.  Many fine debates take place across the floor on many issues, yet while they are not reported the negative approach taken by the media, of the kind we saw over the weekend, prevails.  I was offended by it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Just after the August bank holiday weekend last summer, an announcement was made about decisions made by Aer Lingus in respect of Shannon Airport.  The people of Shannon and the west received a considerable amount of sympathy from all of us around the country because of the problems they would face.  What happened last weekend?  The airport closed for a small number of hours because of the actions of a small group of people.  Perhaps they did so to hold passengers to ransom to achieve their own objectives.  There are other ways of achieving those objectives through normal procedures.  Those procedures have not been adopted.  </P>
        <P>We must remind those people in business and elsewhere, particularly if they are paid by the State, that we in a competitive marketplace.  Shannon is in competition with Frankfurt, London, Paris and everywhere else.  It is a bad idea for us to close the airport on a regular or even irregular basis for selfish intentions.  There are procedures to be used and they should be.  Let us make sure that we do not go back to the position we were in during the 1980s &mdash; the days of strikes where there were no procedures before social partnership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I start by thanking the Cathaoirleach for letting me raise the issue of the cross-Border train service on the Adjournment today.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss that on the Adjournment.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I said this is because I might not have needed to raise it on the Adjournment if we received reports from North-South Ministerial Council meetings.  I ask the Leader to find out whether Ministers can come in here after meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council to explain what has gone on and the progress that has been made.  A considerable amount of activity is going on, many problems are being solved and many issues are being progressed but there are a number of issues which are either not on the table or are not being presented as much as they could be.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps the Leader might ask whether there is much of a move in respect of having all-Ireland health promotion campaigns.  This Friday is Lollipop Day, which aims to raise awareness of oesophageal cancer.  I declare my interest in this subject because my father died of oesophageal <Col N="957"/>cancer.  It is now seen as a disease affecting young people, particularly young women.  Therefore, if individual groups are producing awareness campaigns, we should support them by running such campaigns at not merely a Government level but an all-island level.  Will there be any progress in respect of not just oesophageal cancer awareness but all forms of health awareness?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the request from other Senators for a debate here on the Lisbon treaty.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which some Senators are members, is in the final stages of producing a report on the views of the different social partners on the treaty.  That report is due to be published next week.  I suggest to the Leader that one of the ways in which we might have an informed and quality debate on the Lisbon treaty is by consideration of the report and by inviting some of the people who have contributed to the development of it to the House.  Undoubtedly, the views of organisations like the IFA and ISME will play a considerable role in influencing how the people of Ireland vote on the treaty.  We have a report that captures some of the issues they believe are important.  It behoves this Chamber to debate this report and give our input into it.</P>
        <P>Another matter that will be very important to the future of our country and which we continually touch upon is the question of how we develop and stimulate economic growth.  Frequently, when we discuss this issue, we talk about the mantra of research and development and innovation.  Yesterday, we saw the publication by the Minister for Education and Science of the strategic innovation fund to stimulate that kind of work in our third-level institutions.  It was remarkable that the publication of the detail of the plan came after the publication of a letter from all of the universities to the Minister expressing their frustration with the way the report and plan were progressing.  I call on the Leader to organise a debate on how we are carrying out this research in Ireland to ensure that money is well spent and that it does not replicate private money already spent in these areas.</P>
        <P>I repeat a request I made last week for a debate in this House on how we deal with homelessness in this city and people with chronic alcohol and drug issues.  There is no more distressing sight than walking across our city and seeing people who are inebriated or have drug problems who have prams with young children in them.  What hope do those children have and how can our society help and intervene, given that, unfortunately, their parents might not be able to do this?  Last week, I raised the issue of a centre that was designed to deal with these issues but which will be vacant this summer because the HSE cannot provide the funding to deal with it.  We are letting <Col N="958"/>ourselves and the city down by not dealing with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Donohoe in respect of the request I made last week about a rolling debate on the EU reform treaty.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to wish our troops every success in their mission in Chad.  It is a dangerous mission but is under the control of the EU and supported by a UN resolution.  There are 400,000 refugees in camps in eastern Chad, most of whom have fled from Darfur.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to our courageous troops who are travelling there this evening.  I wish them a safe journey and a safe return after fulfilling their mission.  They will be leading a major deployment of Irish troops in that region.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A debate on the EU reform treaty would be very worthwhile at this very early stage.  People talk about neutrality but that was clearly identified in the referendum in October 2002 when we inserted into the Constitution a clause which states that Ireland could not join a common European defence arrangement unless a specific and separate referendum was held.  Unfortunately, a number of the anti-reform treaty personnel are bringing out these old arguments to try to defeat this treaty.  This House would serve a great purpose by having a detailed debate about the proposal put forward by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, which will outline our views after receiving a large number of submissions.  That could be the basis for a debate in the House next week if possible.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come into the House to discuss the availability of adolescent psychiatric beds?  I understand only 12 beds are available in St. John of God services, with 38 people on the waiting list, but the nature of the illness does not allow for a timeframe in which they might require hospitalisation.  There are no psychiatric beds for adolescents in the south east and very few beds elsewhere throughout the country.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the Garda on its action at the weekend in introducing checks for drugs at some of its checkpoints for alcohol.  That is a welcome move and something on which this House should compliment the Garda.  I have raised that question here on a number of <Col N="959"/>occasions and I am delighted the Garda has now taken action on it.  The Garda should also consider the possibility of introducing more sniffer dogs at entrances to nightclubs and other venues to try to deal with the drugs problem.  We know the problem exists and sniffer dogs are probably the most effective weapon available to the Garda.  Random police patrols in Scotland use sniffer dogs to try to identify people who are either carrying drugs or have been in contact with drugs.</P>

	<P>As we are an island nation I call for a debate on the role of our commercial ports and the way they can contribute to both our regional and national economies.  They are access and egress points for major imports and exports and it is important we would have a debate on their role and resources to determine how they will contribute to the economy in the future.  There are initiatives such as the Gateway innovation fund and we need to know how the ports will be resourced through those initiatives.  We also need to know how they will fit in to the national spatial strategy, the way the Government proposes to roll out the resourcing and the implementation of our ports and how that will fit in to our national development plan.  I call for a debate on that because this is an important issue for the entire country.  Belview Port in the south east is a major international port but it must be continuously resourced.  We must exploit the full potential of our ports to ensure the economy remains strong in the future.</P>

	<P>I join with other Senators in highlighting the importance of this House facilitating a comprehensive debate on the Lisbon treaty.  Like other Senators, I am a member of the European Affairs committee which is in the process of finalising the stages of a first report examining all aspects of the treaty and reflecting the views of the groups that have come before the committee.  If we are considering inviting some of these groups to address the Seanad directly I ask that we would consider inviting some of the people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to address us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I was the butt of one of those pieces and I sent the journalist a short e-mail yesterday saying I did not know he was writing for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  The way to deal with this is not to respond in a sensitive way if we are confident about what we are doing.  The point that should be made, and this is where I part from Senator Ormonde, is that perhaps some of those criticisms are right.  It does not seem to have occurred to anybody in this House that perhaps some of the people who say we are a group of old dinosaurs and fossils are right because we are not relevant enough.  I do not understand why we should not take that on board.  Senator Fitzgerald pointed to that earlier with her amendment calling for a discussion on the pharmacists.

That is crazy and if someone from the press tells us we are irrelevant and that we cannot even discuss the pharmacy sector, he is right.

	<P>There is one procedure in this House which does work in terms of bringing in Ministers, namely, the Adjournment but that takes place at the end of the day when nobody notices anything happening.  The only time pharmacists have been debated in this House is when the Minister, Deputy Harney, came here to reply to my Adjournment matter.  She gave me a ticking off for raising the pharmacy sector in this House but she came here and discussed it.  We have that sort of debate late at night when nobody is listening and the members of the press are not here.</P>

	<P>It is no coincidence that some of those very relevant issues, including autism, which we will debate tomorrow &mdash; I thank the Leader for allowing time for a debate on autism, which is a major improvement &mdash; the pharmacies and adoption of foreign children, which I raised last night, end with the Health Service Executive.  It would be relevant if we debated not only the Lisbon treaty, which is a good point, but also the HSE, which appears to be a blockage in the progress of so many people&rsquo;s lives and on so many issues.  If we are bringing people into the House to debate the Lisbon treaty, why do we not invite the representatives of the HSE and put them under scrutiny because it is relevant and it would make us more relevant?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Homelessness in the city has been mentioned in the House, an issue about which we are all concerned.  Great work is being done with vulnerable people with addiction problems, particularly alcohol and drugs, and so-called wet houses have been opened to try to accommodate them but these are complex issues.  I pay tribute to the people involved in the services, particularly the out-reach workers on the street who not just offer these people a bed but appropriate support services.  Excellent work is being done in this area and it is important that the House would record what is being done in this city.</P>
        <P>I recently received a letter from the city manager confirming to me that he is satisfied he has a bed for every person who is homeless in the city but they are not being utilised.  I concur with the view that we should have a debate on the issue and the appropriate players, the HSE and Dublin City Council, should be invited here to consider how we can ensure better co-ordination and collation of the services available which are not being utilised.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the points made by Senator Ross and others.  Senator Ross might recall that I raised the issue of the HSE some months ago when I said I had certain concerns but I was advised that it was a matter for the joint committee.  I still have concerns about the HSE.  I support the view expressed by Senator <Col N="962"/>Fitzgerald that we should afford the Minister, Deputy Harney, the opportunity to come before the Seanad on the pharmacy issue if that is the appropriate course of action.  I have been advised in the past that it is not and that it is a matter for the joint committee but if it is possible to have the Minister attend the House I suggest we do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Equally, we should afford the Leader appropriate time to contact to the Minister, Deputy Harney, to see if she is available to appear in the Seanad.  There is no point in her appearing here alone.  The pharmacy matter has been delegated to the HSE.</P>

	<P>The HSE has been in consultation with the Department of Finance regarding the budget.  The other important player is the IPU.  If we are to have a full, open and fair debate on the pharmacy issue, we should have a round table meeting with the Minister for Health and Children, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance, the HSE and the IPU.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to obtain clarification on the contract that applies to the GMS and community drug schemes.  Is the HSE proposing that new contracts will apply from 1 March?  What mechanism is proposed to apply the planned reduction in wholesale margins to community pharmacists?  What is proposed does not add up and will not work.</P>

	<P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business.  This Chamber must debate the matter today.  I listened to Senator Kelly&rsquo;s comments on time and space.  This issue has been brewing since September and is not a new issue.  When I sought a debate on this last September I was told to raise it when the Minister was debating another issue.  I did so but we continually called for debates.  This is the second proposed amendment to the Order of Business to propose that the Minister comes to the House to answer these questions.  Senators are aware of the implication if this is concluded &mdash; rural pharmacies will close down.</P>

        <P>Many remarks were made in the Chamber yesterday about the wider public perception of the Senate.  We must bear some of the blame in this respect.  We must examine how we do business.  Last week I sought a discussion on collusion and asked that, instead of statements on collusion that have already taken place in the D&aacute;il and with which many parties were dissatisfied, we would have an all-party motion.  The Leader informed me that this would be raised with party leaders on Tuesday.  Today, the discussion on collusion will take the form of statements.  If we are serious about being more than a talking shop, notwithstanding the fact that some Members are pleased at that, let us agree an all-party motion on collusion.  The issue affects 50 people, killed in this State as a direct consequence of collusion between British paramilitaries and British state forces.</P>

	<P>I join with Senator Fitzgerald in congratulating Trinity College on the excellent work done in awarding certificates to those with intellectual disability.  Perhaps we should call on all third level institutions to follow suit.  Institutes of technology could do work with people who are vulnerable and who may enjoy this after second level education finishes.  </P>
        <P>Last week I raised the impasse between the HSE and the IPU.  There are no unhappy campers in the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  To the contrary, last night I saw they were all happy campers.  We had an open and frank discussion on the impasse, which is where Fianna F&aacute;il and Government Senators would debate such pressing matters.  We are working to find a solution.  If that does not happen in Fine Gael or the Labour Party, that is not our fault.

        <P>I support the call made by Senator Prendergast for a debate on adolescent psychiatry, taking in all aspects of eating disorders.  This group does not have a strong lobby and is made up of vulnerable people.  Sometimes they deal with issues of life and death, issues I would like to discuss.  I have no objection to discussing what is taking place.  I have no idea why Senator Ross suggests we will not be allowed a debate.  I agree that autism, adoption and child and adolescent psychiatry are equally important as this issues.  Let us invite the Minister so that we can deal with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment.  With regard to the debate on the Seanad, I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on how Ireland celebrates St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  At a time when alcohol use has become more prevalent and the perception of the Irish abroad is of an alcohol consuming society, given that the Government has extended St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to a festival it is important that we debate how we celebrate our national day.  It is important to send the signal to Irish people at home and across the world that we are proud of our heritage, which is not just about the consumption of alcohol.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Ross on the relevance of this Chamber.  It ill behoves Members that we see reports in the newspaper that Fianna F&aacute;il Members are asking to meet the Minister.  This is the House of the Oireachtas and there should be accountability here.</P>

They cost four times more than in other EU member states and the world market.  An investigation should take place and we should debate this to see if there is price fixing.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago I called on the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food to the Seanad to discuss REPS.  In light of her recent success in Brussels in getting REPS 2 and 3 payments restored to what they were, this is an ideal opportunity to invite her to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider giving an hour, for example, next week to No. 35, a motion in the name of the Independent Senators with regard to banning landmines and cluster munitions.  It is appropriate in light of the forthcoming conference.  I proposed a slightly expanded version of this in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and it was passed unanimously.  Everyone, therefore, ought to be able to agree to it.  It would take only an hour and it is something practical we could do.</P>
        <P>In light of the fact that former Zambian President Frederick Chiluba is standing trial on charges of malfeasance and stealing $488,000 in public funds, is at the centre of attempts by the Zambian Government to recover $58 million that he and 19 other people salted away in banks throughout the world and, when president of Zambia between 1991 and 2001, routinely turned up in Iveagh House to express his gratitude and accept a cheque for development in his country, would it be possible to ascertain how much of the money, if any, paid by Irish taxpayers went into his Zambian pocket?</P>
        <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling that my motion on the Feis Ceoil is out of order but it is astonishing the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has no responsibility for one of the oldest and most internationally distinguished cultural festivals in this country.  Will the Leader raise this with the Minister and find out if it is possible to get funding?  It would be a disgrace if this splendid festival disappeared.</P>
        <P>I was surprised that there was a certain amount of jocularity when the death of the eagles in Kerry was raised.  This is a significant matter.  If it was caused by poison, as appears might be the case, this disgraces us in the international community.  We are always bleating in the House about the environment, ecology, animal welfare and so forth but last week some Members were proposing congratulations for the coursing industry.  Do we really care about the welfare of animals?  It is not a joking matter.  We have a responsibility to the other creatures on this planet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Health and Children on the <Col N="966"/>issue of stem cell research.  I note that the first adult stem cell clinic in Europe has opened in Germany.  To date the only significant progress in this area of research has come from adult stem cells.  The debate on the need for embryonic stem cells is well past as adult stem cells have proven to have the pluripotent nature required.  Previously, requests were made in the House that the Minister make Ireland a centre for biotechnology and adult stem cell research and development.  They were not taken up at the time.  I fear Ireland might begin to lag behind in this area and we now have a golden opportunity to pursue it.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the possibility of the prices being paid by supermarkets to the farming community being put under the remit of an ombudsman, as occurs in the UK?  In Ireland at present the price paid to farmers producing potatoes is one fifth of the shelf price of potatoes.  What added value is there in putting potatoes into a plastic bag and selling them?  Someone is running the market and ensuring it is paying the retailer and not the producer.  That is not right when so many farmers in the potato industry are going, and have gone, out of business.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to discuss indigenous business?  It was very sad last Friday to hear the announcement of the 500 redundancies in Arnotts, a company that has provided fantastic service in our capital city for many years.  Some of the employees had worked for 30 years in Arnotts.  This will change the face of shopping in Dublin.  It will disturb Moore Street.  Boyers will be closed too.  In the past six months it has been announced that other landmarks in our capital city such as the Berkeley Court, the Burlington and Jurys Hotel are to go.  Do we want our capital city to look the same as every other capital city, with the same high street shopping as other foreign capitals?  This issue warrants debate.  I accept we must be competitive and that the Arnotts trustees must make money but this issue is not just about money.  It is also about the social side of our country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the views expressed by Senator Norris regarding the Feis Ceoil.  He correctly pointed out that it is one of the oldest and perhaps most impressive cultural institutions on the island at present.  The Arts Council appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in recent weeks and the council responded quite generously to the committee&rsquo;s debate.  There was a general consensus that the Arts Council needs to focus on community-based events that are largely reliant on volunteerism.  Events such as the Dublin Feis Ceoil provide a platform for young artists.  Indeed, many of the household names in the arts <Col N="967"/>today will at some stage have had a connection with the Feis Ceoil.  The Arts Council has received almost &euro;80 million from the Government and it should get involved with this.  It would be very sad to lose that event.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the Senator&rsquo;s views on the death of the two eagles.  I was particularly disappointed when I saw the photograph in the newspaper today.  I applaud Senator Coghlan for raising this issue.  I recall there was quite a celebration when the chicks were put into the wild.  As a nation, we have always had respect for our wildlife, which is a huge tourist attraction.  I will be surprised if this bad news does not spread outside Ireland and is not picked up in other countries.  It will not impact positively.  If anyone deliberately did this, they are helping no one and are certainly not helping Ireland.</P>

	<P>Members will share my disquiet that the issue of blood is once again controversially in the news with the report that a stolen laptop in New York contained the blood records of 171,000 Irish people.  This raises the need for a debate about information technology, its potential and the risks attached to the information society in which we live.  Obviously there is legislation in this area but we must discuss how to protect people&rsquo;s data.  There is also the issue of whether such data should be carried around in a laptop in the first place.  When I read that such data are supposedly securely encrypted, I am even more concerned.</P>

The <Col N="968"/>request has been made and we await confirmation of an opening in her diary to enable this to happen.  On the two occasions before Christmas when we invited the Minister to the House, she made herself available at very short notice and gave the Members a comprehensive report on the up-to-date position of the HSE matters under discussion.  I am confident that if her diary can facilitate it, the Minister will come to the House.  All the matters raised this morning can be discussed with her.

        <P>I join with Senators Fitzgerald and Feeney in offering congratulations to the students in Trinity College on this exciting development where the abilities of these students are being recognised and acknowledged.  I wish to be associated with the congratulations offered to them here today.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole expressed his views on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, coming to the House tomorrow.  There is much interest from all sides of the House in this matter and I have no difficulty in this business being rolled over for next week, with the agreement of the House tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White inquired about the new emergency Bill referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  As the Government&rsquo;s representative in the House, I take my instructions from the Government meeting on Tuesday morning or from the meeting of the Whips.  The meeting of the Whips this week takes place this evening and we are awaiting a response on the matter into which Senator Alex White is inquiring.  At present, I do not have an instruction.  When I have one, I will come back to the House first thing in the morning.  My office will contact the leaders of the various parties and groups in this House to update them on the position on that legislation as soon as I am informed.</P>
        <P>Mention was made of the power of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party.  This has always been the case, it is not a new dimension.  As has been <Col N="969"/>stated, the strength of the good backbencher attending such party meetings is to bring the views of the grassroots, the rank and file and of the people we represent, not only in the city of Dublin but all over Ireland.</P>

	<P>Senators Cannon and Carty offered their congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, on REPS 2 and 3, and those 6,000 hard-pressed farmers concerned with payments.  It is good news and I join them in offering congratulations.  I have an update on this matter and I will inform the House tomorrow morning on the position on REPS 4.  I take the position of Senators Cannon and Carty in trying to bring pressure on the EU and to support the Minister for two payments to be made to improve the cashflow of the hard-pressed farmers.</P>
        <P>Senators Ormonde, Donohue, Leyden, de B&uacute;rca and Ross expressed their views and concerns on the Lisbon treaty.  I wish to join with Senator Ormonde in welcoming the support of the IFA and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the treaty.</P>
        <P>I join with Senator Leyden, and the House, in wishing our troops well in their endeavour.  As we will all be aware, the European Union is a force for peace.  Ireland has a proud record of peacekeeping service around the world, having participated in 58 different missions.  This is the 50th anniversary of Ireland&rsquo;s first participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions and EU peacekeeping missions with the United Nations support have already taken place in Indonesia, in the western Balkans and in Palestine.  We all can feel proud.  Many of us live in constituencies where there is more than one arm of the Army.  There are three in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath &mdash; in Athlone, Mullingar and Longford.  Longford-Westmeath is also Senator McFadden&rsquo;s constituency.  We understand the important role of the Army.  I support the great work it is doing and wish our Armed Forces well in their endeavour.</P>
        <P>With regard to the arrangement of a date for the President of the European Commission to come to the House to discuss the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty, I understand that <Col N="970"/>it will be the first week we return after Easter, which I hope will be Tuesday, 8 April.  That is the date which is convenient for his diary.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn comes to the House with a wonderful track record of achievement in Ireland and I must take his views seriously.  He brought to the attention of the House the difficulties being experienced at Shannon Airport regarding flight activity.  I was in London on Monday and three flights were cancelled in the afternoon because of the difficulties being experienced.  There is considerable credibility at stake here in maintaining continuity and in everyone wanting their flights on time.  I sympathise with those who have a grievance but given the position in which Shannon finds itself, it needs all the help and assistance it can get.  Ultimately, everyone must get around the table and perhaps this should be the kernel to the success of Shannon for the future.  I am fully confident that Shannon has a great future.  It has made a marvellous contribution over the past 50 years or more since it was set up.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney called for an update in the House on North-South ministerial meetings.  This is a worthwhile proposal.  Senator Keaveney and I are members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which meets tomorrow.  I have already agreed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that he come to the House on matters pertaining to foreign affairs and I hope I will be able to inform the House next week when he will be coming to the House to update us on North-South ministerial meetings and other matters relating to foreign affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohue called for a debate on economic growth.  I have no difficulty in providing time for that.  It is opportune because we can reflect on our success, particularly over the past ten years.  We can look forward to the new Minister of State with responsibility for innovation policy, Deputy Michael Ahern, attending the House to participate in such a debate and outline the hopes of the new ministry, particularly with regard to the report published last week.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohue also called for a debate on homelessness and alcohol abuse, and Senator Callely supported this.  I have no difficulty in providing time for that.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast and Feeney called for a debate on the problem that now exists in the psychiatric hospitals, particularly in the case of beds for adolescent patients.  I will pass the Senators&rsquo; views on to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  If the Minister is in the House in the next week or so, perhaps this can be brought to her attention by the Senators.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis congratulated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its checkpoints for drug and substance abuse.  As I stated previously, it was the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business that made this recommendation on substance <Col N="971"/>abuse and I want to be associated with the Senator&rsquo;s congratulations in that regard.</P>
        <P>I also want to be associated with Senator Ellis&rsquo;s proposal that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seriously consider making sniffer dogs available at late-night venues, as is successfully the case in Scotland.  These should include not only entertainment venues but all late-night venues such as eating establishments where there is much activity into the early hours of the morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey called for a debate, with the relevant Minister present, on the importance of our ports and the roll-out of their development.  I have no difficulty with allocating time for that.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty pointed out the importance of Malin and Valentia coastguard stations.  I made a commitment on that yesterday and I will endeavour to have the debate take place as a matter of urgency within the next two to three weeks.  The Senator can rest assured that this is a priority item of business for the House between now and Easter.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty also expressed his concerns on the collusion issue.  As Senators know, we have statements today on the report from the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on violent incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  Spokespersons will have 12 minutes&rsquo; speaking time and all other Senators will have eight minutes.  If the issue needs to be rolled over, depending on the number of Senators offering, I have no difficulty with that.  We can review progress with 20 minutes or half an hour to go in the debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for debate on how we celebrate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  This is a worthwhile proposal and perhaps we can discuss it during the tourism debate and make St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day a central issue for tourism.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and all Ministers home in on that time of year.  With regard to promoting Ireland abroad, the festival comes at a good time of the year and we get enormous value for money from it.  It opens the doors in all our embassies and consulates and everyone becomes involved in promoting Ireland at that time.  The suggestion is a very worthwhile one and I will ensure the debate takes place at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty asked whether there was price fixing given the cost of veterinary drugs.  I will pass on his views to the Minister.  That issue could be included with a debate on agriculture.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for one hour to be allowed next week to debate No. 16, motion 35 on the Order Paper.  I have no difficulty with the allocation of that time and it will be on the Order of Business on one of the three days next week.  He also raised the issue of the Zambian Government and donations from Ireland.  He asked about the money trail, the intent behind the donations and how they were used.  That is a difficult issue.  I will pass the Senator&rsquo;s views on to the <Col N="972"/>Minister for Foreign Affairs and see what response we get.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris was just one of many Senators who asked about funding for the Feis Ceoil festival.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who has significant experience and expertise in this area, correctly pointed out that the Arts Council has &euro;80 million to disburse.  I am sure the particular event should and will get the due recognition and funding it deserves, but if it does not, we want to know about it.  The spirit and importance of festivals and events such as this are what contribute to lifting up the spirits of the people.  It is good for everyone Irish to celebrate the traditions of previous generations.  Ireland is one of the few countries in the world whose music is a trademark.  Few countries can say that, but Ireland can.</P>

        <P>Senators Norris, Coghlan and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed shock and disappointment at the death of the two eagles in Killarney, which is our number one destination for tourists.  I never miss an opportunity to visit Killarney and go on holiday there every year.  I have always said that if I could have a second place to live, it would be in Killarney.  I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views to the Minister.  I hope our worst fears are not realised.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called on the Government and the Minister to deal with the issue of stem cell research.  I will inquire about this and come back to him on the issue.  The Senator also made a serious statement regarding the great concerns of the farming community, market farmers in particular, about the low prices being received for their produce from supermarkets.  The former Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business carried out an in-depth investigation, lasting almost two years, into the grocery order.  The committee expressed definite all-party views on that order and came to the conclusion the order should have been retained.  Our worst fears are now being realised.</P>

	<P>The committee heard the views of many groups, in particular the north Dublin growers and the Meath growers who shared their experience.  Now we see the huge decline in growers.  A few hundred of the 700 or so who were in business have gone out of business since then.  Senator Hanafin pointed out that the farmers only get 20% of the price for which their potatoes are selling in the supermarkets and stores.  This is an issue that should be revisited by <Col N="973"/>the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator McFadden expressed serious concerns about the announcement by Arnotts during the week.  I understand 1,200 jobs will be provided in three years.  A significant amount of money, &euro;1 billion, is being spent on the project.  I remind the Senator that 80% of businesses that were in O&rsquo;Connell Street 30 years ago are no longer there as a result of the changing face of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen expressed his concern about the stolen data of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and I will pass on his concerns to the Minister.  I heard the programme on radio this <Col N="974"/>morning.  It is alarming that the data of 171,000 people might be in the hands of some thief.  Perhaps we could bring the matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention when she is in the house next week to discuss the HSE and perhaps we will get an update on the position then.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amend<Col N="974"/>ments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matter that may be discussed is the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>The definition of &ldquo;transfer by electronic means&rdquo;, by reference to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2000, has been deleted because it was considered that this is a term commonly in use that does not require a specific definition.

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Bill was initiated in the House, the European Communities Act has been enabled to permit relevant domestic legislation to be used to give effect to European Acts.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>These Government amendments were made in response to an interesting proposal from the Labour Party to insert a new principles and policies section in the Bill to set out the general principles and policies with particular regard to the EU and other international organisations and any other general Government policies.  The legal advice I obtained from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office did not support the inclusion of the new section.  However, taking on board the intent of the proposal, the text, &ldquo;having regard to the purposes of this Act&rdquo;, has been added to sections 3, 4 and 5.  The objective was to establish beyond doubt the linkage between our EU and international commitments and the reasons for making orders and regulations under these sections.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will deal with that matter in the next group.  Group 4 concerns the scope of brokering controls, which is the subject matter of amendment No. 4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will recall that Senator Quinn tabled an amendment on Committee Stage last year that sought to extend the scope of extra-territorial brokering controls beyond Irish citizens and companies to include non-Irish nationals resident in the country.  At the time, the Government undertook to obtain legal advice on the proposal and, should it prove favourable, to introduce a corresponding amendment when the Bill reached the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The section was subjected to the closest scrutiny by my Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to determine whether there was a way in which to move forward on the proposal.  As indicated in last year&rsquo;s debate in the House, there were serious concerns in respect of the lack of a single definition of a resident under Irish law.  This contrasted with the situation in other countries, for example, where there is a civil registration requirement for all residents.  There was also a question on the extent to which the State can attempt to impose extra-territorial controls.  The possibility was raised that the inclusion of such a provision in the legislation could create the basis for a legal challenge to the Act.  For example, this course of action could be taken by parties to whom we might wish to apply controls.  Regrettably, I concluded that, while desirable from a policy viewpoint, the legal considerations were such that this worthy amendment might create more problems than it would solve.  For this reason, the Government could not accept it.</P>
        <P>The scrutiny had an impact in that it resulted in the identification by the Attorney General of a potential problem with the section as drafted.  He pointed out correctly that the extra-territorial brokering controls should only be exercised outside the EU, as each member state had a similar obligation to control brokering activities within their jurisdictions.  Were Ireland to have the capacity to control brokering activities in another EU member state, we might somehow be implying that we do not trust our partners to comply with their obligations.  For this reason, the Government tabled the amendment which excludes from Irish control brokering activities carried out in another EU member state.  It also provides that brokering activities undertaken outside the State on foot of an authorisation by another EU member state would be outside the scope of Irish control.</P><Col N="977"/>
        <P>Senator Carty raised a question on other brokering issues.  There are regulations on this matter and Common Position 2003/468 has been adopted in this regard by the EU.  This common position is applied and deals with the question raised by the Senator.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government added a new subsection to the section on export licences to provide for the introduction of internal compliance procedures for exporters of controlled goods.  This was in response to calls from various commentators seeking, for example, greater post-shipment controls and will allow me to incorporate such provisions in the regulations to be made under this section.  The implementation of the appropriate internal compliance procedures will encourage responsible behaviour by exporters at all stages of the exporting process, from the initial contact with potential customers to post-shipment control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the inclusion of this amendment, its passage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and it being reported to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This amendment was recommended by the Green Party and I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to include it in the Bill.  It is important that we have internal compliance procedures for licence holders and it is important that those procedures be mandatory.  It is also important that licences include a level of post-export examination as regards the destination of the goods and technology as this will help ensure they are not used for military purposes and that they are not a factor in human rights abuses abroad.  This amendment represents an improvement to the Bill and for that reason should be welcomed by the House in the manner it has been welcomed by those who campaigned for the inclusion of such an aspect to the Bill.</P>

	<P>Group 7 relates to the annual report, the subject matter of amendment No. 10.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>The Control of Exports Bill was initiated in this House in February 2007 and, despite our best efforts, it was not possible to have it enacted before the end of that year.  It was necessary, therefore, to amend this section to provide that the first annual report <Col N="978"/>to the Oireachtas on the operation of the Act would be in respect of 2008.  I assure Senators that this is not to be regarded as an attempt to delay the provision of information on our strategic exports but is merely a technical issue.  Until this Bill is enacted I do not have a legal basis on which to submit an annual report to the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State give a commitment that the annual report will be taken seriously, rather than left on a shelf gathering dust?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation for the need for this amendment as the Bill has taken some time to go through both Houses of the Oireachtas and the elections to both Houses was part of that process.  I welcome the fact that an annual report is part of the procedures of this Bill and, along with Senator Carty, I feel it is important that the reporting mechanism for such a Bill should be to have it debated, where possible, preferably in this House, where there might be more latitude to examine its provisions and comment critically on how the report can be improved in subsequent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of Senator Boyle.  This Bill came about largely due to reports over a year ago on the involvement of Irish businesses in the global arms trade.  I accept the amendment as stated by the Minister of State but I agree with Senator Boyle that we could usefully have a more regular discussion of these issues when the annual report is produced in the Seanad.  The report could be discussed at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business in addition to the two Houses.  Perhaps the Minister of State has some ideas for a direction in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues in respect of the importance of an annual report and the continuing scrutiny of the issues addressed in this legislation.  I appreciate there has been some delay and I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on where the matter stands at the moment but the availability of an annual report and the opportunity for the House to discuss and scrutinise developments is very important and consistent with the democratic process that led to the passing of this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of introducing this Bill and ensuring that everyone was consulted on it I went out of my way to involve Members.  In the course of the various Stages in this House and the D&aacute;il I discussed matters with them and assured them we could debate the annual report either in the Seanad or at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  I believe legislation in this <Col N="979"/>hugely important area will always be a work in progress and I have every intention of ensuring that the consultation process continues.  I hope the Seanad or the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business uses the opportunity each year to debate the annual report because through such a debate we could find ways of improving the report and addressing issues that arise from this legislation or the report.  I again assure Members of this House that I will continue this process and work with them to ensure we have an opportunity to discuss the annual report.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and Report and Final Stages have been quick in the Seanad today.  This is significant legislation and Fine Gael has supported its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>However, Ireland can take another route in monitoring the international arms trade.  A significant number of dual-use products produced in this country are used in some way, shape or form in the global arms trade but in the overall context it does not represent even a drop in the ocean.  Ireland, the Minister and the Government have roles to play, in terms of international relations, through the diplomatic service and the Department of Foreign Affairs, in ensuring the development of a more scrutinised international arms trade.  This goes beyond the bounds of this legislation but it is an area in which Ireland could have a greater impact on this trade.</P>
        <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill through the House and believe it is a significant step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the passage of this legislation and the commitment the Minister of State has shown to consultation with members of the Opposition in both Houses.  This is important legislation and, as Senator Phelan said, the fact that Ireland is a small country and some people view our involvement in this trade as merely a drop in the ocean does not detract from the vital importance of the controls contained in this Bill.  Huge ethical and moral issues are associated with this debate and they have been aired here and in the other House.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the fact that not all of the Opposition&rsquo;s proposed amendments have been accepted there has been a willingness to consider them and some have found their way through in some shape or form.  There has been a vitally important debate on this matter, which may have been a little overdue as members of my party have called for such controls as these to be introduced for some years.  That is in the past now as the legislation is in place.  I welcome it and commend the Minister of State on shepherding it through as he did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="980"/><Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I too will welcome the final passage of this Bill into enactment when it is signed by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann as it represents an important development in legislation in this area.  This applies particularly to the area of licensing and the introduction of a series of controls on an industry that few members of the public in Ireland wish to see develop.  On those grounds, the legislation should help prevent the unnecessary development of such an industry.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, it is only part of a policy approach aimed at ensuring the arms industry does not develop a strong base here.  We need to consider introducing legislation or ethical investment guidelines to govern the use of State moneys, specifically the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  We need to ensure the State does not unwittingly encourage the development of the arms industry, either domestically or internationally.  the legislation will be a cornerstone for our enterprise policies for international trade and I wish the Minister of State every success in implementing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment and congratulate the Minister of State on introducing the Bill.  As Senator Boyle noted, it is important to have proper structures in place to regulate the export of arms.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s intentions regarding secondary legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for participating in the debate.  The annual report will afford us an opportunity to monitor events at home, abroad and in world markets and to respond accordingly.  I will consult the parties on secondary legislation, as I did when introducing the legislation.  I may also consult the Oireachtas committee and will inform the parties and committee of my intentions and listen to suggestions they may have.  I hope to return to the committee to deal with secondary legislation at an appropriate time, perhaps before the end of the year.  A conference on an arms trade treaty and cluster munitions will be held in 2008 and the Government will support any activity in this area which will result in clarity, transparency and so forth. </P>
        <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate and note the work done by my predecessor in this portfolio, the current Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, who introduced the Bill in the House 12 months ago.  I am pleased to have cut my ministerial teeth on this important legislation.  I assure Senators I will continue to consult them in considering secondary legislation and the annual report.</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland Issues: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is right that Members <Col N="981"/>of the Seanad should have the chance to air their views on matters that go to the heart of events on this island over recent decades.  The legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland is something which will be with us for some time to come.  The painful memories of lives needlessly lost or ruined will continue to linger.  The prospect of lasting peace which followed the Good Friday Agreement and the restoration of the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland should raise in all of us the hope, indeed the expectation, that no new victims will be created.</P>
        <P>It is especially important for those individuals and their families directly affected by the atrocities examined by Mr. Justice Barron that this House should have the opportunity to have its voice heard on the reports from the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  It is also important to reflect on the legacy of 30 years of conflict.  As the Taoiseach stated during statements in the D&aacute;il, this process is not only about the past, it is about the future also.</P>
        <P>The positive political developments in Northern Ireland in recent years, especially the restoration last year of the devolved institutions, have given us a glimpse of what can be achieved.  However, to move forward into that better future we need to examine and seek to understand, while in no way seeking to minimise or explain away, the violence which occurred on this island over the past several decades.  Statements in this House today, taken together with those in the D&aacute;il last month, are part of that continuing process.</P>
        <P>Senators will know that the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged the need to address the suffering of victims and recognised their right to remember that suffering.  There can be no hierarchy when it comes to the pain felt by those deprived of a loved one as a result of this conflict.  No one group has a monopoly on grief.  There is, however, a particular sense of injustice felt by those who have been robbed of that loved one following the wilful collusion of those charged with protecting them.</P>
        <P>One of the first significant attempts to address our shared legacy in the context of claims of collusion arose from the Weston Park agreement of 2001.  Senators will recall that both the Irish and British Governments committed themselves to appointing a person of international standing to examine six cases that have been the source of concern about possible collusion by State security forces on either side of the Border.  The resultant collusion inquiry process, led by retired Canadian Supreme Court judge, Peter Cory, recommended public inquiries into all four cases involving concerns about collusion in the murders of Rosemary Nelson, Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright.  Senators will have heard the Taoiseach call, once again, for an inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane to be established, as recommended by Judge Cory.</P><Col N="982"/>
        <P>Judge Cory also recommended a public inquiry into one of the two cases involving concerns about collusion in this jurisdiction, namely, the murder of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan in a Provisional IRA ambush in 1989.  Whatever the merits of aspects of the British response to Judge Cory&rsquo;s recommendations, I am pleased to note the response in this jurisdiction was to accept the need for an inquiry into the murder of the two RUC officers.  A tribunal of inquiry established into the murders is proceeding under the chairmanship of Judge Peter Smithwick, the retired President of the District Court.  Having been in an investigative mode for some time now, I understand the tribunal will commence public hearings during the course of this year.  I consider that the establishment of this tribunal &mdash; the most extensive form of statutory inquiry available &mdash; demonstrates that the Government will not flinch from shining a light into potentially murky corners of our past, as and when merited.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senators will join me in paying tribute to Mr. Justice Henry Barron and his predecessor, the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, for their services as head of the independent commission of inquiry.  That commission produced four substantial reports into a range of terrorist atrocities perpetrated against citizens and individuals in this State.  In preparing these reports, it goes without saying that the Barron inquiry received the full co-operation of all relevant Departments and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its investigations.  The Barron reports and the corresponding reports of the Oireachtas sub-committees which examined them privately and in public hearings are now a matter of public record.  I will not, therefore, reiterate their findings and recommendations here.  I would, however, like to make some specific points in relation to the reports.</P>
        <P>In the case of the random, brutal and senseless sectarian murder of Seamus Ludlow in 1976, in accordance with the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to be actively engaged in a re-examination of the case, in co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Historical Enquiries Team.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have met the families of the victims of some of these murders to hear first hand their concerns and share with them developments in their cases.  I am conscious of the deep loss still felt by them, even after the passage of so many years.  Given the lapse of time, expectations should not be raised in an unrealistic fashion about the potential outcome of any Garda re-examinations, but I hope this demonstrates that the Barren reports are not gathering dust on a shelf.  The findings of these reports and the associated recommendations of the Oireachtas sub-committee have been and are being taken on board.</P>
        <P>Senators will recall that the reports made criticisms of various State agencies, including Depart<Col N="983"/>ments &mdash; my own included &mdash; and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Sometimes these criticisms were severe and stinging, and rightly so.  On occasion, more could and should have been done in response to the attacks themselves and in support of the victims and their families.  We have learned those lessons, and the State and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are in a better position to respond to incidents.  It may be little comfort to those bereaved by past events, but Ireland now boasts best practices in many of the areas where deficiencies were identified.  Most of all, successive Governments have worked hard to ensure that the cycle of violence in Northern Ireland is broken, so that we never again need find ourselves in the position of looking back on the dead and wounded of decades past.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to turn to the single biggest atrocity of the Troubles, and the focus of the first Barron report, namely, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, which claimed the lives of 33 persons.  The Oireachtas sub-committee examination of this report identified a number of matters with regard to the resulting Garda investigation, as well as other issues requiring clarification.  In response, the Taoiseach established a commission of investigation, the first time such a form of statutory inquiry was established under the 2004 legislation, to examine these matters and report on them.</P>
        <P>In respect of the Garda investigation into the bombings in 1974, the commission&rsquo;s final report, published in March 2007, concluded that appropriate decisions were taken by experienced Garda officers at the time.  Moreover, the suggestion that the Garda investigation was wound down because of alleged collusion was rejected.  This finding, although obvious in my view, is nevertheless welcome.</P>
        <P>I previously mentioned it is correct and proper that deficiencies in the State&rsquo;s response to the handling of these terrorist attacks are recognised so that lessons can be learned for the future.  However, it is worth making the point that where the perpetrators of the attacks have not been made amenable for their crimes, it would be wrong that the focus of blame and criticism should be turned on those individuals and agencies who sought to defend life and property, in difficult circumstances and during troubled times.</P>
        <P>In this regard, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is right that I place on the record of this House, on behalf of successive Governments, our appreciation of how members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the years stood by this State against the threats it faced, sometimes at great personal cost.</P>
        <P>Having said all this, while the terrorist attacks might be decades old, the legacy of hurt and pain, both physical and emotional, continues to this day for the victims of these attacks and for the families of those lost and injured.  For these people, the attacks are a present, not a past, reality, and I wholeheartedly acknowledge this. <Col N="984"/> As I previously mentioned, in meeting with a number of these relatives I have seen it for myself.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to refer in detail to one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles, namely the Omagh bomb.  Allegations of Garda failings were made about the period leading up to the bombing.  These allegations were rejected by the Nally report, an edited version of which was published by my predecessor.</P>
        <P>Senators are no doubt aware of the civil action being pursued by families of some of the victims of Omagh.  I understand that in recent days, the judge in this action has indicated his intention to issue a letter of request setting out the nature of the assistance being sought from the appropriate Irish authorities.  All possible support, within the legal framework in which we must operate, will be forthcoming.  Senators should also bear in mind that criminal proceedings with regard to one individual&rsquo;s alleged involvement in this bombing continue in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>The State has endeavoured and continues to endeavour to assist victims of the Troubles.  In some cases, the simple acknowledgement of their loss can provide comfort to victims and their families.  Financial and other support is also necessary and the Government has taken steps to provide this.  Arising from the recommendations of the report of the Victim&rsquo;s Commission, the Government approved in 2003 the establishment of the Remembrance Commission with an associated remembrance fund of up to &euro;9 million.</P>
        <P>The Remembrance Commission was charged with the responsibility of administering the scheme of acknowledgement, remembrance and assistance for victims in this jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland conflict, and I know it has helped numerous families and individuals in recent years.  The commission has made payments to the families of persons killed as acknowledgement for their loss; to spouses and children on the basis of economic hardship; to persons unable to work due to incapacity; to persons displaced from Northern Ireland due to the conflict; and for medical bills.  It has also funded memorials to remember the victims whose precious lives were lost during this period, including most recently memorials commemorating the Belturbet bombing and the Miami Showband attack.</P>
        <P>Although the Remembrance Commission was due to wind up in 2006, the Government extended its duration to October 2008 to ensure that all eligible persons have the opportunity to benefit from the scheme.  As of the end of 2007, approximately &euro;6.2 million has been provided and more than 420 applications have been made to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some families of victims also have the added injustice of not having been afforded the dignity of being able to bury their loved ones.  I cannot think of anything more likely to prolong grieving than not being able to bury the remains of a family member.  As a further practical measure to <Col N="985"/>support the families of victims, in 1999 the two Governments established the independent commission for the location of victims&rsquo; remains.  Its remit is to receive information from paramilitary organisations which could lead to the discovery of the remains of victims in those few cases where remains have never been recovered.</P>
        <P>In 1999 and 2000, on the basis of information supplied to the commission by the Provisional IRA and following extensive excavation work carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, three bodies were recovered and returned to their families for burial.  A fourth, that of Ms Jean McConville, was discovered by accident soon afterwards.  Subsequently, in August 2006, the two Governments agreed that in the absence of any further breakthroughs on the basis of information received, the commission should adopt a more proactive approach to its mandate.  This has included contracting the services of a forensic specialist and carrying out full, non-invasive surveys of all suspected gravesites.</P>
        <P>Mindful of the heartache experienced on occasions when the families&rsquo; hopes have been raised and then dashed, the commission&rsquo;s policy, supported by the Government, is that physical excavation of possible gravesites is now only undertaken if and where the commission assesses a good prospect exists of successful recovery of remains.  The commission maintains extremely close liaison with members of the families of these victims to ensure that their expectations are not unduly raised.  The work of the commission continues to enjoy the full support of both Governments.</P>
        <P>All the matters I have touched upon today relate to various facets of how to come to terms with a past which is, in many cases, still raw and for many acutely painful.  This is not a simple question.  The very fact we are bringing these matters into the open and discussing them is in some small way a part of the healing process.</P>
        <P>In his remarks to the D&aacute;il, the Taoiseach welcomed the establishment in Northern Ireland of the consultative group on dealing with the past, co-chaired by Denis Bradley and Archbishop Robin Eames, whom he met in November.  The group has been charged with seeking views from across the community in Northern Ireland on the best way to deal with the legacy of the past.  This is a difficult undertaking, but a necessary one, and one to which we await the outcome with interest.  As the Taoiseach stated, the group will no doubt learn much from the work that has been undertaken by Judge Barron, by the Oireachtas sub-committee and by victims&rsquo; groups in this jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by reiterating the Government&rsquo;s view that the exercise of looking back critically on past events, in which we have engaged in over the past number of years, has been absolutely necessary.  It may be a painful and difficult process, particularly for the victims and their <Col N="986"/>families, but we owe it to them to do so with honesty and conviction.</P>
        <P>The results of our investigations and inquiries can only ever constitute an element of the full picture of those events in the 1970s.  To complete this picture, all Members of both Houses recognise that we need the unambiguous co-operation of the British Government.  This is particularly the case in instances where real grounds for concern about collusion by members of the security forces in Northern Ireland have been clearly identified.</P>
        <P>I wish to echo the Taoiseach&rsquo;s words that the suffering inflicted during the Troubles was endured by people from all backgrounds and traditions.  The families of those who died know better than anyone that pain and despair do not distinguish on the basis of political conviction or religion or any other aspect of an individual human being.  Wrongs were perpetrated throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>In seeking to progress politically we must confront frankly and honestly our shared past, and hold uppermost in our thoughts the ever-present pain of all the victims of this conflict.  In remembering their pain we should be fortified in our determination that the people of this island should never suffer in this way again.  The past year has seen enormous progress made towards this goal.  Acknowledging and dealing with the past is and must remain a part of this progress.  I hope today&rsquo;s proceedings in this House will further contribute to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is long overdue.  The sub-committee on the Barron report had wished for an early debate after the presentation of its findings.  I am glad we now have the opportunity to debate the reports in the House.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that, like in the other House, the leaders have not agreed on an all-party motion to deal specifically with the items contained in the Barron report.  As it had not happened in the Lower House, I would have thought the Leaders would have rectified that in the Seanad.  Senator Walsh stated to me coming into the Chamber that he has a motion to propose.  I do not believe that is the way of doing business.  As there is all-party agreement on the reports, there should be an all-party motion to follow up on the findings of them and the investigations of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>The Barron report dealt with the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, the murder of Seamus Ludlow in 1976 and the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk.  I was a member of the Oireachtas sub-committee of the justice committee that conducted public hearings and compiled the fourth and final report on Mr. Justice Barron&rsquo;s investigations.</P>
        <P>It was a humbling and moving experience to hear the testimony of decent, honest people <Col N="987"/>whose relatives were murdered in the most horrific and violent circumstances.  Yet, after more than 30 years, the perpetrators have not been brought to justice and the British authorities continue to be found wanting in providing information which could bring much-needed justice and closure for the relatives of the bereaved.  The sense of loss, pain, suffering and grieving was felt by each member of the sub-committee.  We felt honour-bound to ensure our conclusions were clear and unambiguous based on the evidence which we received.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt there was collusion between the British security forces and loyalist terrorists mainly based in the Glenane area in County Armagh.  The then British Government at the highest level was aware of the presence of this loyalist gang and the atrocities it committed.  It failed to take the necessary action to protect the citizens of Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is necessary to put on the record some of the conclusions of the sub-committee.  They state:</P>
        <P LI="1">The sub-committee is left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many, if not all, of the atrocities that are considered in this report.  We are horrified that persons who were employed by the British Administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and butchering of innocent victims.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The sub-committee believes that, unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility, then there cannot be closure for the families.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Nothing could be clearer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the establishment of the Historical Inquiries Team to investigate many of these atrocities but without the full co-operation of its political masters, I am not convinced it can bring closure for the grieving families.  I was incredulous to hear that after 35 years a visit from the team was the first time that some eye-witnesses to these atrocities were interviewed by the security forces.</P>
        <P>The Barron report deals specifically with events which highlighted many vicious attacks on the Catholic community along the Border.  However, we must also remember the equally vicious attacks on members of the Protestant community in the same area.  The families of those who died are the ones who still suffer the pain and despair so many years after these horrendous events.</P>
        <P>More recently there have been the savage murders by members of the IRA of Robert McCartney, Paul Quinn and Joseph Rafferty.  We continue to witness the mafia-style <i>omerta</i> in operation in some areas of Northern Ireland.  Unless some good people come forward, evil will continue to triumph and families in 2008 will find <Col N="988"/>themselves in a similar position as the families we have spoken about earlier some 30 years on.</P>
        <P>We have also seen the re-emergence of the Real and the Continuity IRA which pose a threat to the people and institutions of this State and this island and aim to undermine the position of Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is believed they are responsible for the recent murder of a young man, Andrew Burns, in Donegal.  I urge the Minister to use every means at the State&rsquo;s disposal to crush these evil people whose only aim is to sow seeds of hatred and bigotry in this island and destroy the relative peace we enjoy.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not pay tribute to the groups and organisations, especially Justice for the Forgotten.  Their members have displayed personal commitment and dedication in their efforts to find justice and closure for many families affected by the atrocities covered by Mr. Justice Barron in his report.</P>
        <P>I hope the Taoiseach will instruct his officials to renew contact with officials on the British side and influence the British Prime Minister to release files that may bring justice and closure for the families.  All we want is closure to these events.  If the Minister had listened to the testimony given by many of those affected to the sub-committee, he would see how much it means to them that justice be done for their relatives who were butchered in horrific ways during that sad period in our country&rsquo;s history.  Let us hope these people will get justice and closure for their families.</P>

	<P>The sub-committee&rsquo;s first report dealt with the 17 May 1974, when bombs went off in the centre of Dublin city at 5.30 p.m.  The victims included Patrick Askin, 44 years of age; Josie Bradley, 21; Marie Butler, 21; Anne Byrne, 35; Thomas Campbell, 52; Simone Chetrit, 30, a French citizen; Thomas Croarkin, 36; John Dargle, 80; Concepta Dempsey, 65; Collette Doherty, 21, who ran a shop in Sheriff Street with her husband John, was nine months pregnant at the time but her daughter, Wendy, who was with her survived the blast in Talbot Street; Patrick Fay, 47; Elizabeth Fitzgerald, 59; Breda Grace, 35, recovering from the &lsquo;flu had been encouraged by her husband Tim to get a respite, parked her car on Talbot Street and was killed on the way back to it; Archie Harper, 73; Antonio Magliocco, 37, Italian citizen; May McKenna, 55; Anne Marren, 20; Anna Massey, 21; Dorothy Morris, 57; the O&rsquo;Brien family, John and Anna O&rsquo;Brien, 24 and 22, respectively, and their daughters Jacqueline, 17 months, and Anne-Marie, five months, who lived in Gardiner Street and were originally from Finglas.  John worked in the Palm Grove ice-pop factory, and the entire family was wiped out in the Parnell Street explosion; Christina O&rsquo;Loughlin, 51; Edward John O&rsquo;Neill, 39, and baby Martha O&rsquo;Neill, who was stillborn; Marie Phelan, 20; Siobh&aacute;n Roice, 19, who was from Thomas Street in Wexford and, like many <Col N="989"/>young people, was dreaming of what future years would bring.  She was in the prime of life and had everything to look forward to, but her life was cruelly snuffed out in the explosion; Maureen Shields, 46; Jack Travers, 28; Breda Turner, 21; John Walshe, 27; Peggy White, 45; and George Williamson, 72.  This is just a list of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
        <P>The sadness and sense of loss felt by the victims&rsquo; relatives were very much in evidence when they appeared before the committee, and were as raw and as hurtful as they had been some 34 years ago.  This was compounded by the criminal investigation, which left a lot to be desired and was closed down after four months.  They were then neglected and forgotten by successive Governments, and it can truly be said this State failed them.  They were only sustained in their anguish by the NGOs, particularly Justice for the Forgotten, which campaigned and worked tirelessly to keep the issue to the forefront and researched and gathered much useful data for which the committee and the Barron inquiry were grateful.  It is a pity the group was unaware of the debate taking place today as I know they would have wished to attend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first breakthrough for the families was when they met the current Taoiseach in the late 1990s and he agreed to take a personal interest in the matter.  In 2000 the Government established an independent commission of inquiry under Mr. Justice Barron which investigated the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Among its recommendations was the establishment of a commission of investigation to inquire into aspects of the Garda investigation and document handling by the Department and the Garda.  That commission was subsequently established under Patrick McEntee, who has reported to the Government and there are certain issues arising from this.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile to refer briefly to the recommendations made by the sub-committee and subsequently endorsed by the then Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.  The sub-committee stated that &ldquo;a Public Tribunal of Inquiry in Northern Ireland and/or Great Britain is required and represents the best opportunity to be successful.&rdquo;  This is because the relevant documentation was in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and an inquiry in this State would not have had access to this.  The sub-committee also stated in its recommendations:</P>
        <P LI="1">Before any Inquiry would proceed the Sub-Committee is of the view that what is required in the first instance, is an investigation based upon the Weston Park proposals.  The terms of reference should be agreed between the two Governments and should be based upon the terms agreed at Weston Park, in particular paragraph No. 19.</P><Col N="990"/>
        <P FLI="0">Finally, the recommendations state, &ldquo;The Sub-Committee recommends that a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas be passed endorsing this Report and its recommendations, and would invite the UK Parliament in Westminster to pass a similar resolution.&rdquo;  This report is dated March 2004.  It is a serious indictment of these Houses that four years later, no such resolution has been put before the Houses, passed or endorsed.  While the individual reports have been debated previously, this is the first overall debate on these issues.  I hope this omission on the part of the Houses will be corrected in the not-too-distant future.</P>
        <P>The second report of the sub-committee dealt with the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973, the bombings in Belturbet in December 1972, and the murders of Br&iacute;d Carr, 26, on the Lifford-Strabane road in November 1971 and of Oliver Boyce, 25, and Br&iacute;d Porter, 21, in Burnfoot in January 1973.  The victims of these atrocities also included George Bradshaw, 30; Tommy Duffy, 24; Tommy Douglas, 21; Geraldine O&rsquo;Reilly, 15; and Patrick Stanley, 16.  The issue of collusion was very much in focus with regard to various aspects of these murders.</P>
        <P>The third report dealt with the murder of Seamus Ludlow on 2 May 1976.  In its findings, the committee recommended <i>inter alia</i> that a historic inquiries team be established in this jurisdiction and that a commission of investigation be established to examine certain outstanding questions to do with the Ludlow case.</P>
        <P>The fourth report dealt with nine atrocities: the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk in December 1975, the bombing in Castleblayney in March 1976, the bombing of Dublin Airport in November 1975, the attack at Donnelly&rsquo;s Bar, Silverbridge, in December 1975, the attack on the Reavey family in January 1976, the attack on the Step Inn, Keady, in August 1976, the attack on the O&rsquo;Dowd family in January 1976, the atrocity at the Rock Bar in County Armagh in June 1976, and the attack on the Miami Showband on 31 July 1975.</P>
        <P>For the record, it is worth acknowledging the victims of these atrocities: John Francis Hayes, 38; Jack Rooney, 62; Hugh Watters, 60; Patrick Mone, 56; Patrick Donnelly, 24; Michael Donnelly, 14; Trevor Brecknell, 32; Betty McDonald, 38; Gerald McGleenan, 22; and John Martin, Brian and Anthony Reavey.  I recommend to those who might not have followed the hearings closely that they read the evidence of Eugene Reavey, the brother of the latter three victims, at the various hearings.  They will then understand the manner in which the families were treated, particularly by the British Army.  That family lived very close to the Glenanne farm owned by James Mitchell, who was a reserve member of the RUC.  It was common knowledge that the RUC frequented the farm, and it was from that farm that the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were planned.  It is disgraceful that no action was ever <Col N="991"/>taken with regard to the people involved.  The list of victims continues with Barry O&rsquo;Dowd, 24; Declan O&rsquo;Dowd, 19; Joe O&rsquo;Dowd, 61; Francis O&rsquo;Toole, 29; Anthony Geraghty, 23; Brian McCoy, 33; and Francis O&rsquo;Toole.  The latter three were members of the Miami Showband who were slaughtered coming back from a dance in Northern Ireland.  Anybody who has read the book on this subject or heard the evidence will know that there was strong suspicion that the paramilitary unit that carried out the attack was controlled by a person with an English accent, in all probability a member of the British Army.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the latest report, it is essential that we refer to the conclusions and recommendations of the committee.  As we went along it became obvious to us that there was significant collusion at various levels within the British establishment, not just at police and British Army level but higher.  What happened could not have happened without either the tacit approval or the knowledge of persons in the Northern Ireland Office and in Whitehall itself.  Evidence was presented at the committee that former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, in documentation, gave a briefing for the then leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, informing her of the situation with regard to security forces in the North and the extent to which they had been infiltrated by paramilitaries.  Thus, it was common knowledge that this was happening.  The sub-committee stated in its conclusions:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Sub-Committee is left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that are considered in this report.  We are horrified that persons who were employed by the British administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and the butchering of innocent victims.  The Sub-Committee believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there cannot be closure for the families.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was going to read into the record the comments of the Taoiseach, who has been highly critical of the failure to get co-operation from the British side on this, but will not do so because they are already on record in the D&aacute;il.  I must compliment the leader of the Opposition who was equally forceful in his comments on what needs to be done.  Deputy Joe Costello, who was a member of the sub-committee, set out an approach that should be taken from here.  It is also worth noting the comments of Deputy Se&aacute;n Ardagh who is Chairman of the sub-committee.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ardagh&rsquo;s comments are worth noting because he would certainly have started with a view that perhaps there was no collusion involved in these various atrocities.  As the various hearings went on, he certainly changed his mind in that regard.  According to Deputy Ardagh:</P>
        <P LI="1">These security forces were not prepared to allow the files to be seen by Mr. Justice Barron, which, in itself, indicated that there was something to hide.  We found that members of the security forces in the North were engaged in these terrorist activities in the Republic.  It is inconceivable that the colleagues and superiors of these people were not aware that these men were involved.  A blind eye was turned to many of their activities.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Coming from the Chairman, who was impartial and very objective in the manner in which he conducted these hearings and the subsequent reports, that is of tremendous significance and clearly illustrates the strong view of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question arises as to where we go from here.  These people have suffered for too long without getting some remedy or closure on their hurt and sadness.  I propose we come back to this House with an agreed motion.  First, I propose that this motion be adopted by Seanad &Eacute;ireann accepting, endorsing and approving the four reports of Mr. Justice Barron and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which are before the House.  Second, I propose that the Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann formally inform the Speaker of the House of Lords of the passage of the resolution, forwarding copies of the reports and requesting the matter be considered by members of that house.  Third, I propose that the Seanad support the efforts of the Taoiseach in his talks with the British Prime Minister to have files and all relevant information and documentation made available to a Cory-type inquiry which should be established.  The inquiry could consist of an Irish Government nominee, a British Government nominee and a judicial figure of international repute and stature.  Fourth, I propose that to advance the declared position of these Houses and the findings of these reports, a special Oireachtas joint committee be established to assist in achieving an outcome to the involvement of collusion in these atrocities.  In doing that, the proposal of an Oireachtas joint committee could interact with the House of Commons.  I hope the D&aacute;il would endorse this proposal as well.  A House of Commons and House of Lords commit<Col N="993"/>tee could deal with this too.  Other groups that could be involved include the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, the consultative group on the past which has been established in the North under the former Archbishop of Armagh, Robin Eames, and Denis Bradley, and the European Parliament and Commission.</P>
        <P>I commend the Taoiseach on his efforts.  He raised this issue at the meeting in Manchester with the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and they have agreed that the matter will be pursued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Secretary of State, Shaun Woodward.</P>
        <P>To preserve and endorse our sovereignty, we need, as a Parliament, to ensure these issues are not allowed to be forgotten and to increase our efforts to bring closure to a group of people who have suffered for far too long.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome that we are having this discussion and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution.  However, what was just said by Senator Walsh contrasts to some extent with what the Minister has been able to say in his contribution.  While I could not disagree with anything the Minister said, it might be the consensus in this House or those of us who have spoken so far that while the Minister has made an important contribution, it does not go far enough.  I agree with Senator Walsh&rsquo;s argument that we need to be far more robust and take on this issue at least in the context of a motion or a real and robust debate on an actual proposal for action to be taken by our Government and the British Government rather than simply confining ourselves to making statements in this House, important though this procedure is.</P>
        <?oasys _dc18- ?><P>As the Minister outlined in his speech, there has been a significant change in our country, North and South, in the past ten years and even in the past year.  New institutions are in place and there is a new level and spirit of real political co-operation between North and South.  A new political dispensation is in place which I strongly welcome, support and wish to promote in any way possible.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?><P>The Minister also said that we cannot turn our backs on the past, an argument with which I concur.  We cannot say that atrocities, collusion and dreadful events that occurred can simply be left there.  Closure is a word that is often used.  This word is problematic because people whose loved ones have been injured and killed and who have been affected by atrocities, be they large public ones or ones that are not so well known, never really have closure.  When we use that word, it covers a multitude of things because people affected in that way never have the sort of closure we might like  them to have.</P>
        <P>At the same time, public bodies and institutions such as Parliament and Government must do everything in their power to ensure matters that ought to be exposed, be they in respect of State action or inaction or the action of para<Col N="994"/>military groups that has occurred, are exposed and not confined to the past.  That should occur in circumstances where they should be the subject of public debate or criticism of bodies, including Government.  The overall spirit of the new political dispensation has been very much in the context of a human rights approach.</P>
        <P>If there is one individual I would point out as embodying that human rights approach to evaluating the past and moving to the future, it is Nuala O&rsquo;Loan who was the Police Ombudsman in the North until recently.  She took a human rights approach to what needed to be done in respect of criticism of state actions and the police and assisting all of society to move forward in a spirit of co-operation and healing.</P>
        <P>It is not enough simply to talk about healing or moving.  Sometimes governments must take action to ensure that occurs.  To that extent, I agree with what Senators Cummins and Walsh have said, namely, that we need to do more to put in place a series of actions to follow on from reports such as the Barron report to ensure we learn from the lessons of the past rather than simply talk about or debate them.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the sub-committee to which Senator Walsh referred has made some valuable suggestions.  My colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, as a member of the sub-committee, often criticised the failure to act in this area.  He has made four reasonable proposals.  Senator Walsh suggested a motion should be proposed. I agree with Senator Doherty and others who say there ought to be a debate based on a proposal, but in the absence of that, what Deputy Costello has proposed, in respect of the final reports of the sub-committee, is that at a minimum the interim and final reports of the sub-committee, and the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, should be formally received and endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Deputy Costello also proposed in the other House that the Ceann Comhairle be called on &mdash; the Cathaoirleach of this House should be also called on &mdash; to inform the Speaker of the House of Commons of the passage of a resolution in these Houses and to send copies of the relevant reports and other documents with a request that the matter be considered by members of that House.  If there is to be a spirit of co-operation between political parties and parliaments, the Houses of the Oireachtas should inform the House of Commons and the other parliaments in the United Kingdom of what we have decided and invite them to debate it.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the efforts of the Taoiseach.  These Houses should call on the Taoiseach to renew his efforts to secure the agreement of the British Government on the courses of action recommended by the sub-committee.  The Taoiseach should be invited to report to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on a regular basis on what he has managed to achieve in that regard.  I <Col N="995"/>do not doubt the Taoiseach&rsquo;s good faith in respect of this issue but it is frustrating to witness his frustration on the issue and to see him on television and elsewhere appear to throw his hands in the air saying he has done everything he can do and we can establish no more from the British.  It is not enough for us to wash our hands of the issue.  The pressure must be maintained.  The Irish Government should render it a major international imperative that the British Government should respond much more satisfactorily to the demand that it produce information it undoubtedly has, whether it is recorded by the spooks and others in MI5 or MI6 or in Government papers.  Wherever the records are they should be produced and we should continue to maintain pressure on the British Government to do that.</P>
        <P>These Houses should call on the British Government, as a sign of its good faith in dealing with the legacy of conflict, to provide access to all of the original documents relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction, and in particular the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974 in which 32 Irish citizens, a French and an Italian citizen were killed.  That documentation should be produced.  There is no legitimate excuse for it not to be and pressure should be maintained, at an international level if necessary, for that to occur.  If we are not successful at that level, the Irish Government should give serious consideration to instituting proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights to force the British Government to co-operate in that regard.  The Irish Government took the British Government to the European Court of Human Rights in the past in the course of the early stages of the Troubles.  Now that the Troubles are behind us it is vital that the British Government be pressurised in every way possible, if necessary through international litigation against it, to ensure it produces the documentation and gives the support and co-operation that any democratic government ought to be willing to do.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Walsh and every other Member of this House, I grew up during the Troubles and reports of a body in the ditch on the nine o&rsquo;clock news every night, week in, week out.  It is a huge advance to have moved away from that, if a civilised society can say such a move is an advance.  I was in school at the time of bombings in Dublin in 1974.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to consider another issue to do with our Government&rsquo;s willingness to shine a light on dark areas of the Troubles, namely, the killing in the early 1970s of Garda Richard Fallon in this city.  I am a very close friend of members of Garda Fallon&rsquo;s family and they make a legitimate request of the Government that full and clear confirmation be given to them that all of the available information, documentation, State papers and so on regarding that atrocity in the heart of the city of Dublin be produced by the Irish Government.  It is much more difficult for us to <Col N="996"/>demand, as we rightly do, of the British Government to co-operate and produce documentation if there is any doubt about our willingness to produce all of the documentation, State papers and otherwise on that terrible event in the 1970s to that family.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to do so today or perhaps the Minister could come back to the House and indicate whether that has been done and, if not, when that family can expect it will be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Last weekend I had the pleasure of visiting Belfast on the occasion of the annual conference of the Green Party in Northern Ireland.  The Green Party in Northern Ireland is a regional council of the Green Party on this island.  We are one of only two political parties that operate on an all-island basis.  Not only are we represented in both Houses of the Oireachtas but we are also represented in the legislative Assembly in the North.  </P>
        <P>The visit was an opportunity for me to get a feel for life in Northern Ireland and express a note of regret that it was one of all too infrequent visits I make to that part of this island.  I felt the post-conflict Belfast is more comfortable with itself and a place where the normalisation process, while not complete, is ongoing and has also assisted to define a sense of confidence that has been lacking in the past because of the nature of the conflict which, while we refer to it as occurring on that side of the island, also spilled over into sections of this part of the island.  We must acknowledge that when addressing the issue of collusion and the various committees that have attempted to make sense of the issue and bring finality to it.</P>
        <P>I arrived in Belfast on Friday to visit my colleagues in Stormont.  It was my first visit to the facility and I found it to be an impressive building.  I visited both Chambers of what had been the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  While I was young when Stormont was first discontinued in 1972 I must profess to an ignorance of the Northern Ireland Senate.  While most people would be aware that one of the effects of the conflict in Northern Ireland was the murder while in office of a Member of this House, Senator Billy Fox, I was not aware of similar murders of two members of the Northern Ireland Senate, Senators Jack Barnwell and Paddy Wilson, which are acknowledged by way of a plaque.  That was part of the catalogue of horrific events with which we have had to live on this island for the past decades which I hope the processes and procedures that followed the Good Friday Agreement are starting to put to rights.  One of the overhanging issues is the lack of finality, the lack of information that those who suffered tragic events such as senseless killings have had to endure.  Collusion is a large shadow over that.</P>
        <P>Earlier contributions have acknowledged that collusion was a two sided street.  This State and agencies representing the State must answer <Col N="997"/>questions and provide information.  If the ongoing debate on collusion reveals this information, it will assist the process.  After the Barron report, which concentrated on a number of events, the report of the Oireachtas sub-committee and the MacEntee report we must decide on the mechanism needed to bring finality to these issues.</P>
        <P>In South Africa the truth commission was the mechanism used.  Victims&rsquo; rights groups on this island have advocated this as a possible mechanism to be considered.  I personally support it but recognise the difficulties involved.  Because we are in a post-conflict situation, and mechanisms were set up by the Good Friday Agreement, the degree of justice that can be attained will be compromised.  That is the nature of the agreement reached by all sectors.  If justice is not fully served by the conviction and imprisonment of those involved in horrendous acts, we should expect that the information pertaining to those acts be given full exposure.  That was the value of the truth commission in South Africa.  There was no expectation of a court or prison process following the information becoming available.  How we will come to finality on the issue of collusion, how we get this information to the public and how the victims and family members of these circumstances can feel at peace has been left too vague and inconclusive.  Although it is good to air the debate I regret that, following the debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, we lack a mechanism in the form of a motion to progress it.  In having this debate we must think towards an end to the process rather than its continuation.  I have put forward my support for a truth commission and I believe it would have widespread support but I acknowledge the difficulties involved.  If such a process were established, the type of information that would emerge, the degree of hurt and wounds that would be reopened would be difficult for us to handle on all parts of this island.  Most of the political reluctance exists because of the question about whether we really need this and whether we can handle it.  If we are to move on and put behind us a prolonged history of political violence, it is a thorn to be grasped.  We must put up for scrutiny the hidden part of our history.  Until we do so there will be far too many unanswered questions and far too many unfulfilled people in terms of how and why they lost their loved ones.  I hope the political system can devise the means for that to happen soon, in co-operation with all political forces on this island.</P>

        <P>We must be mindful of all victims of collusion and of those who were directly murdered by British state forces on Irish ground as well as all other victims.  There can never be a hierarchy of victimhood.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that the term collusion does not appear in the title of this debate.  Are we afraid to acknowledge that collusion exists?  Do people believe collusion is an illusion?</P>
        <P>In reply to questions from my party colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Taoiseach stated that the Government would facilitate an agreed, comprehensive all-party motion on collusion and provide time to debate it.  I welcome that response because these statements in the Seanad and the statements in the D&aacute;il are inadequate without an agreed course of action or a resolution.  It is not enough to state our views.  I expressed this to the Leader on the Order of Business.  When I voiced my dissatisfaction last week I asked for an all-party motion.  He agreed to consult with leaders of the groups in the Seanad but the same statements are listed on the Order Paper.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that meeting the families of victims of collusion is an indication that the Government will not allow these reports to gather dust on the shelf.  The real indication would be a joint motion.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party are all in support of that.  Even Members from Fianna F&aacute;il would support this.  What is the delay?  In asking that, I acknowledge the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad passed a motion calling on the British Government to establish an independent international inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane.  Two months after that, Mr. Ken Barrett, the only person convicted in connection with the murder, was released after serving three years.  He was brought by the British Ministry of Defence to a secret hideout outside Ireland.  A deal was done in the case of Mr. Ken Barrett.  A guilty plea ensured no trial or exposure of the central role of British forces in the murder of Mr. Finucane.  The same happened in the cases of other British <Col N="999"/>agents involved in the Finucane murder, such as Mr. Brian Nelson.  It is little wonder that the British Government has turned down the request of the Finucane family and the Oireachtas for a full inquiry.</P>
        <P>Collusion is effectively ongoing.  The British system is still protecting its agents and, for them more importantly, still protecting senior military and political figures who ran the system of collusion.  For that reason the pressure must be kept on the British Government, and that pressure should include an Oireachtas motion.  There also should be a dedicated summit meeting on collusion between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  A central focus of the motion, and of the summit, should be the demand for the British Government to release all relevant information in its possession.</P>
        <P>In the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Taoiseach said he could not envisage this information ever being released.  That is not an acceptable answer from the Taoiseach.  Anybody who doubts the reality and extent of collusion between British state forces in Ireland and Unionist paramilitaries need only examine the succession of reports that have been issued.  The Barron report concluded, with regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, that a cover-up involving British forces, the Garda and the Irish Government could not be ruled out.  There are other reports from Justice Barron as well as the reports of the Oireachtas justice committee.  There is the report into the murder of Patrick Finucane and the involvement of at least five agents of the British state in that killing.  The report of the Independent International Panel on Collusion in Sectarian Killings concluded that in 24 of the 25 cases examined, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there is &ldquo;significant and credible evidence of involvement of police and military agents of the United Kingdom, both directly and in collusion with loyalist extremists&rdquo;.  Finally, there is the investigative report of the former Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, into the circumstances surrounding the death of Raymond McCord, junior, and related matters, which exposed the systematic reality and extent of collusion, including collusion in attacks undertaken by loyalist paramilitaries in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention the murder of Donegal Sinn F&eacute;in county councillor, Eddie Fullerton, in his home in Buncrana in May 1991.  I was too young to know Eddie personally but the older Members of the Houses might have known him.  He was a popular elected representative, not only in Donegal but throughout the country.  He was an exemplary republican and a leader in his community.  He was killed in this jurisdiction at the height of the campaign of collusion orchestrated by the British state forces in the North.  The Garda investigation, if one could call it that, was inadequate.  This State has as many questions to <Col N="1000"/>answer about the murder of Eddie Fullerton as the British state.</P>
        <P>The Fullerton family has been campaigning for an independent public inquiry into Eddie&rsquo;s murder.  They received unanimous backing from all parties on Donegal County Council for that call in 2005.  In November 2006, the family finally met the Taoiseach after many requests but no inquiry has been announced or established.  I ask Senators not only to support an all-party motion and a further debate on all incidents of collusion but also the establishment, without delay, by the Government of an inquiry into the murder of Eddie Fullerton.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, who did tremendous work as Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman with regard to many of these controversial incidents, on her appointment as roving ambassador to Timor.  She will be of great value to the people of that country.  One of the key questions facing the development of the peace process is one many other countries have faced, namely, is the past too horrific to deal with and one must move on to the future or can one not move on to the future unless one deals with the past?  In one sense it is a circular question but it is a vital core issue that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Today we are discussing collusion and the reports produced by the justice committee.  I congratulate all those involved in the committee.  They put serious work into the reports, came to conclusions and made strong and blunt recommendations.  We must examine the recommendations and consider how they can be activated.  It is grand to stand in this Chamber and talk about how terrible the bombings were in Dublin and Monaghan in 1972 and 1973.  I am very aware of the murders that occurred in Burnfoot of Br&iacute;d Porter and Oliver Boyce. The family are my constituents.  There was the case of Br&iacute;d Carroll who was killed on the Lifford-Strabane road in 1971, the murder of Seamus Ludlow and other atrocities that occurred in 1975 and 1976.  We can talk forever about those issues, how serious they are and how a resolution must be found, but we cannot get closure.</P>
        <P>The report states that not only did collusion occur but it was widespread.  It seeks greater political impetus in highlighting the fact that it occurred and its scale and in identifying measures to bring closure to the victims.  Closure is an important issue for all concerned.  It also relates back to the question I mentioned earlier &mdash; was it so horrific that we cannot deal with the past and must move on or can we not move to the future unless we deal with the past?  I am charged by the Council of Europe at present to compile a report on the teaching of history in areas of recent conflict.  The concept is whether a multi-perspective should be given on issues in order that we can begin to remove the prejudices and bigotry of the children living in areas of recent <Col N="1001"/>conflict.  If we are to give the children the various perspectives, we must know the history in order that we can teach it.  At present, we cannot get the facts.  We know there was collusion but we cannot get beyond that because we cannot get the information, in this instance from the British Government.</P>
        <P>How can we encourage the next generation to analyse and understand not only the history of their side but of the &ldquo;other side&rdquo;, however that is defined, if we cannot get access to that history?  I am reading a great deal about this issue with regard to Bosnia, Cyprus and Armenia but I should know most about the situation in which I grew up.  Part of the report we did for the Council of Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a BlackBerry which I use to receive e-mails.  I appreciate the point about the courtesy of listening to speakers but I also appreciate that the Houses are geared up for Internet in order that we can e-mail and participate in that way.  I do not know if that was what the Minister of State was doing.</P>
        <P>In compiling my report, I have examined the situation in Bosnia, Cyprus and Armenia.  I should be in tune with what is happening in the North.  An issue that arose in another committee is the attempt to install a gas pipeline from eastern to western Europe.  After World War II, Britain, America and a third country dumped weapons at sea but they will not say where they are.  We are trying to install a pipeline but we cannot get information on where these chemical <Col N="1002"/>weapons are located.  This could potentially cause a problem.  I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and I ask everybody in the British Government and Parliament to explain what is wrong with giving the people of Ireland a chance to put their past behind them by allowing them to examine it.  I acknowledge it is painful and difficult, but the problem is that it is so currently because they cannot get the information.  All sides have experienced pain owing to what has happened over the past 40 years.  Unfortunately, the pain continues.  Contrary to what Senator White stated about the bodies not being found in the bushes, there is still a situation where Mr. Paul Quinn and Mr. Andrew Burns have almost been among those bodies in the bushes.  We must put an end to these activities and people must be accountable for their part in the deeds.</P>
        <P>I want to mention the issue of Councillor Eddie Fullerton.  I mentioned my father already on the Order of Business.  My father was at a county council meeting with Councillor Fullerton the day of the night that he was killed.  What went on and who was involved is a sore point with the people of Donegal.</P>
        <P>Having spoken to Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Loan and others about the case of Mr. Se&aacute;n Brown who was killed in the North of Ireland, I am astonished at the lack of information that can be obtained when people do not want to give the information.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh spoke of setting up committees in the Oireachtas and in Westminster specifically to deal with this.  The Taoiseach had a good relationship with Tony Blair, the previous British Prime Minister, yet we could not get the information.  I would like to think that no committee would be set up unless we thought we were going somewhere within a certain length of time and with a certain credibility from the highest ranks within both the British and Irish Governments.  We do not need lip-service.  This, in a certain way, is lip-service unless there is a decision coming out of it.</P>
        <P>Given that there is to be devolution of justice and other areas to Northern Ireland in May or shortly afterwards, I ask that the Northern Ireland Executive, on assuming the powers, be given all records held in Whitehall of every event and that it would be the committee, with a committee in this jurisdiction, that would deal with not only the findings of what occurred but also the other issues that are still outstanding and waiting to be resolved.</P>
        <P>There is no point in handing over devolved powers to the Northern Ireland Executive and not handing over certain information as well.  If it is handed over, the Executive is then in a position whereby it is entitled to deal with the difficult issues itself.  There has been too much analysis of what information can be given.</P>
        <P>The clergy in Ireland have stood up to a difficult issue in terms of child sex abuse and much information has now been given freely by the Archbishop of Dublin.  The matters before the <Col N="1003"/>House are of equal importance and of greater importance to the people concerned in that people have been murdered.  It is time for the Governments to give up all information on all these issues because we cannot stand over a peace process that deals only with part of the reality of what occurred.</P>
        <P>I again sympathise with those who have gone round in circles for many years on this issue.  I hope the fact we continue to raise the issue gives them confidence.  We intend to support them in finding a conclusion to their quest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make statements on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the violent incidents arising from conflict in Northern Ireland.  A good context in which to put this debate is the acknowledgement in the Good Friday Agreement that: &ldquo;We must never forget those who have died or have been injured, and their families.&rdquo;  I hope this debate will give some consolation to the families of the deceased that they have not been forgotten.</P>
        <P>As my colleague, Senator Dan Boyle, has spoken on the issue, I will focus on the issue of collusion because there is great concern that this issue is not being dealt with adequately and that this debate does not contain a specific reference to collusion.  It is incumbent on the Government to put pressure on the British Government and to use all the opportunities available to it to encourage that government to examine the findings of the Barron report, the report of the Oireachtas sub-committee and the report from the MacEntee inquiry, and to encourage the British Government to address the issues raised by these reports, including full disclosure of information as highlighted by Mr. Justice Barron.  A significant number of the 3,700 murders remain unsolved and families on both sides of the Border still have no explanation why their loved ones were taken from them.  It is clear that justice needs to be served.</P>
        <P>Victims&rsquo; groups, including Justice for the Forgotten, have proposed different approaches to deal with the past.  One recent constructive proposal was a call by a consortium of groups for the establishment of a truth commission.  This approach was advocated previously by the Green Party and it is being considered by the Consultative Group on the Past.  This group will report back to the British Government in June and I hope its recommendations deal adequately with all aspects of the atrocities in questions.</P>
        <P>The victims&rsquo; groups recent call was for an international, independent truth commission.  Other speakers have mentioned the importance of a commission such as this being established.  Its purpose would be to find a way to deal with the legacy of more than 30 years of conflict.  The commission should deal with truth recovery, should <Col N="1004"/>examine truth commissions elsewhere and how they worked, and should agree core principles and values that would be required as part of a truth commission in this country.</P>
        <P>Speaking on behalf of the groups involved in this consortium, Ms Margaret Urwin stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The focus of such a commission should be on truth and acknowledgement rather than prosecutions.  The criminal justice system has frustrated rather than facilitated access to the truth.  All combatant groups, British, republican and loyalist should co-operate in good faith and have a moral duty to do so.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The organisations representing victims of this conflict which supported this call believe that the current investigatory, prosecutorial and judicial arrangements offer no realistic prospect of truth recovery for bereaved families.  They have called for the following motion to be supported by both Houses of the Oireachtas:</P>
        <P LI="1">That this House</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />endorses and approves the interim and final reports of the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the report of the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan Bombing and the three related Barron Reports, including the Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern, Dundalk,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />calls upon the Ceann Comhairle to formally inform the Speaker of the House of Commons of the UK of the passage of the resolution and to send copies of the relevant reports and other documents, with a request that the matter be considered by the members of that House,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />requests the Ceann Comhairle to call upon the British Government, as an initial step and as a sign of good faith in dealing with the legacy of the conflict, to provide access to all the original documents relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction, in particular the Dublin-Monaghan Bombing of 1974 which killed 32 Irish citizens, a French and an Italian citizen.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a reasonable call by the families and groups representing the victims.  The motion should be uncontroversial.  If both Houses of the Oireachtas would agree to do so, we should move ahead with this.  The families of the victims have identified the need for the British Government, in particular the House of Commons, to be called upon to consider the matter and pass the resolution.  This is an issue that will not go away.  It has been debated in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, but that will not resolve what happened in the past or deal <Col N="1005"/>with the legacy of the 30 years of conflict unless it is taken a step further.  There is much good will in both Houses of the Oireachtas towards the families of victims of the violence in Northern Ireland of the past 30 years, but there is only so much we can do.</P>
        <P>The results of the Barron report were welcome and point to interesting information that must be taken on board by the British Government.  I hope that having debated the issue fully today, we will consider supporting the kind of motion that has been drafted by the group representing the victims of the atrocities in the North.  I hope too that we will call on the Ceann Comhairle to forward copies of that motion to the House of Commons and ask the British Government to provide access to the original documents.  This is important in terms of putting this issue to bed.  Unless this is done, we will find ourselves debating the issue again.  The families and relatives are right not to let the issue go as there has not been proper closure on it.  In order to have closure, we need to take the matter further and use our diplomatic and other powers to try and involve the British Government in the way the families feel it needs to be involved so that it will take the kind of action that will help.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the truth commission with an international composition is important.  Other countries look to Ireland because of the conflict that existed in the North for so long and we are seen as having certain expertise and insights into situations of serious conflict from which other conflict zones can benefit.  How we find closure on the issue of the bombings in Monaghan and other situations of violence and conflict in Northern Ireland will be used as a template by other parties involved in situations of conflict around the world.</P>
        <P>It is important we get closure on this.  The recommendations I have made are important in this regard, namely, the setting up of the truth commission and the agreeing of a motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas with the request to the Ceann Comhairle that it be forwarded to the House of Commons seeking the British Government&rsquo;s co-operation in this matter.  There should be little difficulty getting cross-party support for these recommendations.  It is important we are seen to have a clear outcome from the recent debate in the D&aacute;il and our debate here.  I will finish by stressing the importance of moving this forward and taking further action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support previous speakers and the call for a united motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas to advance the cause of this tragic situation.  I grew up in an era when hostilities in the North began to evolve, initiating with the civil rights movement.  At that time Catholics were treated as second class citizens in the North and they showed their anger through a kind of uprising, using the civil rights marches to do so.  Subsequently we had the appalling <Col N="1006"/>situation of the atrocity in Derry in 1970 where many people lost their lives.</P>
        <P>Arising from the need of these people to fight for their rights, civil war evolved in the North over the past three decades.  When the Good Friday Agreement was passed and we held our referendum the substantial majority of the people, both North and South, demonstrated their desire and eagerness for peace by their vote.</P>
        <P>There were some appalling atrocities during the Troubles, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the bombing in Belturbet, the Miami Showband crisis and the alleged collusion.  There are still people in this part of Ireland who believe there was collusion in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  A serious allegation was made that the RIC and some members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were involved in these tragic circumstances.</P>
        <P>When I was a Member of the D&aacute;il, I was not, unfortunately, a member of the sub-committee dealing with the Barron report.  If we consider the whole situation in the North, we see the sad situation we had over many years where Catholics were killing Protestants and where we had a kind of ethnic cleansing in certain areas, which was appalling.  However, when one looks at atrocities where there was collusion, either by the armed forces or the RIC and possibly with the knowledge of State agencies, this raises serious concerns for me and many others.</P>
        <P>In order to bring some closure to the war and these atrocities, it is important that we, the Government, D&aacute;il, Seanad, Northern Ireland Assembly and Westminster, continue to strive in a democratic open fashion to find the solutions to enable us to put aside these appalling events of our past.  Thankfully, since the Omagh bombings, there has been no serious explosion of any sort.  Appalling as that bombing was, it was a catalyst for change.  We now have a situation in the North where both sides are sitting in Government together and working together for the benefit of everyone.</P>
        <P>Both sides suffered appalling consequences of the violence, with over 3,000 people murdered and thousands injured or maimed.  We should learn from our past.  It is a concern that despite all the inquiries we have had, we have not got to the root of the problem or of the various issues that arose.  We had the Cory collusion inquiry process, the Smithwick tribunal of inquiry, chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick a retired President of the District Court, and various Barron reports over the years, but there are still question marks in some people&rsquo;s minds hanging over the activities of, possibly, the Garda and what type of collusion was involved and who knew what.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 were a massive atrocity.  One of the bombs went off quite close to this House, causing mayhem and death and injury to many people.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I laud the efforts of the group, Justice for the Forgotten.  It strived for many years, initially in <Col N="1007"/>vain but with some success more recently, to highlight the plight of many, for example, the atrocious situation where many people disappeared in the North and were never found.  It is an appalling situation when somebody is taken down a back alley and tied up and shot in the back of the head, but at least their body is found and the relatives and the family can find closure in that death.  Those families have some sort of resolution.  However, it is different in situations where, for example, as in the appalling case of the mother of ten children who came to the aid of a wounded British soldier, the person is taken away, executed and the body is never found.  There are several more such cases.  Attempts were made by various groups to resolve these cases and the Taoiseach has expressed his desire that closure be brought for those affected by such appalling events.</P>
      
        <P>For the first time in more than 50 years there is good will, both north and south of the Border and in Westminster, towards resolving outstanding issues, ensuring the peace strategy is strengthened and finding answers regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
        <P>One could ask if there will ever be total closure.  Will the total truth ever be found?  If one looks, for example, at the appalling Whiddy Island disaster in Bantry Bay, which has nothing to do with Northern Ireland, in which 50 lives were lost, despite a tribunal of inquiry, nobody knows precisely what happened that night.  A ship exploded but we do not know where the negligence lay.  I am still not sure, even though as a young, trainee solicitor, I worked at the tribunal in Dublin and Bantry.  The answers to the questions posed by that disaster never emerged.</P>
        <P>I fully support my colleagues who have expressed the unanimous view of this House that we should move forward and try to bring resolution and closure.  That is my heartfelt wish too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate deals with a matter of great national importance.  It is about a series of atrocities perpetrated on innocent people in our country, including the bombings of 1974 in Dublin and Monaghan, which resulted in the greatest loss of life on a single day during the Troubles, when 33 people were killed.  I remember hearing one of the bombs going off in Nassau Street as I worked in the National Building Agency at the time.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s debate is about justice for victims and about how victims and survivors were, and are, treated.  We know more today about the circumstances in which the attacks on Dublin and Monaghan were carried out, the investigations of these crimes and where those investigations failed.  We must recall that when we revisited this issue in 2000, we were shocked to realise the limited time that had been given to the investigation of the bombings.  We were embarrassed, as a <Col N="1008"/>nation.  Senator Jim Walsh, as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Women&rsquo;s Rights, played a key role at the Barron hearings, which I had the honour of attending as an observer.  The most difficult issue was the fact that it took 25 years to reopen the investigation, as the files on the atrocities were closed in August 1974.  That fact will never leave us.</P>
        <P>Thanks to the work of the committee, the testimonies and experience of victims and their families have been heard publicly and in an appropriate way.  We saw the emotion, pain and anguish of the survivors and the families of those who had been killed.  It was a searing experience.  It is difficult to imagine how it must have felt for them, to have to wait 25 years for a real investigation to take place.  The Taoiseach made an apology in the D&aacute;il on behalf of the Government for the premature closing of the investigation.</P>
        <P>The issue of collusion between the security forces and paramilitaries in perpetrating these attacks always has been a central, unanswered question.  Sadly, that remains true to this day.  Our Government, led by the Taoiseach, has consistently called on the British Government to meet its responsibilities, to co-operate with inquiries in this State and to help the process of discovering the truth about what happened.  In the past month, the Taoiseach reiterated his call on the British Government to be up-front and fully participate in these investigations.  In the D&aacute;il on 30 January 2008 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The willingness of the British authorities to co-operate with the various inquiries has been tested and in many cases found wanting.  We tried to address these issues by establishing inquiries into certain important and representative cases in discussions with the British Government at Weston Park in July 2001.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At Weston Park, the Taoiseach tried valiantly to persuade the British Government to fully co-operate.  For our part, under the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Michael McDowell, an investigation into the deaths of Superintendents Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan was set up and is now proceeding under Judge Peter Smithwick.  While inquiries are under way in the cases of Mr. Robert Hamill, Ms Rosemary Nelson, whom I knew personally through my activities as an observer on the Garvaghy Road, and Mr. Billy Wright, an inquiry into the death of Mr. Pat Finucane has not been established by the British Government.  The Taoiseach has made it clear that he wants an independent inquiry to be held, as recommended by Judge Peter Cory.</P>
        <P>We have reached a profoundly positive new stage in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  Relationships between unionism and nationalism, between North and South and between east and west have never been better.  What drives us all now is the determination that never again shall <Col N="1009"/>our people experience and bear witness to a terrible conflict.  The work of reconciliation must continue and the victims and survivors must be as much a part of the future as they are of the past.</P>

    <Title>Forestry Issues: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on forestry, for which I have special responsibility in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I intend to briefly highlight for the information of Members the importance of forestry to farmers, the economy and the environment in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global warming.  I will outline why it is vital that forestry be sustained in the years ahead through encouragement and incentives to farmers for new planting.  I look forward to Members&rsquo; contributions on this important matter.</P>
        <P>It is useful to put forestry in context.  The area of the national forest estate is some 700,000 hectares, more than 10% of the total land area.  While this has expanded significantly since the mid-1980s with the introduction of grant schemes aimed at encouraging private landowners, mainly farmers, to become involved in forestry, it is relatively low compared to our EU counterparts given that 35% of the total land in the EU is under forest cover.  Of the national forest estate, more than 57% is in public ownership through Coillte and the remaining 43% is in private ownership.  Some 25 years ago, 85% was in public ownership and 15% was in private ownership.  Approximately 16,000 plantations are privately owned, predominantly by farmers.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that the full economic contribution of forestry goes far beyond the forest gate.  Ireland&rsquo;s forestry comprises a growing sector, a vibrant forest industry and a modern harvesting and transport sector.  The growing sector comprises many small and medium sized enterprises that service Ireland&rsquo;s woods and forests, including forest nurseries, consultants, self-assessment companies and forest contractors.  The processing sector includes conifer and hardwood sawmills that rely on the growing sector as a source of raw material.  There are nine large to medium sized fully automated sawmills and approximately 100 small sawmills.  There are also four boardmill processing industries, which utilise a combination of small roundwood, recycled wood and wood waste.  Finally, there is the harvesting and transport sector that forms the essential link between the growing and processing sectors.  Total <Col N="1010"/>employment in the forestry sector is estimated at 16,000 persons.  This all generates considerable economic activity and benefits in the wider economy and more especially in the rural communities.</P>
        <P>The current processing requirement is just under 4 million cu. m. per annum and there is a current deficit of 400,000 cu. m. per annum, which has to be met through imports.  There is an established and growing industry based on raw material from Irish forests and it is important that continuity of supply of this raw material is maintained.</P>
        <P>Farmers are now the key people engaging in planting.  Forestry is a realistic land use option where there are 100% establishment grants for the planting of trees and an annual tax-free premium of up to &euro;573 per hectare for up to 20 years.  An additional premium of up to &euro;200 per hectare for five years is available to farmers in the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, who join the forest environment protection scheme, FEPS, and plant part of their land in accordance with that scheme.  I was pleased to introduce a number of significant changes to the FEP scheme last week.  The main changes were a reduction in the minimum size to five hectares for farms with less than 30 hectares and, in respect of bigger farms, to dispense with the sliding scale and pay a flat rate premium of &euro;200 per hectare, for planted areas of eight hectares or more, irrespective of farm size.  Based on what the sector has conveyed to me, these changes to FEPS should provide a boost to our planting figures.  I was, therefore, pleased to be able to deliver this package as it is further evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to forestry and an acknowledgement of forestry as a positive contributory factor in the areas of the economy, rural development, climate change and renewable energy.</P>
        <P>Forestry is a source of real income for the farmer in terms of an annual income from the premium, in the medium term from the returns from thinnings and in the long term from the end value of the crop.  Last April, for example, almost &euro;57 million was paid out in the annual forestry premium payment under the forestry programme.  As I have already mentioned, this is an annual tax-free premium.</P>
        <P>Due to the current strong market demand the price for timber in Ireland is very high.  First thinnings that two years ago were sold standing for between &euro;1.50 and &euro;3.00 per cu. m. are now fetching &euro;8.50, which makes it more attractive than ever to thin early.  As the quantity removed at first thinning is usually between 40 and 50 cu. m. this represents an income of &euro;340 to &euro;425 per hectare.  Where the harvesting of stake material is an option, a higher income will be realized.  The national forest inventory, which we published in December after a two year survey of the Irish forest estate, estimated that 21,000 hectares of forest established in the private sector are at a stage where they could be thinned.  There is an attract<Col N="1011"/>ive financial benefit in farmers and landowners taking immediate steps towards thinning their forests thus gaining income from thinnings and adding greatly to the timber value of their forestry assets.  If I have two messages to contribute to today&rsquo;s debate one relates to income value for farmers and the other is that 21,000 hectares are ready to be thinned and doing so is in farmers&rsquo; interests.</P>
        <P>A number of producer groups have been established throughout the country, which are, with funding from my Department, currently promoting thinning and developing local markets for those thinnings.  It is also important to note that while most forests are ready for first thinning from year 15, the crop may be thinned on a five-year cycle thereafter.</P>
        <P>Another important return that is sometimes not fully taken into account when evaluating forestry as a possible enterprise is the end value of the timber crop.  Currently, the estimate for the value of timber at clearfell stage ranges from &euro;12,000 to &euro;15,000 per hectare, depending on a number of variables including market prices, crop quality and species.  It is important to note that income from sale of thinnings and timber at clearfell is tax-free.  The increase in the price of timber by some 20% to 25% in the last 18 months was encouraging because as demand rises for this renewable product so too must returns to producers, primarily farmers.</P>
        <P>Forestry should be encouraged because it offers a substantial income to landowners annually in both the medium term and long term.  There are also other non-monetary factors to be taken into account such as the way in which various enterprises complement each other, the type of land and how labour intensive and time consuming an enterprise is, especially if a farmer is also working part-time off the farm.</P>
        <P>Not only should we encourage new planting as a source of income for farmers, we should also appreciate the other significant benefits accruing from forestry.  There is increasing awareness and appreciation of forestry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> its role in climate change.  Climate change is now a top political priority as we address ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global warming over the period to 2020.  Forestry has a distinct role in addressing climate change in the Irish context.  Our existing forests represent a very significant store of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, and our recently completed national forest inventory has shown that it is many times larger than the total annual emissions of greenhouse gases.  The store is growing rapidly, particularly in younger forests planted since 1990, which are removing over 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on an annual basis.  These forests are well below their maximum annual carbon dioxide uptake with the result that the period to 2020 will see a rapid increase in annual sequestration to in excess <Col N="1012"/>of 4 million tonnes.  National investment in afforestation, particularly since 1985, is the main reason that forests are contributing to climate change mitigation at this level.  This is borne out by the fact that in the 23 years since the introduction of the forestry grant and premium scheme 200,000 hectares of new forest, over a quarter of the entire forest area of the country, have been established.</P>
        <P>As well as reducing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the new forests will lessen the cost of Irish compliance with our Kyoto Protocol targets.  Over the five years between now and the end of 2012, estimates are that over 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be taken up by forests within the Kyoto Protocol framework, resulting in potential savings of more than &euro;200 million to the State, at current purchase prices of &euro;20 per tonne of carbon dioxide.  Should the current carbon accounting frameworks continue beyond 2012, the annual contribution of forests to national compliance, in today&rsquo;s costs, will be close to &euro;100 million.  To sustain this level of contribution to climate change continued investment in the afforestation programme will be required over the coming decade and beyond.  Not only will forests remove carbon from the atmosphere, they will also make a sustained contribution to renewable energy targets and the development of the wood processing sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Policies and measures targeted at increasing the use of a range of renewable energy sources, including wood biomass, are set out in the White Paper on energy and the biomass action plan for Ireland.  Forestry is well placed to contribute to these goals by producing clean renewable wood fuels from Irish forests.  The forest service of my Department and the National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, an agency of my Department, have estimated that wood energy has the potential to contribute emissions savings in excess of 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum by 2020 if the full range of measures envisaged, from heat, combined heat and power, and power generation are realised.  Wood, once it is procured from forests that are sustainably managed, where trees that are felled are replaced and forest cover is maintained, is a carbon neutral fuel source.  It can be renewed indefinitely.  Harvesting, on the scale needed to supply both the traditional wood product outlets for pulp and sawlog and the emerging energy market, needs to be rapidly developed over the coming years.  In recognising this need we have put in place capital grants for the purchase of wood energy harvesting equipment.</P>
        <P>Wood energy harvesting, processing, installation and maintenance will create many new jobs in rural Ireland and, by displacing energy imports, will aid security of supply, one of the key objectives of Irish energy policy.  Already a number of companies are involved in the supply of wood energy for heating.  To date, Sustainable Energy Ireland has grant aided 128 biomass boiler pro<Col N="1013"/>jects, about 52 MW of capacity, 73 of which use wood chips, 45 of which use wood pellets and 10 of which use a combination.  In addition 3,500 pellet boilers have been installed under the greener homes scheme and a further 1,500 applications are being processed.  In line with these developments new pellet production and storage facilities are coming on stream, with two in the process of being constructed.</P>
        <P>This wood energy market creates a market for thinnings from forests during their growing cycle.  As I have mentioned, many of the farm forests that were established in the late 1980s and early 1990s are now close to thinning, which improves the quality and increases the size of remaining trees, allowing larger commercial timber to grow.  The developing wood energy market will create an outlet for such thinnings.  However, once these markets are developed there must be continuity of supply into the future and this is another reason it is necessary to encourage new planting.  There are many factors affecting the rate of planting, both within and outside our control, and we need to address what we can.  I requested Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of this Department, to undertake a study on the factors affecting the rate of afforestation in recent years, given the many incentives to plant already available to landowners.  I look forward to receiving his report shortly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have concentrated on the significance of forestry as a source of income to farmers and its role in climate change and renewable energy.  I am not overlooking the role it has to play in the environment, in the provision of recreation and to society generally.  We are currently appreciating those benefits.  We need to ensure forestry is still around in the years ahead to continue to provide those benefits to our children and to future generations.  The time to act is now.  There is ongoing coverage of the consequences of deforestation throughout the world.  We need to ensure forestry remains a feature of the landscape and economy and continues to provide an income stream for farmers and a steady supply of material for the timber and energy sectors.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I am committed to the sustainable development of forestry and I hope Senators, as public representatives, will assist me in this objective through the encouragement of new planting and the development of the sector generally.  I thank Senators for affording me an opportunity to outline the position of forestry in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, a former colleague of mine in both the Seanad and D&aacute;il, to the House in which we both started our political careers in 1987.  I wish her well in her new position, which is an onerous and interesting ministerial portfolio.  Of all the work done by Departments, the development of forestry presents a win-win scenario.  Forestry has a <Col N="1014"/>significant and positive contribution to make to farming, the environment, the economy, the timber industry, wildlife, energy substitution and the generation of new energy sources. </P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was littered with statistics, which is usually a negative sign.  However, the figures she provided were interesting and I noted some of them.  I had, for instance, forgotten the proportion of the Irish landmass covered in forest.  According to the Minister of State, the figure now stands at approximately 10%, compared to a European average of 35%.  While we cannot expect to reach the EU average, there is significant scope for further progress.  Having said that, a debate has commenced on the utility of food production versus energy crops.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food this morning, I pointed out that from a global perspective food is becoming scarcer, with food production having been in deficit for the past five years.  This imbalance will need to be addressed.  While we cannot devote all available land in Ireland or Europe to forestry given the importance of food production, expanding forestry remains both necessary and feasible.</P>
        <P>The first forestry grants were introduced approximately 20 years ago.  The Minister of State cited an interesting statistic on the proportion of Irish forests planted since that date.  While the figure is significant, one must ask the reason the response has not been greater, given the generous grant aid available to farmers to plant forests and the added incentive that income from forestry is tax free.  Interest in afforestation has not increased as quickly as it should have.  The REP scheme solved certain problems but created others, whereas the new scheme, which combines REPS farming and forestry, will be a useful step forward.  I welcome progress in this regard and ask the Minister of State to ensure the scheme is developed further.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of the Government and rural communities to significantly increase the level of forestry plantations.  If farmers and growing agencies do not respond to the substantial grants available, it may be necessary to increase grant aid or to offer further incentives, particularly in light of the timber deficit in the Irish market.  Timber is one of the few agricultural products Ireland must import in significant quantities.  The Minister of State should be able to sell to her colleagues in Government the case for increasing afforestation grants, particularly given the impact of forestry on income substitution, family farm income and the environment.</P>
        <P>It is the environmental aspect of forestry that catches the public imagination most.  Members of the public are tuned into environmental matters much more than in the past.  Even the youngest schoolchildren now speak of global warming and climate change and everybody accepts that forestry plantations and planting trees have a posi<Col N="1015"/>tive environmental impact.  We must consider the issue from this perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Energy substitution and maximising the use of wood chip fuel and old-fashioned timber offers scope to reduce our reliance on oil and other imported fuels.  The Minister of State referred to the green energy grants scheme which was welcomed by all sides.  While Government revenues may not be flowing as freely as they did three or four years ago, it was disappointing that one of the first measures taken by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan of the Green Party, was to reduce the value of some of the grants available to householders to switch to more environmentally friendly heating systems.  This decision should be reviewed.  While it is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s specific responsibility, the Minister should revert to the more favourable rate of grant aid.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility to make grant aid available and the Minister of State&rsquo;s role to ensure the product, that is, timber, is available.</P>
        <P>We should aspire to having energy friendly heating systems installed in all houses, old and new.  The issue of supply was brought to my attention as soon as people began to install wood chip and wood pellet boilers.  I am pleased, therefore, that the Minister of State indicated that a number of new plants are being established to meet demand for these products.  There is little point in Members encouraging constituents to switch to an alternative or green fuel system if the product is not readily available.  I understand most wood pellets are sourced from the North.  The establishment in this jurisdiction of factories producing wood pellets would be a welcome development.</P>
        <P>Forestry has a significant and expanding role to play in terms of the environment, which is an area people readily understand.  We should encourage this development.  As I indicated, the development of forestry is a win-win scenario.  The more of it we have, the better it will be for rural areas, farming communities, rural sustainability, the environment and future energy supplies.  The statistics speak for themselves.  It is one of the few products we can grow naturally for which a gap exists in the market.  We are not talking about European subsidies or any degree of false State aid.  We are talking about simply supporting what we need not only for the present but well into the future.</P>
        <P>Whenever one drives past a forestry plantation whether it be 40, 50 or 60 years old, one gets a great sense of where one is and one reflects on who planted it and the farmers who existed.  This is another positive side to our forestry industry.</P>
        <P>Five to ten years ago a difficulty existed in some parts of the country, in particular in the west of Ireland.  Senator Ellis is present, and his previous constituency colleagues often spoke to me about it.  I remember a former Member of the D&aacute;il, Ted Nealon, speaking many times about marginally viable farming land put up for sale <Col N="1016"/>being purchased by people who planted forestry.  This is one of the difficulties but we cannot have it every way.</P>
        <P>The grants system gives a premium or advantage to the growing of forestry in less marginal areas and it is also making it more appealing in those parts of our island which previously were not deemed to be attractive for forestry growing.  We are getting more balanced development, which I welcome.  However, as in all walks of life we cannot have it every way.  We cannot grow more trees from an environmental and energy point of view and bemoan the fact that farming land is lost.</P>
        <P>We should not move away from the important food <i>versus</i> energy debate because it must be addressed with regard to food from a world perspective.  We have scope at home to significantly increase our plantations.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s ongoing interest and developments in this regard.  The role may be deemed what is termed a &ldquo;junior ministry&rdquo; but it is extremely important to the development of rural Ireland, our energy supplies and our environment.  I wish her well in her endeavours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bradford finished on a point I was going to make.  I attended many public meetings &mdash; I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Reilly was also called to many &mdash; on the problems caused by private afforestation companies backed by pension funds and other operations which did not need to make a commercial return.  They forced a number of farmers out of business by being able to pay more for land for forestry because of the tax breaks available to them.  This has had a major detrimental effect as far as certain parts of the west of Ireland are concerned.  The land in question was not always marginal land as better plots of land were available and taken out by forestry companies.</P>
        <P>The grant scheme was tiered so hardwood was at a higher rate than sitka spruce or pines.  The net result of this is that 15 to 20 years ago every bit of reasonably good land in my part of the country was forced into afforestation.  If one was not able to pay more than the private forestry companies one did not get the land.  Rather than being able to expand one was put out of business because once forestry was introduced alongside one&rsquo;s farm one had problems with vermin and other problems associated with forestry.  Nothing can be done about this now but I predict that within 20 years all of the trees will be pulled out because the land will have to return to food production.  It is becoming marginal as to whether we will have trees or food to feed the people on the planet.  This is already happening in some cases.</P>
        <P>Forestry plays a major role in helping to improve the environment.  At one level, it is important that carbon is removed.  However, nobody ever mentions a major negative caused in the west by indiscriminate planting beside watercourses and rivers whch is that all of the fish were <Col N="1017"/>killed.  Whether people want to admit it, when the needles fall and rot an acid is secreted and seepage of this into our watercourses has killed off fish in many smaller rivers.  We all know this and we must accept it happened.  I do not know whether it could have been avoided but it might have been if we had proper planning regulations and people were only allowed to plant deciduous, hardwood or non-coniferous trees within 20 m of watercourses.</P>
        <P>Grant assistance is of great value to those who receive it.  However, as first thinnings are taken out after 20 years the first crop of any farmer who plants and maintains forestry is yielded after 15 to 20 years.  After this, no income is received until the next thinnings.  It is not a viable prospect for any farmer, although it is a viable prospect for investors or insurance companies.  It is being peddled as a farm crop and it should be explained that the first thinnings will be after 20 years and the only income after this will be made from timber sales.  People under 50 years of age see this as a cash cow for 20 years, forgetting their life expectancy can be up to 80 years and they will have ten years of no return.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford mentioned wood pellets.  Many people discovered recently that at one stage this was a monopoly market and supplies were tight.  The costs rose significantly from what was originally predicted 18 months or two years ago.  While it is market-driven, it should be examined.</P>
        <P>Problems with clear felling are arising now with regard to what was planted 20 or 25 years ago.  Clear felling of land leaves scars on our landscape and should be dealt with.  Tree-felling licences should be issued on the understanding that clear felling should not occur within 15 m or 20 m of roadways.  Timber should be left to allow a new forest to build up or to be replanted.  It should also be mandatory that tree felling licences be issued with the condition that replanting should be done within one year.  Areas have been left for years before they were replanted.  This is probably because grant assistance is not available to replant land which has been clear felled.  I do not know what the departmental officials will state about this.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the matter in her reply.</P>
        <P>Lack of maintenance of forests frightens us all.  Once the fences went up and the gates were locked much of the land which was planted was forgotten about.  A great deal of private forestry has been badly maintained.  The net result of this is that only a fraction of a potentially decent crop is produced and this is wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is also wrong that people are paid grants without a proper annual inspection system.  A farmer receiving a single payment grant can have two, three, four or five inspections per year depending on how it falls.  One can have an inspection for the new suckler payment, for REPS, an area-based inspection and an entire stock check.  Forestry is planted and cleared, <Col N="1018"/>checked over for the first year or two and after that the grant is paid without question.  I could show officials sites which could be described only as scrub.  Furze took over before trees got established.  It is now the case of an odd tree coming up through the furze but the landowner is still paid the grant aid, which is wrong.</P>
        <P>Proper provision must be made to ensure roads are not damaged during clear-felling.  Leitrim County Council is always seeking moneys from the Department and elsewhere to cover damage done to roads by tree-felling operations.  This also leads to communities becoming agitated and not wanting more plantations.</P>
        <P>I note in the Minister of State&rsquo;s projections the proposed figures are dropping.  They will drop more despite her best efforts because people have copped on that while it may be attractive at the start, forestry plantations after 20 years leave nothing else but timber sales.  They may be tax free, suit pension funds and those with a considerable income other than from farming.  A farmer, however, getting into forestry planting will not see the returns down the line for which he would have hoped.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State claims the average value of thinnings, the first crop between 15 years and 20 years, works out at &euro;150 and &euro;200 per acre.  That is the total income other than grants for the first 20 years.  I accept every five years, a certain amount can be removed from a plantation and the final clear-fell could be between &euro;12,000 and &euro;15,000 per hectare.  However, having to wait for 40 years to reach the final clear-fell and taking in other factors such as felling costs, what one receives for the timber and an unreliable market means one is entering into an uncertain business.  It is a tempting prospect for certain age groups.  It is the way to go for those who are 65 years.  A 45 year old farmer will see a reasonable income for 20 years.  However, when he reaches 65 his concern will be his pension.  He will not get any pension from the farm.  If he had maintained it even as a farm, the leasing value would be much higher than the forestry income after 20 years.</P>
        <P>The implications of forest plantations should be fully explained to those wishing to get involved.  Forestry is needed from an environmental point of view but it is a two-edged sword.  There is the environmental and structural damage from clear-felling.  There is also the question whether the cost-benefit analysis will show it is worth it for the farmer in the long term.  Those with marginal agricultural land should be encouraged to plant.  It is not the best option for those with less marginal land, on the knife edge so to speak.  I do not understand why Coillte leaves large tracts of clear-felled land unplanted, leaving the countryside scarred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest figures to hand indicate the forestry industry accounts for approximately 0.3% of annual gross domestic product with some 16,000 people employed, <Col N="1019"/>either directly or indirectly, in the sector.  In excess of 16,000 private plantations have been established, the majority, more than 14,000, established by farmers.</P>
        <P>In 2005, &euro;57.8 million in forestry premiums were paid out to forest owners.  As well as the timber benefits, non-timber benefits are becoming increasingly important such as recreation, carbon storage and the biodiversity benefits of forestry.  This is approaching a value of &euro;100 million per annum.</P>
        <P>Some 25% of our forestry cover is now broadleaf, a massive shift from the traditional conifer forestry.  This change is as a result of the Government&rsquo;s grant aid policy which financially encouraged woodland owners to plant broadleaf species.  The Minister of State confirmed 43% of forest estate is now privately owned.  The pattern of Irish forestry has changed to one of smaller forests with greater species diversity.  Also, it is gradually coming down from the peat uplands to the lower lying mineral lands.</P>
        <P>I welcome these developments as they will bring about a significant and positive change to our landscape and facilitate the development of a widespread wood culture.  It will bring about a mixture of different habitat types and contribute to the increased biodiversity of our countryside.</P>
        <P>Despite these notable advances, all is not as rosy as one might think.  The forestry service&rsquo;s recent detailed survey of our forestry indicates a forest cover of just 10%, well below the European average.  The Government&rsquo;s strategic plan, entitled Growing for the Future: A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector, published nearly 12 years ago, set an annual target of afforestation of 20,000 hectares until 2030.  This target has never been achieved, neither in this century or in the years leading up to it.  The level of afforestation was as low as 7,000 hectares in 2007, 35% of the target set out in the Government&rsquo;s strategic plan.  This is an indication of the level of ongoing interest the Government has in the industry, in developing it and in supporting the 16,000 people who derive their livelihoods from it.  The figure of 35% is not even a pass rate.  It is a shameful record.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the era of peak oil and ever-increasing energy prices, the value of a renewable and home-grown wood energy takes on an increasing importance.  Ten years ago the cost of a barrel of oil was as low as $20; now we are hitting $100 a barrel.  What will a barrel of oil cost in another ten years?  It is time for the Government to be proactive, increase investment in the forestry industry and assist it in realising its full potential.</P>
        <P>Climate change has become an issue mentioned in the House every day and has permeated many debates.  Forestry makes a significant contribution to our environment.  It is accepted by all sides in this House that forestry plays a key role in delivering our targets under the national climate change strategy and the national biodiv<Col N="1020"/>ersity plan.  New forests established under grant aid since 1990 will qualify as areas that will contribute to Ireland meeting its emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol.  Forests planted since 1990 will absorb approximately 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year over the next four years.  This can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
        <P>This highlights the need for the Government to show more initiative in adopting an appropriate and well-thought out strategy for the development of the forestry industry.  It should reward woodland owners for the environmental benefits that accrue from their forests.  In doing so, the Government undoubtedly would entice more farmers and landowners to commit their most valuable asset &mdash; their land &mdash; to forestry.</P>
        <P>The IFA&rsquo;s farm forestry committee put forward an interesting idea of a green forest payment.  This would be paid annually to woodland owners for the wide range of non-timber benefits which their forests provide.  Currently, the Kyoto Protocol provides no mechanism to reward woodland owners financially for the positive environmental and non-timber benefits provided by their forests, a good concept worthy of serious consideration.  I urge the Minister of State to consult with her Cabinet colleagues, with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and with other stakeholders to see whether such proposals could be introduced.</P>
        <P>There are some grave shortcomings in the management of our forests.  The Forest Service has pointed out that 87% of private plantations are not thinned.  This is an alarming figure.  It has been speculated that if we thinned half the plantations that are currently suitable for thinning, we would obtain more than half a million cubic metres of wood.  At a time when we are trying to encourage alternative energy projects such as wood chip burners, it seems incredible that we are content to leave more than half a million cubic metres of wood in our forests.  The Government should encourage private woodland owners &mdash; financially or otherwise &mdash; to thin their forests, and we should make use of this perfectly good resource that nature has provided.  That this resource is out there unused and untapped is a great shame.</P>
        <P>We are blessed with perhaps the healthiest forest estate in Europe, but we must continue to do everything to ensure the good health of our forests.  We need to maintain the strict regulatory policies that have protected our plantations.  I urge the Government to continue to insist on the most stringent regulations regarding the importation of timber and timber products.  We have seen that the Government has recently been less rigorous in the area of cattle importation and has allowed cattle to be brought here from different regions of the world.  This has resulted in the introduction of diseases that were never here before and has raised fears about the overall health of our herd.  I would not like the same to <Col N="1021"/>happen in the timber industry.  Imported timber must be accepted only from pest-free regions of the world.  The task is great, and climate change will not make that task any easier.  The increases in temperature mean that insects and pests are on the move.  We need to be prepared and vigilant.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that we are the biggest importers of rain forest timber in Europe.  We need to be adamant that all timber imported into Ireland comes from sustainably managed woodlands.  The Labour Party believes that sustainable forestry is of huge importance in securing the continued viability of rural Ireland.  We are convinced that forestry remains a major option for effective land use in this country.  Our forests contribute enormously, and beyond simple monetary value, to the economic, environmental and social well-being of our society.  For these three reasons, I urge the Minister, and particularly her Green Party colleagues, to commit themselves to action on this, to follow through on their commitments to the industry and to encourage increased forestry cover in Ireland.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate her on the introduction of the forest environment protection scheme.  The Minister introduced the FEP scheme on a pilot basis in early 2007, and it is testament to her eagerness to have it implemented that she has brought it forward so quickly &mdash; we are now only in the first months of 2008.  I particularly welcome it because it gives people in my area, where land is marginal, an opportunity to plant.  I especially welcome the reduction in the minimum size to 5 ha. for farms with 30 ha. or less.  For bigger farms, the sliding scale has been dispensed with and instead, a flat rate premium of &euro;200 per hectare will be paid for planted areas of 8 ha. or more, irrespective of farm size.  This is good news for both small and large REPS farmers with enhanced incentives.  It is also good news that their entitlements will not be affected, which is very important in that part of the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to consider the fact that some very marginal land has been planted in years past and this has been of little benefit, especially in the north west and west of the country.  Large areas have been planted but there has been no great return from this.  People have received grants, but the planting is a blight on the landscape from a sightseeing point of view.  Many <Col N="1022"/>of these trees were planted on virgin bog.  If the land had been left alone it would have been of equal use.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis also alluded to the condition of roads and fences left by forestry activities.  I concur that there should be some provision to deal with this.  At the moment, when trees are felled and removed from the forests the roads are sometimes left in a terrible condition, but people still have to use them.  I know there are grants in place in this regard but they are not being used properly.  In west Mayo, which is the most scenic area of the county, trees have been removed in the past four or five years without being replaced or the areas refurbished.  It is an eyesore.  Large numbers of tourists go through this area and they ask why this has happened.  The local population is also angry about it.</P>
        <P>Demand for timber is high.  In the west there are a number of facilities producing wood stakes, which have provided employment in these areas.  For example, the Gaeltacht Co-operative in Corr na M&oacute;na, was set up by our former colleague, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, before he became a TD or a Minister, and there is the facility at Hollymount.  These employ quite a number of people in the production of these raw materials.  This is important to the local economy, which does not have a high employment rate.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the proposal that many more broadleaf trees be sown on good land.  The Forest Service is considering this.  These trees are vitally important and they look good.  I know they take a long time to mature but we must look to the future.  We may not be around to enjoy them but they would be good for the country and the economy.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and for her introduction of the new scheme.  Many farmers in my part of the world will welcome the extra payments that will be given out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  It is my first opportunity to wish her well in her role.  I know very little about forestry.  Many years ago the area of forestry was covered by the Department of Lands and Forestry, but it suddenly faded out of the picture and I no longer heard any discussion of this issue.  When I heard the Minister of State was to receive this new brief I thought she was in a win-win situation.  Forestry is good for the economy, for farmers and for the environment, especially in view of climate change.  The Minister of State has a major role to play here.  She can turn it into anything she wants but it will be a success story.  I know she is working towards this in all of the areas I mentioned.</P>
        <P>I love trees.  I love walking in the environment and looking at old trees and talking about them.  They offer a whole new way to consider our environment and our archaeology, and the world out there wants wooded landscapes.  We do not <Col N="1023"/>want to be surrounded by flatness but to have the feeling of woodland.  It is beautiful to see the old trees in blossom.  The Minister of State has a golden opportunity to improve the environment.</P>
        <P>We know the introduction of the new FEP scheme is good for farmers, and Senator Carty has talked about this.  The Minister of State has spoken about the various grants that are now given to part-time farmers to supplement their incomes.  This is a golden opportunity for the farming industry and an opportunity to rethink the area of agriculture from the point of view which used to prevail many years ago.  It is good to see it coming back into play and to see that the Minister of State has been given a significant role in changing it for the farmer and industry.</P>
        <P>It is terrible that we import wood because I love hurling.  I am always talking about hurleys, particularly my team in Waterford which I love to see.  Yet we import this timber when we have a golden opportunity, particularly in respect of ash which is needed so much.  There will be considerable interest from now until next October, so the timber is needed.  We have the hardwood saw mills about which the Minister of State spoke.  We talked about the transport aspect of it and how important it is for the economy.  We can turn this industry into a world industry.  We have the potential to make it a real industry for the country.</P>
        <?oasys _dc18- ?><P>I wish the Minister of State well.  I admire what she is doing and will fully support her endeavours.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0- ?></Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the general welcome extended to the Minister of State.  We served together on an Oireachtas committee some years ago to good effect.  We must be concerned about the statistic that 10% of the land in Ireland is under afforestation, while the EU average tends to be in the range of 35%.  Bearing in mind the food shortage and all other considerations, we should still aspire to having a greater proportion of our land planted.    </P>
        <P>We must also put more emphasis on native tree species.  We may have an over-reliance on non-native softwood species.  These are falling in price and, in some instances, are being imported more cheaply.  We must affect something of a balance between hardwoods and softwoods and tilt the balance more in favour of hardwoods.  I recognise that softwoods produce a more immediate income and that they have a shorter developmental span, which is important in terms of creating an economic return.  However, an emphasis on hardwoods is necessary.  We have traditional hardwoods in Ireland which are very much part of our original landscape.  I recommend that the Minister of State looks at strategies to achieve that.  I understand that only 3% of our planted land is planted with traditional hardwoods, which bears consideration.  We should be concerned about the fact that we import Canadian and US hardwood and ivory.</P><Col N="1024"/>
        <P>We need to put more emphasis on regular felling, which is not happening in our forests.  There needs to be more regular thinning and there should be an outlet for that.  Pellet burners are an obvious outlet for tree thinnings.  It is important for the health of forests that regular thinning be carried out.  It should also be an important economic factor in terms of getting a return from the thinnings, creating jobs and contributing to our GNP.  The fact that we do not have sufficient output from thinnings and the potential for jobs need urgent consideration.</P>
        <P>We should be promoting hardwoods.  Afforestation contributes so much to absorbing carbon emissions.  I understand that it saves approximately &euro;200 million annually in respect of carbon emissions absorbed by our forests and not having to pay fines imposed under the Kyoto Protocol.  As we approach 2020 and try to reach the new agreed levels of carbon emissions, afforestation must be a very important strategy in that regard.  The potential of our forests to absorb carbon emissions is of considerable importance.  It will be of considerable importance in respect of hardwoods because despite their long developmental life, they would be very useful from that perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ellis mentioned the fact that fellings are taking place and are not being replaced, particularly by the State agency.  I agree with him because I have witnessed it on occasions.  I suggest to the Minister of State that this needs urgent attention.  We cannot leave an eyesore or allow under-productivity or no activity on the land in question.  In the context of global warming, it is almost criminal if this is the case.  It does not happen too often but it should be monitored.</P>
        <P>The climate change element is very important.  If we are to reach the proposed level of emissions and the European target of a 20% reduction for 2020, it will take a combination of strategies, of which afforestation must be one.  Afforestation and our forests&rsquo; contribution to recreation, our tourism infrastructure and our quality of life cannot be underestimated.  At the risk of sounding parochial, my experience of dealing with Coillte in this regard has been positive.  I found Coillte to be proactive in terms of maintaining its forests and making them attractive to tourism.  I understand that the element of Coillte&rsquo;s budget that is devoted to the development of forests as a local resource could be looked at because there may be the potential for more development there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the risk of sounding parochial, there is a very beautiful area called Castle Lake at Bailieborough where I live.  While these matters are local, they have national relevance.  The Dun an R&iacute; Forest Park is located  nearby.  The renowned Lough Key Forest Park is located over in Roscommon.  Castle Lake is in a very beautiful setting and contains very nice forest walks.  There has been considerable development there hence my reference to my experience in dealing with Coillte, which has done very good work there. <Col N="1025"/> However, this needs replication.  There is further room for improvement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is enormous potential for areas like Castle Lake in Bailieborough and Dun an R&iacute; Forest Park to be resources for a local community, particularly in terms of health considerations and more free time, and to be resources that improve our tourism product.  I invite the Minister of State to visit the Castle Lake area in Bailieborough.  It is worthy of examination because it is a very beautiful example with further potential for development in which more money could be invested.</P>
        <P>The IFA has made a number of recommendations to Mr. Malone&rsquo;s inquiry.  I understand it is proposing that it should not be obligatory to reforest after the life of a forest has expired.  I suggest the Minister of State takes this recommendation on board.  Farmers do not like the idea of committing themselves, their children and their children&rsquo;s children to afforestation.  It is enough to commit to one life cycle of trees.  The likelihood is that they will continue in the vast majority of cases but the option needs to be there.</P>
        <P>A green forest payment as an extra incentive in the context of the expenditure that will be necessary to reach our Kyoto Protocol targets needs examination.  A green forest payment and the removal of the replanting obligation would be good incentives to develop the forestry sector.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept my invitation to Castle Lake in Bailieborough to look at it as a practical example of what has already been achieved by Coillte.  It is a resource that is greatly used by the local community and is attracting visitors.  It has so much potential for further development.  That could be the pilot study in which the Minister of State could invest heavily and from which she could extrapolate nationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to the House.  I congratulate her on her new portfolio and wish her well with it.  I have no doubt she has various ideas on the way she would like that portfolio to develop and change.  Perhaps I could be so bold as to make some suggestions to her.</P>
        <P>The Green Party has long been interested in the issue of forestry and we now find ourselves a party of Government along with the Minister&rsquo;s party.  We have made several commitments in the programme for Government, which I will mention, that I believe will be positive in the area of forestry, but in a general way I hope the Minister might examine the area of forestry and the narrow commercial focus that has been brought to bear on forestry in recent years and begin to change that somewhat.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers pointed out that there are many other benefits and dividends from forestry that are not just the narrow economic and commercial benefits we might focus on when discussing forestry in a debate such as this one.  There are a range of environmental services such <Col N="1026"/>as fresh air, clean water, fertile soil and climate stability.  Trees help prevent soil erosion, drought and flooding and as previous speakers pointed out, only 10% of our land area is tree covered even though the average in other European Union member states is approximately 30% to 35%.  It is something we must consider in terms of encouraging forestry but also examining its value and the returns it provides for this country in a broader way than the narrow economic way it is sometimes viewed.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers spoke about climate change.  What we are doing regarding the Kyoto Protocol and the emissions reductions targets we have agreed to is factoring carbon dioxide emissions into the economic cost-benefit analysis when we are examining any economic activity.  It has been pointed out that trees provide a carbon sink; they are what we might call carbon assets.  The non-timber benefits of forestry must be emphasised and previous speakers spoke of proposals that have been made where farmers might get financial support in terms of the non-timber benefits of the forestry projects in which they engage.  In the light of the Kyoto Protocol and other commitments this country has made, we should examine that because if we do not we will end up paying fines for being in breach of the targets to which we signed up.  It is much more positive to do something constructive such as encouraging more forestry with all of the other environmental and recreational benefits to which people have referred.  Trees have an aesthetic value and contribute to landscape character and improving the quality of all our lives.  I hope the Minister might take that broader approach to developing forestry in this country than has been taken to date.</P>
        <P>I refer to a study the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department commissioned and that yielded interesting information.  A national forestry inventory was carried out by her Department and it involved a detailed field survey of Ireland&rsquo;s forests to assess their composition and also the condition of the entire national forest estate, both public and private.  It established that there are 2.4 billion trees growing in forests in the Republic and that they contain 30 million tonnes of carbon assets, which is considerable.  My county of Wicklow emerged as the county with the highest percentage of forest cover, at 18%, while Cork had the largest forest area with 77,700 hectares.  The inventory took three years to complete and established that 10% of the State&rsquo;s total land area is under forest.  It found also that 57% of the forests in the State are now in public ownership while 43% are held privately.  Interestingly, of the private forests, 30% were grant aided and 13% were held in other ways.</P>
        <P>The survey also found that almost two thirds of the national forests are under 20 years old, which is worrying and suggests that the newer planted forests are part of the shorter-term commercial forestry as opposed to the longer-term approach to forestry mentioned by previous speakers that <Col N="1027"/>involve the planting of broadleaf trees, preferably native ones, and forestry that will be longer-term in its duration and lifespan than the short rotation commercial forestry such as the Sitka spruce and other commercial forestry.</P>
        <P>The inventory also gave a breakdown of the type of trees that are being grown and established and pointed out that 25% of the national forests are broadleaf and the remainder, 75%, are conifer tree species.  It established also that more than 20% of the afforested area was planted with native tree species and one quarter of the forest stands had three or more tree species present.  Of major importance was the discovery that there were no significant threats to the health and vitality of the forests, which was a welcome finding.</P>
        <P>In the programme for Government we have committed jointly to promoting a diverse forestry culture with an emphasis on native trees, and the Minister of State indicated her intentions in the area of increasing the supply of native trees.  We are also committed to ensuring forestry continues to give an important income stream to farmers through the forest premium scheme that has been substantially increased under the partnership process.  We have agreed to develop new markets for thinning linked to the increased need for renewable energy sources.  We have agreed also to promote forestry plantation to increase biomass production demand in the building and fuel markets and to provide carbon sinks to combat climate change.  We have agreed also to review the forest environmental payment schemes pilot, which is under way, with a view to a full roll-out in the years ahead, and to reviewing the forest premium levels and ensuring a minimum of 30% broadleaf will be planted annually by 2012.  I hope that when this target for broadleaf is being achieved we emphasise the importance of native broadleaf and not just broadleaf generally.  We have agreed to initiate a review of the Forestry Acts and programmes to reflect sustainable, social and environmental objectives.  That is a welcome objective.</P>
        <P>An important report was drawn up recently of which I would like to remind the Minister of State.  I understand she is aware of its existence.  It was the joint COFORD-EPA report, Biodiversity in Irish Plantation Forests, which made 57 recommendations, including a call for the establishment of a biological record centre.  Some of those actions would involve the Department of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, but I hope there would be close synergy between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in terms of complying with some of those recommendations.</P>
        <P>The bioforest project, which was one of the largest undertakings on biodiversity research conducted in Ireland, concluded that in general forestry plantations could make a significant contribution to biodiversity if they were properly planned but, if not, would have a negative effect. <Col N="1028"/> The study also found that each local authority should establish ecological advisory units.  It pointed out that in the past local authorities have not had the in-house technical expertise available to comment on conservation issues pertaining to grant applications, particularly forestry related conservation issues.  However, the appointment of heritage officers has begun to remedy that deficiency and the establishment of ecology units would rectify the situation.</P>
        <P>Another far-reaching recommendation of the report was that semi-natural habitats should not be afforested unless there were mitigating circumstances.  It recommended that, where possible, improved grassland or arable land should be used for afforestation instead of semi-natural habitats, especially in landscapes that were dominated by intensive farming.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will put to the Minister of State one or two of the objectives from the Green Party&rsquo;s manifesto in the area of forestry, which ties in with the objectives we have agreed in the programme for Government.  The Forestry Act 1988 should be reviewed to restructure Coillte, so that it gives equal consideration to the social, recreational and environmental objectives necessary for a sustainable forestry programme.  An immediate restructuring programme of existing plantations should be implemented to address the problems apparent after a policy of planting non-native, fast-growing conifer monocultures and a research project should be set up to identify the range of broad leaf species with economic potential.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&ldquo;Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmaid?  T&aacute; deireadh na gcoillte ar l&aacute;r.&rdquo;  This is true in contemporary Ireland.  Our philosophy in the 1930s was one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough but that has changed over the decades.  This is a different Ireland under the EU.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, with whom I had many dealings in her former portfolios.  I have happy memories of her visiting west Cork with a different brief.  She acquitted herself well and people still talk of her visits to CoAction Bantry.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we have a sad record on the plantation of forestry compared to Europe as a whole.  I am delighted with the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to support afforestation.  As a farmer&rsquo;s son, I have been an advocate of the REPS scheme for years and have encouraged people to get involved in REPS 1 to 4.  A significant amount of farmers work in an environmentally friendly way.  They are encouraged to do it and it is good for areas such as the Sheep&rsquo;s Head, the Mizen Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula where there is a mixture of tourism, scenic routes and afforestation.  In areas such as Glengarrif there is a natural wood where Coillte has done much good work.  I am encouraged by the announcement of extra grant aid to farmers.</P><Col N="1029"/>
        <P>I do not wish to rehash the points already made.  For someone who was involved in setting up the Sheep&rsquo;s Head way, a renowned walkway on the peninsula, it is wonderful that &euro;4 million has been provided by the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs.  The same marked walkways exist in Beara and Kerry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support developing forests, as well as the point made by Senator de B&uacute;rca on greater balance.  We had a tendency to plant conifers rather than our native deciduous trees 20 or 30 years ago.  I am glad to see our native types encouraged.  We had wonderful oak forests before my time and before the history of this State.  We must examine what is native to Ireland.  I am not anti-conifer but it is a Scandinavian breed of timber.</P>
        <P>Only 20% of the dairy farmers who farmed when I was a child are left today in places like west Cork.  Dairy farming has become more intense and the farmer with 15 cows is no longer at the races.  Such farmers are dying out.  These farmers are engaged in REPS, which is the type of support needed to encourage people to remain on the land.  Afforestation has great potential in creating jobs.  Not before time there is a tendency in the construction industry to build a type of house that is environmentally friendly, with less wasted on heating.  I recently examined the possibility of a wood chip burner for the house in which I live.  These are very efficient compared to the days of the huge coal fires.  We have an obligation to the next generation to ensure we have an environmentally friendly way of dealing with issues.</P>
        <P>Afforestation has a significant role to play in this.  I am pleased to see the Minister of State take a proactive approach to encourage afforestation in a sensible manner.  We do not wish to destroy our landscape.  I was a councillor for nearly 20 years and received complaints about country roads near Gougane Barra, the Borlin Valley and the Ballydehob area where the harvesting of trees damaged roads.  This matter has been resolved due to an arrangement between local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that ensures that roads are repaired after huge trailers transport logs to the timber processing plants.</P>
        <P>In the next 20 years I wish to see greater intensity of afforestation.  With the concept of setaside, there are arguments that with much of world grain being used for biofuels we may have to row back and decide that land should not lie idle because of some EU regulation.  We may be forced to use it to grow wheat or barley.  There is more land than ever in my lifetime available for afforestation.  This is due to the changing patterns of farming.  This can be handled in a sensible way.</P>
        <P>What I like about the proposals is that, under FEPS, a small farmer with some mountain and some lowland can grow up to eight hectares and receive grant aid assistance.  Under the FEPS premium, it is payable in addition to the existing <Col N="1030"/>afforestation scheme.  In addition to grants and premia, a farmer planting eight hectares or 20 acres for the duration of FEPS can earn an annual tax free forestry premium of up to &euro;6,000 without affecting his or her single payment.  It is a wonderful suggestion that should be promulgated more.  Many farmers in remote areas of Ireland may not be aware of this.  I appeal to the IFA, an organisation for which I have great respect, to use and promulgate these schemes to add a sense of security to subsistence farmers.  These are not commercial farmers, they have a place in rural Ireland and I love to see them supported.  I support the initiatives of the Minister of State and wish her well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  The use of statements by the Upper House of the Oireachtas provides an opportunity to outline the contribution of forestry and the reasons it is vital to sustain the industry in the future by encouraging new planting now.  All Senators outlined the importance of forestry and the new planting story.  Some made suggestions on what we should do.  If I had addressed this House three years ago, I could have pointed out that one of the key things people were saying at that time was that much of the land that was not available for food production, such as mountain land, was planted and that the next step was to make it attractive for the farmers in the rural environment protection scheme by including forestry on the REPS land.  Many speakers, particularly Senator Carty, referred to the changes in the REPS.  Last year we announced FEPS as a pilot scheme and it made a huge difference in encouraging REPS farmers to get involved in forestry.  One of the key messages that should be conveyed from this debate is the value to the farmer of planting forestry, especially the REPS farmer.</P>
        <P>Initially, the farmer or landowner could calculate that the cost of planting was 100% covered and that there was a premium of &euro;550 or &euro;570 per hectare for 20 years.  However, that was competing with the REPS payments for environmental farming.  That is the reason we introduced the FEPS pilot scheme last year and rolled it out this year.  The extra &euro;200 top-up is what makes it really attractive for REPS farmers in 2008 to consider new planting.  I had the pleasure this week of visiting a farm in County Meath.  The farmer is going into forestry for the first time.  This farmer was involved in cattle and sheep farming as well as holding down a part-time job.  He was having difficulty maintaining his farm.  He has decided to plant 50% of his farm and the key advantage for him is that he will keep his single farm payment and get the additional money from forestry.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis made an important point about the income flow through the years from forestry.  In the case of the farmer I mentioned, for the <Col N="1031"/>next 20 years he will receive the original planting grant, the forestry premium and FEPS for five years as tax-free income in addition to his single farm payment.  Furthermore, the farmer does not just thin on the fifteenth year but can thin every five years thereafter until clear-fell.  There is an income from thinnings.  Ten years ago that income was not as good as it is today.  Owing to wood energy and the use of wood pellets and wood chips, thinnings are now a real source of income for farmers.  There are 21,000 hectares of forestry available now for thinning on land planted 15 or 20 years ago.  Farmers should thin those forests now and avail of the income from the wood energy market.</P>
        <P>At least four speakers, including Senators Ellis, Carty and O&rsquo;Reilly, raised the issue of Coillte.  They mentioned the positives and negatives of the agency and the State planting programme.  On the positive side they mentioned the recreational issue and the importance of recreation.  On the negative side they mentioned the issue of replanting and the protection of roads.  These are important matters.  If Senators are aware of any examples where Coillte has left land for longer than 12 months without replanting it, we would like to know about it.  There is an obligation to replant the land.  We talk to Coillte regularly about the protection of the county roads.  The roads element in which we are involved is funding and grants for forest roads so the timber can be taken out of the forests.  We do not wish to see the local authority roads abused.  We certainly are anxious to know more about the replanting concerns.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to hear Senator de B&uacute;rca make substantial references to the national forestry inventory.  We published this document before Christmas.  It is a two-year survey of forestry in Ireland and an important work.  I am delighted the Senator took the trouble to read it in such detail and to quote from it.  It is an important statistical document which tells us exactly what the situation is and what must be done.  The Senator drew some important statistics from it.  She also referred to the importance of working closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  It is important and, in fact, I and my officials are due to have a meeting with the Minister soon.  Forestry is an important issue for the environment.  Senator Ellis also raised environmental issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important we do the right thing for the environment but it is also important to have a proactive approach to planting new forestry.  In various parts of the country where there is acid sensitive land, people are concerned they are being refused the opportunity of planting on their land for environmental reasons.  We are working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and if a real environmental issue arises, we will work together on it but if not, we must examine ways of planting <Col N="1032"/>the land.  An example that arose last year was with regard to the hen harrier.  We discussed this extensively and found a regime within which planting could take place in hen harrier areas.  It is important for the future that we can plant land where possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford and Senator Ormonde described forestry as a win-win enterprise.  I am delighted to be the Minister with responsibility for forestry.  It is a fabulous story and an area where we can make a real difference.  The timber is needed in the timber industry while forestry is good for recreation and the environment.  From the farmer&rsquo;s point of view it offers a good income and forestry is needed for wood energy.  There are many reasons to promote it.  There are gaps in the market for the product and those gaps, if they do nothing else, emphasise the need for new planting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to native hardwoods and softwoods and Senator Bradford mentioned the gaps in the market for them.  Senator Bradford said my opening statement was full of statistics but I hope they were useful.  I will offer some further statistics now which I hope also will be useful.  It is important to see where we are going.  The figures show why forestry and the timber industry is important.  The softwood market in Ireland, which provides trusses, floorboards and skirting, grew a great deal as more houses were built.  In 1995, Ireland was using 307,000 cu. m. of softwood while in 2006 it used 825,000 cu. m.  However, 60% of that wood was imported.  Senator Bradford spoke about importing wood when we should provide it from our forests.  The hardwood market is of greater concern in many ways.  In 2006, the sawn hardwood market in Ireland used 3,435 cu. m. and 95% of that was imported.  Those bald statistics demonstrate why forestry is so important.</P>
        <P>We are planting an average of 7,000 hectares per annum but I agree with Senator Ryan that we must plant more.  That is the reason we are providing so many incentives for planting.  However, what are we clear-felling?  We are clear-felling 8,000 hectares per annum.  The wood products sector provides direct employment for 6,500 people.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="5" />
        <P>If we are clear-felling 8,000 hectares we need to be planting more than that.  That is one of the reasons I am so pleased we are having this debate because we were able to highlight the benefits which exist today for farmers considering getting involved in forestry.  If there are any gaps in what the Department is doing, we are glad to hear from Members about them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some Members referred to the report the Department is undertaking under Mr. John Malone, the former Secretary General of the Department.  Before Christmas we asked Mr. Malone to undertake this report and we expect him to come to us shortly with his findings.  Some Members referred to the IFA document that was submitted to the report and to the many others <Col N="1033"/>who also made submissions.  We are looking forward to the report and are always open to ideas.  We are in a business where ideas are important.  In this regard we are only too glad to give strong consideration to ideas that were brought up by Senators during this debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford also raised the fact that much of the agricultural land used for forestry was not suitable for food production.  From our point of view, it is important to make mountainous land attractive to the REPS farmers, and also the other lands that are available for forestry.</P>
        <P>I would fully encourage biomass and the mainly wood industry of pellets and chips.  I agree with Senator Bradford that the incentives are good and that we needed to go a little further with the creation of FEPS.  We are always interested in looking at what more can be done.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty made a point about FEPS.  As he is from Mayo, I must tell him we made big changes to FEPS following many calls, particularly from people in Mayo, on the provision regarding the minimum of eight hectares.  We brought that minimum down to five hectares with the view to encouraging smaller farmers.  I should point out that FEPS has been such a success story for us in the pilot that we also made changes at the bigger end to allow farmers access to the payment of &euro;200.  The changes we made have been encouraging.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty referred to broad leaf, as did Senator de B&uacute;rca and others.  It benefits from the higher rates of premium.  We have reached the 30% level in terms of planting of broad leaf, which was the balance in the mix referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and others.</P>
        <P>Some Senators commented on the roads.  I agree with the points made regarding the protection of county roads.  I also agree with the point made on the importance of replanting from clear felling.  Senator de B&uacute;rca and others asked about the replanting obligation in that regard.  It is an issue we are looking at in the present review of the legislation.  We are not here concerned with the removal but the relaxation of the planting obligation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators, including Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and de B&uacute;rca, who referred to tourism recreation, which is important.  The neighbour wood scheme and the visit to the forest are important but our main focus this year is on new planting.  There will be no forestry for our grandchildren if there is no new planting today.  The reason we are able to enjoy the benefits of forestry from an environmental and recreational point of view is because our ancestors planted in days gone by.  Senators also referred to the importance of forestry in the context of climate change and I agree with the views expressed.</P>
        <P>Regular thinning of the forestry was mentioned by many Senators.  It is one of the important messages we would send from today&rsquo;s debate.  I was fortunate to visit a research site in Wicklow where one could see the difference.  There was <Col N="1034"/>one forest which had been regularly thinned and there was another where the gate had been closed.  They were next to each other.  In the first there were tall trees full of good solid timber which was wonderful to look at.  In the second there were small, bushy trees.  They were both planted on the same day but without thinning, the trees in one were not allowed grow.  The impact upon the timber of the trees not allowed grow was considerable.  Today it is worthwhile because of the income the farmer could get from the thinnings.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan made an important point regarding vigilance on imports with which I agree.  Our plant imports are subject to EU law, as is the entire timber store.  I agree all of that is important.  The Senator also referred to the fact that the management, including the thinnings, must be done on a professional basis.  I agree with that.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to the 10% cover and I agree with their call that it should be greater.  My Department is providing the incentives to encourage more farmers to plant.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to the situation regarding narrow commercial forestry.  While we are focusing on the importance of new planting, we are not ignoring the important issue of the environmental and other benefits.  I agree with the Senator that the policy must be science based.  COFORD, as an agency of my Department, is involved in the research area.  The more research we can do, the greater the benefit to those involved in forestry and also to those involved in the environment, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  We can work together on a science-based approach and are supportive of it.  I dealt with the point Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised about broad leaf, the 30% being achieved and its inclusion in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>On the question of COFORD and the EPA report, a biological record centre was set up in Waterford two years ago.  For the information of Senators, the forest service has full-time ecologists and archaeologists, which is an important area for us to address.</P>
        <P>If I have not answered any questions important to Senators, I ask them to let me know.  I hope I have covered everything.  I have taken substantial notes and we will consider the ideas the Senators came up with during the debate.  The forestry section of the Department is always open to ideas because it is a win-win situation for the economy, for the farmer who gets involved in it and for the environment.  On those three grounds alone, we must be open to ideas in the future. I thank the Senators for holding this debate and for being so supportive of forestry.  We should encourage farmers to be aware of the new incentives to plant, especially the REPS farmers.  We would ask farmers to work with us in using the cash that we are now providing to encourage them take up forestry.  We would ask them to work with us, as <Col N="1035"/>the farmer in County Meath did this week.  He is retaining his entire single farm payment, planting half his land and getting all of the incentives.</P>
        <P>I also ask those who planted 15 or 20 years ago to work with us now in terms of thinning those forests.  It is in farmers&rsquo; interest to do so and it is also important from the point of view of both wood energy and the future of timber.</P>
        <P>My message to the House is that this is a solid, win-win issue.  I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.</P>

    <Title>Economic Outlook: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in light of the changing economic outlook of our economy, calls on the Government:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />to accelerate the reforms of the sectors of our economy under its control and to dramatically improve the productivity and competitiveness of Government provided services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />to respect the role of the Oireachtas, as the legitimate forum of decision making for the people of Ireland, by fully informing the Oireachtas on the national pay talks in a timely fashion;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />to ensure that vital infrastructure is delivered on time and gives value for money to the taxpayers of Ireland; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />to ensure that the necessary funding for all levels of the educational system, research and development, and IT development is provided so that we can deliver the knowledge-based society that Ireland must become in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is no doubt our economy is in good shape overall.  It is no thanks to Government policy that it has remained in such good shape over recent years, but rather to the hard work and diligence of the people who have made great sacrifices over the past 15 years to deliver what has become known as the Celtic tiger.  Things are changing, however, and the situation is no longer the same.  We hear constantly in the media that if we do not take control of our economic problems, we will have to make difficult decisions later.  We are already making them.  In some respects Fianna F&aacute;il has taken over the role of the Progressive Democrats and has become quite a tough right-wing part of Government.</P>
        <P>The tough decisions being made now are ones that hurt the poor, the sick and the elderly.  For example, the Health Service Executive is trying to deny operations to young sick children on the basis of costs.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, announced in the <Col N="1036"/>D&aacute;il today that she intends to cut back on devolved grants to schools.  She has already cut summer works projects and schools are now being asked to pay for their water.  This is a dramatic change in society in a short time.  The Government already is forcing the people to pay for its mistakes.</P>
        <P>Let us look at this from the economic point of view.  What do we expect from our economy?  We want an efficient public sector and a competitive cost base, but there are problems in both these areas that are not being dealt with.  Given that we rely heavily on foreign direct investment, we need an open and transparent democracy to prevent corruption which has a negative effect on how we are seen by people outside the country.  We also need an infrastructure that allows our economy to change quickly and respond to growth, and a workforce with the necessary skills, training and education.</P>
        <P>One area in which the Government is falling down particularly badly is in the provision of services under its control.  Energy, transport and water charges have increased.  It is not only water charges for schools that have increased.  Water charges for businesses increase constantly.  Rates and waste costs are also increasing and these costs are hitting businesses hard.  Now that construction has decreased significantly, levies for county councils will decrease.  The knock-on effect of this failure by Government to contain costs is that local authorities will have to increase their rates, water and, possibly, waste charges in the coming years.  This is a result of the failure to deliver efficient local and Government services, despite the promises made so often.</P>
        <P>The new buzz words are &ldquo;the green agenda&rdquo;.  This agenda is no more than double taxing or a means of increasing taxes.  The Green Party must wake up to what is happening in our economy and start bringing forward proposals that will benefit rather than damage the economy.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is a significant issue.  It has been ignored by the Government but will creep up on it very quickly.  Competitiveness in the private sector has increased by 46% in recent years but only by 7% in the public sector.  The public sector has grown dramatically in recent years and makes up 20% of our economy.  If we continue to have poor competitiveness and productivity in Government services and if significant costs continue to be involved, this will spell disaster for our economy in the next few years, especially if we cannot maintain the massive growth that has been very much driven by the private sector.  If we do not keep up that level of growth, we will run into major problems.  This is the warning the European Union tried to give the Government this morning.  It needs to wake up to what will happen to our economy if it is not careful.</P>
        <P>Infrastructure is incredibly important to the economy but we are not investing enough in transport, roads, rail and ports.  Our broadband is <Col N="1037"/>a standing joke internationally.  For a country that prides itself on being an open, fast-moving economy that is in touch with what is happening around the world, broadband roll-out has failed miserably and is a national disgrace.</P>
        <P>The extent to which house owners have been screwed by the Government will become more apparent at the end of the year when we see the huge drop in income from the construction industry.  What is happening in the construction industry is a lesson for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.  Once builders realised they no longer could sell their houses at inflated costs, they slashed their prices.  They tried first to use the usual gimmicks of new kitchens, cars and holiday vouchers, but when they realised these would not work, they slashed their costs and brought them back to 2005 price levels.  In leaner times we need fewer gimmicks and more value for money.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to wake up to the need for value for money in all the services for which Government is responsible.  Ireland has been lauded on its low unemployment rate of just under 5% and I accept this is low by European standards.  We must ask whether we are getting value for money from the retraining and reskilling of our workforce and from the education programmes for workers.  There is concern that significant sums may be going to waste in this regard.</P>
        <P>I was very disappointed by the Government&rsquo;s efforts to dismantle the community employment schemes.  These schemes are a social scheme and do not exist to provide an educated workforce.  They have proved excellent where they have been set up and allowed to operate properly.  If we consider many of the F&Aacute;S training schemes and courses, however, we must question the value for money obtained from those.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General should examine this area, Ministers should stop deluding themselves and consider whether we get value for money with regard to training.</P>
        <P>I have noticed there appears to be a significant number of people going on permanent or temporary illness related disability payments rather than saying they are unable to attend work.  Has there been a significant increase in the cost of providing social welfare payments?  If there is such a significant increase, this will have a knock-on effect in future years when there is less money and scope for the Government to spend money on these services.  If there is an issue with why people cannot work, we need to investigate it more.</P>
        <P>The Government must look at the cost of reskilling and retraining people for new jobs, especially people leaving the construction sector.  Unfortunately, too many young men did not go on to college or to learn a trade or skill when they left school but went straight into the construction industry where they were well paid.  They are the first to lose their jobs in the slowdown happening in the construction sector.  Rather than the <Col N="1038"/>Government coming up with more harebrained ideas, which is what it has been doing in recent years, we must make sure we get good value for money from retraining these young men in order that they can continue to make a valuable contribution to our society.</P>
        <P>We have heard a lot of talk recently, from the Taoiseach down, stating that the problems with our economy are a result of the challenging global climate.  That can be described only as poppycock because the problems in our society can be sorted only out by us.  Crying into our glasses and blaming what is happening in America and elsewhere is of no benefit to the people of this country.  The problems in our economy are made by this Government and its policies and we want the Government to come up with innovative ideas to sort them out.</P>
        <P>Last May, Fianna F&aacute;il, through the Minister, Deputy Brian Cowen, said there was nothing to fear regarding the Irish economy because the party would ensure continued growth in our economy and the maintenance of a positive economic outlook.  Unfortunately, we have seen with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s amazing, technicolour rainbow Government, that the dazzle is going very quickly.  Now we are told it is the global economy that is causing the mess, but it clearly is not.  Many of these problems have been made at home and are a result of a failure to deliver on the good times.  Broadband is a clear example in this regard, but the same poor value for money has happened in the areas of road and railway infrastructure.  We have been talking about redeveloping our ports for the past ten years and the failure to do so could put us at a severe disadvantage in the next ten years.  The Government is simply too slow in making vital decisions.</P>
        <P>The backlash for the Government will probably come from the unsheltered section of our economy, where the concept of a job for life never existed.  Many people do not yet realise how much of a raw deal they have got in the past and will get in the future, when the economic situation gets much more difficult.  When people start losing their jobs, there will be grave problems because many of them are highly indebted.  This is something for which we must make allowances.</P>
        <P>In 1983, when this country was considered to be in a serious financial predicament, our debt was basically the debt of the State.  The Government had done most of the borrowing.  Today this country is still in as much debt as it was in 1983, but most of the debt is personal.  The ordinary men and women in the street are now responsible for the debt.  We must make allowances for that in the context of the future of the economy.  We must ensure that people do not become bankrupt, lose their homes or suffer disadvantage in any way because of the enormous level of indebtedness.  It is also important that we look after the people who are outside the Government&rsquo;s responsibility.  The Government is responsible for <Col N="1039"/>pensions and pay rates.  The current pay talks should be discussed in detail in this House and not negotiated in private in Dublin Castle.</P>
        <P>We have a responsibility to the people who have made the Celtic tiger what it is today.  We must ensure they are not disadvantaged by any Government decisions made in the next two or three years, especially in the context of the cutbacks being made in the areas of health and education, as well as in terms of the way we deal with crime and the infrastructure in our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to second the motion.  I will elaborate on some of the points made by Senator Twomey and respond to the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.</P>
        <P>I concur with the analysis offered by Senator Twomey regarding the origins of our economic success.  In the past number of years, we have completely opened up our borders, society and economy to the global economy.  This opening up process coincided with an economic miracle that was taking place.  The entire global economy, primarily led by the United States of America, experienced one of its strongest periods ever, with global economic growth, low inflation, low unemployment and rising productivity.  During that period, Ireland was in a very good position and was able to ride the crest of a wave.  The opening up of our borders and society, to coincide with this global phenomenon, ensured we benefitted from it and our economy grew.</P>
        <P>During that time, however, we should have ensured that when the favourable economic environment changed, we would be still in a good position.  We would then be able to ride the crest of less fortunate waves and ensure our society and workers would be protected against a slowing down of the global economic growth we have enjoyed.  That this did not occur is why Fine Gael  tabled this motion this evening.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the United States of America and the United Kingdom, neither economy is technically in recession.  Both economies are experiencing an economic slowdown but their Governments are working to correct this and to re-stimulate their economies.  In Ireland however, we are already making cutbacks, even though we are only at the beginning of a change in the economic environment.  We can see the first signs of change and potentially stormy weather in the global environment and already we are making cutbacks in HSE expenditure, summer works schemes, school building programmes and so forth.  This is happening because the Government completely failed to lay the foundations for future growth.  It failed to ensure that when things were not going so well in the wider world, we would be in a position to protect our economy and those working in it.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on public sector reform and the position of our education system, particularly with reference to lifelong learning and the need <Col N="1040"/>to upskill our workforce.  On the latter point, I have heard much discussion in recent months on the need to upskill workers in our economy.  F&Aacute;S published a report in 2007 on the skills status of our workforce.  The centrepiece of that report was the fact that between 500,000 and 700,000 people&rsquo;s skills would have to be completely upgraded in order to ensure they would be able to gain employment, become prosperous and contribute to the economy.  It is almost a badge of pride for the Government that it managed to identify that such a large group of people needs retraining.  However, it should have asked some years ago what it should do to ensure such people did not actually exist, that there were not hundreds of thousands of people within our economy in need of urgent retraining and upskilling.  Now that the economic outlook has deteriorated, that enormous amount of work must be done.</P>
        <P>That such retraining and upskilling has not taken place represents a lamentable failure on the part of the Government.  The reasons for the need for such upskilling are several.  In the past few years, many people entered the workforce who had not completed second level education.  The last OECD report showed that 38% of our workforce did not have secondary education.  To find ourselves, at the end of a period when there was enormous growth in Exchequer funds, coupled with an enormous increase in funding for education, in a position where four out of ten workers do not have a leaving certificate, is a disgrace.  The Government and the economy will have to deal with the consequences of that in the coming years.</P>
        <P>When one examines the other economies which are well set up to deal with the global economic downturn, one of the things they have in common is the fact that, for at least the last decade, they have invested in preschool education.  Thus, when their students exit the education system, their minds will have been influenced at the earliest possible stage, ensuring they have the capacity to learn more skills and languages and be able to adapt to a very rigorous and demanding competitive environment.  The fact that, after ten years of a Fianna F&aacute;il led Government and many years of the Celtic tiger, we do not have a preschool system in place to ensure our workforce is equipped to deal with the challenges of a rapidly changing, competitive economic environment, is entirely the fault of the Government.</P>
        <P>The issue of public service reform is mentioned in the amendment.  Every time we get into a discussion such as this, there is a significant debate on the additional amounts being spent or people being employed.  However, we must consider what we are getting in return.  The Minister for Finance has made two efforts in this respect, both of which ended in complete failure.  The expenditure review initiative scheme was announced in 2002-03 and considered large areas of capital and current expenditure to determine what value for money and outputs were being delivered, but <Col N="1041"/>none of the reports from the scheme have been published.  The scheme&rsquo;s replacement programme, the value for money scheme, produced 93 reports seeking to identify how millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money was being spent and what was being achieved in return.  Some 66 of the reports were due to be published by the end of 2007, of which only one third has been published.</P>
        <P>Given that we will ask people working in the private sector and the non-sheltered economy to work harder and to make better decisions on how to spend their money, the Government&rsquo;s singular failure to publish the reports, to follow through on any of the expenditure review initiatives it has discussed or to ensure that value for money and outputs are being delivered is a legacy, the consequences of which will become apparent in coming years.  For this reason, the motion we are proposing is timely.  If many of the amendment&rsquo;s provisions had been carried out in the past decade, we would be better placed to deal with the challenges of a more threatening global environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to position the economy for sustainable development over the years ahead, while adapting to the reality of more moderate growth in the future;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />notes the progress to date on public sector reform and welcomes the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to progressing public sector reform;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />notes the Government&rsquo;s objective in entering talks on a second pay agreement under Towards 2016 of achieving a sustainable pay deal compatible with improving competitiveness and productivity and the Government&rsquo;s intention of fully informing the Oireachtas as appropriate about progress in this regard;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />commends the Government for the progress made in enhancing the delivery of infrastructure on time and on budget and the measures put in place by the Government to speed up the delivery of vital strategic infrastructure;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment, as set out in the National Development Plan (2007-2013) and as underpinned by the provision in the Exchequer multi-annual capital envelope to spend an annual average of 6% of GNP on capital projects, to addressing infrastructure needs; and</P><Col N="1042"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to continued support for the development, enhancement and modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s education sector and Ireland&rsquo;s Science, Technology and Innovation sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate, in respect of which we should express our gratitude to the Fine Gael group for using its Private Members&rsquo; time to deal with issues important to the economy.  Given the current environment, it is imperative that we visit this subject on an ongoing basis so that the House can contribute its opinions to the Government through the Minister or Minister of State in attendance in a meaningful way.</P>
        <P>Like many economies, the Irish economy is facing its most difficult environment for some time, with both domestic and external headwinds likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion in the short term.  We all know this; it has been acknowledged on the other side of the House that we have come out of a period of unprecedented growth, the foundations of which were laid in the mid-1980s and from which we have reaped the benefits since.  A series of challenges have presented themselves primarily due to external factors, particularly the credit crunch, the sub-prime issue in the United States, the dollar situation in terms of the competitiveness of our exports and a number of other matters.</P>
        <P>While new housing output has been domestically forecasted to be approximately 55,000 &mdash; it could be less &mdash; compared to 80,000 last year, it is clear that the demand for housing remains strong.  Rents are rising by approximately 11% per year.  The output is likely to stabilise at equilibrium levels once confidence is restored.  Speaking as a practising member of the auctioneering industry, there has been a significant increase in the number of inquiries since Christmas compared to the October-November period of last year.  In itself, this is an indication of an element of confidence returning following the budgetary measures by the Minister for Finance and a growth in confidence in general terms.</P>
        <P>The external environment is more challenging.  For example, growth is set to moderate in our two major export economies, the UK and the US.  The exchange rate has appreciated and, notwithstanding some improvements in recent weeks, conditions in the financial markets have not yet normalised.  GNP and GDP growth of 2.8% and 3%, respectively, is expected this year.  The fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong, which will help to absorb the housing and external shocks in our medium-term prospects.  We have a dynamic and well-educated labour force, as mentioned by Senator Donohoe, but we need to upskill and to keep this matter under review.  With the level of ongoing and committed Government investment in education &mdash; the Minister of State will go into more detail &mdash; our <Col N="1043"/>markets are flexible and allow us to respond efficiently to adverse developments.  We have a pro-business outward-looking society and our public finances remain sound, with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area.  The tax burden on labour and capital is low.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding recent negative developments, there are substantial grounds for optimism.  Domestic demand could not sustain overall GDP growth in the long term and we are witnessing a rebalancing towards more sustainable export-led growth.  A renewed emphasis on improving competitiveness is required to ensure rebalancing is achieved efficiently.  In this regard, the next phase of the partnership negotiations is critical and expectations must be in line with productivity growth.  We cannot expect unreasonable increases above increases in productivity.  I would appeal to the social partners when negotiations begin in April or May to be cognisant of this matter, which they will.  They will also be mature and realistic in their expectations in light of our changed economic environment and the fact that we must be prudent in our outlook.</P>
        <P>That the economy displayed considerable resilience in the global ICT shock in the early part of the decade is further ground for confidence in our ability to overcome challenges.  The performance of service exports in recent years is encouraging, with double digit growth in the past five years.  World Trade Organisation data show that Ireland is the fifth largest exporter of commercial services.  We want the economy to go in the direction of high value-added tradeable services, which are high revenue, such as financial, business and computer services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fiscal policy plays a key role in terms of providing support for the economy.  This year, current spending will rise by approximately 8% whereas revenue will increase by just 3.5%.  The package of measures in the budget, on which we had a debate, is prudent while maintaining investment in our capital programmes, which I hope will support momentum in the economy and ensure that the infrastructure and foundation for the future are successful.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the various matters the Minister of State will mention in respect of the amendment &mdash; pay in the next round of partnership talks, the national development plan and our investment in education &mdash; I wish to make a number of points regarding the effects of talking down one&rsquo;s economy.  I have been greatly bothered by this and the contributions of people with an economist&rsquo;s education but who could not quite hack it as economists and, subsequently, turned to the media.  At the beginning of the week, we expected a report from the European Commission on the state of Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  RTE&rsquo;s news coverage of the report on the euro growth and stability programmes of Ireland, Greece and Spain stated: &ldquo;The essential message is that Ireland is on a transition to lower growth and that <Col N="1044"/>there has been a deterioration in public finances&rdquo;.  The report did not state this.  Instead, it stated: &ldquo;Ireland is facing challenges in its transition to a period of lower but more sustainable economic growth&rdquo; and the &ldquo;economy is slowing down, but the growth prospects remain good and well above the euro area and EU averages&rdquo;.  In the past 18 months, it has been grossly irresponsible of many sectors in the media to contribute in this way to the slow-down of the economy.  The fact remains there will be growth of between 2% and 3% in our economy this year and this would be the envy of most economies in the eurozone and the US.  They would love to be in such a situation.</P>
        <P>Mr. Stuart Draper, an economist, attacked the media some months ago, making the point that instead of always focusing on the negative, greater responsibility is needed.  Despite the changed economic environment and the associated challenges we have a good product.  Since the mid-1980s Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, and the country as a whole, have excelled in rising to challenges and showing the ability to adapt, improvise and overcome.  I believe this Government, with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, at the helm and under the stewardship of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, will rise to the challenges of today.  Prudence, with the support of modest borrowing, is important with regard to our capital programme and all aspects of our infrastructure.  I believe we will continue to progress as we have in the past two decades.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have supported the Government&rsquo;s economic policy in almost every debate for some years.  Not only have I spoken in favour of its policy, I have voted with the Government in this House, although I acknowledge that this is not of great significance.  After a long period of support for what has happened under various Ministers for Finance I am now beginning to change my mind.  Much of what Senator MacSharry said was true.  This has been a difficult time for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to be in Opposition on an issue such as the economy because it has been an unprecedented success and criticising its management is politically foolish, although they indulged in this from time to time with no profit.</P>
        <P>I think this motion is timely because while the Government side of the House is correct that the management of the economy has been strong, deft and beneficial to the country, what was said today was smug and very aspirational.  An extraordinary complacency has sunk into the body politic, those running the economy, the Department of Finance and others.  They feel that somehow, because we were successful when times were good, our economic success will extend for another five or ten years.  I do not feel this is the case.  I think we are running into trouble and are refusing to recognise this.</P>
        <P>The indications are that those who judge us with the kind of clinical independence we ought <Col N="1045"/>to respect are casting a negative verdict on us.  Senator MacSharry rightly referred to the European Commission in this regard, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, cast a similar verdict, as did European analysts.</P>
        <P>The Irish stock market was one of the worst performing stock markets in the world last year and, while this might not be accurate as a final judgment of the Irish economy, it indicates a change of opinion about it.  The Irish stock market is down about 40% from its highest point and, while this does not necessarily indicate that those selling Irish stocks are right, although there are many of them, it is foreigners who are selling these stocks.  Foreigners take an objective view of the economy and they do not like what they see here anymore.  They believe the game is up and the good times are over and, to some extent, this is a verdict on the Irish Government&rsquo;s economic policy.  This may not be altogether accurate because the world is going through economic problems, as Senator MacSharry pointed out, but foreign investors are indicating that things here have worsened and the economy has become vulnerable.  They do not feel the Government is on top of what is going on.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by what the international community has seen happen to the property market, one of the pillars of the economy, which has more or less collapsed, despite the anaesthetic words of spin doctors and soothsayers.  I am also concerned about multinational companies in Ireland and Senator Donohoe will be familiar with this topic.</P>
        <P>There was a debate in this House recently on broadband and the Broadband Infrastructure Bill went on the Order Paper today, but the Government&rsquo;s complacency on the issue says it all.  Ministers have said we should not worry about broadband because multinationals are still coming to Ireland but this merely means they have not quite rumbled us yet.  We are sitting on our laurels and are happy with what has happened in the past 15 years.  We are not keeping up with what is happening to this generation.  If we do not realise we are falling behind with regard to broadband and other areas, and the Fine Gael motion mentioned infrastructure, the economy has serious problems.</P>
        <P>The Government is depending greatly on social partnership and we must be careful of this.  It tells us not to worry in the hope that talks on the issue go well, but social partnership does not matter much anymore.  It is a nice charade that involves the trade unions and employers.  Once an agreement is reached we are told the economy is fine because a pay agreement has been reached.  This is a cosmetic exercise that does not represent the truth as only employees who are members of trade unions and employers who are members of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, are bound by it.  Some of the most important and vibrant parts of this economy are members of neither and will have no truck with social partnership.  Ryanair, the most successful company of its generation in the Irish economy, <Col N="1046"/>refuses to join IBEC and believes social partnership to be nonsense.  I recently asked the head of a multinational what would happen if trade unions started recruiting in his company and he said it would leave Ireland overnight to return to America.</P>
        <P>It is convenient to place great credence in social partnership because, without doubt, a deal will be done &mdash; a deal is always done &mdash; because it suits all those involved to create a charade that the economy is healthy.  This will not matter much because it is not the real economy anymore.  Those who depend on social partnership &mdash; conservatives and people with vested interests &mdash; are talking about the old economy.  IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, share the same interests.  They each want to pose as counsellors for the economy when the economy exists elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I warn against the sort of complacency the Government has shown today.  I point out to the Government that multinationals are probably the most important prop to the economy and no major multinational has located here in the past year.  Can the Minister of State address this?  Strong and worrying signals are coming from the multinational sector but they can be addressed if we create the necessary infrastructure and do not fudge the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I sense a huge dichotomy between the motion presented to us this evening by Fine Gael and the opening contributions of its members.  On the surface I cannot disagree with the wording of the motion as I want to see an acceleration of the reform of sectors of our economy.  I want the role of the Oireachtas to be respected.  I want to ensure vital infrastructure is delivered and the funding required in all levels of the education system and for research and development and IT development is provided.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey&rsquo;s opening contribution was nothing short of a rant.  It is nonsense to argue that everything that is economically negative is the fault of the Government.  The argument is particularly hard to take from the Fine Gael Party, which covers itself in a veneer of economic competence but has, in opposition, proposed some of the most insane economic policies to feature in political debate.  For example, during the general election campaign before last, it proposed compensation for taxi drivers and Eircom shareholders.  The joint platform agreed between the Fine Gael and Labour parties prior to the previous general election was predicated on levels of economic growth that were not achievable given the knowledge available at the time.  If those parties had found themselves in Government, they would have spent most of their time in office renouncing the programme for Government they presented to the population at the general election.  That is an economic fact.</P>
        <P>I am the spokesperson for the party which produced the most prudent economic platform at the <Col N="1047"/>previous general election, one which anticipated that the rate of economic growth would slow down.  However, electoral politics dictated that Fine Gael and the Labour Party were just as likely to work on the basis of bogus economic figures as any other party.  The former party&rsquo;s attempt to present current economic conditions in the most negative terms possible must be challenged.</P>

We are not in a national or international recession, nor is the economy stagnation.  The worst thing to happen to the economy, still one of the best performers in Europe, is that the rate of economic growth has slowed.</P>
        <P>Valid criticisms can be made of the way in which resources are apportioned in our economy and the transfer of decision making responsibility from the Government to external agencies.  The health service is an obvious example of the latter trend.  Questions should be asked about the decisions by agencies to cut various services despite receiving increased allocations every year.  The argument made by Fine Gael amounts to nothing more than name calling and hand waving.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My confidence is based on the fact that the structure of the economy has changed and our relationships with trading partners are much different.  For instance, when we joined the European Economic Community we conducted 50% of our trade with the United <Col N="1049"/>Kingdom, our main trading partner.  This figure has reduced to 14% and our main trading partner is now the United States, with which we conduct 15% of our trade.  Our trading relations are more diverse, not only in terms of the number of countries with which we trade but also in terms of the types of goods and services in which we trade.  It is also more secure as a result of adequate investment over the years. </P>
        <P>This change is not the sole responsibility of any Government or political party.  Structural decisions made over the years on education and taxation policy have boosted economic growth.  The Single European Act created the Single Market in Europe and encouraged many multinational companies to establish in Ireland.  The benefit of some of these factors is beginning to dissipate and the manufacturing sector is experiencing difficulties as companies move to locations with a lower cost base.  Problems also arise regarding energy use in the economy.</P>
        <P>In his contribution, which I described, perhaps in unparliamentary language, as a rant, Senator Twomey referred to the Green Party, of which I am the finance spokesperson.  Our proposals to restructure the taxation system will not add one cent to the tax burden and will be to our advantage in creating a more competitive, resilient economy in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House.  While I did not intend to have a slagging match with Senator Boyle, he continually trots out the line that newer Members of the House do not understand economics.  This is not the case.</P>
        <P>The figures produced by my party show that the Exchequer balance of &euro;2.3 billion in 2006 has become a deficit.  When one sees overcrowding in our hospitals, the lack of balanced regional development and chaos in the education system, one questions the Government&rsquo;s economic programme and the country&rsquo;s competitiveness.</P>
        <P>I will take no lectures from Senator Boyle about my party&rsquo;s role in government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He should not tell us we do not understand economics.  We do understand them and I welcome this debate on the economy.  Yesterday, the European Commission&rsquo;s annual report on the economy under the Stability and Growth Pact referred to several macroeconomic and price competitive challenges facing Ireland and noted the noticeable deterioration in the budgetary position.  In January the live register revealed a sharp increase in unemployment to approximately 4.8%.  Ireland has slipped 17 points on the world competitiveness <Col N="1050"/>ranking.  What proposals does the Government have to meet these challenges?  It does not appear to have any meaningful, concrete solutions to the problems facing us.</P>
        <P>Just last weekend, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, withdrew his plans to introduce competition on the Dublin bus market.  Commuters will be left stranded between the aspiration of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to reduce car dependency and car transport and the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s inability to offer an alternative to static traffic on the M50.  We have seen no plans and Senator Ross made a contribution on this.  We see overflowing Luas and train carriages.  People spend almost 20 hours per week travelling to and from work which is an inordinate amount of time and an unhealthy mark of our economy.</P>
        <P>We speak about infrastructural development.  Rail transport along the western corridor from Navan has long been promised but we have had procrastination and no delivery.  My constituency of Cork South-Central has no National Roads Authority project under construction.  We will not have an N28 upgrade, a Bandon Road flyover or a Sarsfield Road flyover.  In a failure to tackle growing traffic congestion, no new buses will be provided to our gateway city.</P>
        <P>For balanced regional development we need development which is sustainable and delivers infrastructure on time.  We do not have this.  In his remarks, Senator MacSharry blamed outside influences.  Perhaps he is correct.  What are we doing as a nation when the Government promotes decentralisation but does not provide the infrastructure for it?  Undoubtedly we are facing a worsening budgetary climate.  What hope do we have of rectifying this?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance did not have the answers at the meetings of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service this week.  We have no record of delivery of infrastructure on time or on budget.  We speak about promoting e-technology and communications infrastructure but we have had a dilution of the commitment on broadband as laid out in the programme for Government.  Greater access to broadband was to be a plank of Government.  However, only 15.4% of people have access to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fine Gael spokesperson on communications, energy and natural resources, Deputy Simon Coveney, called for the implementation of a ten-point plan.  If we are serious about a knowledge economy, the communications infrastructure should be upgraded to higher speed fibre-optic cable.  Anyone involved in industry, education and communications will state the importance of this.  Priority must be given to the connection of schools and education institutions to next generation networks which have sufficient bandwidth to carry data, images, voice, television and video.  It is important we commit to this.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe spoke about upskilling.  Many people are in dire need of upskilling.  In my <Col N="1051"/>former job as a director of adult education I met people seeking to be retrained, educated and upskilled.  The importance of the work of F&Aacute;S cannot be understated.  Many community education providers who are supposed to be self-financing and therefore left alone are struggling.  We need serious examination of how we provide for upskilling and retraining people.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Yesterday and this morning, we discussed the image of the House and the questioning of its relevance.  I recommend that the Seanad actively seeks to be included and regularly updated on social partnership, the national pay talks and economic matters such as that which we are discussing this evening.  This would mean we could employ ourselves as a legitimate forum for debate in parallel with the social pay talks.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House.  It is important we debate this matter because this is the legitimate forum for it.  I thank Senator Twomey for proposing the motion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak in favour of the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion.  In particular, I wish to restate the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to position the economy for sustainable development during the years ahead while adapting to the reality of more moderate growth in the future.  I also wish to put firmly before the House the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to progressive public sector reform and to confirm the Government&rsquo;s objective in entering talks on a second pay agreement under Towards 2016 to achieve a sustainable pay deal compatible with improving competitiveness and productivity.  It is also the Government&rsquo;s intention to inform the Oireachtas fully as appropriate about progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>I record the Government&rsquo;s progress in enhancing the delivery of infrastructure on time and on budget and the measures put in place by the Government to speed up the delivery of vital strategic infrastructure.  I repeat the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment, as set out in the national development plan and as underpinned by the provision in the Exchequer multi-annual capital envelope, to spend an annual average of 6% of gross national product on capital projects to address infrastructure needs.  I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to continued support for the development, enhancement and modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s education sector and Ireland&rsquo;s science, technology and innovation sector.</P>
        <P>While the economy is facing into its most difficult and challenging period for some time, with domestic and external factors likely to restrain short-term growth prospects, it is important to put this lower economic growth into context.  GDP expanded at an annual average rate of 6.5% <Col N="1052"/>over the period from 1997 to 2007.  This has facilitated a substantial improvement in living standards, as evidenced by the fact that income <i>per capita </i>is now among the highest in the EU.  The number of people working in Ireland today has increased by more than 700,000 since 1997.  Unemployment has fallen from more than 10% in 1997 to approximately 4.5% last year, which as Senators stated is among the lowest in the EU.</P>
        <P>At budget time, GDP growth of 3% was projected for 2008, a lower growth rate than in recent years, due primarily to lower new housing output this year.  However, once new housing output returns to more sustainable levels, growth is expected to pick up in 2009 and 2010.  This owes much to the fact that the underlying fundamentals of the economy remain strong, facilitated by appropriate economic, budgetary and social policies as well as the fostering of a business-friendly and pro-enterprise culture.</P>
        <P>We are now seeing a re-balancing of growth away from domestic demand, new housing construction in particular, towards more sustainable, export-led growth.  A renewed emphasis on enhancing competitiveness is required to ensure this re-balancing is achieved in a smooth manner.  Improving our productivity is vital and it is good to hear Members on both sides of the House speaking on it.</P>
        <P>It is important to note the key role played by fiscal policy in terms of supporting the economy.  Current spending will rise by approximately 8% this year while revenues will grow by only 3.5%.  Despite this, only a modest deficit is in prospect.  Capital spending will rise by approximately 12% as full implementation of the national development plan is given priority.  This will help boost the productive capacity of the economy and lay the foundations for future growth.</P>
        <P>General Government surpluses in ten of the past 11 years are solid testimony to the Government&rsquo;s sound management of the economy.  We also have one of the lowest levels of public debt in the EU, which is important in terms of dealing with future pressures on the public finances, especially those stemming from the ageing of the population.</P>
        <P>Recent years have seen significant improvements in the overall quality of the public service.  These include better financial management, more professional human resources management, regulatory reforms, e-Government initiatives and a sharper focus on service delivery.</P>
        <P>A major challenge for the public sector over the next ten years will be to sustain recent progress and build on it.  The moment is opportune to review our public services to see if they are ready for the challenge.  With this in mind, the Government asked the OECD to carry out a review of the public service.  It will benchmark the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and to identify appropriate measures to compare the productivity and effectiveness of the Irish system against comparable <Col N="1053"/>international best practice.  It will make recommendations on future directions for public service reform which will support the Government&rsquo;s drive for delivery of world-class services within existing resources.  It is hoped the OECD will deliver some clear messages to guide us.</P>
        <P>The efficiency review announced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement is a practical demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving the delivery of public services and achieving value for money.  The review requires Departments to come forward with specific proposals to maximise administrative savings in their area.  Such proposals should not jeopardise the maintenance of front-line services.  In short, it should yield administrative cost savings which will help meet overall Government priorities.</P>
        <P>A large element of the costs of public service is pay provision.  It is important we get value from what we pay to staff to deliver such services.  Public service pay must develop in a manner consistent with competitiveness, price stability and budgetary policy.  The public service should be in a position to attract and retain its fair share of good quality staff at all levels.  It should neither lead the market nor trail it.</P>
        <P>Pay developments must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario we face and be more directly linked to changes in productivity.  It is crucial wage expectations are kept in line with the rapidly changing economic environment in which we are operating.  Over recent years, wage increases have exceeded productivity growth with a resulting loss in competitiveness.  Regaining market share will require an approach to wage determination which takes greater account of productivity developments as well as labour cost developments in our major trading partners.  We are favoured with a dedicated public service that many other countries would wish to have.  The Government appreciates and values this commitment.  We need to build a wages policy that develops public services.</P>
        <P>Members will appreciate that, as is the case with any negotiations and especially with pay negotiations, there is a need to retain a level of confidentiality regarding developments in the proceedings.  However, the Oireachtas will be kept informed, as appropriate, of progress made.</P>
        <P>As regards the overall framework agreement, Towards 2016 provides for a formal review during 2008.  This will provide an opportunity to take stock of outcomes achieved for the overall goals and to consider any opportunities arising to refocus and reprioritise.  The Taoiseach announced the commencement of the review process at last week&rsquo;s plenary meeting with the social partners.  This review process will be separate to the pay discussions.</P>
        <P>Investment is the key to future growth and prosperity.  We are in a position, fortunately, to deliver the quality and range of infrastructural services our people deserve and which for a long <Col N="1054"/>time we could not afford.  The bulk of capital projects are being delivered on or below budget and, in some instances, ahead of schedule.  Two key Government initiatives, the value for money effort and the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, are specifically designed to help the delivery of infrastructure in a cost-effective and timely manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has put in place a firm framework for achieving value for money in infrastructure delivery.  Measures include better appraisal of all capital projects; full cost benefit analysis for all projects more than &euro;30 million; a central evaluation unit to verify compliance with best practice requirements; a clearer focus on what we get for this investment; and a more strategic approach to procurement and the use of public private partnerships to deliver value for money.</P>
        <P>We must strive to ensure the delivery of infrastructure on time and on budget.  This is crucial to the further development of our economy and the enhancement of our quality of life.  The Government recognises the importance of having in place a dynamic means of meeting our infrastructure deficit which also safeguards the traditional central principles of our planning system and ultimately delivers investment ahead of demand.  The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act provides this means and has introduced major changes to the way large infrastructure projects of national importance are handled.  Some of the most important infrastructural developments in the history of the State will go through this new streamlined process.  Some are already being dealt with by the board.  More than 75 requests for pre-application consultations have been received and six full strategic infrastructure applications are on the board&rsquo;s books.</P>
        <P>The Act provides an enhanced service for all stakeholders, infrastructure providers, State bodies and the public by enabling the planning code to meet efficiently with the demands of a modern State.  We are confident it will help ensure continued economic development takes place in a sustainable manner.  The new process is designed to be robust and transparent while delivering the right decisions within reasonable and defined timeframes.</P>
        <P>The national development plan, NDP, plays a significant role in our strategy.  It sets out a comprehensive investment framework of the Government&rsquo;s investment priorities over seven years in the areas of economic and social infrastructure, human resources, social inclusion and enterprise, science and innovation.  NDP investment in infrastructure will be crucial for enhancing our economic competitiveness and delivering a better quality of life.  It is an ambitious investment programme on a scale not before seen in the State.  It is a priority for the Government and its commitment to its implementation is underpinned by the Exchequer capital envelope published with the budget in December.  Over the next five years <Col N="1055"/>total Exchequer capital expenditure will average 6% of gross national product, twice the rate of other EU member states.  The NDP will transform the State and secure our future growth.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Like the NDP, developing the education system is at the heart of strategic growth policies with great strides already made.  In the past three years, more than &euro;2 billion has been invested in educational infrastructure.  Much-needed progress has been made in improving the existing stock of school buildings.   A sum of &euro;4.5 billion has been provided for the schools building and modernisation programme under the NDP.  The priority for educational expenditure in 2008 is to provide additional new accommodation to cater for the 13,000 additional children who will seek a school place this year while also facilitating school modernisation and expansion in primary and post-primary schools in other areas.  There will also be a large increase in third level capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive new information and communications technology strategy is being finalised by the Department of Education and Science.  Its aim will be to develop an e-learning culture in schools to ensure ICT usage is embedded in teaching and learning across the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Supporting the education of children from disadvantaged communities will be a key objective of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, initiative.  The initiative is addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities from preschool to upper second level education, from three year olds to 18 year olds.  This initiative is motivated by a desire to ensure no one is left behind, that every child gets the supports he or she needs to reach his or her potential and that a culture of high expectations is at the centre of our actions locally and nationally.</P>
        <P>Up to &euro;900 million will be spent this year on education for students with special needs, double the amount in 2004.  More than 19,000 staff in our schools work solely with children with special needs, including approximately 10,000 special needs assistants compared with just 300 in 1997.  More than 7,800 resource and learning support teachers are in place compared with 2,000 in 1998.  More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.</P>
        <P>Advanced research and development and the availability of highly qualified people is crucial to the success of Ireland&rsquo;s economy.  The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013, SSTI, was launched in June 2006.  This builds on key Government investment over recent years, such as the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and the <Col N="1056"/>creation of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which have been successful in developing our research capability.  The implementation of the strategy forms a central plank of the NDP and will involve expenditure of &euro;8.2 billion over the period of the plan, &euro;3.2 billion of which will be allocated to the higher education sector.  The SSTI relies on the development of a higher education system of the best international quality with advanced infrastructure and skilled researchers.  The strategy also addresses the vital international and all-island dimensions of research and innovation.</P>
        <P>Without high level research we cannot hope to be a success in the future.  This is why we have consistently prioritised research and development policy during our time in office.  The Government is committed to leading the delivery of a knowledge-based economy in Ireland.  The world university rankings recently published by the prestigious <i>Times Higher Education</i> supplement shows that universities in this country are reaping the benefit of the increased investment from the PRTLI, SFI and other funding sources.  Trinity College has moved up to 53rd place, while UCD has broken into the elite 200 for the first time at 177th place.  Meanwhile, UCC and DCU have risen more than 100 places, entering the top 300.  Progress is not confined to the SFI or schemes funded by the Department of Education and Science.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively encouraging companies located in this country to undertake research and development activities in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have given a fully comprehensive review of all that is being done to keep us ahead of the curve.  Senators will agree the Government is making good progress on the key issues that face Ireland as we strive to enhance the national competitiveness and productivity on which our living standards and quality of life depend.  We are pursuing economic and fiscal policies that will continue to promote sustainable economic growth as they have done over the last ten years.  We will continue to pursue the critical public service reform agenda.  We will strive for a pay agreement that enhances our economic environment.  We will continue to secure the best value for money in infrastructure investment while promoting the speedy delivery of critical infrastructure provided for in the national development plan.  We have demonstrated our ongoing commitment to supporting the education sector and promoting the science, innovation and technology sector.  Taken together, these measures should help ensure our continuing economic success, which is the basis for the improved living standards and better quality of life we all want.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State although I am not sure I entirely wel<Col N="1057"/>come all his words.  I am pleased this debate is taking place because it is an important issue.  I have had a very interesting few months.  One of the opportunities I had was to visit a country called Panama, of which I had never heard, other than in the context of the canal, until I went there last month.  The reason I was invited, as was the former Prime Minister of Estonia, a country I also had a chance to visit recently, and the former Minister for Finance of New Zealand, was that those in Panama admired and wanted to learn from countries of a similar size which had done well in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I was very impressed at what I learned and at the enthusiasm and ambition of the Panamanians and what they intend to achieve.  To take one example which illustrates the competitiveness of the marketplace in which Ireland is competing, the Panamanians, who wish to deregulate as much as possible, decided to aim to be one of the best countries in which to set up new businesses.  They looked around the world and saw that Ireland was quite good at this with a period of nine or ten days required to set up a business.  Our Companies Registration Office has done a very good job in this area.  However, the best country in the world in this respect is Singapore, where it is intended to reduce the time it takes to open a new business from seven days to three days.  Panama, in view of the competition it is up against, introduced a system under which it takes 20 minutes on the Internet to set up a company.  This system may not be exactly the same as ours, but I mention it because it gives us some idea of the competitiveness of the marketplace for countries such as Ireland.</P>
        <P>We were so with it 15 or 20 years ago that we managed to create the Celtic Tiger.  However, today there is a degree of complacency, as referred to by Senator Ross, which can certainly be seen in the Government amendment and in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  I welcome this debate because it is high time we replaced complacency with action.  The changed economic situation demands an appropriate response.  We can no longer get away with blatant mismanagement of the economy for electoral purposes which has been a disgraceful feature of past years.</P>
        <P>When I was in Panama one of the questions I was asked was how I saw the future of Ireland.  I said that what we had done in the past would not work in the future and that we must re-invent ourselves.  I did not get the sense that we were doing so in the Minister of State&rsquo;s words tonight.  The future will not be like the past and what we more or less got away with in previous years will no longer suffice as policy for the much tougher conditions we will face in the next few years.  On past performance, it is likely the Government will adopt an attitude of denial, especially with regard to its own responsibility for the situation in which <Col N="1058"/>we find ourselves today.  I could forgive that attitude of denial if, at the same time, the Government recognised the need for radical change in its approach to managing the economy.  Unfortunately, if the debate so far is anything to go by, I do not see any sign of it.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s conditions, the issue of competitiveness has begun to bite.  I and others have been talking about our eroding competitiveness for many years but the reality of what has been happening has been masked by the artificial and unsustainable growth provided by the construction industry bubble in recent years.  During those crazy years &mdash; we can tell they were crazy by the number of cranes that were around &mdash; we forgot about exports.  We forgot that ultimately the only real wealth we create is that which we earn abroad.  Now that our home-grown bubble has burst and we are forced to rely once again on exports, we are beginning to realise just how uncompetitive we have let this country become.  People may have grown tired of hearing this message but they have never needed to hear and pay attention to it as much as they do now.  The area of competitiveness, which was mentioned by the Minister of State in the Government amendment, must be much higher on the agenda.</P>
        <P>In the new world into which we are moving, we cannot ever again rely to the extent we did in the past on overseas companies to provide the lion&rsquo;s share of our growth.  We must still work hard to attract foreign direct investment, as mentioned by the Minister of State, and to make Ireland a hospitable and rewarding place for high value-added activities.  However, in the future foreign direct investment will be no more than the icing on the cake.  For the cake itself, we must rely increasingly on indigenous, Irish-owned companies.  We need a quantum leap in the level of support we provide to these companies.  We need to extend our vision with regard to these companies and we must help them also to extend their vision.  In terms of State support, the hero of the future will be Enterprise Ireland rather than IDA Ireland, although the latter will continue to do valuable work and must still be supported.</P>
        <P>As the motion suggests, we must recognise the crucial importance of education in preparing Ireland for the future.  I was interested to hear the figures the Minister of State gave the House, but here again there is complacency that will cost us dearly if we do not rid ourselves of it.  As we have greatly increased our investment in education in recent years, we are inclined to regard this as a problem we have addressed and which is now behind us.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  What we have invested up to now has solely been in a process of catching up.  We still have not caught up with the rest of the world, however, let alone invested enough to take a position of leadership in the knowledge society of <Col N="1059"/>which the Minister of State spoke and which looms ever nearer each time we discuss this subject.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear where we are in terms of higher education and that Trinity College is among the top 100 universities while UCD is in the top 200 and others are in the top 300, but we have a long way to go.  We go on a lot about the national development plan, but what we must do is to revisit that plan in the light of what we now know and make the required adjustments.  In a nutshell, we need to spend less on roads and more on education.  Only by shifting the entire thrust of our infrastructural investment away from bricks and mortar and towards the development of brain cells can we do the right thing in terms of the future of our economy, society and country.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about pay and how it was important to get value for the money we pay staff to deliver such services.  He said that over recent years wage increases have exceeded productivity growth with a resulting loss in competitiveness.  I do not heard sounds of that being solved.  Four and a half years ago, the Government promised to bring in a structure that would ensure State employees did not hold the country to ransom.</P>
        <P>I was very concerned about what happened last week at Shannon Airport, which called out to us only six or eight months ago and evoked such sympathy.  What does it do?  It allows a small number of State employees who earn very large sums of money to close the airport.  I understand that these people, who say they do not want to work overtime, get 37 days leave per year and, including pensions, earn something like &euro;140,000 per year.  They said they not willing to wait to solve this and that they were going to close down the airport.  The airports are closing down.  We are in a competitive marketplace and cannot afford to do this.  The Government has promised to take action to avoid that.  Regardless of whatever it is going to do, it promised it four and a half years ago and we have not solved it yet.  We must avoid the complacency I detect in the counter-motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment outlined by Senator MacSharry.  In recent years we have seen higher interest rates, higher oil prices, a depreciation of the dollar and sterling, the opening of the economies of China and India, the subsequent loss of manufacturing jobs to those countries and a slowing of growth in our trading partners.  Despite all this, the only thing we have seen is a decrease in the growth of this economy.</P>
        <P>We have a remarkably robust and well-managed economy.  We are looking at 3% growth at the moment.  I was delighted to hear Senator Quinn say he was asked to go to Panama to <Col N="1060"/>explain how a small country that is probably similar in size and population to Panama and Estonia has managed to develop.  While it is always good to welcome proposals about how things can be done better, there is no doubt that in only two decades, we have escaped an invidious legacy of involuntary emigration, joblessness, inflation and high taxation while effectively doubling to considerably in excess of two million the number of people engaged in productive employment.</P>
        <P>This transformation has delivered the standing we now enjoy as a dynamic, prosperous and high participation economy at the very vanguard of the globalisation era.  Ireland is a location possessed of unrivalled attractiveness to investors and workers alike and a success story which continues to unfold as both a model for others and the envy of our international peers.</P>
        <P>The doomsayers among journalists who said that things could go wrong were right because things can go wrong.  Notwithstanding that, our economy has brushed off every challenge and has shown itself to be remarkably robust in an economic downturn.  It is a well-managed economy at that.</P>
        <P>It is clear that success brings with it new challenges and opportunities but success also equips us with the capacity and resolve to meet these new challenges and opportunities most effectively.  Investment is essential to help us meet emerging challenges.  The economy is very strong with gross domestic product and gross national product growth rates that are among the best in the world.  The Government recognises that to remain competitive, we should increase the added value of our economic output.  To achieve this, we need to focus on high technology industries which are driven by significant investment in research and development.  The medical device industry is clearly one of these sectors in which future technological development can be exploited.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the first stem cell clinic, which is an adult stem cell clinic, opened recently in Germany.  It is interesting because it no longer involves research.  It is an actual clinic where people can go to receive treatment.  This is a very important development and I see a role for Ireland in this.  A few years ago, I called for Ireland to engage more in this area because it is the future.  It involves the effective use of adult stem cells which is where the proven successes have arisen to date.  This country still has an opportunity to develop in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is committed to the development of Ireland as a world-leading knowledge economy founded on research, development, innovation and a highly developed skills base.  It is delivering substantial investment in cutting-edge research, development and innovation and has put in place a number of key structures and <Col N="1061"/>strategies to drive our development in this area, including Science Foundation Ireland and the programme for research in third level institutions.</P>
        <P>With the launch of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013, the Government reiterated its commitment to the creation of a knowledge-based economy.  The goal of this ambitious strategy is to position Ireland as a key player in research on the world stage.  The strategy envisages significant increases in public expenditure on research and development over the next eight years.  During this period, we will double the number of PhD graduates in Ireland; develop a targeted and focused programme of research activity across a range of key sectors of the economy, building on our proven expertise in information and communications technology, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; enhance arrangements for the capture, protection and exploitation of intellectual property; further develop the opportunities for collaboration between industry and academia; and create a dynamic environment in which to attract, produce and retain world-class researchers and research projects.  The clearly stated aim of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is that by 2013, Ireland will be renowned internationally for the excellence of its research.  We will be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress within an innovation-driven culture.</P>
        <P>It is part of what we are discussing today.  It is important to mention that this Government consistently ensures the less well-off have benefited from its achievements.  This was made clear by the recent budget where, again, concern was given primarily to those who are less well-off.  In an economic debate, it is good to restate that.</P>
        <P>The Government is also conscious that strategic management initiatives are essential for better quality public service delivery.  Excellent public service delivery is essential on social grounds because of the importance of the service provided by the Civil Service and the public service.  It is also essential for economic reasons because of the important contribution of the work of the Civil Service and public service to national competitiveness and sustainable development.  The cost of the Civil Service and public service, the extent and cost of Government programmes and the combined effects of these on the economy, particularly its competitiveness, require that financial management systems be comprehensive and effective and ensure that value for money is achieved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principles underpinning the Government's approach are to ensure every organisation has efficient flows of financial information, vertically and horizontally, so that decision making is enhanced by the availability of up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive financial information; assist managers by providing quality financial <Col N="1062"/>systems and giving them sufficient flexibility in the management of resources allocated to them; provide incentives for management to achieve greater efficiency in the management of their resources; ensure financial responsibility is delegated as close as possible to the point of delivery of service so that empowerment is not just a buzz word but a reality; and ensure a balanced focus on the relationship between the outputs and the inputs required to achieve them.</P>
        <P>The new national development plan will see a deployment of resources in supporting the productive capacity of our enterprise sector, equipping it to compete effectively in an increasingly knowledge intensive and interconnected global economy.  At a point in our national development where our future prosperity has never been more dependent on unlocking the talents of each citizen, the Government is reinforcing the emphasis on skills and training to ensure adaptability to the accelerated change we face.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt value for money is a hallmark of this Government.  The ambitious plan is to ensure the national infrastructure in terms of time and costs is significant value for money.  In this regard, it is a top priority during the lifetime of this Government to ensure we get value for money in respect of the moneys we spend.  We are achieving this by all recognised standards.</P>
        <P>This Government has been more than just a manager of an economy.  It has been flexible and innovative.  I refer in particular to the financial services sector.  During 2007, the moneys under management in the Irish Financial Services Centre exceeded &euro;1 trillion for the first time.  It provides a significant income for the Government, which heretofore went to other countries, as it manages funds in this country and of other countries.</P>
        <P>This Government is getting international recognition from people who are internationally respected.  The country has become a location <i>The Economist</i> has described as being the best place to live and work in the world.  Instead of listening to the Jonahs, we should consider the fact that despite the difficulties, we have thrown every burden off our shoulders and continued to grow and develop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution on the amendment.  It is unfortunate the motion tabled by Fine Gael, all of which was positive and pinpointed some of the key areas that must be addressed, should be met with a rebuttal without any real engagement in the Chamber on the issues raised in the motion.</P>
        <P>In an article in a recent publication, <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Economic Success: Reasons and Prospects,</i>by Paul Sweeney, the Taoiseach states that the Celtic tiger was in gestation for quite some time prior to its emergence.  The fact is that it was in ges<Col N="1063"/>tation and it did emerge prior to Deputy Bertie Ahern becoming Taoiseach.  In 1997, when the Fine Gael-Labour Government left office, it had the first budget surplus in the history of the State, inflation was very much under control, Government borrowing was in line with the requirements of our membership of the European Monetary Union and growth rates and export performance were very impressive.  It was in those difficult times during the gestation period of the Celtic tiger that difficult political decisions were made.  The difficulty now is that a complacency and a smugness has set in about the success of the Celtic tiger and we get carried away in the belief that this Government created it.  We do not look forward; we look back.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said it is important to put the current lower economic growth into context and revert back to the growth rates we have had in the past ten years.  We revert back to the Government expenditure and fiscal policy of the past ten years but that is not what we are talking about today.  We are talking about adopting an economic policy which will sustain growth into the future.  The Minister of State said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Current spending will rise by approximately 8% this year while revenues will grow by only 3.5%.  Despite this, only a modest deficit is in prospect.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We are aware of the figures.  That is a shocking admission and the complacency of the conclusion highlights the problem we face because there has been a complete reversal in the state of the Government&rsquo;s finances.  For the first time we have a rising national debt and despite all the painful decisions and processes of the 1980s and 1990s, we are not concerned about that.  There is a smugness about the success of the past ten years and a lack of realisation that action is required.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey and Donohoe touched on many of the issues that speak to the motion but I want to raise the issue concerning the social partnership agreements and the manner in which the State&rsquo;s public policy input takes place without regard to the Oireachtas.  In the context of the Lisbon treaty and previous treaties which had to be adopted by referendum, the continual claim is that there is a democratic deficit in Europe.  In that regard it is clear that the democratic deficit is in Ireland, something that was recognised during the Nice treaty debate, and measures were put in place for the scrutiny of EU legislation by the Oireachtas.  That commitment was not fulfilled but that is a separate issue.</P>
        <P>We also have a democratic deficit domestically where we adopt legislation in the Oireachtas and delegate to Ministers an extensive area to legislate without the Oireachtas taking responsibility for adopting legislation setting out the policies <Col N="1064"/>and principles by which any statutory instrument by a Minister should be adopted.</P>
        <P>The third area I believe there is a democratic deficit is in the manner in which the social partnership agreements are conducted by the Government.  Given the extensive nature of those agreements that do not concern simply pay and employment conditions but go into wider fields of taxation, social policy and general economic policy, it is imperative, if that process is to have legitimacy, that there is engagement by the Oireachtas.  More particularly, apart from the issue of legitimacy there is the issue of effectiveness and if the Government enters into that process without setting out any objectives in terms of what it hopes to achieve in the social partnership agreements, that is a fatal flaw in its approach.  It is incumbent on the Government to set out its objectives for the Oireachtas but the only reason I can surmise that is not done is that if those objectives are set out, the Government can be judged on its success or failure in those negotiations.</P>
        <P>In the past the Government has entered into commitments that were a serious constraint on Government policy.  We saw that in the area of testing for driving licences where, by reason of the nature of the agreement, the Government considered it was not possible to outsource that testing process.  Those are important issues and if there was a greater input by the Oireachtas, they could be teased out more effectively and the public policy input into the social partnership agreements would be more transparent and effective.</P>
        <P>Deputy Enda Kenny suggested in a recent D&aacute;il statement that the situation could be addressed by each new round of partnership being proceeded by a motion outlining the key challenges to be addressed and making the processes of partnership more transparent and subject to engagement with the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  That is the mechanism by which this issue could be addressed.</P>
        <P>Setting out those objectives by the Government is of particular importance.  We are aware now that we are in a very difficult economic situation.  That has been confirmed by the European Commission report on the Irish economy and the Government&rsquo;s stability programme.  Government finances have gone from a &euro;2.3 billion surplus in 2006 to a projected deficit of &euro;4.9 billion this year.  Our competitiveness has fallen in the rankings, as has our share of export markets.</P>
        <P>In 1950, Se&aacute;n Lemass opposed the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority on the basis that the Minister for Industry and Commerce under that Bill was endeavouring to pass over his functions in respect of industrial development from his Department to this new body.  We <Col N="1065"/>have come a long way since then but we should not abdicate our responsibility for industrial development and outsource it.  Perhaps the Minister of State would address that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I please Senator Regan by engaging fully with the motion and counter-motion before the House.  Regarding Exchequer returns, the difference is that investment made now is wise and will produce a good return for the country.  Anyone would agree that one invests to produce growth.  This has been part of the success of this country.  This is why certain decisions were taken in respect of the national development plan.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan referred to smugness on the part of the Government because of ten years of economic success.  I think it is pride that we all experience as we travel abroad.  I know this from my experience in Ukraine where people try to find out how we did it.  We are a beacon to many countries and everyone who has played a part, not just the Government, can be proud of it.  I reject the notion of smugness.</P>
        <P>I refer to competitiveness in Government provided services, especially public services.  A good example of that was Spencer Dock train station, the first publicly developed train station opening ahead of time and within budget.  This was a direct response to competitiveness from other elements of the transport sector.  Transport 21 gave &euro;34 billion to the transport sector.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proved what could be done when there was money available and it wanted some of it.  The company had to demonstrate it was capable of providing a service within a budget and on time.  It has made us all proud by demonstrating how positive public services can be when faced with a competitive element.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the motion notes the progress to date on public sector reform and welcomes the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to progressing public sector reform.  Mitt Romney made a point in his speech on so-called Super Tuesday which means, as far as the Government is concerned, that it would be wise to retain its strategy section before it enters partnership talks.  He said: &ldquo;Can you imagine what happens to an economy where the best opportunities are for bureaucrats?&rdquo;  We must be cognisant of this because that is the case.  That is how we got the result of the second benchmarking report.  We cannot afford to lose sight of this.</P>
        <P>Senators Ross and Quinn mentioned complacency, a concern I share.  We are entering different times and must know our public services can cope with adaptability.  From the point of view of the Progressive Democrats, a party that believes in competition in services, we are not in favour of privatisation for its own sake.  In some areas, such as health care, funding will be pro<Col N="1066"/>vided largely by the State.  The application of some private enterprise will deliver good results.  In the long term, this will protect the public service industry.  The inability of the public sector unions to accept change is the greatest threat towards privatisation.  The groups that decry privatisation are the ones who drive the exasperated Government down the privatisation road.  Reform of the public sector is the greatest protection of our public services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I heard on the news that IMPACT has called an all-out strike at the airports.  As an island nation we must be careful with these matters.  Senator Ross outlined what is wrong with social partnership.  We must look at this critically because we need to decide what we need from the process.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan criticised the Government for not explaining what it sought from the partnership process.  It is perfectly clear and is written in the amendment to the motion.  The Government&rsquo;s objective in entering talks is to achieve a sustainable pay deal, compatible with improving competitiveness and productivity.  The amendment also refers to the Government&rsquo;s intention to inform the Oireachtas fully as the appropriate forum to address this.  We must be careful because, as a result of social partnership, we are not used to strikes.  I would hate to think we might revert to them.  We need cool heads and to play our part in a partnership deal that works.  We do not need one for the sake of having one.  We need one that will work for the workers.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the call by Senator Alex White for a debate on the tax regime, which would be useful.  As feared, Senator White reversed his party&rsquo;s position in the election.  It is disingenuous to fight an election knowing that people like tax cuts and then, six months later, to decide to abandon the proposal.  I welcome such a debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The slowdown of the economy is no surprise.  It has not been helped by our dependence on the US economy which has been on a downward slide since the sub-prime crisis broke.  Neither has it been helped by the failure of the Government to intervene as the competitiveness of the Irish economy has been eroded.  Our ranking in terms of global competitiveness has fallen since 2000.  There are numerous reasons for this, including increases in consumption and investment rather than strong <Col N="1067"/>export growth; the slowdown in Irish productivity growth, particularly in the high-tech sector; the contribution of net exports to economic growth being small or negative in recent years; and the high reliance on the construction sector for employment.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, 65% of jobs have been created in public services or the construction industry.  In the same period, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors have lost jobs.  It is crucial the Government acts to improve competitiveness.  How successful it will be in doing this depends on key decisions in areas such as regulation, finance, social capital and physical and knowledge infrastructure.  Ireland&rsquo;s physical infrastructure, North and South, remains a source of acute competitive disadvantage.  During the boom years successive Governments failed to introduce the infrastructure needed to attract foreign direct investment and enhance domestic business and ordinary people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
        <P>Our cities are congested and public transport infrastructure is inadequate.  We pay the highest rates for broadband which is the slowest in Europe.  House prices have pushed workers further into the commuter belts around the major cities, adding to personal debt and traffic congestion problems.  In transport, energy and information and communications technology, Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure lags well behind that of comparable countries in the OECD.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there is still a knowledge deficit, particularly with regard to pre-primary education where Ireland is well below the European average.  A number of years ago Sinn F&eacute;in proposed the introduction of free preschooling as a means of solving the child care crisis and beginning the process of lifelong learning from an early age.  We must deal also with the fact that many children do not complete secondary school.  In addition, illiteracy levels are outrageously high for a first world country.  At third and fourth level, we must examine why none of Ireland&rsquo;s institutions is ranked among the best in the world.  To enter the ranks at number 250 is not good enough.  I agree with Senator Quinn that we must do better.  The use of ICT in Irish education remains poor.  The statistics on the number of computers in classrooms that do not work are proof of that.</P>
        <P>Our approach to research and development is a concern.  While belated strides have been made in this regard, current employment in and expenditure on research and development in higher education and enterprise remain well below leading comparable countries.  Sinn F&eacute;in seeks an all-Ireland research and development strategy co-ordinated through the enterprise development agencies, central and local government, business, trade unions and educational institutions, including a programme of assistance to small and <Col N="1068"/>medium enterprises and new businesses to develop new research and development business plans.</P>
        <P>The rising cost base is undeniable.  However, several contributing factors can be remedied by appropriate, progressive Government intervention.  The three largest sources of spending in Ireland are housing, child care and health.  The need for wage increases in such conditions is genuine but the Government through its policies can reduce the cost burden of housing, health care and child care on ordinary workers.  That would have a positive impact on wage inflation.  For the reasons I have outlined, I support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>No one in this Chamber or in the media is trying to talk this country into recession.  The Taoiseach stated not long ago that people who talked down the construction industry were unpatriotic.  However, often people simply are trying to have a reasoned debate without the use of spin.  The sector of our economy that is not sheltered is suffering owing to a loss of competitiveness that has been fuelled by an increased cost base and lack of productivity in some services on which it depends.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I run a business and, like other business people, I know what it means to be fleeced by Government costs.  Rates, waste and water charges are increasing while there is a raft of large additional charges, including VAT.  That affects everyone who provides jobs.  It will have a knock-on effect on the economy when people begin losing jobs.  The Government did not take control of this cost base and that is the nub of the issue.  Each day I deal with many areas of the public sector.  Many people are making a significant effort to keep things working and running on time in so far as they can.  There are also many problems in that sector, however, and I have been aware of them for more than a decade.  Some of them have improved but some have worsened in recent years.  Again, it is a failure on the part of the Government to recognise these well-known problems and tackle them.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>The chickens have started to come home to roost and that is damaging our economy.  Government speakers who recite lists in their contributions as if everything in the garden is rosy are acting like the Taoiseach did some months ago when he told us we were unpatriotic and talking down the economy.  We are not talking it down but urging the Government to do something about it before people are back on the dole queues and the emigration boats.  Our growth rate of 3% is not keeping pace with public spending growth of 8% and the erosion of the cost base.  That is what we must confront when we talk about broadband, the lack of road infrastructure and basic things such as how people get to work. <Col N="1069"/> People are forced to commute in cars and find their commuting times lengthening.  They are experiencing great difficulties at present and Members of the House waffling about how much the Government can spend will not help matters.</P>
         <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley made an unbelievable statement when she said the public sector unions are <Col N="1070"/>driving the Government down the privatisation route.  If any explanation is needed for how the Progressive Democrats became redundant rather than radical at the previous general election, that statement says it all.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, to take this motion on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>I raise the matter of a capital project, which has been proposed by the HSE, and formerly by the North-Western Health Board, entailing the provision of a community care facility and small hospital in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.  This was sanctioned in 2002 and was given the go-ahead then.</P><Col N="1070"/>
        <P>On numerous occasions since then I have raised this with the HSE, both locally and nationally.  It appears that when I raised it here in September or October with the Minister, Deputy Harney, she pursued the HSE, which the following day phoned officials in the local office in the north west and told them to proceed.  Until recently however, they have not received the proper confirmation to allow them to move to the next stage.  I hope that tonight the Minister of State will be able to inform us when they will be in a position to move to the next stage.</P>
        <P>This community facility is badly needed.  At present, there are people occupying beds in general hospitals who could be accommodated in such a facility, if it were provided.  I hope the Minister of State can tell me the up to date position and give me a definite date with regard to proceeding on this project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ellis for raising this important issue, which he raised last year in the House with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy <Col N="1071"/>Mary Harney.  I am glad to have the opportunity to respond and I apologise on her behalf for being unable to attend here.</P>
        <P>This matter provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing community-based services at local level.  Government policy with regard to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective of continued development of community-based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  In the budgets of 2006 and 2007, over &euro;400 million was provided to enhance service developments across the sector, of which just over &euro;190 million was for community-based services over the two years.  Arising from budget 2008, a full year package of &euro;22 million has been allocated for new services in the area of older people.  This gives a total of over &euro;422 million for new services for older people over the last three years.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, the Health Act 2004 provides the Health Service Executive with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services.  As a corporate body, the provision of these services, including progressing community hospitals or primary care centres at local level, is, therefore, an operational matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>The proposed capital development for Ballinamore, which has a total capital requirement of over &euro;7 million, has been approved by the executive.  The project is progressing to the next stage, which is the appointment of a design team.  It is expected that the team will be in place by the end of April next.  I understand from the HSE that, when complete, the development will include the following: Ballinamore community hospital, to include long-stay care services and palliative care services; day care services, to include a social model of care with interaction activities and personal care needs; and a centre to facilitate the provision of multi-disciplinary primary care services, which will ultimately encompass the core multi-disciplinary team of general practitioners, public health nurses, mental health, occupational therapy, social work, chiropody, community welfare, physiotherapy, dietetic and home help services.</P>
        <P>The Government strategy, Primary Care &mdash; A New Direction, 2001, is the roadmap for the development of primary care services in Ireland over a period of ten to 15 years.  The development of such services is an essential component of the <Col N="1072"/>health service reform process.  It has been estimated that in a developed primary care system, 90% to 95% of people&rsquo;s day-to-day health and social care needs can be met in the primary care setting.</P>
        <P>The key objective in primary care policy is to develop services in the community that will give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams such as that proposed for the Ballinamore development.  Under the Towards 2016 agreement the Government has committed to the establishment of 300 primary care teams by 2008, 400 by 2009 and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken this year.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, the Government has provided significant new funding to enable the primary care strategy to be rolled out, amounting to &euro;52 million.  In addition to the additional resources being put in place, the HSE is working on the reorganisation of existing professional resources in the community from a care group model to a primary care team model.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the people in the Ballinamore catchment area may feel that nothing is happening because they do not see anything tangible happening.  I want to inform them that the project has been approved by the HSE.  The next step is the appointment of a design team.  That will happen by the end of April and, hopefully, progress will be made then.  As a public representative, I fully appreciate that until such time as the sod is turned, the people of Ballinamore and its catchment area will feel nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>I assure them there is movement and the moneys will be provided.  The project has been approved and the appointment of the design team is the next stage.  We are anxious to ensure that team is in place by the end of April.  The new, high-quality facility planned for Ballinamore will substantiate and complement the significant service delivery thresholds already put in place or planned for primary care and services for older people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise the important matter of the provision of a new school in Ballintemple in Blackrock in Cork.  I am heartened by the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to Senator Ellis, because for the first time a Minister of State has come into the House and deviated from a prepared script on an <Col N="1073"/>Adjournment matter and given an honest appraisal of where matters stand.  I commend him on that and hope he does the same in response to my matter.</P>
        <P>Five years ago, two new portacabins were located on a site adjacent to the school in the grounds of the SMA Fathers.  Has the situation improved since then?  There has been massive growth in the area and Ballintemple national school has outlived its present campus.  The site has become too small, the school is on a split campus and we now need a bigger site and school.  It is important that we provide for both the present and the future.  We have an opportunity now to plan for a meaningful education programme for our young people, existing students, parents and teachers of this school.</P>
        <P>The Ballintemple and Blackrock areas are ones of rapid urban growth where there is competition for school places.  I met a woman recently in the area who walks with her three children to Turner&rsquo;s Cross national school every morning, a fair trek.  I understand the Ballintemple school board of management has spoken with senior planners in the Department, but there has been no tangible news.  I do not want to receive a response that only marks time, because a marking-time response will bring no progress on this development.</P>
        <P>We need a commencement date for this necessary new school.  We need a school that will cater for three times the current intake because of existing demands.  The school is currently an eight-teacher school but the new school planned will have capacity for 12.  The SMA fathers have offered a free site of 1.5 acres to the Department and finance will be available from the sale of the current school.  There is no issue with regard to the land which is self-financed.  The SMA fathers and the board of management are ready to move.  I ask for some progress on the provision of this important facility in this fast-growing area of Cork city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise that the Minister for Education and Science is not in a position to attend the House tonight.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to this House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position regarding the provision of a new school at Ballintemple, in Cork city.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  The Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in <Col N="1074"/>place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>During the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishments over the next number of years.	</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific matter in hand, Ballintemple national school is a co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 211 pupils as of September 2007.  Enrolments at the school have increased by 14% in the past five years.  The school has a current staffing of one principal, eight mainstream class teachers and two permanent learning support-resource teachers.</P>
        <P>The school has submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding towards the provision of a new school and the long-term staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.  It has been agreed that appropriate accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of one principal and 12 mainstream assistants, with appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>The school authorities were advised in September 2007 that the proposed site for the new school building was suitable for the construction of a new 12 classroom school and that they could proceed with its acquisition from the SMA fathers.  The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the national development plan and the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  The project at Ballintemple will be considered in that context.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter and allowing me to outline the progress being made under the school building and modernisation programme and the position regarding the provision of a new school building at Ballintemple, Cork City.  I will relate Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s strong views about the progression of the project to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the adjournment of the House.  While I welcome the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, I am disappointed the Minister for Transport is not here.  That is no reflection on the Minister of State, who knows exactly the situation in Donegal.  He knows that one should be able to get on a train in Derry and arrive in Dublin.  It is the people who live outside the general Donegal area that I would like to awaken to the fact that one can now physically get on a train in Derry and arrive in Dublin.  However, there are difficulties with the line, particularly from Derry to Coleraine and there are difficulties with the lack of political will to resolve the issue.</P>
        <P>I have been raising this issue since Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke was Minister for Transport, which is some time ago.  I have been trying to get people to understand the concept of Dublin to Derry, not just Dublin to Belfast, as the full line.  There have been great improvements on the Dublin to Belfast line.  The Enterprise is a supreme service and investment in the Dublin to Belfast section of the line is continuing, which is to be welcomed.  However, it is happening at the expense of the Belfast to Derry section of the line.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to relay the facts to the Department of Transport and I challenge those involved in the North-South Ministerial Council, on both sides, to explain why they can talk about Dublin to Belfast but cannot talk about Dublin to Derry.  I know that if it gets as far as Derry, we can then examine the possibility of bringing it back into Donegal.  Others are talking about linking train services from the west to Donegal, ultimately linking, I would like to think, with the service in Derry.</P>
        <P>Some may ask why I am not fighting the corner for Dublin to Donegal at this point.  It is simply that results can be achieved very quickly on the section of the line to which I am referring.  It has been recorded by Translink that more than 1 million passengers use the Derry to Belfast line.  It has been recommended by consultants that &pound;64 million be spent on the line.  Out of the &pound;64 million, &pound;23.5 million has been promised to be spent on it.  However, the actual figure earmarked is &pound;12 million.  This &pound;12 million is to be used to upgrade the section from Ballymena to Coleraine.  The line will be closed during this time and shuttle buses will be used for this route instead.  Many people feel this could ultimately impact on the <Col N="1076"/>number of people using the service, but they do not want to stand in the way of progress.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, Mr. Conor Murphy stated that investment in the line from Coleraine to Derry is key.  However, he also stated there is no money for this.  The Northern lreland Government has &pound;18 billion to be spent on infrastructure in the next ten years.  In that context, why is there no money in the budget for upgrading the track?</P>
        <P>The Minister says they must raise the money, and if they do so, the upgrade can be carried out in 2011.  If the money is found it will mean the line will be closed again while repairs are carried out.  Translink says it does not have the equipment or staff to upgrade the Ballymena to Coleraine section and the Derry to Coleraine section at the same time.  However I have been led to believe that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has the necessary equipment and staff to do this and the equipment is currently lying idle in Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Derry to Coleraine track is a jointed one, but what is needed is a welded one.  New trains on this route cannot get up to speed, and some travel at speeds as low as 20 mph.  That is one of the core problems.  It is faster to take the bus from Derry to Dublin than it is to take the train.</P>
        <P>At the last North-South Ministerial Council meeting in January, the possibility of both Governments coming together to buy trains for the Belfast to Derry route was raised and a decision will be made at the next meeting in May.  I ask that the decision be taken, not only with regard to new trains but also with regard to the upgrading of the track because it has been proven that where improvements are made, they yield a significant increase in the numbers of people who use trains.</P>
        <P>The ILEX regeneration board plans to build a new railway station in Ebrington.  The chief executive of the ILEX board has taken on the demands of the Into The West group and has agreed to leave enough room to build a track across the Foyle to Donegal.  This is a tran-jurisdictional corridor and is eligible for funding under the Tran European Network System, TENS.  I ask the Department to confirm that this is the same funding body that funded the upgrading of a section of the Cork to Dublin line recently.  Apparently, that upgrade was funded because it was stated it was on the Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Larne line.  If that is the case, it is a scandal that the Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland cannot fight the corner for Derry to Belfast, as part of the Derry, Belfast, Dublin link.  It is also a scandal that we are not using European funds that have been available for this for the past number of years and delivering what is needed.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point that this is not about a new train service, new planning, a new line or compul<Col N="1077"/>sory purchase orders on people&rsquo;s lands.  It is about a number of passing points for the existing train service and a matter of replacing a jointed train line with a welded one.</P>
        <P>I would expect a negative answer or for this issue to be put on the long finger were it a complicated matter, such as the suggestion of an overall package of an all-island train service, but not at the level of complexity described.  I am asking that the prevarication stop in respect of the current service and the two stations, York Street and Central Station.  If it is good enough for the Cork-Dublin line, it is good enough for the north west.</P>
        <P>When I raised this issue previously, people told me that there are flights to Derry and Carrickfinn, a planned road through Aughnacloy and bus services and asked me why I would want a train service.  The childish argument would be that, if everyone else can have one, so can we.  The north west needs access and infrastructural development and there is a simple answer.  The amount of money is not significant in the scheme of things, with &euro;64 million being the most required.  Some &euro;23 million has been promised and, a number of months ago, I attended the announcement at Stormont by Rev. Ian Paisley, MLA, of a further &euro;12 million.</P>
        <P>I am not asking for the impossible.  It is no reflection on the Minister of State that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, will have the facts when he returns to the North-South Ministerial Council, the issue I raised on the Order of Business.  There are council meetings on education, health, transport and so on, but we are not getting feedback so that we can give our own feedback.  European funding is available and I ask that it be spent in the north west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the Minister in a position to attend the House, he would be present.  That he is not present is no reflection on the House or the Senator, as he has another commitment.  As we all know, matters on the Adjournment can be raised in the morning, but Ministers can have other commitments.  I welcome the opportunity to respond to Senator Keaveney and the House on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
        <P>Rail services to Derry are available via Belfast.  The upgrading of Belfast-Derry rail services is a matter for the authorities in Northern Ireland.  While it did not form part of the main agenda, the Minister mentioned it at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting last December and he understands that the service is being considered by the Northern Ireland authorities in the context of overall plans for the development of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s railways.  Both larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railways are working on proposals to improve the Dublin-<Col N="1078"/>Belfast service in terms of frequency and journey times.</P>
        <P>While I welcome that the Senator&rsquo;s Adjournment matter relates to the Derry-Coleraine service, the North-South Ministerial Council at its December 2007 meeting welcomed a presentation from representatives of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railways regarding the Dublin-Belfast service.  It noted the options for the development of the service, particularly in terms of increased service frequency, improvements to rolling stock and the elimination of speed restrictions.  The council requested officials to assess the options and prepare a report for consideration by it at its next meeting in May.  The subject will be on the agenda and there will be an opportunity to consider the Senator&rsquo;s matter.</P>
        <P>In considering the case for improved Dublin-Derry rail services, it is important to bear in mind the improvements made in transport links to the north west generally.  I first came to Dublin as a public representative from the far end of the north west for the county in 1981 when there was little funding available.  Over the years, major upgrades of roads, such as the N2, N4 and N15 serving the north west, have been completed and more are planned.  I am proud that, when travelling on the M1, the only town one goes through is Emyvale, then the inner relief road at Omagh and through to Strabane.  While much remains to be done, it is important to focus on what has been done in recent years in terms of train, air and road services.  Substantial support is being provided for air services between Dublin and Derry and between Dublin and Carrickfinn, Donegal&rsquo;s airport.  These links are supplemented by extensive hourly bus services between Dublin and Derry, including nine daily services each way operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Further investment under Transport 21 will see improvements in transport infrastructure serving the north west, including the Atlantic road corridor linking Derry, Letterkenny, Sligo, Galway, Cork and Waterford.  It is important to highlight the fact that the Government has agreed to make available funding of &euro;580 million to provide a major upgrade of roads within Northern Ireland serving the north west gateway of Letterkenny and Derry.  The project is being taken forward by the National Roads Authority, which has responsibility on this side of the Border, and the Roads Service of Northern Ireland under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
        <P>Progress has been made in respect of air links, roads and the Derry-Belfast line, but I take on board Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s strong case regarding the Derry-Coleraine route.  She stated that, instead of it being necessary to secure CPOs for rail lines or property, it is a question of an upgrade.  It would be beneficial for those from Donegal who would use the Derry-Dublin train <Col N="1079"/>service and not just the people of Derry.  I will raise the various issues referred to by the Senator with the Minister.  I can neither refute nor confirm the issue concerning the provision of capital funding elsewhere in the country, but I assure the Senator that the facts will be ascertained and I will ask the Minister and his office to provide them to her.</P>

	<P>The last point was the most important.  If, as I have been led to believe, there is European funding for the Dublin-Derry line, it is time to call it the Dublin-<Col N="1080"/>Derry line.  Will the Minister of State confirm or refute whether the Cork-Dublin or Glountaune-Middleton line got that funding on the basis that the lines all head to Larne?  We deserve the same service as everyone else, a line of thinking followed by the Minister of State.  We accept that there has been much investment in the area, but there is no train service.  We are discussing eco-friendly work that will minimise the amount of heavy freight on the roads, which is offered by train services.</P>
