      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on enforcement measures that can be and are being taken against the destruction that occurred at the old Methodist Church, Jones&rsquo;s Road, Dublin 3.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to indicate his immediate plans to reduce substantially the waiting time for scrutiny of long-term residency applications, currently circa two years from date of application, and if he will consider an amnesty for those who find themselves in this situation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Defence to outline the rationale behind the closure of Rockhill and Lifford barracks, County Donegal, and if he is willing to review this decision and the timeframe for implementation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s Order of Business is No. 1, statements regarding the Morris tribunal report.  It is proposed that No. 1 will commence on the conclusion of the Order of Business and adjourn not later than 1.40 p.m., if not previously concluded.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes.  Senators may share time by agreement of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and questions from spokespersons or leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Considerable uncertainty and fear has been created by the announcement that tax relief for care in nursing homes will be changed from the marginal rate to the standard rate.  Ministers have issued contradictory statements about this subject.  The Government is also hiding behind the fair deal proposals, on which there is also confusion. <Col N="884"/> These details should include eligibility criteria.  The scheme provides for high dependency but does not outline how the dependency will be defined.  There is a necessity to clear up this matter.</P>
        <P>On the overall budget, will there be a cap on the numbers who can participate in the scheme and will a limit be set on the spend for the scheme?  When will the full details of the fair deal scheme be brought before the House?  Will the health expenses relief be amended as part of the social welfare Bill and when will that Bill be brought to the House?  On another social welfare matter, will the Social Welfare Bill include a provision to exclude those over 70 from paying the 2% health levy or will that be set out in other legislation?</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to debate agriculture, an issue that has been raised by a number of Members in recent months.  The ill thought-out measures included in this year&rsquo;s budget will have severe consequences for farming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader very kindly, at the conclusion of the Order of Business yesterday, spoke about putting factual matters on the record.  It is time to engage with fact in the debate on education.  There is much unfounded comment that is presented as fact when that is not the case.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to confirm that every time the Minister for Education and Science challenges the teachers&rsquo; unions, he challenges not only the unions but the whole education community.  The teacher unions have not stated one thing differently to Catholic, Church of Ireland and Muslim management.  I have not heard from the Jewish schools yet, but their comments are exactly the same.  The same point is being made by Gaelscoileanna, Eagra&iacute;ocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post-Primary.  Consequently, although the Minister is trying to divert this into an issue that pertains to teachers, it is not a teacher issue, it is that teachers happen to be the front-line professionals dealing with a particular issue.</P>
        <P>To bring this matter to a neat conclusion and to make matters easy for the Leader and me, I challenge the Minister for Education and Science to come into this House and state on record what he is saying outside.  Outside the House, the Minister has stated there will be no more than 200 fewer jobs in Irish education next year than there are this year and that that will have no further impact on teaching and education.  In other words, his point is this simply constitutes a loss of 200 jobs.  However, my point is that such a conclusion does not factor in the increase next year in pupil population.  The crucial issue is not the difference between this year and next year but the difference between this year and what would have been in place next year had the Minister made no change to the schedule.  It will mean a loss of far more than 200 jobs and will be closer to the figure of 1,000.  The Minister should come before the House and state that.  He should fulfil the commitment he gave last week.</P>
        <P>Second, I support very strongly the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  As the Cathaoirleach is well aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seconding the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  In particular, I wish to focus on the impact of the budget on farming and the west.  I raised many times in the House the difficulties relating to fishing and infrastructure in the west.  I have raised many issues, such as Valentia and otherwise.  I am coming to the conclusion that the Government does not care a whit for the west of <Col N="885"/>Ireland and that it considers we would be better to cut it off at the Shannon and allow it to drift out to sea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The impact of the budget on small farmers, sheep farmers and people in disadvantaged areas is utterly disproportionate.  That is the problem with this budget.  While everyone is aware that cuts must be made, in each sector they are being made on those who are most vulnerable.  A debate on agriculture should take place and I will make a significant contribution on the subject of disadvantaged farmers in regions, some of which are close to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s area, who are utterly dismayed by what has been done to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points made in respect of the education debate with the Minister, which I hope will take place soon.  Whatever debate takes place must be based on facts and accurate information.  In fairness to the Minister for Education and Science, numbers might not necessarily be his strong point, as Members discovered during the summer in respect of third level fees.  However, I am sure there will be a sufficient number of people to advise him when he comes before this House to debate such issues, as I believe he will.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that this is an unworthy attempt to seek to reduce a highly important debate on education and the future of education provision to an attack on teacher unions or teachers&rsquo; self-interest.  It is reprehensible to seek to reduce it to such a proposition.  Members should have a much better debate in this House that will be based on facts and information, the validity of which can be tested.</P>
        <P>In the context of renewing the call for a debate on the education cuts, I reflect on what is a theme of mine, of which there were plenty of examples in the House yesterday.  It appears the first lesson one must pass to succeed and perform on the other side of the House is an ability to say one thing when on one&rsquo;s feet and vote the opposite way a few minutes later.  This is extraordinary.  It appears to have been fostered and almost encouraged by the former Taoiseach in particular that one can say anything one wishes as long as one does the right thing when pressing the button or lining up in the voting lobbies.  One can make fun of this and people write about it in newspapers to the effect that it is a bit of gas and so on, but if one thinks about it, it is a serious matter.  While I do not wish to become too po-faced about this, the practice contributes to an added cynicism in respect of politics and politicians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>People can stand up in the Houses of the Oireachtas, make marvellous speeches that purport to take one particular position and end up doing the complete opposite.  What, therefore, are people supposed to think about politicians?  What are they supposed to think about the Government and those who supposedly support the Government?</P>
        <P>While the Deputy Leader may not accept my bona fides in this regard &mdash; I say this more in sorrow than in anger in respect of the Green Party, for many members of which I have considerable respect &mdash; it appears to have learned that lesson and to have passed it with flying colours.  Its Members attempt to persuade the people that they can look in one direction when speaking and in another when voting.  That simply is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Members were treated to a short lecture by the Deputy Leader last night in respect of the duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?  Questions should not be directed to the Deputy Leader.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="886"/>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Second Stage speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a question.  Does the Leader agree it is unacceptable for the Opposition to be treated to a lecture from the Deputy Leader as to what are its duties?  He did so in circumstances in which 18 months ago, his party, in the form of Deputy Gogarty, was able to tell the people:</P>
        <P LI="1">Fianna F&aacute;il have fooled us before on education and they won&rsquo;t get away with it again.  They have broken promises, they have under-invested, and have failed to grasp the opportunity presented by our booming economy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I understand Deputy Gogarty will be leading for the Green Party in the debate in the D&aacute;il today, he is not that much of a maverick.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">My message to voters is this: If education is important to you, then it is essential that you vote Green Party candidates Number 1 to ensure a real input into any future educational investment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the basis on which his party got its mandate.  That is the mandate on which its Members are in these Houses.  That mandate is completely spent because they are doing the polar opposite to what they told the people, whether it was in Dublin South, in which 14 teachers are to be lost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or any other constituency.  I seek honesty, clarity and some dignity in these Houses.  Lectures to the Opposition about bogus motions and so on should cease.  Members should face up to their responsibility to do something along the lines they stated they would do during the election campaign.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that before the banking crisis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call first on three Members who did not get an opportunity to speak yesterday.  I call Senator Coghlan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to be associated with the call for a debate today on agriculture.  Members are tied up at present with matters pertaining to education and are concerned about our youth.  While education is a vital foundation for life, one cannot overlook the fact that the farmers of Ireland traditionally were perceived as the backbone of the economy.  Although that might not be the case today as much as heretofore, sadly a highly important industry has been treated rather shabbily in the recent budget.  It is worthy of a debate and other Members will wish to speak on it.</P>
        <P>On another matter, there have been many calls to patriotism in these straitened times.  Only yesterday, Members on all sides outlined measures they believed would improve our flagging economy.  Obviously, practical patriotism is required all round at present.  In this regard, the repatriation of our tax exiles would be timely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to Irish citizens holding Irish passports who loudly proclaim their Irishness.  They are as Irish as the rest of us and, as Members are aware, many of them do much good work in their communities and with various charities.  It behoves them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a question for the Leader on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="887"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like you to do so.  I am obliged to three Members who missed out yesterday and it will be the same today.  If we continue like this, people also will miss out today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that and I will come to the point.  I will not take as long to formulate it as would other Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Hopefully not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It behoves them to come within the scope of Irish tax law.  I am coming to my question to the Leader.  In that context, perhaps the Government will re-examine the definition of residency with a view to amending the very generous 183-day rule.  The Leader should respond on that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Why have the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children not appeared before this House?  It is an absolute disgrace and it ill behoves the Seanad, as the second Chamber of the Oireachtas, that the Minister for Health and Children has not come before it to discuss the callous cuts regarding medical cards.  We need an answer giving the reasons she has not been to the House.</P>
        <P>While the Leader is inviting the Minister to the House, he should also ask her why Cork University Maternity Hospital, which was built at a cost of &euro;75 million and opened last year to great fanfare, has a capacity of 7,000 births per year but is now catering for 8,800.  What is even more damning of the Health Service Executive is the fact that a woman in the southern region may have to give birth on a trolley in a hallway.  Is it acceptable in modern Ireland that the HSE cannot plan ahead and is now asking women to give birth on trolleys in the hallways of a modern maternity hospital?  The <i>Irish Examiner</i> has reported on this issue and I have made my own inquiries with the INO which has been able to confirm the risks that are presented to the health and safety of women who are due to give birth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outrageous.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite this, the Minister cannot come to this Chamber to discuss these issues.  I want the Leader to arrange for her attendance next week.  This matter does not concern politics; it is about women and babies.  We deserve answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made by my colleagues for an urgent debate on agriculture.  The agricultural community has faced enormous financial pressures for some time but the measures proposed in the budget, including the removal of the farm installation grant and the farm retirement pension, represent an especially bitter blow to young farmers and their parents.  We know of many cases from our constituencies of people who were on the threshold of applying for the schemes but who now find that their financial prospects have been entirely changed by the cuts.  A debate on agriculture is urgently required.</P>
        <P>Calls were made on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business for a robust debate on the economy.  This would provide us with an opportunity to hear ideas on turning around the economy and to make suggestions which the Government might take on board.  Several speakers referred to the public service.  We all recognise the necessity for reform and a certain degree of financial restraint in the public service.  Perhaps we can hold a series of debates on the economy between now and Christmas so that problems can be raised and solutions proposed.  While we should focus our attention on the public service, we should also recognise that public servants include the staff and Members of the Oireachtas, the garda&iacute; on the streets outside Leinster House, the soldiers serving overseas in Chad, our nurses and our teachers.  Public servants are good people <Col N="888"/>and we have a good public service in this country, although it needs reform.  In the current economic climate, we all recognise that savings and sacrifices will have to be made.</P>
        <P>A realistic debate is needed on the economy, beginning with the public service given that it consumes &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; an enormous proportion of the budget.  Any service which uses so much taxpayer money can and should be examined with a view to reforms.  The document published by Deputy Richard Bruton in advance of the budget should be explored as part of our debate because he has outlined many good ideas which deserve to be fleshed out in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to arrange an emergency debate on the cost of petrol, diesel and home heating oil.  The price of a barrel of oil is now $69, compared with $147 in July.  The price at the pumps in July was &euro;1.335 per litre of petrol and &euro;1.438 for diesel, whereas it now stands at &euro;1.099 in Kerry and &euro;1.129 in Strandhill.  Last Tuesday, the price in Knockroghery was &euro;1.139.</P>

	<P>I am delighted that the Leader has agreed to hold a debate on the economy once every month.  I have had the opportunity to visit Finland during almost every decade since the 1970s.  I suggest that, in advance of our next debate, every Senator should read an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> written by a professor of education and lifelong learning in UCD.  This very interesting article concerns the success of the Finnish economy.  Finland was called the Nordic tiger but it encountered similar problems to Ireland&rsquo;s current economic difficulties.  It came out of that difficult period, however, and is now experiencing significant success.  Part of the reason for that success is Finland&rsquo;s continued investment in education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Its investment in education is approximately 33% higher than Ireland&rsquo;s as a percentage gross domestic product.</P>
        <P>Finland has a fascinating history which contains many similarities to Ireland&rsquo;s.  Its population is almost the same and it went through a Finnish revival in the 1890s which was similar to the Gaelic revival.  It won independence in 1917 and has the experience of a civil war and a powerful neighbour.  Its history is so similar to ours that it is worthy of study.  However, its success over the past 30 years are most interesting.  I was fascinated by the figures revealed in <i>The Irish Times </i>and suggest Senators read the aforementioned article before we hold our debate.</P>
        <P>I gather that the prize fund for the national lottery is increasing.  However, it was reported in the newspapers that Catholic Youth Care is concerned that its funding is being cut by 10% even though 90% of it comes from lottery money.  I do not quite understand this.  Is it possible that the Government is using lottery money to make savings?  This had not dawned on me previously but it is a stealthy way of making cuts by using the increasing pool of money in the national lottery.  I ask the Leader to investigate the matter.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for ongoing debates on economic matters.  We are facing serious economic times both nationally and globally.  The example he gave of Finland is apposite.  A green party participates in that country&rsquo;s Government and we can adopt many of the lessons learned from its experience.  In recent local elections, despite being in government and changing economic times, the Green Party vote has increased.</P>

	<P>I support the call for an ongoing debate on education matters.  Recent Cabinet meetings and the budget have confirmed that education spending will be prioritised during the rest of the term of this Government.  We have taken a step backwards and there must be an ongoing national debate on the best use of resources.  I am confident there will be changes in how those resources are used but it will take a collective change.  The partners in education are part of that process and I look forward to that debate.</P>
        <P>I promise to take care of the sensitivities of the Opposition, which feels it has the right to condemn the Government and hold it to account but that the Government cannot hold the Opposition to account.</P>

	<P>I support the call for a debate on agriculture.  The actions taken in the budget in a host of areas cut right through agricultural policy in this country.  A number of measures, such as the farm retirement scheme, are fundamental in maintaining and improving efficiency and encouraging the constant process of the modernisation of Irish agriculture.  The Irish Farmers Association took a particular position with regard to the Lisbon treaty and made life difficult for the Government about the World Trade Organisation negotiations, but the Government should not be vindictive because the IFA adopted that position.  The range of measures and the depth of the cuts displays a bit of payback time for farmers and the IFA.  That is what I read in the budget and I welcome a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>A matter that should not go unnoticed, as it has been the subject of much discussion in these Houses, is the conclusion of oral hearings of the Mahon tribunal.  I raise this because it is relevant to the national issues we discuss in this House and which are of fundamental import<Col N="891"/>ance.  I have a question for the Leader.  The tribunal was established essentially to investigate the activities of Fianna F&aacute;il politicians.  Those politicians under investigation have obstructed and delayed the work of the tribunals.</P>

	<P>This has added to the time and delay in the conclusion of the tribunal and the cost.

A clear picture is emerging and the question to the Leader is whether we have learned any lessons.

	<P>In particular, I call for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to attend.  Last week, Gordon Brown made a major speech in which he referred to the Keynesian nature of the future of the British economy.  In the past 12 years we have had 11 surpluses.  This is the first year in which we have had a deficit.  It is standard <Col N="892"/>practice that in times when the market cannot function as it did, the Government steps in.  It is a simple method of Keynesian economics.  In this country, we are past masters of that.  When others would not invest in this country, the Government set up semi-State companies such as Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB, the success stories that have brought us to where we are.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>It was one of the most appalling decisions made by any Government in the history of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and using the money correctly and investing it for the future, is it incumbent on the State to retake Eircom for the benefit of the nation and develop it as we would wish when we could pick up the company for a reasonable rate?</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has always undertaken what was good for the country.</P>

	<P>What is good for the country is that the State spends to reactivate and ensure economic activity.</P>

        <P>I fully support what Senator Alex White has said with regard to those on the Government side speaking on both sides.  After Senator White made the point this morning, we heard a number of Senators making this point.  It undermines people&rsquo;s trust and confidence in politicians.  To hear Senator Leyden express a permanent state of indignation at what his Government is doing is extraordinary and it beggars belief.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the way they have spoken and in accordance with principle.  Senator Boyle expressed his support for a debate on education yet voted against the amendment to the Order of Business tabled by Fine Gael, not once but twice, this week and last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

	<P>That beggars belief.  Those who have been in this House a long time become utterly cynical about it and it is no wonder people outside these Houses are utterly cynical about politicians if they hear people saying one thing and then voting another way.  This happens all the time.  I ask the Leader for a debate on people voting the way they say they will vote and on people voting against their principles.  </P>

	<P>The broadcasting networks in Ireland have much to be proud of.  Over the years we have had many fine and responsible presenters who were aware of, and reflected, the values and the deeply held beliefs of the people who, in fact, paid them.  However, it is important we have a debate on standards in broadcasting every so often.</P>
        <P>We received a message from Britain in recent days when we saw the debacle with two highly paid presenters there.  The first reaction of the BBC to the offensive action was to defend them but when it received 18,000 telephone calls, the situation changed resulting in the resignation of one of the presenters and the suspension of the other one.</P>
        <P>In recent times in this country we have witnessed situations on television and radio programmes which were not acceptable if they were to reflect the values of the people.  I do not believe it is acceptable to poke fun at Down&rsquo;s syndrome children, Travellers or the crucifixion of Christ.  All that happened on our broadcasting network.</P>
        <P>Taking a message from Britain, we should step back and realise that it is not only a matter of ignoring and dulling the sensitivities of the people but it is a negation of responsibility that action is not taken.  I raised a specific incident on a previous occasion and in fairness to the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and Gay Byrne, an apology was given.  It is, however, quite clear that this is continuing and is being magnified over and over.  Therefore, if we do not take a message from what happened in Britain, we will not maintain the standards we expect in the broadcasting network.  With that in mind, I ask the Leader to arrange debate at an early date to give us an opportunity to express our views in a more extended and broader way.</P>

        <P>The Leader promised me two weeks ago that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, would come to the House for a serious debate on education.  I listened to the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night and he said something very important and correct.  He said the quality of teaching in the classroom is what matters.  However, it is very important that he knows that class size affects the quality of teaching in the classroom, as does the inclusion of children with special education needs and foreign national children without English.  Heaping them in on top of other children, as it were, is outrageous.</P>
        <P>I listened to the hypocrisy of the Green Party in Ireland and how it is letting down its Green colleagues in Finland.</P>

	<P>I am coming to my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should come to it quickly.  Other Members are offering.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Finnish Government is doing because I have called for us to study the Finnish education system at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science.  It is coming out on top in all levels of achievement in PISA, the Programme for International Student Achievement, whereas Ireland is coming out below average.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the call for a debate on agriculture.  The recent budget has meant farmers will lose 10% of their income, especially farmers in the west.  The suckler herd grant will be cut from &euro;80 to &euro;40 per cow.  This is an appalling cut.  Some 60% of suckler herds are in the west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Last week 2,000 farmers attended a meeting in Claremorris.  Tonight I believe they will meet in Tullamore in the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s area.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the calls for a debate on the way people vote, cynicism and so on.  It seems it was a clarion call for independence.  We are the only ones in this House who have the luxury of being able to act as we speak in the voting lobby.  I have seen every party in the Oireachtas behave in precisely the same way described by Senator Alex White.  This is a feature of the way in which the party system works.  Nobody is completely without guilt in this.</P>
        <P>We have received the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill 2008.  Will the Leader give me an idea when it will be taken?  It is a very important, significant and hopeful Bill and these days we need a bit of hope and idealism.  Ireland, the Seanad, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, all played a crucial role in getting international agreement.  I am very proud it is called the Dublin Agreement.  This is part of the realisation of this process.  It would be very good if we had a debate on this, which is something of which we can be proud in these difficult times.</P>
        <P>I thought I was in danger of agreeing with my good friend, Senator Hanafin, but then I realised I can only technically agree with his call for a debate on privatisation and so on.  Let us have such a debate.  Privatisation, the market, competition and so on have got us into this problem.  In the broadband debate, I did not hear one person refer to the fact that Tony O&rsquo;Reilly gobbled up Eircom and asset stripped it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not mention people outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That company had the lowest investment in infrastructure, especially in broadband.  Having flogged off Eircom, so to speak, we are going to do a little bit of short selling on the market, namely, selling and buying back again.  Hedge funds; short selling &mdash; what a way to go.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Aer Lingus was happily privatised and Shannon was shafted pretty nicely.  Now the workers are going to come out because Aer Lingus wants to outsource.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on all these issues, including Eircom, privatisation, the market and the Competition Authority which has been spoken about, has been absolutely useless, has only intervened against the citizens and neglected to notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the deadline that let off one major multinational corporation.  Let us have a debate on all these issues but let us be honest about and see what the record and the past has taught us in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the last part of what Senator Norris said.  I join other colleagues in seeking debates on agriculture, education and health.  Yesterday I asked the Leader for an indication when we might have those debates, although I did not expect he would be able to name the day.  Perhaps he did not fully understand what I was asking.</P>
        <P>What strikes me about the schedules we have had for recent weeks, including this week, is that it has been very slim.  There are a number of Ministers in the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Education and Science and Health and Children.  If the senior Minister cannot be in the Chamber for the entire debate, it should not mean we cannot have it.  It is <Col N="896"/>inappropriate that we have not had discussions on the budget cuts in education, health and agriculture since they were announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I hope we can have them as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>When Adjournment matters are tabled by Members, there is an appalling lack of relevant Ministers coming to the House to respond.  I had two Adjournment matters taken recently and have another matter listed for today, which I hope will be taken by the relevant Minister.  The two recent matters came within the remit of the Department of Education and Science in which there are at least four Ministers.  On both occasions one of the other Adjournment matters related to education.  It should be possible that one of the four Ministers in that Department could be here to answer direct questions on such matters.  It is all well and good to ask another Minister to reply, but he or she cannot deal specifically with matters relating to the Department of Education and Science.  I hope that there will be a change in this respect.</P>
        <P>The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, which was passed here two years ago, has disappeared into the ether between here and the other House and has not been seen since.  The argument could be made that, with the amount of conveyancing that has taken place in the past ten years, the passing of the Bill is a bit too late.  Will the Leader advise when the Bill might be taken in the other House &mdash; I acknowledge he may not be able to do so now on the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>I point out to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others that there are considerable disadvantaged areas in parts of the country other than the west.  Farmers in my part of the country and, I am sure, in the Leader&rsquo;s and the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s parts of the country will suffer serious cutbacks as a result of the budget with the cuts that will take place in the disadvantaged areas payments, the scrappage of the installation aid scheme and the early retirement scheme and significant cutbacks in the suckler cow scheme and a number of other initiatives.  I hope we will have a debate on agriculture as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I strongly second Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s remarks concerning the outrageous &mdash; he did not use that term but I have no hesitation in using it &mdash; broadcast on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; last week.  It was insulting to many people.  It was horrendous and the Senator was absolutely correct in what he said.  Something should be done about it.  I strongly commend to the Leader that steps be taken to deal with it.</P>

        <P>We must return to the drawing board regarding the education debate.  The Government will have to review class sizes and the substitution question.  They are not sustainable from the point of view of the welfare of our children, their education and their one opportunity and in terms of the economy in the long term.  The Leader should convey to the Minister that we have multi-ethnic classes, students with disabilities, students with a range of abilities and, thus, a mix that makes it impossible to consider raising the pupil-teacher ratio.  I commend to the Leader that we have a debate on education and rectify the matter.  The Government will simply have to do what it did in the other instance.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for a debate on agriculture in this House.  Agriculture is the source of employment in our country towns and our rural way of life.  Virtually all jobs in the small towns are connected with agriculture.  It is enough that farmers are subject to the normal taxation measures, the increase in college registration fees, the increase in petrol prices and the levy on <Col N="897"/>their income.  The normal taxation measures are imposed on them without the imposition of specific attacks relating to headage payments, the farm retirement scheme, the installation aid scheme and the suckler cow welfare scheme.  I appeal for a debate on agriculture and for a reversal of the decisions regarding those schemes.  I second the proposition by our Deputy Leader, Senator Cummins, that we have a debate on that.</P>
        <P>I also second Senator Cummins&rsquo;s remarks concerning the fair deal scheme.  Will the Leader clarify the tax implications of that scheme for people in nursing homes and their families?  When will the fair deal legislation come through and how will it impact on the people concerned?  The Leader needs to answer those questions.  We talked about the anxiety among pensioners regarding their medical cards, and that was valid, but one can imagine the anxiety among people in regard to nursing homes, older people who are very vulnerable.  I ask the Leader to take that on board.  As my colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan said, we should be debating these issues, regardless of how long we sit every day.  They are critical and the people are watching us on those issues.</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify the Order of Business.  I said that the statements regarding the Morris tribunal reports would commence on the conclusion of the Order of Business and would adjourn not later than 1.40 p.m.  I should have said that they would conclude not later than 1.40 p.m.</P>
        <P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Coghlan, Bradford, Regan, Healy Eames, Boyle, John Paul Phelan and O&rsquo;Reilly expressed various views and concerns regarding education.  As I pointed out yesterday, there is an increase of 3.2%, or &euro;302 million, in the education budget in these difficult economic times and the Government must be commended on that.  They are the facts.  There are now more than 30,000 primary teachers throughout the country.  Since 2002, in excess of 6,500 more teachers have been on the Department&rsquo;s payroll.  The Government is investing &euro;586 million in the capital programme this year, which must be spent by the end of this year.  That will deliver a record 1,200 new school places.  Furthermore, the allocation of &euro;889 million for 2009 is an increase of &euro;80 million on the allocation for 2008.  These facts must be stated to put everything in its proper context.  I have no difficulty in having further time allocated for a debate on education.  There was a debate on education last night.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty in asking the Minister to come to the House to discuss the achievements of the Government in funding for education.  As Senator Hanafin said, we have had 11 years of surplus and this year is the one year we will face extreme difficulty and that will possibly continue for the following two years.  Our future depends on our investment in education.</P>
        <P>I must take on board Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point.  As I said on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, if a person is successful in business, what would that person be able to do if he or she had the national resources of the nation behind him or her?  We must take advice from the captains of industry.  That is the reason I always pay particular attention to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s advice to the House.  We can take into account the experience of Finland when we have this debate.  I know the Joint Committee on Education and Science will closely examine that and hopefully will be able to assist the Government in the future policy direction.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins in particular asked me about the issue of tax relief for nursing homes.  I understand there are no changes in this respect.  I inform the House that next week the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, will be here on Thursday for statements on the Health Information and Quality Authority nursing home standards.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>Many Senators, particularly Senator Buttimer, called for the Minister, Deputy Harney, to come to the House.  She has always been available to attend the House provided she is not out of the country or in the D&aacute;il, and has been most co-operative to this House in the past 18 months.  I can confirm that statements on the over 70s&rsquo; entitlements to medical cards will be taken next Wednesday morning at the conclusion of the Order of Business and will continue until 1.45 p.m.  Senators can be prepared for that.</P>

	<P>That will take place next week.  I know that many Senators will wish to contribute to that discussion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the request for a debate on agriculture, I am actively pursing the Minister in terms of a date in his diary for this debate.  It is timely that this should take place and I have no difficulty in accommodating such a debate at the earliest possible time.  I will come back to the House next week with a time and date for that.  Senators Bradford, Quinn and Boyle expressed their various views on the economy and the public service.  I have no difficulty with such a debate, which I will endeavour to have at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden brought a very important point to our attention on the cost of energy, particularly oil, electricity and gas.  At yesterday&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I raised this point with the chairman of the Competition Authority and his officials who appeared to discuss other matters.  I highlighted the cost of energy, particularly electricity and gas, which have had increases of between 25% and 40% in this year alone.  This is unsustainable and unacceptable.  The chairman had very strong views on these matters and while he said that it was not within his remit he made various comments that we all know can be dealt with.  Perhaps we will have a debate on the cost of energy.  This will take place as soon as I can arrange it.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the importance of the allocation of national lottery funds for youth services.  I understand such allocations are completely dependent on the availability of funds.  I will certainly pass the Senator&rsquo;s strong views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan referred to the old chestnut of the Mahon tribunal.  I wish the tribunal well in its deliberations.  It is a mammoth task and a great undertaking has been going on for in excess of ten years, with more than 400 witnesses giving evidence.  I hope all can benefit from the experience.  It was not just one party alone that appeared before the tribunal, I understand that members of other parties were there.  I hope everyone in public life can learn from the experience that these difficulties arise from time to time.  We are placed here by the trust of the people.  On the day that I was first elected to the Seanad, I came home to Castlepollard where 1,000 people had come out.</P>

	<P>My late father told me I was getting involved in a very difficult industry.  He said I was going in with my good name and that if I came out the same way I would have achieved a lot.  For many years I wondered why he felt it necessary to say that to me because I always tried to do the right thing in my life.  At the end of it all, I realised how <Col N="899"/>sensible a remark it was from an ordinary man in an ordinary part of the country.  What great advice it was and I never forgot it.  Now that I have placed it on the record of the House, I am sure other colleagues might deliberate on it from time to time when put in the same difficult positions.  It is never the wrong time to do the right thing, as Paudge Brennan used to say, and I hope all Members of this House will always bear that in mind.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin made a proposal regarding Eircom.  This can certainly be discussed and debated.  I will certainly pass his views on to the Minister.  The House may be able to discuss them at some future time when we are discussing the issue of finance for communications.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and O&rsquo;Reilly spoke about the media.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; put his finger on the point in congratulating those responsible people in the media who have maintained the standards of broadcasting at such a high level here.  We can have a debate on standards in broadcasting at the earliest time.  We certainly must not let our standards slip in any shape or form.  From that point of view I have no difficulty in allocating time.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris made an inquiry about the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill 2008.  I understand that Bill was published yesterday &mdash; I received a copy of it anyway.  I hope it will be through before the Christmas recess.  Senator John Paul Phelan asked about the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, which was passed by this House two years ago.  I will come back to him in that regard.</P>

    <Title>Morris Tribunal: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The publication of the sixth, seventh and eighth reports of the Morris tribunal brings to a close a six-year investigation into misbehaviour on the part of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Donegal during a period in the 1990s.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I would especially like to thank Mr. Justice Morris and his team for producing eight comprehensive and conclusive reports and for the huge service they have done for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public.  Mr. Justice Morris carried out the task with diligence, independence, intelligence and fairness.  Having listened to more than 680 days of oral evidence from 812 witnesses, he reached his conclusions without fear or favour.  His practice of publishing reports in a systematic manner at the end of each module or set of modules facilitated public discourse and enabled the Government to give considerable weight to his recommendations in framing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The tribunal uncovered a pattern of Garda misbehaviour that was unprecedented, disturbing and at times shocking and that called for a strong and effective response.  The Garda Commissioner stated that the events outlined in the various reports of the tribunal and the unacceptable actions of individual members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na identified in those reports represent a dark period in the history of a great and proud organisation.  He pointed out that they do a grave disservice to the tradition of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and dishonour its primary objective, which is to provide professional, fair and effective policing to all in our community.  He apologised to those who were found to have been mistreated by garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The Government shares the sentiments expressed so well by the Garda Commissioner and readily acknowledges that certain individuals were subjected to police actions that fell far short of the high standards that citizens are entitled to expect from all members of the force.</P>
        <P>The second Morris report was published in June 2005, shortly before the commencement of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  It characterised the Garda investigation into the death of Richard Barron in Raphoe on 14 October 1996 as &ldquo;prejudiced, tendentious and utterly negligent in the highest degree&rdquo;.  It was heavily prejudiced against two suspects, Frank McBrearty Junior and Mark McConnell.  This gross incompetence gave rise to a series of subsequent events that are fully analysed in the sixth and seventh reports.  Those reports reveal a continuous pattern of misbehaviour against the McBrearty family and its relatives, friends and associates.  Members of the family of the late Richard Barron were also victims of this misconduct and I extend my sympathies to them for the grievous loss they have suffered.</P>
        <P>In the time available I do not intend to reprise all the findings of the sixth, seventh and eighth Morris reports, but I will set out the main elements of those findings and detail the strong action taken by the Government as events unfolded.  The sixth report examined the circumstances surrounding the arrest, detention and treatment in custody of a number of persons arising, directly or indirectly, from the investigation into the death of Richard Barron.  The report makes serious findings against a number of garda&iacute; involved.  It finds that a number of persons were unlawfully arrested and detained and that some were mistreated in custody, mainly through verbal and, in some cases, physical abuse.  The tribunal does not accept the evidence to it of several garda&iacute; and strongly condemns the instances of mistreatment uncovered.</P>
        <P>The report made a number of recommendations arising from its findings, mainly centred on how improvements could be made to the law and practice relating to the conduct of interviews with persons in Garda custody, but also touching on other aspects of Garda investigations.  In consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Minister is carefully considering the recommendations and will table any necessary proposals for change.  On the positive side, the report <Col N="901"/>found no truth in the serious allegation that conversations between solicitors and persons detained in Letterkenny Garda station were secretly recorded by garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The seventh report uncovers a continuous pattern of harassment by some garda&iacute; in the months that followed.  Some 68 summonses were issued against associates of the McBrearty family with the full knowledge and approval of some of the most senior officers in the Donegal division at the time.  Among the most serious findings is the finding that Detective Sergeant White planted drugs on Paul Quinn to &ldquo;teach him a lesson&rdquo;.  The garda&iacute; impugned in the seventh report have been dismissed, have retired early or have resigned.  The seventh report also confirmed that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board had neither the statutory powers nor the resources to deal effectively with events on the scale of those that emerged in Donegal.</P>
        <P>The eighth report concluded that the false allegations against two assistant commissioners, which were brought by Deputy Howlin and then Deputy Jim Higgins to the then Minister, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, were utterly without foundation.  They had been constructed by Mr. Frank McBrearty Senior, assisted by Mr. P. J. Togher, a former garda, from &ldquo;numerous half-truths, lies and rumours&rdquo;.  The tribunal also identified Mr. Martin Giblin, SC, as the person who conveyed the information to Deputy Howlin.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report was critical of the Deputies for their failure to reveal these sources of information to either the Garda assistant commissioner appointed to investigate the matter following the intervention of the then Minister or to the tribunal itself.  Mr. Justice Morris is of the opinion that the Deputies should have carried out some further inquiries before bringing the anonymous allegations to the attention of the Minister.  This was his recommendation because the sources were confidential and neither the Minister nor any investigators of these matters would be allowed access to them.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Morris was also critical of the failure of the then Deputy Jim Higgins to disclose the existence of a fax he received on 15 July 2000 for a period of approximately two and a half years.  In the fax&rsquo;s terms, it exonerated Assistant Commissioner Carty to a significant extent from the false allegations made against him in the information that was originally supplied to the Minister and, consequently, to the Garda investigation team and the tribunal.  This also meant that the tribunal&rsquo;s terms of reference were framed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the absence of important information of direct relevance to those terms.</P>
        <P>There are differing opinions on Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s findings on these matters.  However, we are all grateful that the reputations of two highly respected senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Assistant Commissioner Kevin Carty and retired Assistant Commissioner Tony Hickey, have been vindicated by Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s findings.</P>
        <P>As a consequence of these findings, Mr. Justice Morris recommended that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann urgently review the manner in which Members deal with whistleblower allegations to guard against unfounded allegations being endowed with undeserved legitimacy.  I will return to this matter shortly.</P>
        <P>The significant reforms that have taken place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the past three years have in large part been a result of the findings and recommendations of the Morris tribunal.  The major step in the reform process was the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  This legislation represented the single greatest change in the way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated since its establishment after our independence in 1922.  At the heart of the Act is a new statement of the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation and of the Garda Commissioner as its head.  The Act makes clear the Commissioner&rsquo;s relationship with the Minister, the Department, the Government and the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Regarding accountability, individual garda&iacute; are now required to account to a higher officer for any act or omission of an act while on duty.  The Garda Commissioner is obliged to account <Col N="902"/>to the Government through the Secretary General of my Department for any aspect of his functions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A significant number of other developments are transforming the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and addressing  the problems identified by the tribunal.  The new Garda discipline regulations introduced last year have introduced more streamlined discipline procedures.  There is a new system of external oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has been in operation since May 2007 under the chairmanship of a High Court judge.  The Garda inspectorate has brought international policing expertise to bear in ensuring that Garda resources are used so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness.  The civilianisation programme has resulted in the appointment of civilian managers to a range of senior and middle management positions within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2006, a new promotions system was introduced which aims to ensure that talent and performance are recognised and rewarded.  Greater engagement between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities has been promoted by the establishment of joint policing committees which are now being rolled out to all local authority areas.  The Garda Reserve was established in 2006 and its members are making a positive contribution to policing local communities throughout the State.</P>
        <P>I said earlier I would return to Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s recommendation in his eighth report concerning the procedures of this House.   The tribunal has recommended that the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of the two Houses of the Oireachtas urgently review the manner in which Members deal with allegations brought to their attention by so-called whistleblowers, although neither Mr McBrearty nor Mr Giblin was a whistleblower in the sense of being inside the Garda structure.  It is clear that the tribunal is not against the principle of whistleblowing <i>per se</i>.  A key issue to emerge from the Morris tribunal&rsquo;s investigations was the lack of a whistleblower system for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to raise concerns they may have about wrongdoing in the force.  In its third report, the tribunal recommended that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Subject to safeguards, it should be possible for any serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ring headquarters, and to speak in confidence with a designated officer, or group of officers, as to real concerns they may have as to misconduct within the organisation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, which were made in April 2007, allow civilian employees as well as sworn members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make confidential reports on any corruption or malpractice of which they become aware.  The regulations are framed in a way that seeks to strike the correct balance in achieving that objective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tribunal recommends that the review should be addressed urgently by both Houses &ldquo;with a view to ensuring an appropriate balance between the right of access of a &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; to his/her public representative, and the right of those subject to those allegations to be fairly treated and not made the subject of unfounded allegations that have been endowed with undeserved legitimacy because they were conveyed cynically and successfully to well-meaning members of either House&rdquo;.  In view of what happened in this case, the tribunal&rsquo;s recommendation is eminently sensible.  I am sure the committees of both Houses will consider these matters carefully and I look forward to hearing what they have to say in due course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is evident that the findings and recommendations of the Morris tribunal have been a major influence on the considerable change that has taken place in policing in recent years.  A strong and effective response was demanded to events in Donegal, not only by the public but also by the overwhelming majority of honest and decent members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who serve the public loyally and well, even to the point of risking their lives in the line of duty.  The groundwork has now been laid to ensure the culture and organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <Col N="903"/>are more open to the outside than ever before and that the organisation is fully fit for purpose.  This has helped to strengthen it and assist it in performing its vital role in today&rsquo;s Ireland.</P>
        <P>We must never be complacent and must always keep under review the adequacy of governance and oversight in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At the same time, we should recognise the major reforms that have been put in place, reforms which owe a great deal to Mr. Justice Morris and his dedicated team who are so deserving of our thanks, respect and praise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s outline of the findings of the Morris tribunal reports.  I agree with much of what has been said.  Mr. Justice Frederick Morris has done extraordinary work in his inquiry into the activities of certain individuals in the Donegal division of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The thoroughness of that work and the extensive nature of the reports make for compelling reading.  The first report, which was published as far back as July 2004, highlighted the planting of bogus explosives in the 1990s.  The second report dealt with negligence in the handling of the investigation into the death of Richie Barron.  The May 2008 report referred to the invention of evidence and bogus arrests.  The seventh and eighth reports deal with harassment and the question of how allegations are handled by public representatives.  People are shocked that such activities could take place within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a body which was and still is held in high regard by most people.  The Morris tribunal has unearthed an array of the most serious abuses.  </P>
        <P>It is important, however, to emphasise that the corruption exposed by Mr. Justice Morris and his team, and which has tarnished the force, was practised by a minority of individuals within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These findings have led to the introduction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda inspectorate, with the result that confidence in the force has in large measure been restored.  The most recent surveys, carried out this year, indicate a public satisfaction rating of 81%.  Nevertheless, the editorial in the latest <i>Garda Review</i> observes that the small number of garda&iacute; who made the headlines for all the wrong reasons completely drowned out the significant numbers who were entirely exonerated by the tribunal&rsquo;s findings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any allegations against a named individual which are the subject of a tribunal or investigation can have a serious effect on the person concerned.  This is certainly true in the case of Assistant Commissioners Kevin Carty and Tony Hickey who were totally exonerated by the tribunal.  Tribunals are set up to sift out allegations and establish facts.  Mr. Justice Alan Mahon was recently obliged to underline that the purpose of the tribunal of which he is chairman is also to vindicate individuals who have been the subject of allegations; it is not simply about condemning people.  In the case of the Morris tribunal, the two individuals in question have been entirely exonerated albeit, given the lapse of time, their careers were undoubtedly affected by the allegations.  However, the point is that the tribunal has served its purpose in exonerating them.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that the final reports have detracted from the main focus of the inquiry, namely, to investigate misbehaviour in a particular division of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to establish procedures to correct that.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has put a particular spin on the findings of Mr. Justice Morris in regard to the allegations that were passed by Deputy Howlin and Mr. Jim Higgins, MEP, to the then Minister.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should be the last person to adopt this approach on such a matter.  When he was asked some years ago to investigate issues concerning a former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, claimed he had tried to find the truth but had got nowhere.  It is difficult to carry out one&rsquo;s own personal investigations of allegations.  For the Minister to put a spin on the tribunal&rsquo;s report is entirely inappropriate, particularly in his case.</P><Col N="904"/>
        <P>There is another issue.  The Minister claims in his defence that he is merely quoting the chairman of the tribunal.  However, this Minister has not always been so respectful of tribunals.  We have had the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals and findings in respect of a former Taoiseach.  The Minister had no difficulty disavowing any findings of the tribunal in regard to the former Taoiseach.</P>

Not alone would we not have had a tribunal but we would not have known what was possible, in terms of abuse, within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

        <P>Notwithstanding the furore created by the Minister in regard to this final report, the reports and Mr. Justice Frederick Morris and his team have done a wonderful service to the body politic in Ireland and to one of the most important organisations to the functioning of this State, namely, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I compliment Mr. Justice Morris in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to debate this important report from Mr. Justice Morris.  There have been eight reports, many of which have been debated previously in this House.  Many changes in practice within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have ensued as a consequence of these reports.  As the Minister of State said, Mr. Justice Morris deserves credit.  The tribunal was long and protracted and took more than six and a half years to complete its work.  It is fair to say that the practice of issuing reports and conclusions following completion of each module has been beneficial in informing the change which has taken place in the policing practices in this country.  We will reap the benefits of this in the future.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile stating that we are, in this debate, dealing with the 6th, 7th and 8th reports.  The 6th report made serious findings against a number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arising from the unfortunate death of Richie Barron.  It found that a number of persons were unlawfully arrested and detained and that some were mistreated in custody.  Equally alarming is that the tribunal did not accept the evidence of several members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and strongly condemned the incidences of mistreatment it uncovered.  This goes to the core of what the police force should be about in terms of trust and its respect for other institutions of the State.  That the tribunal did not accept some of the evidence given illustrates that much was going wrong in that jurisdiction in Donegal.</P>
        <P>The 7th report uncovered a continuing pattern of harassment by some garda&iacute;, the issuance of 68 summons against associates of the McBrearty family and that Detective Sergeant White planted drugs on Paul Quinn to teach him a lesson.  It is fair to point out that those members of the force impugned in the 7th report are no longer members of the Garda in that they have either been dismissed, retired or have resigned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 7th report also points out that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board had neither the statutory powers nor the resources to deal effectively with the scale of events that emerged in Donegal.  In my opinion, this raises questions such as why the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was not aware of the deficiencies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board and why remedial action was not taken.  It also raises questions about the effectiveness of management controls within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally and, in particular, in regard to the exercise of responsibility by Garda headquarters.  These matters should be examined to ensure the force is strengthened.  While I accept there has been a great deal of change we must not allow this type of scenario to develop again.</P>
        <P>I was previously a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights which examined investigations by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  The lack of preservation by garda&iacute; of crucial evidence in the most serious of <Col N="906"/>crimes, some involving multiple murders, and the lack of control exercised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform illustrated, in my opinion, a clear dereliction of duty at the time by senior people on whom the State was depending to ensure we had effective policing in this country.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that, perhaps as a consequence of the findings of the Morris tribunal, the ensuing reports and other incidents, we now have a Garda Ombudsman Commission and a Garda inspectorate &mdash; which I strongly welcomed &mdash; which has a critical role to play in ensuring we have a police force of which this State and its citizens can be proud.  The majority of garda&iacute; are honest and good people who want to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the joint policing committees was a great innovation of previous Ministers.  I accept that changes have been made.  There has been much criticism of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an institution of this State arising from the events in Donegal, in particular, and in other areas.  Abuses of power cannot and should not be accepted.</P>
        <P>I join those who praise Mr. Justice Morris for his commitment to this task on behalf of the State.  As a consequence of his good work, we will hopefully never see a recurrence.  Listening to the Order of Business, I heard about people talking out of both sides of their mouths.  We are happy to accept aspects of the report, but Senator Regan disagrees with other aspects.  When others take a similar position, that is not acceptable to Senator Regan.   Subjective views apply here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is spin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think there was any spin on this.  Mr. Justice Morris, in his report, is critical of the false allegations made anonymously through two D&aacute;il Deputies, which impacted on the careers of two senior assistant commissioners of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </P>
        <P>I know Deputy Howlin much better than former Deputy Higgins.  We come from the same constituency.   He is a conviction politician and I have good regard for him.  I have no doubt everything he does is done with the best motivations.  Both Deputies received information on the same day, 25 June 2000, which they passed to the then Minister for Justice, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, who acted on foot of that information.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, highlighted the part of the report Mr. Justice Morris referred to regarding further information in a facsimile message received by then Deputy Higgins on 15 July 2000, which cast some doubt on the original information received.  It would be helpful if former Deputy Higgins made a statement to clarify why the fax and the information in it was withheld and not reported until three years later.  I will not make a judgment on it, but it could have had a bearing on the establishment and the terms of reference of the tribunal.  In this instance, the tribunal was carried out more efficiently than others, but there is a large cost involved.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan said this morning, &ldquo;lessons have to be learned&rdquo;.  Reports will be issued and the findings should and must be acted upon.  Spending hundreds of millions of euro, even at a time when Exchequer finances were in a strong, healthy position, was totally unwarranted.  I hope we have learned that less costly mechanisms should be used to ascertain the truth in issues of public importance in the future.  One example is the commission of investigation model, which was established by theses Houses in recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have been highly critical of the cost of tribunals and of the exorbitant legal fees.  There should be a maximum fees order on senior counsel of no more than &euro;800 or &euro;1,000 per day for High Court or Supreme Court attendances.  It is not good enough that captive clients can be compelled to accept exorbitant fees in a service area where there is no competition.  It is a <Col N="907"/>criticism of the Competition Authority; I know it issued a report but it failed to deal with this at a much earlier stage.  That is an issue of public importance which I hope will be addressed by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I had discussions with Deputy Howlin and we have a difference of opinion.  Where we establish, through the Houses of the Oireachtas, tribunals of inquiry into matters of public importance, preserving an absolute entitlement to non-disclosure of sources may not be justified.  That is part of what Mr. Justice Morris addresses.  In this instance, a case went through the High Court and the Supreme Court.  There is an important principle involved.  The CPP of both Houses supported the case and instructed their legal teams to go in.  There were legal teams on behalf of the two individuals and the CPP of the Houses, which cost in excess of &euro;1 million.  That is not good investment of public funds.</P>
        <P>Where a tribunal is established the absolute privilege we claim should not continue to be applied.  Mr. Justice Morris raised the issue of whistleblowers, which he asked the CPP to look at because where information comes maliciously or falsely to individuals of the Houses, who act in good faith, which the two Deputies did, it can give rise to the situation that emerged here.</P>
        <P>The overriding thrust of these reports brings us to the conclusion that the disgraceful behaviour of a small number of garda&iacute; during the 1990s in Donegal should not be allowed to overshadow the dedication and public service given by the majority of garda&iacute;, now and in the past, to the State.  That would be retrograde and would be an injustice to those who have served with distinction.</P>

	<P>Please interrupt me if I speak for six minutes.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad to hear him refer, particularly, to the Morris tribunal and state that the complaints do a grave disservice to the tradition of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and dishonour their primary objective to provide professional, fair and effective policing to our community.  Since the State was established and the decision made in the 1920s to have an unarmed Garda force, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been held in very high regard, and hopefully that will continue.  What happened in Donegal in the 1990s caused great concern.  I hope it will not hamper or damage the ability of the Garda to do, as Senator Walsh referred to, the very effective job it has done in the past.</P>
        <P>A management term refers to &ldquo;flat management&rdquo;, which involves passing as much responsibility as possible on to people without having a structure that has many different controls before someone can make a decision.  In solving this problem, I hope we do not end up losing the innovation and enthusiasm of people in the force.  There is a danger of that with the structures that have been put in place.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State discussed the whistleblowers mechanism.  After years of demand from the public for whistleblowers means within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the new confidential system for reporting Garda malpratice was announced in April 2007, over 18 months ago.  Although this facility must be welcomed, why was the system not made active until just four months ago?</P>
        <P>I understand the whistleblowers mechanism has already received three contacts from garda&iacute; concerned about the conduct of fellow garda&iacute;.  As there have already been three cases in the four months of operation, surely this is considered a large number?  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s view.  The Government already gave up the need for legislation in 2006 that would have provided for extended legal protection for whistleblowers in favour of a so-called <Col N="908"/>sectoral approach.  It is not unusual for whistleblowers to be discriminated against by current or future employers or even sacked from the organisation.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we need legislative provision to facilitate whistleblowers.  The director of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Mr. Paul Appleby, stated in May this year that he &ldquo;would like to see a whistleblowing provision provided in the forthcoming companies consolidation and reform Bill&rdquo;.  We need a different approach to whistleblowing and perhaps it is regarded as a non-Irish thing to do.  The shortcomings of the Garda, which were highlighted by the Morris report, show we need to afford whistleblowers more protection and commend them on their civic contribution rather than ostracise them as informers, which has happened in the past.</P>
        <P>There are numerous examples of very brave Irish whistleblowers.  For example, Fr. Gerald McGinnity was removed as senior dean at St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Maynooth, in 1984 when he tried to draw the attention of its bishop trustees to seminarians&rsquo; concerns about the behaviour of the then vice president.  Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe was charged with contempt of court for refusing to name her sources to the beef tribunal following her 1991 &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; television programme which led to the establishment of that tribunal.  Sheenagh McMahon experienced devastating personal repercussions when she revealed in 1999 that her husband, Detective Garda Noel McMahon, had planted home made explosives later claimed as significant IRA explosive finds.  That led to the establishment of the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have mentioned these because we must act on the need for whistleblowers.  I am concerned about the solutions we are finding to put in place controls to ensure this does not happen again in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Senator Walsh spoke about the Garda inspectorate, the joint policing committees and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The danger I see is that individual members of the Garda will be so afraid of taking a step out of line, they will be controlled by the duties placed on them.  I know garda&iacute; in the past who have taken innovative individual steps and have been able to say a problem should be solved in one way rather than another.  I hate to think that young garda&iacute; joining up, in particular, may be inhibited from taking the right steps.</P>
        <P>With whatever solutions come from the Morris tribunal, I urge the Minister to maintain the effective Garda force of which we have been so proud over the years.  We should not hamper or damage it or inhibit the individual ability of garda&iacute; to act in the best manner of protecting citizens and giving them the sort of police force we have been used to in the past 80 years and which should continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this subject.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas and the people are deeply in debt to former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The cardinal point is that without them, the Morris tribunal would not have existed.  They did not make allegations but rather reported them while behaving in a very proper way.  They did not abuse the privilege of the House or name people while in it.  They did exactly as Mr. Cosgrave had done with Jack Lynch and went to a senior Minister with the allegations.  When the allegations were investigated, the vast and overwhelming majority of them were found to be true.  Our first point should be our gratitude for the proper behaviour of these two Deputies.</P>
        <P>The findings indicate there was a serious incident and the Garda was called upon because a man was dead.  One garda was off having a drink and the other two were on a meal break so they would not attend a roadside accident where somebody had died.  They did not preserve the scene, although it was initially accepted it was a hit and run accident.  They then started to frame the McBreartys.  There was no evidence and yet they levelled charges against Frank <Col N="909"/>McBrearty and Mark McConnell.  They proceeded to use a plant and there were 68 prosecutions over an 18-month period.</P>
        <P>The allegations properly passed on by these Deputies included the manufacturing of bombs, which we all heard about from the evidence given.  It was re-enacted brilliantly on Vincent Browne&rsquo;s show, which detailed the grinding of chemicals in coffee grinders.  It was a mad scenario.  The allegations also included the planting of bombs, use of bogus informers and the framing of innocent people.  The allegations upheld included allegations of using bogus informers, planting IRA bombs, planting a gun and explosive device to arrest innocent people and coercing murder statements from witnesses.</P>
        <P>Garda&iacute; lied under oath at the tribunal and then covered up the activities of corrupt senior officers out of a sense of misplaced loyalty.  That was in a case where the disciplinary regime was totally deficient, as a member could hardly be sacked for anything and an answer could not even be extracted.  Members did not have to explain actions to a superior officer.  That was not confined to Donegal.</P>
        <P>Thanks to the action of former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin, we have a new regime, which the Minister of State referred to, where garda&iacute; are compelled to furnish answers.  A register of informers has been introduced and there is a whistleblowers charter and so on.  I remind the House this would not have happened without former Deputy Higgins and Deputy Howlin.  The accusations against them are misplaced.  They went to the Minister and gave the information to him in confidence, as had been done in the past.  No garda&rsquo;s name was mentioned in public utterances.</P>
        <P>They have been told they should have investigated the allegations.  How could they have done this?  It took the Morris tribunal six and a half years, millions of euro and the power to compel witnesses to do so.  Which of us could possibly expend that kind of energy and dynamism?  It is a farce to have expected them to investigate the allegations.  In any event, a decision in the Abbeylara case places considerable restrictions on the capacity of elected representatives to intervene in a matter investigating a private citizen.</P>
        <P>The allegations were not made by the two Deputies.  One allegation passed on was found not to be true but we should follow the matter a little further.  When the information was passed to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, he decided to investigate.  The allegations against these two senior garda&iacute; were investigated but even after the investigation, the Minister decided to include the allegations in the terms of reference of the tribunal.  If there is any responsibility, it would bounce back to the then Minister, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, who after having the matter investigated still found the charges serious enough to be included in the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal.  That completely exonerates former Deputy Higgins and Deputy Howlin.</P>
        <P>We have reason to be grateful to the Morris tribunal.  Although it has been expensive and lawyers make much money from such things, that is the responsibility of the Government that established them.  The Government should have considered payment in the terms of reference as much money was spent.  Nevertheless, it is good to think we are improving these matters and this kind of corruption will be restricted if not completely stamped out.</P>
        <P>I have the highest regard for the Garda which serves us well.  It had a systemic problem and then the characteristic few rotten apples.</P>
        <P>This matter is not yet finished.  This was a case of a couple of people who were framed by garda&iacute;.  In the previous session I raised the case of a man prominent in Dublin business life who was framed by certain elements within that circle.  The Minister of State may find the records of this matter.</P><Col N="910"/>
        <P>While I will not name the man, he was head of ISME and the matter received much publicity after I raised it in this House.  The fraud squad was involved and while I do not suggest it was deliberately corrupt or anything else, although a series of meetings has been arranged between the principal in the case and the fraud squad over the years, they never meet.  Letters no longer are replied to, meetings are arranged and people travel long distances only to meet a closed door.  I will conclude on this point.  The Minister of State should take up this matter and I can supply him with the relevant information.  He should establish the reason the fraud squad continues to pussyfoot around and does not meet this man against whom serious allegations were made and subsequently disproved.  He is trying to get to the bottom of the matter.  They agree to meet him but then no one is there and there are no appointments.  I do not understand what is going on and I believe this is a serious case.</P>
        <P>Everyone, including Members as public representatives and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the guardians of our peace, must be accountable.  To state the Garda must be accountable is not to state that widespread corruption exists or that one should be suspicious of all police.  While the Garda does a good job, by and large, when it falls down on the job it has disastrous implications for all of us as citizens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The gratitude of the House in respect of the work done by Mr. Justice Morris already has been marked.  One must repeat the comments made by the Minister of State in his opening contribution to the effect that the entire purpose of the tribunal was to examine how one particular incident affected those who were accused and how they were subsequently treated in Garda custody.  The main finding of the report, which was given in June 2005, indicated the investigation was &ldquo;prejudiced, tendentious and utterly negligent in the highest degree&rdquo;.  To have such a finding made in respect of our police force is utterly shaming.  It reflects badly on the individuals concerned and places an onus on how the Garda, as a body corporate, is perceived by the public.  Everyone will accept the Garda is a highly effective police force.  It is supported by the population but such incidents and those who are involved in them do nothing to ensure this confidence is shared at all times.</P>
        <P>The tribunal findings in respect of particular incidents pertained to the culture that obtained in County Donegal in particular.  However, while such incidents may have been specific to that location in their intensity, there is a need for wider debate on whether their more petty practices are to be found elsewhere.  If a case exists that there is a culture of planting evidence or of petty corruption, such as the breaking of laws and subsequent avoidance of taking responsibility for so doing by Garda members or the protection of family members in similar circumstances, then confidence-building agencies are needed that will help to identify such practices, root them out and ensure they do not recur.</P>
        <P>The office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was established subsequent to the establishment of the tribunal and it is a case of waiting and seeing as to its effectiveness.  I tend to consider that the degree to which Garda representative bodies are unhappy with the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has worked to date is a sign in its favour because it shows there is a policing of the police.  This pertains to the dilemma of who guards the guards that has obtained since Members have been obliged to deal with such issues in the first instance.  Members must ensure the resources and structures that are in place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission are sufficient.  During the passage of the relevant legislation, Members debated whether the three-person structure was adequate or whether the highly effective structure that operated in Northern Ireland would be more appropriate.  This debate should be ongoing because the work done by Nuala O&rsquo;Loan in particular, <Col N="911"/>albeit in a situation that also was coloured by distinctions of a political and religious nature, was highly effective and proved to be a template for how such an office should work.</P>
        <P>I will revert to the matters in hand in respect of the report itself.  It is an additional commendation of the work of Mr. Justice Morris and his team that he is far from circumspect in spreading the blame regarding what went wrong in respect of this incident and the systems and procedures surrounding it.  There is criticism of the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the area of privileges and procedures.  I consider that the work of the two Oireachtas Members in question was more to the advantage of advancing justice in Ireland than not.  However, pertinent questions are asked by the findings as to whether the use of privilege and the potential abuse of privilege is something against which these Houses have sufficient protection.  These are pertinent questions because of the potential that, for mischief&rsquo;s sake, allegations can be invented on the pretext of privilege, even without such allegations coming through a third party or an alleged whistleblower.  I would welcome a wider debate on how Members can prevent such an occurrence.  I must admit that in my experience in both Houses, I never have seen an incidence of the use of privilege being abused.  However, that does not mean Members must not be wary of the possibility that it can be.</P>
        <P>Blame also is apportioned to some of those who were peripheral victims of the original incident in respect of the making of further allegations.  Mr. Justice Morris has made a highly serious criticism in this regard.  The invention of further allegations is the equivalent of police planting evidence in the first instance and the planting of drugs in particular.  I am unsure how this finding of the tribunal will be pursued.  While one can argue about how this might have come about in human terms, it did not help how the tribunal was allowed to do its work or how the tribunal eventually was allowed to make its finding on the main object, namely, the death of a person and people who were unjustly accused in that regard.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, there has been a huge cost to the State, not only in the cost of the tribunal itself but in high awards to individuals who have been affected by Garda negligence.  Members&rsquo; responsibility is of both a fiscal and a moral nature and when addressing the work of the Morris tribunal, they should not only state that such situations should be avoided but should discuss how it both affects the rights of the individuals concerns and how it diminishes the ability of the Government to allocate resources effectively, particularly in the area of justice.  If such lessons are learned, if they can be reinforced and if such incidents can be avoided, Members should be grateful for what the Morris tribunal has done.  However, if another situation arises in which such cultures are allowed to develop that somehow are reinforced by a lack of proper management within the Garda and a lack of legislative and political action, unfortunately the work of Mr. Justice Morris and his team merely will be perceived as another attempt to stop a tide that those of us engaged in politics have not been successful in stopping in the first instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by echoing the remarks of other Members in respect of Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s work during the preparation of his eight reports.  I refer to the extraordinary amount of work that was input, the careful consideration and sifting of evidence and allegations, as well as the highly detailed and, as Members have commented, in many ways shocking contents of the reports that have been published as a result of the inquiries the judge carried out.  I also add my congratulations to those who worked with Mr. Justice Morris in his tribunal, including the lawyers, high-paid or otherwise, who performed an important public duty by sifting through a considerable number of allegations, sometimes of great complexity, as well as hearing evidence and reaching conclusions based on the evidence put before the tribunal and publishing the reports it was charged with providing to the Oireachtas when it was first established.</P><Col N="912"/>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P Just="Left">The most recent report is the one we are at present considering in greatest detail but, as other Senators have noted, the most serious of conclusions were reached by the Morris tribunal and each of the eight reports makes for disturbing reading.  As others have quoted from the findings, I will not rehearse them other than to note that a police force in a democratic society is nothing without the trust of the community.  The Garda has a remarkable tradition of coming from the community but if that connection is undermined, it will hit at the core of the confidence that the public must have in its police force for society to function and justice and policing to be administered efficiently and fairly.  If authority is rooted in the society which it serves, it will be successful.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the example of what occurred over a number of years in Donegal, which the Minister of State described as a dark period in our history, could be repeated and suspicions remain that similar practices continue.  Ongoing scrutiny and engagement are needed in respect of these issues because we cannot be absolutely confident that the dreadful deeds set out in the Morris reports will never be repeated.  Perhaps ominously, Mr. Justice Morris was of the opinion that the garda&iacute; serving in Donegal cannot be viewed as unrepresentative or an aberration from the generality.  He was reflecting on concerns that he was not inquiring into an isolated case and reminding us of the need for constant vigilance and proper mechanisms to ensure public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>One hopes these matters will be consigned to history but the only way we can be sure of this is by developing the confidence building institutions to which Senator Boyle referred.  In this regard I welcome the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, although I fear that we have not gone far enough.  The model successfully developed in the North might be copied in this part of the island.  Like Senator Boyle, I am prepared to allow the commission some time before judging its success.</P>
        <P>My party has made other proposals in the context of the debates on these issues.  In particular, we see the need for an independent Garda authority between the Garda and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The resistance that has been put in the way of such a body is not ultimately sustainable.  I do not understand why the Government is not supportive of the notion of an independent body which would scrutinise the operations of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>We have also proposed extending the remit of the Freedom of Information Act to the Garda.  Regrettably, the resistance to this proposal comes from a culture similar to the one that has prevented the establishment of an independent Garda authority.  This culture is based on the belief that all power should be tightly controlled within the Department and that opportunities for scrutiny in which the public might engage should be resisted at all costs.  However, information is everything in these matters.  Often, if people receive, in response to their inquiries or complaints, evidence of what actually occurred, they see the rationale for the decision and are reassured.  However, confidence breaks down and uncertainty increases where a culture of withholding information exists.</P>
        <P>Remarks have been made during our debate regarding the roles played by Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Jim Higgins.  In fairness to the Minister of State, his contribution to the Seanad debate was markedly different from the speech made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the D&aacute;il.  Regrettably, the Minister found himself unable to pass up the opportunity for making a baldly partisan political intervention.  So many of his comments were devoted to criticisms of Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Jim Higgins that one had to delve deeply into his speech to establish his views on the Morris report.  I welcome, therefore, the change of tone signalled by the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to this House.  It is legitimate to <Col N="913"/>seek debate on the implications of what was said about the contributions of two serving public representatives who Mr. Justice Morris acknowledged were acting in good faith.  After hearing the Minister&rsquo;s contribution in the other House, however, one might be forgiven for thinking that was not the case.  He made little mention of the fact that the politicians concerned were acting in the public interest and were doing everything they could to act properly by relaying the allegations to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Morris was of the opinion that the two should have made &ldquo;some further enquiries before going to the Minister&rdquo;.  My colleagues in this House have asked the precise meaning of that statement.  What level of inquiry ought a Deputy or Senator engage in prior to passing allegations to the responsible Minister?  Members face a considerable dilemma in trying to understand the level of investigation required of them.  My frustration is shared by other Senators, including Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and O&rsquo;Malley who made similar points three weeks ago when this issue arose briefly.  Members act carefully and responsibly but they would need considerable resources to investigate an allegation fully.  One cannot partly investigate an allegation.  One either investigates it or not.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>That is why we have tribunals: to hear evidence, hear the counter-evidence, hear cross-examination and analyse an allegation before coming up with a finding of fact.  I am glad, as is the Minister, that the two garda&iacute; against whom allegations were made were vindicated in the tribunal and I welcome this.  In debating other tribunals, Members referred to allegations made in these other tribunals.  Members on the Government side would point out that these were just allegations, not findings, and this is correct.  I do not underestimate the effect on someone of a false allegation being made against him but the fact is that other allegations were made that turned out to be true.  These were, in many cases, even more outlandish in content, yet they turned out to be true.  If an allegation is made, one cannot know whether it is true or false and it requires a third party to determine whether it is true or false.  Although the allegations proved to be false, they had the nature of allegations and were not findings.</P>
        <P>I respectfully disagree with and question Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s point that these allegations were conferred with legitimacy to the extent that people would have thought they were true because they were conveyed by Members of the Oireachtas to the then Minister, who also acted responsibly.  They were not true unless they were found to be true and, thankfully, these particular allegations were found not to be true, although many serious allegations were found to be so.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his staff.  As a nominee of both Garda representative associations, I am particularly interested in the Morris tribunal and its recent report.  I pay tribute to the dedication of the tribunal and its entire staff in sifting through six and a half years of evidence.  The vast majority of garda&iacute; investigated or mentioned in the course of the proceedings were completely exonerated and the main Garda members criticised in the seventh report have either been dismissed or have taken early retirement from the force.  Public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is crucial to its authority and effectiveness and a recent public satisfaction survey, thankfully but unsurprisingly, puts public confidence at a high level of 81%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission but it has been reported in the recent edition of <i>Garda Review</i>, the magazine of the Garda Representative Association, that three quarters of complaints are under Garda investigation despite the reiterated position of garda&iacute; that they want all investigations to be, and to be seen to be, independent.  The tribunal report itself concludes that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board had neither the statutory powers nor the resources to deal effectively with events such as those in Donegal. <Col N="914"/> A reform resulting from the events which is particularly welcomed by the Garda Representative Association is the introduction of forensic road traffic collision investigators.  Other extensive reforms have now been put in place to ensure the misconduct which occurred in Donegal cannot happen again.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to give the House a commitment that these reforms will be regularly reviewed and that this House will be kept up to date on their implementation.  A number of Members of this House, myself included, represent members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including sergeants, inspectors and superintendents, in the parliamentary forum and consider it our right and duty to be kept informed of such measures.</P>
        <P>Regarding the conduct of tribunals, I commend Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s practice of publishing a detailed and conclusive report after the completion of each module.  This practice kept Members of these Houses and the public well informed and promoted relevant investigation and public confidence.  The tribunal recommends that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann should review the manner in which Members deal with whistleblowers&rsquo; allegations to guard against unfounded allegations being endowed with undeserved legitimacy.  This touches on the matter of parliamentary privilege, which I have used to raise issues that deserve attention and for which there is no other forum.  This privilege is a vital part of democratic society and must be preserved but I would welcome guidelines of the sort suggested by the tribunal.</P>
        <P>Those members of the force found to have acted improperly are no longer serving, reforms have been introduced to prevent similar events occurring in the future, and public confidence in the force is still very high.  I commend the work of the tribunal and the results achieved and agree that it is time to move forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The editorial in volume 36 of the <i>Garda Review</i>, published on 8 October, outlines the situation from the Garda point of view.  This relates to the &ldquo;serious &lsquo;appalling allegations&rsquo; made against members of the service including Assistant Commissioners Kevin Carty and Tony Hickey that Judge Morris emphasised were completely untrue and unwarranted&rdquo;.  We must be very careful, as Members, with regard to allegations.  As it happens, a stone was lifted in Donegal and brought about issues relating to other members of the force.  Serious allegations were made against people of the highest integrity and we regret that situation.</P>
        <P>The other point made in the editorial is as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">The reality is the vast majority of members of garda rank serving in the Donegal division today were still in secondary school, even national school, when the events took place in the 1990s. Of those that were and are still serving, most had nothing to do with the inquiry but held views on the participants. Many retired feeling disgruntled to how they had been treated by the Carthy investigation and the tribunal. Many were passed over for promotion by a layer of garda management who were later found to be complicit.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The editorial is worth reading and very fair.  A cousin of mine served in Dungloe, the late Sergeant Frank McDonagh.  He was a man of honour and dignity and served the force with great distinction and without fear or favour.  To me, he represented the quality of garda&iacute;, sergeants, inspectors and superintendents who served the public in Donegal.  I hope this tribunal report would never reflect on the commitment and dedication of so many of the 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Donegal and throughout the country.  We are fortunate to have a force of the highest integrity and that is unarmed, brave and courageous.  Many have given their lives to defend their fellow citizens.  I pay tribute to a cousin regarded so well by everyone who met him during the course of his duties in Dungloe.  He would be very upset by <Col N="915"/>allegations made against other members of the force in the region.  He reflected the highest integrity of the force and was of the highest standard.  I commend the report to the House and thank the Minister for being present.</P>

	<P>I join Members in thanking Mr. Justice Morris for his report on happenings in Donegal which brought shame on many members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These caused distress to the vast majority of members of the force who go about their business in a professional manner serving communities fairly, diligently and effectively and without fear or favour.  This has been the hallmark of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since its foundation.  What went on in Donegal was an absolute disgrace.  The lives of families were destroyed because of the inexplicable and dreadful behaviour of serving garda&iacute;.  What a travesty of justice would have taken place if the Morris tribunal had not been set up.  It would not have been set up without the dogged determination of former Deputy Jim Higgins and Deputy Brendan Howlin, who did the country a considerable public service &mdash; a fact acknowledged by impartial commentators and by the public.  Without the intervention of former Deputy Higgins and Deputy Howlin, the unseemly happenings in Donegal would not have been uncovered.  The Minister of State alluded to some of these happenings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A family&rsquo;s life and the lives of the extended family were destroyed after allegations were made that they were involved in a murder.  There was no foundation to those allegations.  Garda&iacute; were involved in the manufacture of bomb-making material and in planting explosive materials.  A gun was planted by a detective sergeant at a halting site in Burnfoot to obtain a conviction.  Drugs were planted on a person.  There was wrongful arrest and ill-treatment of innocent people when in custody.  These were but some of the actions on which Mr. Justice Morris reported.  As a result, one senior garda was fired, as were rank and file garda&iacute;, and we witnessed a spate of resignations.</P>
        <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is not here, although I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  The Minister&rsquo;s rant and attempt at character assassination of Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Higgins in his contribution in the other House last week was a display of arrogance and an insult to the high office he has the honour to hold.  He spent nine of his 15 minutes having a go at former Deputy Higgins and Deputy Howlin.  Talk about shooting the messenger.  He did not even have the grace to apologise to the families who had their lives destroyed as a result of the actions of the agents of the State.  I am glad this has been rectified here by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan.</P>
        <P>What were Deputy Howlin and former Deputy Higgins to do at that time?  They came upon information in which serious allegations were made.  They stated that they could not stand over the allegations to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but insisted the allegations should be investigated.  They deliberately chose not to use the privilege of the House to make the allegations and did as a former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, did in informing the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, of allegations that some Ministers were involved in the importation of arms.  There was no other mechanism for them.  They were damned if they did and damned if they did not.  It took over six years for a tribunal, at a cost of over &euro;70 million, to investigate fully what went on in Donegal at that time.  The Deputies were vindicated by their actions.</P>
        <P>As a result of this tribunal, a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has been set up and an independent Garda inspectorate.  These moves will, I hope, ensure that the likes of what happened in Donegal will never happen again.  The measures taken will, I hope, restore public confidence in a force of which we should be proud, which has served the country well in difficult times and which should not be judged on the actions of some members who were a disgrace to their uniform.</P><Col N="916"/>
        <P>I commend Mr. Justice Morris on his report.  I also commend the former Deputy Higgins and the current Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Howlin, on their actions which brought about the tribunal.  I condemn the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his disgraceful contribution in the other House, which was a vindictive and scurrilous attack on two people who did a great service to the nation by their actions.</P>

	<P>I thank the many Senators who made contributions to this very important debate.  It is important to note that we have been well served by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since independence in 1922.  I am always conscious of that because my maternal grandfather joined the force in 1922 and rose to the rank of chief superintendent.  I am reminded of a divisional meeting he attended in Limerick in the early 1920s.  Of 26 senior officers photographed, four of them were dead by the end of the 1920s, having been assassinated.  That is a timely reminder of how the force has served this country since independence.  It was unarmed and its peer group was often threatened and shot.  My grandfather had to carry a weapon for most of his life even when he ceased being a member of the force because of the threat placed upon members throughout their careers and, in some cases, afterwards.  </P>
        <P>We need to put firmly on the record that the Garda force has served this country extremely well, especially given that it is an unarmed force and the difficult circumstances in which it found itself on independence, namely, in a civil war.  A cataclysm such as the Civil War placed huge pressure on officers in its aftermath to serve the State loyally and to put the State&rsquo;s interests above and beyond their own personal opinions and prejudices or political views of one kind or other.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that the Garda force has never become a sectarian force or succumbed, as virtually all police forces around the world have, to the culture of the drugs gangs.  There is very little penetration of our force by the evil drug dealers who have, in many instances globally, corrupted forces and, in some locations around the world, hollowed them out.  That has necessitated hugely painful investigation and inquiry and complete restructuring.  One can think of a number of such forces.  In the 1980s, the Hong Kong police force had to restructure itself substantially because of the activities of criminal gangs and the perception that it had been deeply penetrated by these drugs gangs or other types of dealing gangs.  That has not happened here.</P>
        <P>However, that is not to minimise in any way what we have read thanks to Mr. Justice Fred Morris and his report.  This is a ground-breaking report.  It has, in a sense, brought into a new era the professionalism of the force.  The force should have perhaps been reformed in the 1960s and 1970s along the lines it has been reformed today.  That would have happened were it not for the conflict in the North of Ireland.  A huge security paradigm had to operate for all officers.  There was a huge resource constraint and pressure on the force because it had to service the many needs of the conflict in the Border counties.  I say that not to mitigate the effect of this report.</P>
        <P>The report has come as a huge shock to everybody in this House.  Mr. Justice Fred Morris has done a fabulous job for us and I very much appreciate the kind comments made about the now retired judge on his contribution and work.  I do not want to make a political point but it is worth saying from a taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective, the Morris report cost &euro;70 million and produced eight timely and regular reports since 2002.  At the same time, the Mahon report cost &euro;300 million.  That tribunal was set up in 1997 and it has not produced as many timely reports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to be political.  From a taxpayer&rsquo;s point of view, we must look at how these things are constructed.  We need to learn from Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s report and how it did its work.  It was certainly not cheap.  I accept what Senator Walsh said in regard to capping fees.  That would be laudable in the short to medium term.  However, the tribunal has done its work very effectively.</P>
        <P>Some 78 of the 102 civil actions which have flowed from this tribunal have already been resolved at a cost of &euro;11 million.  The State has seen an effective tribunal investigate some serious and depressing allegations and they have been responded to quickly and effectively by the Government.  I am sure other Governments would have done the same had they been placed in the same position.  It so happens we have been in power for the past ten years and it was our responsibility, with our various coalition partners and Ministers, to respond to those allegations over the period.  There was a timely response to them.  We now have a much more reformed force, with more civilianisation and more professional managers with technical specialties coming into the force in technical areas in which it is not necessary for garda&iacute; to be involved.  We are bringing in superb, strong management.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate is in existence.  This is a fantastic operation led by a fantastic woman, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, who formerly delivered policing in Boston.  She is undertaking reform and finding out how to make the force more efficient every day.  I am impressed with her work.  One of the early revelations of the inspectorate&rsquo;s work was a simple matter concerning the collection of crime statistics from various districts in the Dublin area.  There were glaring disparities between, for instance, the Terenure district and its adjacent district, Templeogue, which had a similar profile in terms of population and suburban settlement but vastly different detection rates.  Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole has addressed this issue in a profound way, raising standards, getting garda&iacute; to concentrate on the crimes that matter in their area and that happen with frequency.  Often over the years prior to the input of the inspectorate, Garda effort and time was misapplied on crimes that were not the main priority in a particular district.  There can be enormous variations, as Members of this House know only too well, particularly in an urban setting, between one type of suburb and another or in one part of the inner city and another.  That work is continuing.</P>
        <P>Another response has been the creation of the Garda Ombudsman and the strengthened internal procedures now in place, which many Members mentioned, around the concept of the whistleblower.  It is not perhaps the grand whistleblower inquisitor Senator Quinn would desire, but there is a strong commitment by Government through an Act of Parliament to insist there is a proper confidential complaint procedure in place for individual officers who see malpractice or corruption occurring in the force.  This system is good and can be vindicated.  We have had a few complaints already and the system is working well.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White and Boyle made some timely interventions.  Senator Quinn, given his entrepreneurial, business and executive experience, would probably agree that the culture of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether it be at management or lower levels, is entirely changed because of these reforms.  We are good in this and the other House at calling for root and branch reform, changes and more regulation.  It is hugely important that the leadership and culture issues of an organisation are addressed and changed.  It is important that the culture in an organisation such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not one where a person becomes commissioner because it is a Buggin&rsquo;s turn ritual but that we get seriously specialised managerially qualified competent people into the senior positions, whether they be civilians or serving members of the force.  One makes a lifelong commitment to a force such as this or to an organisation such as the one Senator Quinn led in the retail operation of Superquinn.  It is important to commit to continuous improvement in quality and standards, as Senator Quinn blazed a trail in the retail sector in Ireland.  That is happening and there is such a commitment.  It is remarkable.</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P>I have only been around for a few years but I have seen a few Garda Commissioners come and go.  There is no doubt that the current incumbent and the last few have been of a higher order in terms of their professionalism, conduct and determination to make real improvements in terms of crime detection and in terms of management of the organisation.</P>
        <P>I am not chiding Senator Cummins and I know he has to score political points, but my senior ministerial colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern &mdash; I have been a Minister of State in Departments with him for the entirety of the short duration of my ministerial career, now in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and previously in the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; is not the sort of person who, as Senator Regan depicted him, engages in spin.  The Minister felt profoundly that it was important that the voice of Mr. Justice Morris and his opinions, which had been criticised by Members, were vindicated and brought to the notice of the House.  That is important.  We must be self-critical.  This report is somewhat critical of the two Deputies mentioned, but I agree with Senator Alex White it is not to the point that it is blaming them or saying that they acted in bad faith.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most timely quote from the report is on page 158, which caught my eye.  It states: &ldquo;Politicians must be attuned to the possibilities that they are being used to advance a wholly false agenda by constituents who may be unscrupulous, deceitful, or have an agenda against the person or persons against whom they make allegations.&rdquo;  It is timely to quote that reference.  We all have a moral responsibility to double check and quadruple check our sources of information before invoking the power and privilege we enjoy in this House.  As Members, people come to us in confidence.  I support some of the Opposition Senators&rsquo; views on the privilege aspect.  There must be some cover for a Deputy or Senator who is in receipt of highly confidential information that may be pungent or explosive in metaphorical terms.  It is hugely important that some account is given to the privileged positions we hold and people trust us generally speaking.  I know we all score political points around that concept of how much we are valued or trusted, if at all, by the public, but we are trusted when people who are vulnerable come to us and ask us to inquire or investigate.  We must be sensitive in how we do that.</P>
        <P>I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was having a go at either the distinguished former Deputy Jim Higgins, now an MEP, or the very distinguished Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Brendan Howlin.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Both of those men have had admirable and positive public service careers in this House and that is what motivates them, as it motivates all of us in the Lower House, not to aggrandise but to serve the community and society in the best way possible.</P>
        <P>There is an issue around how we use information, privileged or otherwise, that comes into our hands and how we deploy that.  Mr. Justice Morris said that.  It is an indication of how fair the judge was that he was not afraid to go where perhaps we are sometimes loathe to go, namely, to be self-critical of our own profession.  It is a rare privilege to be able to say things in this setting and not be subject to legal or other pressures of being sued etc. because we are in a sense the grand inquest of the nation, which is one definition of parliament.  It was felt by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that he should defend what Mr. Justice Morris had put in the report.</P>
        <P>A number of other questions arose in the debate which I want to address.  I was struck by the issue of culture raised by Senator Boyle.  The culture of organisations is hugely important.  I say that self-critically, even in relation to my party and the troubles and difficulties we have encountered as a party through public tribunals by known individuals who have come before <Col N="919"/>them.  What is crucial in terms of the development of our organisation in response to those particular revelations and tribunals is the change in culture both at leadership level and through the organisation.  It has been a painful process for Fianna F&aacute;il and for this House.  I refer to the period we have come through of accountability or ethical cleansing as people sometimes derisively call it.  It has been an important process.  It needs to be fair and people need to be self-reflective about its impacts.  It is important to ensure that the new regulation does not result in people&rsquo;s basic rights and entitlements to free speech and basic privileges, as Members have said, being in some way infringed by a new regulatory environment or parameters.</P>
        <P>I would also like to deal with an issue raised by Senator Norris, which I will follow up with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  He mentioned the case of a prominent businessman who had been seeking meetings with the fraud squad, which he claims were constantly delayed or put on the long finger.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  If it is happening I will ask the Minister to address it fairly quickly because it is not appropriate and would only serve to undermine confidence in the force.</P>
        <P>I was very struck by Senator Regan&rsquo;s honest leading of the survey attitudes in evidence about the Garda.  I had not been aware of it.  I am a Minister of State and am not engaged full-time in the business of the justice and security side of this Department that I am in from time to time.  The 81% rating for satisfaction with the Garda is remarkable given the almost catastrophic and terrible nature of the revelations that arose from the Morris tribunal.  The legislation that this House and the other House have passed to reform the force is testimony to our success as legislators and credit is due to the force for reforming itself.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did apologise on behalf of the people in the other House, contrary to what Senator Cummins said.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful that the Senator would pay the tribute to me that I appear to be more fulsome in my apology.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I am sure he was also quite fulsome.  I just was not there to witness it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White asked why we do not have an independent police authority as is the case in the UK.  Given that we have created the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate, and the other changes made in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, this would only add another separate and interposing layer of accountability into the picture.  I am trying to set this out fairly.  We do not want to kill an organisation like the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by imposing an accountability paradigm that becomes almost stifling of initiative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must also accept that it is now <i>de rigueur</i> and <i>au courant</i>, if I may use two French phrases, for us to talk about Civil Service and public service reform.  However, one must be extremely careful when one reforms an elemental part of our democracy, namely, the police force.  Police forces have major operational responsibility and are not, what I would describe, arid and immutable administrative organisms.  They are dynamic day-to-day operational organisations.  One must be very careful in how one regulates such organisations.  As I have experienced from my interactions with the Garda, it has a requirement to respond very quickly to particular evolving situations, be they criminal, public order or otherwise.  That requires a more nuanced approach to reform and the issues surrounding accountability.  I am more than aware of that given the security dimension of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s work as the main custodian of the internal security of the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Minister of State working within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one is from time to time included in information that must be handled sensitively and with a certain degree of respect for the kinds of operations involved.  Given that individual officers, <Col N="920"/>male and female, are putting their lives on the line, sometimes in undercover operations against drug criminals, sometimes working abroad in conjunction with other forces, one must be very sensitive in what one does in terms of those issues.  I believe I have addressed Senator Alex White&rsquo;s issue in that regard.  We did not want the extra layer of responsibility.  Our force is a unified force whereas the UK has a series of regional forces with their own levels of accountability.  Given that it is a much larger operation, it may have a requirement for an authority in that context.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The local joint policing committees will be very positive.  While I am not sure how it operates in other local authority areas, I am aware how it operates in the one to which I am accountable in the sense that I operate in that territory, which is South Dublin County Council.  Oireachtas Members are invited to become members of it.  Sometimes in our zeal to reform and separate the functions of local and national politics, Oireachtas Members have been pushed out of the picture at local level because of the assiduous aspect of the local authority members guarding their own particular electoral and other bases.  In my local authority area we are allowed to go.  Obviously as a Minister of State, it would not be appropriate for me to attend.  However, my constituency colleague, Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor, attends regularly.  It is important for Oireachtas Members to involve themselves in the life of the district or local community policing fora that are now evolving and being set up.  I am not sure of the approach being taken &mdash; perhaps some of the Members might enlighten me afterwards.  Do different local authorities take a different view?  I know South Dublin County Council encourages, invites and allows Oireachtas Members and local authority members to be present, which is very positive because we all have a contribution to make in raising genuine public concerns.</P>
        <P>That is something I have seen changing in recent years regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Even ten years ago when I started out in public life one was seen to be almost out of order if one questioned the operations of the Garda locally.  If one put down a challenge to it as to how it conducted its business or dealt with a situation, be it anti-social behaviour or otherwise, one was seen to be not really part of the gang in doing so.  That has changed as a result of the Morris tribunal and the panoply of accountability measures and reforms introduced.  It is now very easy for a public representative, either local authority or Oireachtas, to raise serious issues without being subject to a sort of fatwa from Garda sources suggesting that one was a troublemaker or anti-Garda.  Legitimate complaints by public representatives are now entertained and dealt with in a more serious and appropriate manner by the force, which is a positive development.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White also asked why the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  As part of a general review of the Freedom of Information Act last year, the extension of the Act to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was considered.  That consideration involved an examination of all factors relevant to the governance, oversight and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was decided it would not be extended to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because at this time it would place an excessive administrative burden on the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as the force continues to discharge its challenging core duties.  That reflects back to what I said earlier.  One must be careful how one regulates an organisation of this kind and that one does not, in the classic sense, tie it up in knots, thus preventing it from doing its essential core activity.</P>

	<P>Fair dues to the Senator.  It is important that we are sceptical of these.  However, I believe the Senator knows where I am coming from in that regard.  I do not believe I need to add much more.</P><Col N="921"/>
        <P>I found most of the contributions very enlightened.  It is good to see how the Upper House is performing its duties.  I accept that people are acting in good faith.  Senator Regan obliquely referred to a dilemma.  Nobody really expected that it would emerge at the tribunal that the loadstone or core document that occasioned the establishment of this tribunal was based on a concocted document.  That is the harsh reality.  I am not suggesting it was not good that the tribunal started its work.  Clearly it has been very good because we discovered things that we could not even have imagined before it started its work.  However, we cannot escape the essential fact, which is a moral point, that the core document at the foundation of this public tribunal &mdash; worthy and all as its work is &mdash; was a fraud.  While I am not particularly equipped to say this, it has been said to me by many eminent people that it had the effect of nearly ruining and calling into question the illustrious careers of two senior and good officers who gave great service to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>That is a very serious issue that we must all consider.  We must all learn the lessons from that.  We are all for transparency and accountability and for using, standing over and defending our privileges as D&aacute;il Deputies to raise issues of public importance.  However, there must be some sense of proportion and sophistication.  We cannot always return to the notion, as public representatives, that public disclosure is the most important factor.  On the basis of a limited ten-year membership of the D&aacute;il and limited experience as a Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and I am grateful to the House for agreeing at short notice to sit this evening to consider this emergency legislation.</P>
        <P>The necessity for legislation arises because a patient in a psychiatric hospital who has been involuntarily detained therein since summer 2007 initiated a judicial review of her case in June 2008.  The case was heard during early October and concluded on 17 October.  Judgment was reserved.  I understand from the Attorney General that the judgment is to be delivered in the High Court at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow.  When the case was initiated against the Mental Health Commission, the view was taken that the case&rsquo;s circumstances were particular to the plaintiff only.  However, when the case was argued in court, it was brought to light that the person was detained under a provision of the Mental Health Act, namely, a form used by the Mental Health Commission for consultants to renew detention periods.  The form, a copy of which I have if Senators are interested, refers to detention periods not exceeding three, six or 12 <Col N="923"/>months.  The view has been advanced in the case that this provision does not give enough discretion to consultant psychiatrists to ask for two months and two weeks, three months and three days, etc.  The form is prescriptive to not exceeding three, six or 12 months.</P>
        <P>If the Mental Health Commission loses the case, there will be implications for up to 209 patients involuntarily detained in 40 HSE and three private hospitals.  The decision to involuntarily detain anyone is a serious one.  The loss or removal of liberty of any citizen is a serious matter.  Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the decision can be made only after a general practitioner refers a patient to a psychiatrist.  If the psychiatrist makes a decision to admit the patient, the patient&rsquo;s case will be reviewed within a 21-day period by an independent psychiatrist appointed by the Mental Health Commission and a tribunal consisting of a consultant psychiatrist, a lawyer and an independent lay person.  To be involuntarily detained, three psychiatrists and a mental health tribunal must decide that the circumstances of one&rsquo;s case are such that one must be involuntarily detained.</P>
        <P>Regarding the options open to the Government, this issue came to light on 10 October and my Department was informed by the Attorney General that these issues were being advanced in the case.  In the period since, the Attorney General has been taking advice and reflecting on the best course of action in all circumstances.  It was initially believed that we could appeal if we lost the case.  Alternatively, all 209 patients could be discharged and readmitted if the case is lost tomorrow.  From the perspective of patient safety and health, putting individuals through that traumatic experience would be unthinkable.  We could wait until next week for the case&rsquo;s outcome and to introduce legislation.  However, were even a single patient to go to court this weekend using <i>habeas corpus</i> and be discharged from involuntary detention, the implications would be unthinkable.</P>
        <P>People are involuntarily detained for their health interests so that they can receive appropriate medication.  One can only be involuntarily detained if one is a danger to oneself in the first instance, to others in the second instance or, if absolutely necessary, to administer medication.  The decision to involuntarily detain is taken in a small number of cases, accounting for approximately 7% to 10% of the 3,000 patients in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
        <P>Effectively, the legislation states that the detentions cannot be invalid for the sole reason that it was these forms that were used and completed by the consultant psychiatrists in good faith.  No question of clinical error is involved.  The legislation will lapse after five working days of its enactment.  Some five days after the legislation is signed into law by the President, new renewal orders will be made in respect of all of these patients.</P>
        <P>Approximately one week ago, the Attorney General advised that, to ensure that robust clinical examination of all of the patients occurs, the renewal notices should be reviewed, a process that has been ongoing since last Friday. I pay tribute to the consultants who worked from Saturday to Tuesday in that regard.  All 209 cases have been reviewed.  Some 99% of renewal orders were maintained, indicating the robustness of the process.</P>
        <P>Issues have arisen with this legislation in regard to the precedents.  On several occasions, legislation was enacted in the Oireachtas before the ultimate determination by the courts of the validity or otherwise of a particular challenge.  This happened in regard to the Immigration Act, the Aliens Act and several EU directives.  There is also a precedent whereby the decisions of a judge who was invalidly appointed were retrospectively made valid.</P>
        <P>The case of the person who initiated the proceedings in question cannot be affected by this legislation.  The Bill can have no retrospective effect on any patient who has initiated proceedings.  We are aware of no case other than the case to be determined tomorrow.  However, if it transpires that another case was initiated in recent days, it cannot be affected by the provisions of this legislation.  I come reluctantly to the House because, as Minister for Health <Col N="924"/>and Children, I could not contemplate a situation where in the coming days, any one of the 209 patients concerned could be discharged from the care which is clinically necessary for his or her health.  Besides the dangers to themselves, there is in a small number of cases &mdash; I emphasise that it is only a small number &mdash; the possibility that they may be a danger to others in society.</P>
        <P>For all these reasons, we recommend the enactment of this legislation.  I ask the House to pass an early signature motion allowing the President to sign the legislation immediately and thus forgo the ten-day period normally applying to legislation passed by the Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her contribution and for the briefing she and her officials provided earlier on the need for this legislation.  This is obviously the best course to safeguard the health of those persons who have been involuntarily detained and in respect of whom there is uncertainty pending the outcome of the court case tomorrow.  It is somewhat unusual to anticipate tomorrow&rsquo;s judgment but, as the Minister observed, precedents exist in this regard where such a course of action was in the interests of certain people.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of the letter from the Irish College of Psychiatrists to the Mental Health Commission expressing serious concern about the directives that were issued by the Health Service Executive following the recent High Court case?  Concern was expressed that the directive was put in place without any consultation with clinical directors or consultant psychiatrists and that it will prove unworkable in its current form and requires urgently to be revisited.  I am pleased to hear from the Minister that the patients concerned have been seen by psychiatrists throughout the State.  This was obviously done as an emergency measure.  I welcome what has been achieved given that the guidelines were issued only on 24 October, leaving little time for people to become familiar with them and to carry out the assessments.</P>
        <P>The review of the mental health legislation presented to the Minister in recent months includes 51 recommendations relating to the Mental Health Acts.  While the Minister has come to the Chamber in haste because of what is emerging in the court case in question and the potential adverse effects of that on patients who have been involuntarily detained, there is no denying the need for a revisitation of the Mental Health Acts.  Will the Minister outline a timeframe for the type of review suggested in the review report?</P>
        <P>I note that we are not dealing today with the mental health legislation but with a procedure that was adopted by the Mental Health Commission.  It is somewhat ironic that a fairly minor procedure could lead to catastrophic consequences for the more than 200 patients affected.  However, we must bear in mind the potential constitutional implications of what is in effect a procedural point that has been raised in the courts.  Will the Minister outline the advice she has received from the Attorney General in regard to the constitutionality of this legislative proposal and whether she is satisfied with that advice?  One must invoke the adage that rushed legislation makes bad law.  We have seen evidence of that many times.  What is at stake here is a person&rsquo;s right to freedom versus a clinician&rsquo;s view of that person&rsquo;s medical need.  The Minister referred to this measure as a policy decision as opposed to a legal decision.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, there cannot be a situation where the safety and well-being of more than 200 patients is put at risk owing to an operational or administrative form.  We must be practical and put patient safety to the fore.  This is not to deny that there are questions to be answered, some of which the Minister dealt with in the D&aacute;il and others which remain to be clarified.  When was the Minister first made aware of the case and its possible implications?  Will she clarify why two weeks were allowed to elapse before action was taken?  Can she guarantee that all involuntarily detained patients who are affected by this legislation will be seen by all necessary clinicians within the five-day period?  Will she also offer an assurance that she will meet <Col N="925"/>with the Mental Health Commission to ensure the various forms comply with all legal advice now emerging in regard to best practice and patient safety?</P>
        <P>A point was made in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about supported accommodation.  I hope this is not the issue involved.  Nobody should be involuntarily detained simply because suitable supported accommodation is not available.  Will the Minister address the points of concern raised by the Irish College of Psychiatrists?  Mental health provision was the Cinderella of the health system for a long time.  I hope we will continue to focus on the needs of mental health patients in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support the legislation as necessary to ensure the safety of a small but vulnerable group of people.  As the Minister observed, these are people who find themselves involuntarily detained for their own protection, whether as a consequence of being deemed a risk to their own or others&rsquo; safety or because treatment in a safe environment was deemed to be of benefit to them.  The passing of this legislation will prevent disruption to their treatment and any consequential setback to their recovery.  As the Minister said, the legislation may prove unnecessary pending the outcome of the court case.  I commend her on her proactive approach in avoiding any risk arising to these vulnerable people.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to hear that since last Friday, approximately 209 reviews have been completed of the cases of people detained under renewal orders under section 15 of the Mental Health Act in order to confirm the justification of each person&rsquo;s continued detention.  This is a considerable undertaking which provides reassurance as to the merits of putting in place this legislation as quickly as possible.  I wholeheartedly commend those who undertook this review in such a short period.  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s comment that the necessity for this legislation may arise through the layout and contents of a form as opposed to an aspect of clinical practice.</P>
        <P>There is always cause for concern when legislation must be taken quickly.  I thank the Minister and her officials for the briefing they provided to us all earlier.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurances that no injustice has been caused to patients and that this emergency legislation to validate the detention of involuntarily detained patients relates to detentions which have been already the subject of a robust process.  The legislation provides for five working days to make a replacement renewal order where appropriate for patients.  Have the HSE and the private psychiatric hospitals indicated whether they have the capacity to undertake and complete this work?  In asking this, I again acknowledge their work since last Friday.  However, it is a considerable undertaking in a period of five working days.</P>
        <P>Is it intended to introduce new forms to replace the queried forms?  Will the new forms be introduced regardless of the outcome of the case?  Given the questions that have arisen and the comments made about the forms, new forms would be entirely appropriate to facilitating professional discretion.</P>
        <P>This legislation is clearly driven by a desire to protect a vulnerable group of people and, as such, I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While I appreciate the need for this legislation, I am seriously uneasy about certain aspects of it.  Unfortunately, I was unable to listen to the debate in the other House and I apologise if the Minister has dealt with some of the issues I am about to raise.</P>
        <P>I expressed concern about section 16 of the Mental Health Act 2001 in terms of the requirement to bring to the attention of the people concerned what exactly they were entitled to and what treatment they would receive.  The Minister referred earlier to the <i>habeas corpus</i> section of the Constitution, which is clear enough.  It states that no citizen should be deprived of his <Col N="926"/>liberty save in accordance with law, which is clear.  The law, therefore, purported to deal with this issue.  The law concerned is the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
        <P>We come then to the section of this Bill dealing with discretion.  I did not follow the court case and was not aware of it until I heard about it today.  I seriously doubt if the point of law is simply about the difference between a week, two weeks, five days or three days.  I suspect the point of law is that the court will need to be confirmed in its view and will have to see evidence that the consultant exercised discretion.  The only way in which the <i>habeas corpus</i> section of the Constitution could be reflected is by a consultant coming to a conclusion and exercising discretion.  Discretion is always contemplated by that section of the Act.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant quantum of case law during recent years involving cases that have been successfully taken through judicial review.  Various judicial reviews have found that not only do they need to know that discretion has been exercised but also that they need to see evidence that it has been exercised.  Under sections 15 and 16 of the Mental Health Act 2001, a consultant is required to have seen a patient five days before a renewal order or order.  He or she is then required, within 24 hours of that consultation, to provide the patient with further documentation explaining various things, including the level of treatment to be provided.  I am summarising the process given the time available.</P>
        <P>I am not concerned about existing legislation and I understand there is a hole which we need to plug.  I am concerned, however, about section 3 which states, &ldquo;An unexpired order shall be deemed valid and always to have been valid&rdquo;, &ldquo;have been&rdquo; being the past perfect tense.  In other words, we are effectively saying that it might have been a breach of the <i>habeas corpus</i> section of the Constitution but that discretion need not have been exercised or that a consultant need not have made a defined, confined or succinct decision.  I do not believe we can do that.  We are trying to second guess the Constitution.  I do not believe I have articulated the point clearly.</P>
        <P>I will put the point again.  The Constitution states what the law must do and the law states what we must do.  We are here tonight because the law, as interpreted by the courts, may not have been implemented as contemplated.  We are now saying it did not need to be implemented.  The only reason it needed to be implemented in the first instance was to apply the Constitution.  I hope I am making some sense.  This is a vicious circle.  I am not sure we can do this.  I would like to know the Attorney General&rsquo;s view on this as there appears to be a problem in this regard.  I do not have any difficulty with what the Minister is trying to do; I accept the need for this legislation.  It would have been irresponsible of the Minister not to have introduced it.  An issue arises in respect of the exercise of discretion, which does not relate only to the difference between three days, five days or the form being restrictive in terms of the number of choices offered.  Evidence will be sought that the consultant reached a conclusion, exercised discretion, formed a judgment and made a decision.  It must be shown that all of these steps were followed.  I have sore evidence of this having been on the receiving end of it while wearing another hat.  The courts were not happy to accept that discretion had been exercised and required evidence to that effect.</P>
        <P>In respect of all cases reviewed during the past six years, was there a consultant examination within five days of the order, was the order then signed by the consultant and was each person, at each renewal, given the set of facts within 24 hours, as required by law?</P>

	<P>The Green Party understands the circumstances surrounding the extraordinary introduction of this Bill and is supportive of it but with reservations.  Our mental health legislation is under review and there is a need to complete that review and to introduce large-scale amendments to existing legislation.</P><Col N="927"/>
        <?oasys _cl13- ?><P>We have come a long way from the 19th century legislation which referred to people with mental illness as idiots.  However, we still suffer terms that are not in the interests of people who suffer from mental illness.  This legislation refers to periods of detention rather than to hospitalisation or care periods.  As stated by the Minister in her opening contribution, we are speaking about people deprived of liberty for medical reasons.</P>
        <P>The Green Party and I believe that existing legislation is flawed in terms of how it is framed, access to lawyers for the mental health tribunals and the ability and capacity of people to respond to those tribunals.  A further difficulty arises in terms of statistics in regard to access to those tribunals and their effectiveness.  On those terms, many of the reservations expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole are valid.  This means we must return to this debate and quickly.  We must be informed also by the many mental health advocates who have expressed concerns about existing legislation and the need for it to be updated.</P>
        <P>I understand the difficulty in which the Minister, the Department, the Government and apparatus of State will find themselves if this legislation is not passed this evening.  The need potentially to recommit more than 200 people is not something the State should have to consider without having in place proper legislation.  The deeper concerns in terms of getting a better balance between the ability of clinicians to define the mental health needs of people who access the service and the legal rights of people who find themselves accessing such services is a balance we have not got right to date.  It is a debate to which we will need to return.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will leave the Chamber tonight having put in place the legislation required to close this particular loophole and will concentrate her mind on the need for a wide-ranging and seriously broad re-interpretation of our mental health legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party will not oppose this Bill.  What strikes me initially &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is that this is the second time in recent months the Minister has come to this House with legislation that retrospectively validates the legality of particular matters within the remit of the Department of Health and Children.  If I am not mistaken, this House dealt previously with legislation relating to health institutions.  I am sure the Minister will recall the legislation to which I refer.  That legislation sought to validate retrospectively the existence or legality of a range of different institutions and hospitals under the remit of the Department of Health and Children.  I did not then, nor do I now, question the merits of doing this.  This is the second occasion on which we are being asked to pass legislation retrospectively validating something about which a question has arisen.   To be asked to introduce or agree to legislation validating something retrospectively must give us some pause.  Legislation, in principle, should always be prospective.  If we change a law or introduce a new law we should decide how the law needs to be changed and what kind of regime we want to have in the future.  </P>
        <?oasys _cl13- ?><P>It goes against the notion of legislating that we are asked to validate something that has already happened.  It should only be done in the rarest circumstances.  The Minister will probably agree with the proposition that it undermines the fundamental role of legislators if all they are asked to do is give the thumbs up to something after it has happened.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan asked about future orders and I am sure the Minister will respond.  I am interested to hear the change in regime the Minister proposes to introduce to ensure any frailties or questions of the orders or forms are validated retrospectively.  What will be done to ensure no issue of that nature arises in the future?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to address the issue of deeming something to be valid retrospectively.  She has been advised by the Attorney General that he is satisfied and she, by extension, is also satisfied that there is no constitutional question on this matter.  We are never told the advice of the Attorney General in detail, but I would like more from the Minister than to be told that the Attorney General is satisfied that it is constitutional.  As legislators we are entitled, as is <Col N="928"/>the wider community, to more than a thumbs up from the Attorney General that this is all right.  How can it be constitutional to deem something illegal as valid retrospectively?  Retrospectivity, whether something can be validated and deemed valid after it has occurred, has arisen in a number of cases, including the CC case.  I ask the Minister for more detail on the basis upon which she has been advised there is no constitutional question on retrospective validation on a matter such as this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and commend the Bill to the House.  This is a short Bill but it is important legislation.  It aims to validate 209 renewal orders which are in force under the Mental Health Act 2001 and to make lawful the detention of those patients.  The need for the new Bill has arisen from High Court proceedings concerning a patient detained under section 15 of the 2001 Act.  This arose from questions asked by a judge and gave rise to the patient being granted a request for a hearing.  That judgment will be released tomorrow and I commend the Minister on being proactive and bringing the legislation to this House today.</P>
        <P>The Minister is acting on best clinical, as opposed to legal, advice.  It is about patient safety, and the type of patients we are discussing are very vulnerable people who may sometimes be a danger to themselves and others.  The form as it exists was not correct.  The choice was detention for three, six or 12 months, and a box was ticked to say which period applied.  The new form is more patient-focused.  It will give a better choice to clinicians and patients as to the length of time their detention will be.</P>
        <P>As the Minister pointed out, involuntary detention is not done lightly.  There are three psychiatrists and a member of the Mental Health Commission involved.  Other accommodations and options are considered.  It is probably the last thing that is done and it is done in the interests of the patient and his or her safety.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation.  I thank the Minister for her good briefing, for acting swiftly in bringing this Bill to the House and the D&aacute;il before the judgment is released tomorrow.  I thank the hard-working officials from the Department for preparing the Bill and giving good advice to us today.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the support from Senators.  We are not making legal something that is declared illegal.  If the court decision tomorrow finds against the Mental Health Commission and we are here tomorrow afternoon or on Monday, that is what we may do.  It has not been established that these orders were made illegally.  </P>
        <P>We are, as a precaution and on the advice of the Attorney General, in advance of the court decision tomorrow, making sure we do not put this group of 209 patients into a vulnerable situation regarding their mental health.  Of the 209 patients, 18 are under the care of the St. John of God Brothers, five, including the plaintiff, are under the care of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, one is in Stewards Hospital, and the remainder are under the care of the HSE across 40 different sites.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware of the letter from the Irish College of Psychiatrists.  Notwithstanding that letter, I am advised by the HSE that there has been great co-operation from psychiatrists.  They came in on bank holiday Monday, as well as Saturday and Sunday, to review these orders and I pay tribute to them.  Nothing we do here implies any clinical error on the part of any psychiatrist.  It is purely about forms and form filling.  We are more than satisfied that over seven days, including Saturday and Sunday, all the individual orders can be reviewed if that is necessary as a result of the decision tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Risk equalisation was emergency legislation to close a loophole.  The legislation on corporate bodies concerned the fact that many corporate bodies were established by orders or statutory instruments under primary legislation over many years and it affected the Minister for the <Col N="929"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other Ministers.  The advice from the Attorney General &mdash; he is extraordinarily active and spends 24 hours a day reading legislation to find difficulties for Ministers &mdash; was that corporate bodies cannot be established by primary legislation.  We came into the Houses to ensure that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the Irish Blood Transfusion Board and  the National Treatment Purchase Fund, bodies doing an extraordinary amount of work, employing many people and treating thousands of patients, were made legal as quickly as possible.  That was the basis on which that legislation was introduced.  We have more legislation to enact in that area.  This legislation cannot affect this individual plaintiff or any other patient who may have initiated action, although we are not aware of any such patient.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied, and the Attorney General has argued in this case, that the consultants have full discretion under section 28 of the Act.  I will not read it all here but all the rights prescribed in law, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, are fulfilled.  The threshold in Ireland to be detained involuntarily under our modern legislation &mdash; which we are very proud of &mdash; is really high.  Besides the three psychiatrists, everybody has their own lawyer, and a lawyer and layperson sits on the tribunal.  Every time an order is made, the process is gone through again.  It is a very high threshold and nobody could go through those legal and patient safety hoops without really being seriously ill and requiring to be involuntarily detained.</P>
        <P>I do not want to deal with the specifics of the case except to say no clinical view has been advanced that this person is not seriously ill.  We may fall down on form filling, which is not part of the 2001 Act.  There is no deficiency in that legislation; it is kosher.  On the basis of legal advice, what may have happened is that the forms which were brought in by the Mental Health Commission on foot of the legislation may be found faulty tomorrow.  It is to deal with such a position that we are bringing forward this legislation.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Boyle and others asked about the amendments to the mental health legislation.  We intend to bring proposals to the Government this session to amend the Act and update it further on the basis of the 51 recommendations mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>My Department was advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on 10 October of the possible implications of this case.  In the other House reference was made to procedures brought in by Eddie Sullivan when the State or any Department is exposed.  Those procedures were all complied with in this case.  As soon as we became aware of the possible wider implications as a result of the intervention of the judge in the case, it was brought to our attention.</P>
        <P>To be fair, when asking what happened between 10 October and now, people must reflect on what was the best action to take.  Did we need amending legislation?  Outside counsel was consulted and the view was advanced that we could appeal the case if we lost and the patients could be discharged and readmitted.  Other possibilities were considered.  Although the legislation is coming today in a rushed fashion, the Attorney General and outside counsel have given consideration to this for the past two weeks.  It was on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice that the clinical review took place between last Friday, 24 October, and its completion yesterday.</P>
        <P>I believe I have dealt with all the issues.  If I have not, I would be happy to deal on Committee Stage with any outstanding matters I may not have taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the same point I asked about before but I am still not clear on it.  The constitutional position is that the law protects <i>habeas corpus</i>.  The law required the consultant to exercise discretion.  This section states &ldquo;An unexpired renewal order shall be deemed to be valid and always to have been valid&rdquo;.  We are saying effectively that if the fail-safe which the law was required to put in to protect the <i>habeas corpus </i>section of the Constitution was not followed, this is okay.  We do not have the power to do this and we are challenging the Constitution on that basis.  I am not clear about it.</P>
        <P>It is not just the fact of not having enough discretion between three months, six months, nine months or a year.  A consultant may not exercise discretion at all and could sign the form without going through the other processes.  I asked a question of the Minister which she did not get a chance to answer.  It was sections 15 and 16 of the Act to which I was referring rather than section 28.  Those sections require the three steps to be taken five days before the order, on the issuing of the order and 24 hours after the order.  If those three steps were not carried out in all cases, it could be argued discretion was not discharged and we would be here trying to plug what was not a legal gap but a constitutional gap.  We cannot do that.</P>
        <P>This is important and I disagree with Senator Feeney.  I grew up all my life knowing of cases of people being committed to psychiatric hospitals involuntarily with many outstanding questions.  I can remember cases where it was said people were committed incorrectly.  When this legislation was being put through, it was done to ensure such actions could not happen in the future.</P>
        <P>It is very important legislation and although I do not argue with the actions of the Minister, can she say it &ldquo;shall be deemed to be valid and always to have been valid&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister confirm that each patient to be reviewed will have access to a mental health tribunal, with most having been before one already?  With the new assessment and renewal to be made, will each patient have access to such a tribunal?</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the form ran into difficulties because it mentioned three-month, six-month and nine-month periods.  I understand the Attorney General advised the consultant psychiatrist looking at the detention of each patient to ensure the detention was lawful by reference to the criteria set out in the Act while also exercising the discretion as to the appropriate duration of the detention, which can be any period as is appropriate up to and including the limits specified in the various sections.</P>
        <P>I understand some of the difficulties the Irish College of Psychiatrists are concerned about deal with being able to name a period of time, which is not always possible.  Has that been considered by the Minister and will she comment on it?</P>
        <P>Article 40 of the Constitution provides a mechanism whereby the legality of a detention is challenged.  Will the Minister inform the House further on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice about Article 40?  Is the Minister sure it is within the competence of the Oireachtas to enact legislation to continue the unlawful detention of any person and is she sure such legislation would rightfully have the presumption of constitutionality?  Will she comment on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice about the constitutionality of what we are doing this evening?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a quick question related to my earlier statement.  In section 3 there is a specification of five working days.  Are the Health Service Executive and the three private hospitals satisfied there is capacity within the five working days to complete the necessary work to ensure replacement renewal orders can be put in place?  On an aside, I understand there will be a new form but will it be put in place regardless of the case outcome tomorrow?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>All of us would be concerned about legislation of this import that must be rushed through.  I understand the reasons this is so but we all share the concern that there could be unforeseen deficiencies in the legislation, and the issues which have been raised are important, especially that concern the purported retrospective effect.  The effect of this is difficult to predict.</P><Col N="931"/>
        <P>I have a specific question on section 3.  Will the weekly review of patients, which is currently the practice where somebody is detained, continue given it is now more likely there will effectively be a fixed date on which orders expire?  The current practice is a weekly review, given that orders are effectively indeterminate.  I want to ensure patients are not being disadvantaged by this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the last point is relevant to some of the other issues raised.  Notwithstanding these forms, patients are reviewed all the time and are seen on a weekly basis by their psychiatrists.  The argument advanced by the Attorney General in this case is along the lines of section 28 of the Act, that notwithstanding the forms and whether they are deficient, this does not take from the discretion that the consultants exercise under section 28.  It is important to make that point.  Clearly, I could not advance legislation in the House unless the Attorney General advised it was constitutional.  I am not interfering with the rights of this plaintiff.  Nothing that is happening in this House tonight can take away from the rights this plaintiff has under the legal proceedings she has initiated, or of any other person who initiates proceedings between now and the time the President signs this legislation this evening.</P>
        <P>The Government, as a precautionary measure in the event of this case going down tomorrow, is putting in place legislation that in effect is of temporary duration.  Its sell-by date pertains to the aforementioned 209 patients and is five working days from the time it is enacted, which effectively is next Thursday.  In addition to the five working days, two non-working days, Saturday and Sunday are available and I am advised by the HSE that this time will be sufficient.  I refer to the extraordinary work that was carried out since last Friday by consultant psychiatrists, notwithstanding the bank holiday weekend.  This is a holiday period and some of us got a break.  However, the consultants came into the 40 HSE sites, that is, the 40 hospitals in which patients are involuntarily detained, and reviewed all those cases.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked me a question that I cannot recall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It pertained to the mental health tribunals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>For all these patients, the procedure, if this case goes down tomorrow, will be that a new renewal order must be made before five working days have elapsed.  When that new renewal order is made, an independent psychiatrist must review these patients who also will go before a tribunal at which a different psychiatrist, a lawyer and a layperson will review their cases.  This process happens all the time as new renewal orders are made.  The Department is very proud of this legislation.  It is highly progressive and pro-patient.  I remember the dark old days when members of one&rsquo;s family could have one detained involuntarily forever and no one ever reviewed the case.  Moreover, one did not have one&rsquo;s lawyer, a tribunal and all the safeguards that now are in place.  A total of 90% of renewal orders are upheld by the tribunal.  In approximately 10% to 11% of cases, the renewals are set aside.  While a high percentage of renewals are confirmed, in a small percentage of cases they are not.  Obviously that is for good reasons and one must have no alternative except to involuntarily detain such people, essentially for medical reasons pertaining to their treatment, safety and well-being, before an order to involuntarily detain can be made.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether Senator O&rsquo;Toole is satisfied.  All the procedures in sections 15, 16 and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the argument the Attorney General made in this case.  I repeat the Government is by no means pessimistic about losing this case tomorrow.  I have learned from experience that one case can cause much disquiet and upset and that over this weekend, were this case to go down and were one very sick person to be discharged home or into the community in such circumstances, there would be much concern for that patient and perhaps <Col N="932"/>secondary concerns in a minority of cases for other people.  The risk is too high to take, which is the reason the Government is dealing with it in this fashion.</P>

It is set in County Sligo, where the head of the mental hospital is trying to ensure that someone is allowed to leave and return to the community.  The woman involved, who is doing all the writing, is doing her damnedest to prove she is insane and she is very clever.  It is a beautiful book in which there is extraordinary tension between the two protagonists.  One will not put it down until one is finished reading it.</P>

        <P>In response to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I have a copy of the book on my desk.  It was sent to me recently with a covering note explaining what it was about.
