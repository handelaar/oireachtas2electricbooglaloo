	<P>I have received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline staffing arrangements for shelters for the homeless, including new buildings co-funded by the HSE and by other bodies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to allow the site acquisition for a new school at Gortahork, County Donegal, to proceed to the next stage.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to outline his plans for the new Abbey Theatre in Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement on initiatives planned by him to secure the ongoing Irish open golf.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators McFadden, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Coghlan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Buttimer as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter &mdash; it is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 5, motion re section 12 of Employment Equality Act 1998, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 6, Broadcasting Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 5, to adjourn not later than 5.30 p.m., and, if not previously concluded, to resume at the conclusion of No. 7; and No. 7, Private Members&rsquo; business, statements on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes.  Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.</P>

	<P>I extend the best wishes of Senators to the 50,000 young adults who are starting their leaving certificate examinations today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all done many examinations in our time, but I am sure we will agree that the leaving certificate remains the hardest examination of all.  We should send the best wishes of the House to those young people who are sitting examinations today.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to change the wording of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; business so that Senators can vote on a motion relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  This House needs to show the people of this country and the rest of Europe that it fully supports fundamental rights for all EU citizens.  Perhaps the Leader will take on board my suggestion that he should provide an opportunity for all of us to vote on this issue, which affects people in Ireland and throughout the EU.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on an important issue that has been brought to my attention?  The issue in question relates to the ongoing debate on the health service.  I was contacted this morning by a doctor who told me he knows of a laboratory that deliberately decided not to analyse 12 blood samples for medical conditions which are mainly associated with elderly people.  The laboratory did not have the resources to conduct the tests in question.  The general practitioner told me he is unable to instigate treatment, or make an accurate diagnosis, in respect of the 12 patients.  The laboratory has told him that if he wishes to repeat the blood tests, it cannot guarantee that the tests he has requested will be carried out.  If the patients in question are dragged back into the surgery to give blood once more, their general practitioner will not be able to assure them that he has accurate information on them.  A doctor has contacted me about this ongoing issue.  Laboratories throughout the country do not seem to be able to test all the blood samples that are submitted to them by general practitioners.</P>
        <P>I would like the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to explain what is going on.  It is impossible for general practitioners to provide a service to sick patients if the laboratories are unable to guarantee that they will analyse the blood samples the GPs submit.  This issue needs to be debated further if we are to find out what is going on in our health services.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As we send our good wishes to those who are sitting the leaving certificate, it is interesting to take the matter a little further by considering how many of the 60,000 students in question are likely to aspire to having a career in political life, involving public representation.  One of the great problems we face when considering the future of this or any other society is the lack of interest in public representation.  It is an issue which this House and the Minister for Education and Science should examine.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach will recall that I raised a query last week in regard to item 5 on the Order Paper which deals with the Order under the Employment Equality Act.  I wish today to make the point that the House needs to address this issue which relates to legislation that allows Church bodies to discriminate, albeit in a way with which very few people would disagree.  In this case, the Church of Ireland College of Education seeks to ensure a quota of people from its own cultural background are available to them in their college over a period of years.  I do not believe any right-thinking person would object to this.</P>
        <P>This legislation, however, can be abused and misused against perhaps people who are gay or have other interests.  It also raises the issue of how an Islamic or other person of non-Christian faith can become a teacher in Ireland.  These are serious issues.  I have a difficulty not with the intent of the Order but with what its tells us in terms of our view of ourselves as a society.  Senator Norris and I have raised the issue under various headings, including under the equal status Bill, during the past 15 to 20 years.  There exists in this regard a problem for society and we should be prepared to grasp it, deal with the issues and protect people and our cultural values.</P>
        <P>One of the great aspects of the Lisbon treaty is that it gives a pride of place to national cultural values in order to develop it and move it forward.  We must take a more multifaceted approach to cultural issues.  I ask not that we debate the issue today but that we debate it in the context of the employment equality legislation, equal status legislation and related matters at an appropriate time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association has come round to supporting the Lisbon treaty.  I am aware, having spoken to many farmers in my area, of the concerns in regard to the impact of the WTO talks.  I am hopeful the IFA recommendation will allow its members to support the treaty.  </P>
        <P>A level of disquiet exists in regard to the treaty.  Many people intend to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; just to give the Government a bloody nose for its mismanagement of the economy.  There is no reason to hit the Government at this stage.  There will be many other occasions when this can be done.  It is vital for the country that we ratify the Lisbon treaty.  People should be under no illusion in regard to the real threat which exists to our economy.  According to the ESRI report published today consumer confidence is at its lowest in 12 years.  Oil, fuel and food prices are increasing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the Government&rsquo;s fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Export orders are down for the third consecutive month.  One can detect these concerns on the street.  I have spoken to many builders in the past few weeks who are concerned about what is happening.  F&Aacute;S predicts a downturn of approximately 55,000 jobs in the construction sector.  This will hurt people and families.  It will also hurt those currently sitting the leaving certificate examination who hoped to get involved in the construction industry.  These people are worried about whether there will be jobs in this area for them.  </P>
        <P>I welcome SIPTU&rsquo;s statement today that we need to speed up investment in the national development plan.  SIPTU has called for more investment in the Dublin outer orbital route, in <Col N="4"/>school classrooms and in new social housing units.  The Government, Senator White, can do more.  We must protect the economy and invest more in the construction industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the fatalities which occurred on our roads during the bank holiday weekend.  I begin by expressing my sympathy to the families of those who died on our roads.  </P>
        <P>It was disturbing to hear the chairman of the Road Safety Authority calling for two Departments to agree on the roll-out of speed cameras.  According to the chairman, Gay Byrne, a stand-off between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance has led to an unacceptable delay in the promised roll-out of speed cameras.  While I note both Departments have indicated no difficulty exists, I would like clarification in this regard.  Perhaps the Leader will seek clarification in regard to this long promised element of the road safety strategy.  It is a matter of concern that seven people died on our roads during the bank holiday weekend.  There was a sense that significant progress was being made in terms of reducing the number of fatalities on bank holiday weekends.  I believe that between the May bank holiday weekend and the Easter weekend only one fatality occurred.  This was one fatality too many but seven over a period of one weekend is far too many.  As legislators and policy makers we must ensure we are doing everything we can to make our roads as safe as possible.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister of Transport to the House to provide an update on how the implementation of the new arrangements for provisional licences is coming into effect and to address the concerns raised about testing procedures?  Driving tests must be a great deal more comprehensive.  It was mentioned to me that night-driving is not examined.  When we test people we must ensure they have the skills necessary to drive safely on our roads and not put their lives or the lives of others in danger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator de B&uacute;rca, I call for an urgent debate on the tragedies which took place on our roads at the weekend.  In making my contribution, I wish to extend my sympathies to those families who were grieving during what was a holiday period for many of us.  This subject is so important that the Fine Gael group wishes to table an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the magnitude of what happened at the weekend, which deserves clear and forensic debate.  Many things take place on our roads and drivers and pedestrians do many things for which Government and politicians cannot take responsibility.  However, Government should take responsibility for its priorities, plans and strategies, implement them and be held accountable for them.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of this Seanad session, we had a debate on the road safety strategy and the Road Safety Authority and clear priorities were outlined.  Sadly, mounting evidence exists that a number of these priorities are not being delivered.  It is incumbent on us to review where we stand, to examine what is working and not working and hold to account the Road Safety Authority, the Department of Transport and the Government.</P>
        <P>Two important points must be stressed.  That the chairman of the Road Safety Authority again pointed out the continued non-implementation of the speed camera strategy is of major concern.  We know the role speed cameras can play in tackling these issues and to have the chairman again stating the strategy is not being implemented must be discussed in the House.  We must hear an answer from the people responsible for this, namely, the Government.</P>
        <P>The second point is that a lack of alignment and agreement between Departments could be getting in the way of implementing a road safety strategy which everybody wants to see implemented.  This merits urgent debate and an urgent response from the Government.</P><Col N="5"/>
        <P>We will table an amendment to the Order of Business in recognition of what happened at the weekend.  Will the Government update us on what it is doing to implement its strategy?</P>

	<P>I rise to condemn the senior management of the Irish Coast Guard service for its actions in refusing a request by the Spanish Ambassador to visit the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Valentia.  The Ambassador wished to thank the men of Valentia station for their work in co-ordinating the rescue of Spanish trawlers in distress.</P>
        <P>A decision on the future of Valentia coast guard station is imminent and if it is closed, Spanish lives will be lost because Malin and Valentia are the only two coast guard stations in Ireland, England, Scotland or Wales which can communicate with Spanish trawlers in distress.  Will the Leader find out why the senior management of the Coast Guard service dishonoured us all by its actions and its insult to the Spanish Ambassador?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme investigated the so-called war on drugs and examined alternatives to the prohibitionist approach to drug misuse.  The Leader previously facilitated a debate on this and I was one of the Senators who participated in formulating the motion.  However, the debate lapsed into platitudes on what to do about drugs and we did not sufficiently address the question of alternatives to the current criminal justice or prohibitionist approach to drugs in our society.  Last night&rsquo;s programme clearly and coherently showed the case for a harm reduction model, as used in Amsterdam, Switzerland and other countries.  Such alternatives should be examined rather than focusing on criminal justice and law and order.  Too many platitudes and insufficient practicalities have characterised the debate on drugs to date.  It is timely to have another debate not only in light of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme but also in light of the publication of a book next week by a colleague in Trinity College, Paul O&rsquo;Mahony, entitled The Irish war on drugs: the seductive folly of prohibition.  He was quoted on the programme last night describing criticisms of the current approach to drug law in Ireland.  It is timely, therefore, to have a debate on how best to progress harm reduction models to ensure addicts are treated as patients rather than as criminals.</P>

	<P>I would like to raise two issues.  I previously asked for a debate on dangerous dogs, dogs under threat and the upcoming animal welfare Bill.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to introduce regulations to microchip dogs.  Will the Leader ask him to come to the House before he finalises them because I would like to know how he proposes to deal with non-pedigree dogs, which should be neutered or which raise safety and licensing concerns?  When the Minister introduces the microchip regulations, how will he deal with the dogs that cause problems in our communities?</P>
        <P>The National Council on Special Education has been up and running for a short time.  Would it be appropriate for the head of the council or the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to discuss the implementation of yet another external body and to examine the effectiveness of strategies in place for the special education cohort?</P>

	<P>I very much welcome the position taken by the ICMSA and the IFA on the Lisbon treaty.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s timing is not the best and it is unfortunate that this situation was not defused a long time ago, but it is better late than never.</P>

	<P>As the campaign on the Lisbon treaty draws to a close, it would be useful to examine all the arguments made by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign, which were completely undermined as information emerged about the treaty.  There will be no change to Irish<?oasys _jy ?>neutrality, the 12.5% corporation tax rate, abortion laws, gay marriage, stem cell research, the veto on the WTO agreement and the primacy of EU law or citizenship, an issue raised recently by Anthony Coughlan who overlooked the provisions in the treaty in this regard.  It has been also asserted that there would be a requirement for a referendum in future when changes are made to treaties.  Again, that has been proven not to be the case.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to again come to the House?  In particular, I am thinking in terms of the superlevies.  We are reviewing these at a time when there is a food shortage and when Europe has never filled its quota for milk.  If ever there was proof positive that Europe recognises the nation state, it is this case because it certainly recognises the nation state when it comes to superlevies and tax.</P>
        <P>I often wonder at the perceived threat of Europe becoming a super-state.  It certainly does not apply when it comes to tax and individual states paying their levies.  This is happening at a time when there is a food shortage and when we are trying to increase production.  It should be looked at in the European context because this is where Europe claims a competence in agriculture to see if we could have a European view so that farmers are not penalised for producing food that is badly needed.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment moved by Senator Donohoe.  I ask the Leader to seek an urgent debate today on the issue of road safety.  Clearly, lessons have not been learned.  It is four years since we were promised the roll-out of speed cameras.  The strategy of road safety has not worked, the chairman of the Road Safety Authority is frustrated and angry and we have a silly dispute between two Departments.  This weekend nine people were killed and their families are bereaved and in mourning today as a result of a lack of joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>This debate is urgently required because resources were available to roll out these speed cameras but we have failed to do so.  How many more lives will it take and how many more accidents must occur before the road safety and traffic legislation can be co-ordinated?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play.  As a matter of urgency, will the Leader bring the Minister to the House today for an urgent debate?</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for Education and Science, who I am sure is well into his brief by now, come to the House to discuss a number of education issues.  Today is very important for the thousands of students doing examinations.  For many of us, it is the elitist legacy of pressure and tension.  Is the leaving certificate of 2008 the best method of examining our students?</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House to discuss the programme of works for the school year beginning in September 2008.  This morning on local <Col N="8"/>radio in Cork he said he was examining the issue and was not making a decision until October, which is far too late.  We need an urgent debate on education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the acting leader of Fine Gael in calling for a debate on the health service.  Last week messages of sympathy were sent to Senator Ted Kennedy but this morning we heard of another Ted Kennedy, a patient in the Mater Hospital suffering from some variation of motor neurone disease.  He has been treated and has been fit to go home for the last two months but is unable to do so because of cutbacks in the health service which mean that he cannot be provided with the necessary assistance to adjust a breathing apparatus in the morning and evening.  That is an extraordinary comment on the human aspect of this issue and also on the waste of resources as it costs much more to keep him in hospital for this amount of time, I would have thought.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the question of the operation of the equality legislation.  This is something that must be examined.  A motion has been tabled in the name of the Independent Senators to examine the entire area.</P>
        <P>On 22 May I referred to a situation where hedgerows were being sprayed inappropriately.  The Leader indicated he would obtain some information for me, which I have not yet received.  However, I have received a detailed confirmation and analysis of what happened, which I will make available to the Leader so that he can progress the matter further.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to confirm that an invitation is to be sent to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.  I raised this in the proper and appropriate way by writing to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, our representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  He raised it and there was no opposition.  In fact, there was general agreement from the leaders that this was appropriate.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has no objection and it is now appropriate for me to raise this matter and ask the Leader to confirm that an invitation has been or will be issued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Daly raised a very important matter, to which I also wish to refer.  It was an horrendous act and a frightful insult to the accredited ambassador of a friendly government to refuse him the right to visit Valentia coastguard station to thank the men for the valiant efforts over so many years.  This is a tremendous facility which is very well located and staffed by wonderfully qualified people who do great work.  It is a place of outstanding merit and the ambassador wanted to visit it, not just to thank the staff for all they have done, but to mark the historic links between Valentia and Spain, Dingle and La Coru&ntilde;a, mainly through fishing and other activities about which we know from our history.  I wish to protest in the strongest terms and ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Whoever authorised that decision should be ashamed of himself or herself in this democratic State.</P>
        <P>There has been much mention recently of the fact that the Office of Public Works will dispose of dozens of properties in Dublin.  The OPW is responsible for over 2,100 buildings.  Perhaps much of the disposal arises from the decentralisation programme but the OPW is paying &euro;82 million annually in rent in Dublin and approximately &euro;9.5 million outside the capital.  I would like to know &mdash; I have asked this several times before &mdash; how many buildings are owned and how many are leased by the OPW.  We had the famous Parlon inventory during the last D&aacute;il but I do not think anybody ever saw it.  There was a lot of talk about it, particularly from the then Minister of State.  Now we hear that the OPW is currently identifying all State properties but surely to God it must have this information already.  To give the OPW credit, it has been a good manager of State properties in the past.  I call for a special debate on the strategy regarding State properties, with the participation of the Minister of State at the Depart<Col N="9"/>ment of Finance, with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  I ask the Leader to arrange a special debate on the matter.  This is how, with proper management, we can save the taxpayers&rsquo; millions.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Beverley Flynn and others with whom he might not necessarily choose to pursue this particular adventure.  Senator Regan has a genuine passion and I believe we should respect him for it.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il seem to be united behind this treaty, as well as employers and employees.  There are disparate groups forming behind an issue and we should respect these beliefs because there is obviously some conviction in this type of politics which does not exist in other types.</P>
        <P>There is one matter, however, on which I would like to take issue with Senator Regan.  He is absolutely correct when he said the Lisbon treaty does not make any difference to the veto on corporation tax.  That is correct <i>per se</i>.  However, I am sure the House does not need reminding that a report on tax harmonisation was held back by the EU Commission because it did not want to frighten the Irish electorate.  What kind of manipulation is going on? The veto, of course, will remain but not in perpetuity.  The French, the Germans, the Italians and now the British are, as we speak, plotting to remove that veto and change the corporation tax base.</P>

        <P>I join other speakers in wishing the best of luck to those undergoing their State examinations in the leaving and junior certificates.  They are important examinations in anyone&rsquo;s life.  I extend my best wishes to their families who are going through this torture.

	<P>What is the status of the debate on housing I have called for over the past several weeks, particularly in light of the decline in funding from the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for local authorities for social and affordable housing?   What is the status of a debate requested by several speakers on the role of public private partnerships in the provision of different services?  As a matter of urgency, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the leaked report from F&Aacute;S which suggested that up to 65,000 jobs in the construction sector would be lost in the next year or so.  If this comes to pass &mdash; given that F&Aacute;S is an independent agency &mdash; and if those figures are proven to be correct, it will have devastating consequences for many parts of the country, particularly rural areas which the Leader and I represent.  This House would do well to have a debate on the possibilities of upskilling.  Today sees the commencement of the State examinations of the leaving certificate and the junior certificate.  In the past few years, many people left education early to take up jobs in construction.  If this downturn results in a dramatic cut in the number of people employed in construction, there will be devastating consequences for parts of the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues who have expressed satisfaction at the decision of the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the ICMSA regarding the forthcoming vote on the Lisbon treaty.  Rural Ireland has benefited to an unprecedented degree from our involvement in the European Community and the European Union.  It would be tragic if there was not full support from farming communities for the Lisbon treaty.  I hope now after all the arguments and doubts expressed in recent weeks that farmers and farming families will come on board and support the Lisbon treaty because the interest of Irish agriculture is best served, and really only served, by full engagement with the European Union.</P>
        <P>I also support what was said by Senator Hannigan with regard to the construction industry.  I ask the Leader to address the schools building programme.  Many colleagues, including myself, have extended good wishes to the students commencing the leaving certificate examination today.  It must be acknowledged that many thousands of those students have spent the past five or six years or perhaps even the past 12 or 13 years in sub-standard accommodation.  There is a massive schools building project list in the Department.  The new Minister, notwithstanding the fact he is still reading himself into his brief, has major decisions to make with regard to school buildings in the next few weeks and months.  If there is one area of construction we cannot afford to have delayed, it is in the area of education.  I ask that the Minister for Education and Science be invited to the House before the summer recess to outline the level of funding available, his commitments in this regard and the promises that will be fulfilled.  It is only 18 months since major commitments were made by the previous Minister and, perhaps because of the change in financial circumstances, those commitments have not been fulfilled. <Col N="11"/> We need clarification from the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and we need a debate on the schools building programme.  We need the State to recognise that from the point of view of education, buildings cannot wait.  We cannot defer the future of our children&rsquo;s education.  We must continue to invest in the schools building programme.  I ask that in the near future the Minister would address the House on this vital issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Leader organise for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House.  I agree with previous speakers on this issue.  There is a crisis in education and people need to realise this.  It is not just in the area of school buildings but also in class sizes and in the broken promises made by the Government prior to the election.  Our children are being left to suffer.  Recent statistics from the Department of Education and Science were given in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleagues showing that one in every three schools in this State has applied to the schools building programme but there has not been any announcement of schools being built since the start of this year.  Many students who are sitting the leaving certificate examination today have been in temporary accommodation since they entered education at the age or four or five. This is not acceptable.  Promises regarding class sizes, capitation grants and private ones made by Ministers and Deputies &mdash; the nods and winks in their constituencies that new schools would be built after the general election &mdash; were  reneged on by this Government and this Taoiseach.  </P>
        <P>The most significant promise waiting to be broken is that made by Deputy Brian Cowen, to the IFA at the weekend that he will veto any outcome of the WTO talks if the Lisbon treaty referendum is passed.  Will the Leader seek clarification on this matter because that veto will not exist for the Government or the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Senator would refer to the Taoiseach by his correct title, rather than calling him Brian Cowen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.  Will the Leader seek clarification that the commitment given by the Taoiseach is one he can fulfil?  The veto will not exist if the Lisbon treaty is ratified, and the Taoiseach knows that.  That is why this hand-wringing exercise has been going on for months.  We had a debate on the World Trade Organisation and supposedly tried to clarify this issue, but when the Minister attended this House he did not mention the word &ldquo;veto&rdquo;.  The Minister failed to answer specific questions that were put to him about where in the legal text of the treaty we would have the option to use the veto in a post-Lisbon scenario.  I wrote a detailed letter and the Minister of State was accepting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing that matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Leader to facilitate this.  In fairness, a Chathaoirligh, you have allowed people on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side to contribute.  I am asking the Leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to be fair to everyone.  I have allowed people on both sides to contribute and I possibly have given too much latitude to them.  Members should address questions to the Leader to see if he can reply to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader clarify this situation?  He should ask the Minister of State, who took questions in the House, to respond to my written question as to where in the text of the Lisbon treaty it states that the veto on international trade can be used after the treaty is passed.</P>
        <P>Comments have been made about the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in this campaign.  I am proud of every single person, including Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il supporters, who will come out on 12 June and <Col N="12"/>vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I have repeatedly put our position across in this House.  We have not said that the veto on corporation tax will be taken away.  What we have said, however, is that Fine Gael agreed to this.  In the European Parliament, Fine Gael voted for tax harmonisation in the Bersani report.  The Lisbon treaty provides the infrastructure to change corporation tax from a veto system to qualified majority voting.</P>

	<P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleagues Senators Donohoe and Buttimer.  Road safety is of such significance that it is a matter of national importance meriting an immediate response from this House, one, because of the gravity of the issue and, two, to establish further the relevance of this House.  There has been an inexcusable delay in the delivery of speed cameras.  The Leader should state in his reply what the Government proposes to do about it.  From my own observations, there is too much enforcement of road safety regulations in built-up areas, including the 50 km/h speed limits as one enters towns, while there is not enough enforcement of regulations on national motorways and secondary roads in rural areas.  The concentration of Garda presence at the entrance to urban areas needs to be addressed.  Roads accident figures need to be analysed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader agrees to have such a debate, the Senator can raise all those matters then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader accept that many accidents occur late at night or early in the morning and involve speeding by young drivers and, in some instances, substance abuse by them as well?  Will he put this to the Ministers concerned?  That is the difficulty that needs to be examined together with the introduction of speed cameras.  There also should be a reduced focus on built-up areas at the entrance to towns.  A sensible approach is required to what is a grave national crisis.  The Leader should concede the debate and should approach the Government in this regard.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a full response by way of debate and ministerial intervention to the anticipated loss of 65,000 jobs in the construction industry, which equates to one quarter of the workforce in the sector.  Senator John Paul Phelan is correct that those affected must be <Col N="13"/>upskilled immediately.  They should not be left in unemployment and the largest possible number should be redeployed to a school building programme.  The focus in education in recent years has been on building up the number of teaching staff in the learning support area while school buildings have been neglected.  Those who are made redundant in the construction sector should be upskilled and redeployed to build proper school buildings throughout the country.  They should not be left unemployed indefinitely at great cost to themselves and the State.</P>

        <P>I will communicate to the Minister the concerns raised by Senators Twomey and Norris on health issues.  I do not envisage having another debate on health as we have had four such debates with the Minister in attendance.  Owing to the large number of Bills due before the House in the ten or 11 sitting days before the summer recess, legislation will be prioritised in the time remaining.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Bradford and Doherty called for a debate on education issues, including schools building projects.  I will arrange for such a debate at the earliest possible date.  I look forward to having the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, a former Senator, in the House to update us on developments in his portfolio.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan, Regan, Ross, Bradford, Doherty and John Paul Phelan expressed diverse views on the Lisbon treaty.  I concur with most of Senator Regan&rsquo;s assessment.  Given his legal background, I hope his views are shared by the majority of voters on 12 June.</P>

Having been a Member for almost as long as the Senator, I understand only the Irish Government can get rid of the veto.  I do not want anyone to be misled in this regard.  We all have friends who do not understand much of the treaty and take the word of public representatives on this matter on trust.  We are telling them to come out and vote in the national interest and on behalf of future generations.</P>
        <P>Ireland has played an honourable role in Europe for the past 35 years and our progress has been the envy of most of the world.

        <P>Senator Hannigan was the first of many Senators to raise concerns about the construction industry.  I share the views of Senators on these concerns.  F&Aacute;S has an onerous task in upskilling 60% of our people up to 2020.  I acknowledge the expertise and high standing of Mr. Wills, chairperson of the group responsible for the report published yesterday.  If F&Aacute;S or the Government thinks it can expect employers to put up 25% of the retraining programme, it is not going to happen.  In Mullingar, 16 people wanted to retrain and put their names into the institute but when the institute contacted the employers to provide 25% &mdash; F&Aacute;S was providing 75% &mdash; not one of the employers could afford to provide it.  I recall that billions are available to retrain and upskill our people.  If that is the case, it must be, because times right across the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sounding a warning as someone who works very well with people who have given employment and works hard to keep people in employment.  F&Aacute;S must consider giving 100% training grants in order that we can upskill our people.  People are available to be retrained and employers will give them time to do so, but they will not pay 25% for the employee to do nothing.  The employee will benefit from being upskilled and we must give 100% from the F&Aacute;S allocation.  Speaking from memory, <Col N="15"/>I believe the figure is in the region of &euro;4 billion, a sizeable amount of money made available to train people up to 2020.</P>

        <P>Senators also referred to the horrific accidents at the weekend, where nine people lost their lives.  I join with the House in expressing our condolences to the unfortunate families of those who have lost their lives.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which Senators Coghlan and Leyden were also members, we did a hell of a good job with regard to insurance reform.  We had the admiration of quite a number of Senators.  The committee played a leading role in supporting the Minister and the Government in introducing penalty points.  Penalty points have made people fear the law.  There was a massive reduction in the number of road accidents in the first seven or eight months following their introduction.  The committee also recommended the installation of speed cameras.  We join with Gay Byrne and the Road Safety Authority in their call for their speedier installation.</P>
        <P>The committee also had the courage to propose random breath-testing.  The Government sub-committee recommended random breath-testing two weeks later and introduced it on 21 July 2006.  At least 200 people are alive today who would not be if random breath-testing had not been introduced two years ago.  There are thousands of people going about their daily chores who would have suffered serious injuries had it not been introduced.</P>

        <P>Four years ago, there were 575 garda&iacute; working in the dedicated traffic corps.  By the end of this year, 1,200 garda&iacute; will be working in the dedicated traffic corps, the full complement required by the Commissioner.  We all know of the success of the few speed cameras in place.  We all know the speed cameras in Lucan on the N4 and on the N3 coming in from Navan.</P>
        <P>Members of the committee travelled to America on two occasions where we observed best practice.  People there will say that a dedicated traffic corps is the way to make people fear the law.  Manufacturers have a serious obligation because they make vehicles for the comfort and enjoyment of those of us who have the opportunity to drive our own cars.  Only &euro;15 need be spent on linking the ignition to seat belt use whereby a car would not start if the occupants did not push in their seat belts.  I do not know why that has not been implemented.  We saw that demonstrated in the University of Maryland which has the most up-to-date simulators in the world.  If those on the committee wish to observe best practice, they should go to the University of Maryland.  If time is available, I will arrange for the urgent matter of road safety to be debated and for the Minister to update us on the driving licence issue.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin called for a debate on super levies and issues pertaining to same.  I will arrange for a debate to take place.  Senator Norris called for an update on the invitation to the Dalai Lama.  I will come back to the House on that issue tomorrow.</P>
        <P>Senator Paul Coghlan asked about the Office of Public Works and progress on decentralisation.  Planning permissions are coming through in most areas for the decentralised offices but it is a challenge.  I also read the article he read on Sunday and the fact that &euro;82 million is being spent on rents in Dublin and almost &euro;9 million is being spent outside the Dublin area.  That is a huge amount of money.  I have no difficulty arranging a debate on an action plan from the Office of Public Works to meet the challenges over the next five to ten years.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for a debate on housing and I will arrange for one to take place.  The Senator also asked about the economy and public private partnerships.  I have already given a commitment to the House and the Senator on such a debate.</P><Col N="16"/>
        <P>Senators Daly and Coghlan raised an issue in regard to the Spanish ambassador.  I will investigate the incident as a matter of urgency after the Order of Business to see how I can use my influence.  I will not comment further other than to say it was an exception to the rule and that it was certainly not in keeping with the great work done by generations of families around our coast.  When the ambassador of a friendly nation wishes to express thanks on behalf of the people of his country, this is an exceptional response.</P>

Senator Cecilia Keaveney once again called for a debate on dangerous dogs.  As she correctly pointed out, the animal welfare Bill will cover this issue, hopefully this year.  She also called for a debate on the National Council for Special Education.  I acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s great experience in this area.  I have no difficulty arranging a debate on that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am generally in agreement with the views expressed by the Senators who tabled these amendments, I believe many of the issues are already dealt with in the Bill.  For example, in regard to amendment No. 1, section 42 requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland prepare codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters.  In particular, section 42(2)(<i>g</i>) provides that advertising, teleshopping materials, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any broadcasting service, particularly in advertising and other activities which relate to matters likely to be of interest or indirect interest to children, protects the interests of children having particular regard to the general public health interests of those children.  </P>
        <P>Furthermore, section 42(4) allows a broadcasting code to be prepared by the authority prohibiting the advertising in a broadcasting service of a particular class of foods or beverages considered by it to be subject to public concern, in particular, in respect of those which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars.  While I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator I believe the provisions proposed are already provided for and addressed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendment No. 23, section 42 requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland prepare codes governing the standards and practices in general to be observed by broadcasters and that such codes provide that matters involving taste and decency of programme material, in particular in respect to the portrayal of violence and sexual conduct, shall be presented by a broadcaster with due sensitivity to the feelings and convictions of the audience and with due regard to the impact such programming can have on children.  Senators will be aware that these provisions mirror the provisions under which the BCI prepared the children&rsquo;s advertising code and the BCI code of programme standards which specifically address the points made.</P>
        <P>We have provided in section 42(9) for the continuation of these codes which can, of course, be updated, renewed and amended by the authority.  I consider that these provisions encompass and in many ways go beyond what Senators are proposing.  Accordingly, I consider the provisions outlined adequately address the concerns raised.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendment No. 24, section 42 requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland prepare codes governing the standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters in regard to children.  These provisions mirror provisions under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 30, section 42 requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland prepare codes governing standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters.  Section 42(2)(<i>g</i>) provides that advertising, teleshopping materials, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion employed in any broadcasting service, particularly in advertising or other such activities which relate to matters of interest to children, can be regulated.  Again, I consider these provisions encompass and go beyond what the Senator is proposing.  Accordingly, I consider the provisions outlined already address the concerns raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 34, section 42 requires that the broadcasting authority of Ireland prepare codes governing standards and practices to be observed by broadcasters and Senators will be aware that these provisions mirror the provisions under which the BCI prepared its code of programme standards.  I have provided in section 42(9) for the continuation of these codes.</P>
        <P>While I concur with many of the sentiments set out in the amendments, I believe the provisions of the Bill address these concerns.  I cannot therefore accept these amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that provision is made in the Bill in respect of the matters raised in the amendments.  He also stated that regulation to deal with these issues can be made.  Am I correct that this is what the Minister is indicating?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister indicate when such regulation will be made, what type of regulations will be made and who will police them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Such regulations already exist as administered by the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BCI and such codes have been developed, particularly in respect of children&rsquo;s advertising codes.</P>
        <P>The Bill allows for a continuation of that system.  In this case, the broadcasting authority of Ireland would be responsible for the design, monitoring and implementation of such codes.  We have strengthened the legislation in that we are allowing specifically in legislating for such codes that children&rsquo;s advertising of food products which are high in salt, fat and sugar may be excluded.  This is an attempt to give real legislative back-up to an authority looking to introduce such a scheme.</P>
        <P>The codes are in place and provide wider cover for an authority seeking to maintain certain standards with regard to public decency and violence.  A wider issue is raised with regard to how far we can go with such codes.  I am open to different views on how we regulate advertising, especially advertising aimed at children.  Certain individuals argue we should have a complete ban on advertising.  Others argue that such a blanket ban would undermine the financing or commercial viability of good children&rsquo;s programming or the ability of programme makers to broadcast good children&rsquo;s programming.  A balance is required.  The argument is also made that proper and well-regulated advertising for products which do not damage the health of a child should be allowed.</P>
        <P>In this Bill I want to strengthen the code so we can be sure we have effective control when it comes to advertising which we know has a real effect.  We want to discourage the use of junk foods.  I will leave it in the hands of the authority as to how the particular codes are developed.  These provisions are included in the Bill.</P>

I am happy to review the text in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel prior to Report Stage.  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 3 as no such generic provision was included when drafting the Bill as it was intended to allow the requirements to go further in some instances than merely laying documents before the Oireachtas.  In parts of the Bill positive resolutions are required to be passed by each House of the Oireachtas for certain actions to take effect, such as the removal of a member of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  With regard to amendment No. 4, section 4 is a standard provision which appears in most Acts and as such I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, subsection (1), between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) The proposed Board Members shall go before an oral hearing at the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to allow that committee to direct questions to the proposed Board Members as to their competence for that office having regard to experience and/or qualifications as set out in <i>section 9</i> of this Part.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister and Senators will recall that in my Second Stage speech I welcomed the fact that the Minister will give a critical role to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the appointment of the board of the broadcasting authority of Ireland.  I do not propose to elaborate on this any further.  This amendment asks that we take a bold step forward, however, and give it further expression and authority.  I ask that the Oireachtas joint committee hold an oral hearing to be attended by all of the Minister&rsquo;s nominees to the board at which they would be questioned on areas related to their competency for membership of the board.  Whether they belonged to the specific sectors set out in the Bill would be established, as would whether they represent a union or another interest group.  Their competency and knowledge in the broadcasting sphere also would be established.</P>
        <P>The nominees would answer basic questions on the sector they represent, their competency in the broadcasting area and their suitability to be members of the authority.  Qualifications or experience claimed in a given sphere, such as music or culture which are mentioned in the Bill, would be examined.  It would not examine extraneous material such as private lives or matters outside the remit of the committee.  It would establish suitability for membership of the broadcasting authority of Ireland.</P>
        <P>This would further public confidence in the process of appointing public boards.  I know the Minister is innovative and this is a great opportunity for him to go a stage further.  I appeal to him to take this amendment on board.  It would allay public cynicism and let us be frank about the great cynicism among the general mass of people about how we appoint people to State boards, the clandestine nature of the appointment process, the fact people may not necessarily be qualified for the board of which they are a member and the fact that subsequently they may not participate wholesomely in the board.  Public cynicism must be allayed to improve confidence in our democratic system.</P><Col N="21"/>
        <P>We need competence on the board given the serious nature of broadcasting which was discussed at great length on Second Stage and rightly so.  We want the highest form of competence and calibre of commitment on the board which we want to reflect the sectors set out in the Bill.  The board would be transparent and open and win public confidence in the system.  It would be another advancement on appointing four people on the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee.  It would set a wonderful precedent.</P>
        <P>I am convinced about this and I would be prepared to accept amendments on Report Stage to ensure extraneous material would not be examined and people would not be subject to witch hunts or inquisitions of a tabloid journalism nature.  However, in the interests of taxpayers who will fund the operation, the democratic system, this House and the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides, which are unquestioned, nominees should be subject to proper questioning on their competence, the sector they represent and their commitment to the broadcasting process.  Any reasonable candidate for membership of the board should stand up readily under that process.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the setting of parameters or guidelines to negotiate a methodology for it.  I am well aware of the risks within and I would like them to be eliminated.  However, I appeal to the Minister to go a step further.  It would be a brave step for democracy and the broadcasting sphere and it would be appropriate to take it in the Seanad.  The Minister should do this and I am prepared to have my amendment refined if that is necessary.  If the Minister and his officials think it needs tweaking, I do not mind once they accept the principle and commence the process of an open inquiry into board appointments.  This process should extend to all State boards.  Would it not make for a wonderful new society and a confident people?  Is it not time it happened to eradicate cynicism about such appointments, cronyism, jobbery and patronage of the wrong type?  Patronage is all right when it is meritocratic and based on commitment to the nation and civic well-being.  Patronage of a sinister type must be eliminated.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this worthwhile amendment, which is meant in the best sense.  He will be aware of how positive I was on Second Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much recognise the bona fides and the motives behind the amendment and the Senator&rsquo;s interest in the area.  I am examining innovate new ways of appointing authorities and it is important to get the balance right between various considerations.  It is appropriate for the Minister of the day to have an appointment facility to boards.  He or she does not have to appoint the entire board but it is appropriate for him or her to have certain control, particularly over the appointment of the chairman and a number of others, because public policy is set by the elected Government and a Minister is given constitutional responsibility to determine and pursue such policy.  It is, therefore, correct to marry that officeholder, elected under our constitutional arrangements, with any authorities set up.  He or she should have the ability to outline policy in his or her Department and to extend that policy vision into relevant State authorities via those he or she appoints to their boards.  It is correct for the Minister to have the ability to influence the direction of boards through public appointments.</P>
        <P>However, where a new board is being appointed, as is the case under the legislation, it is possible and beneficial for the Minister to share that responsibility with a joint Oireachtas committee in a number of board appointments.  That would widen the net the Minister casts to appoint people to boards and it would allow for a wider democratic discussion and engagement in that process.  That is why the new provisions were developed.  I have a fundamental concern with what I understand to be Fine Gael&rsquo;s position on this matter.  The party says joint Oireachtas committees should question, check or interview ministerial board appointees and that is the primary instinct of the party in how we evolve in this area.  I prefer my approach in that the committees would have a proactive rather than a reactive role in this regard.  No matter <Col N="22"/>how much we might wish this should be done in an open, civil and proper manner, such an after the fact check on appointments could easily turn into a contentious system of interview and check that would discourage people from taking on a not well paid public service function.  I fear the proposal set out in the amendment and more widely outside the Houses by Fine Gael would lead to people being discouraged from taking up appointments and that would not necessarily improve the process because it would have the potential of becoming a contentious checking process.</P>
        <P>I much prefer my proposal because it would be much more proactive for joint Oireachtas committees to conduct such discussions and interviews at they see fit and to use them to propose names, which they could present to the Minister who, in turn, would present them to the Government for nomination.  That will provide for an engaged public process and it will provide committees with great freedom in how they decide to go about their work and with a wide selection procedure.  That is the right way to go rather than the alternative whereby nominations are brought to the committees for vetting, which would inevitably be more contentious and would lead to board selection that would not deliver as good candidates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty accepting  the Minister&rsquo;s proposition that there must be significant ministerial control and input because that is a given.  I also have no difficulty with the proposal that an Oireachtas committee should make four recommendations.  My amendment does not preclude the Minister&rsquo;s proposition and I propose that a public hearing should be added.  The committee should make four recommendations but a public hearing should be held on them.  That would improve the system as the proactive dimension cited by the Minister would be provided for.  I do not accuse him or being disingenuous but my proposal for a public hearing on the appointments would not replace his proposition that four members be appointed on the recommendation of the committee.  I support the proactive role but a hearing should be instituted.  My proposal could be refined but it could be pioneering in regard to all State board appointments and it would make for great reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 6 refers to the limit of two consecutive terms for authority members.  This is a blunt instrument in that it affects good members as well as poor members.  If the Minister wishes to replace somebody, he or she can choose not to appoint him or her.  I ask him to reconsider this provision.  If terms limits apply, it is possible a large number of people could leave the board at the same time, which would potentially disrupt its operation.</P>
        <P>Under amendment No. 7, we would like qualifications to be stated as opposed to just the terms.  Amendment No. 8 provides for the publication of appointments in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>rather than having them laid only before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to delete the gag on the chief executive which would prevent him or her from commenting on Government policy while amendment No. 11 provides a mechanism for public information regarding interests and conflicts of interest on the part of members and staff of the authority.</P>

	<P>If I can return to the point made by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly before going on to deal with the other amendments, the issue here is whether this process will improve the quality of members we get for our boards.  In the absence of a real veto, which is not being proposed here, I fear that such a vetting process could be something that might only restrict good candidates from coming forward.  It would not have the real power to check the appointment of a candidate.  I do not see what added value it would bring to the process.  In particular, if we have a more open and transparent process, which I believe we have here, some of the <Col N="23"/>qualifications or the skills people have should be available for public view.  In a sense, this provides a similar role to what is being proposed.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendments Nos. 6 and 86, it is correct for us to put in place a two-term cap.  It is interesting to note a discussion this morning on the US presidential elections and the US experience.  Such caps have been a useful system for ensuring there is change, that one gets new blood and that there is a limit in terms of people&rsquo;s involvement.  In this case because it limits the appointment to five years each, it is appropriate to ensure that, in legislative terms, it is restricted to such a ten-year period.  I do not accept amendments Nos. 6 or 86.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which were moved by Senators McCarthy, Alex White, Ryan, Hannigan and Kelly, deal with the issue of transparency in reporting on the appointment of board members.  There is some merit in identifying the qualifications of board members in any statement laid before the House, as well as the term and remuneration.  The Senators also proposed that such a statement be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  While I cannot accept the amendments today, I will consider them further in advance of Report Stage in recognising that they may in a sense provide some of the objectives that we might have in a vetting process suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes to remove subsection 2 of section 19.  This subsection restricts the CEO from discussing the merits of Government policy while attending the Committee of Public Accounts.  I cannot accept this amendment.  The restriction on comment on the merits of Government policy is standard in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The purpose of the Committee of Public Accounts is to focus on the reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General on their use of resources and expenditure generally and on financial matters and not on other issues.  There is no such restriction proposed in legislation in respect of section 20, which deals with attendance or accountability to other Oireachtas committees.</P>
        <P>In respect of amendment No. 11, which seeks to ensure that any disclosures made by members of staff to the broadcasting authority of Ireland and statutory committees will be placed on a register which will then be made available to the public, sections 21 and 22 set out clear methods for dealing with situations where disclosures are made and where the authority can make certain decisions in respect of members and staff.  In the case of staff and consultants, the legislation is clear that removal from office or termination of contract are possible solutions where requirements have not been complied with.  I do not feel this section requires more strengthening and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 20, which was moved by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, proposes allowing the Minister, following consultation with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to cap the levy imposed on broadcasters by the broadcasting authority of Ireland to meet its expenses.  I understand the need for the levy to be justified and appropriate and the authority should not seek to obtain funds greater than it requires from a levy on broadcasters.  The proposed legislation states clearly in subsection 5 of section 33 that the authority must either offset against the following year or refund any surplus in the levy.  Subsection 7 requires that details of the levy order be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas where it may be annulled by resolution.  In the case of regulators for most sectors where they are funded by a levy, it is not standard practice for the Minister to have powers to cap the levy.  I believe the legislation places sufficient restrictions on the broadcasting authority of Ireland in this regard and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the Minister&rsquo;s point about my first amendment, it would not restrict good candidates from seeking positions on the board.  If they are competent, know what they are about and have the right motives, they would not have a problem with a properly <Col N="24"/>ordered process of public investigation.  I do not accept the contention that it would deter good candidates.</P>
        <P>It is correct for the Minister to challenge on the added value.  The added value, again, would establish excellence in the personnel joining the board, maintain transparency and confidence in the whole process and the system and further break away from the traditional models of appointment.  It has much to commend it, namely, a huge output with no disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence and assistance in respect of amendment groupings.  In respect of amendment No. 20 and the capping of the levy, we contend that there should be a reasonable level of expenditure.  However, in the current economic climate, when we are asking many sectors and workers to exercise restraint, it would not be a bad thing for the House to establish in legislative terms the concept of restraint in expenditure by a State board.</P>
        <P>I understand the controls in the legislation but what we are effectively saying here is that a reasonable cap be established on expenditure, taking cognisance of previous and likely expenditure and exercising leniency, reason and vision for pre-planning.  We could have an excellent board today and next year.  To take it to an extreme and ludicrous level, it should be enshrined in legislation that no board in the future could decide to build itself a Taj Mahal-like office block, that it needed to visit Bermuda a few times a year to analyse its role in broadcasting or any other such extravagant or outlandish thing.  This is the purpose of the capping exercise.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister accepts that the objective is not to muzzle the board or to restrict its remit.  The objective is in no way to make it less effective in what it does or in its vision and planning.  Of course, we need all that.  We need an exciting, adventurous, ambitious and developing broadcasting sector.  We must all be gung-ho about that, which is why we are all so committed to getting this legislation right.  However, no board should be given an open chequebook.  The need for reasonable expenditure should be inserted in legislation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If we capped the levy, we would achieve another objective, namely, a high quality of programming. We are currently not punitive or prohibitive in respect of the amount of money we collect from the various broadcasters around the country.  If they pay too much into an authority that spends ridiculous amounts foolishly, they could limit the amount they spend on programming, quality productions and planning for the future.  That also must be a consideration.  Capping would stop ludicrous expenditure and ultimately would be a safeguard for good programming.  I commend the amendment to the Minister on that basis.  We do not have a philosophical dispute here.  This is an operational matter, to attain what is best and to achieve probity while not thwarting or muzzling creativity or success.</P>

	<P>I hear what the Senator is saying and perhaps this is something we can come back to on Report Stage.  The Senator suggests there should be a check in place, perhaps in the context of the Committee of Public Accounts or within the structures set out here, in terms of the Minister determining an annual cap.  Either way, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly argues that some sort of external check or reporting requirement is desirable so that any such concerns could be allayed.  </P>
        <P>By and large, these authorities are very responsible, particularly in areas like this, and are very conscious of public propriety as they deal in corporate governance regulations.  My experience is that they are very proper in their dealings.  However, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying and perhaps we can look at some sort of wording on Report Stage which would give comfort and assurance that there is an ability to justify or clarify a levy.  I may return to the matter on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>I genuinely and enthusiastically welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply in this instance.  I am very happy about it.  I feel very strongly that it is important that the Seanad has an input into the legislation, not just in verbiage but in terms of output.  For that reason, I am delighted that the Minister has decided to make an adjustment on Report Stage to accommodate this ambition, which is a reasonable one and simply seeks that we have probity and are seen to have such.  As the Minister has said, ultimately the board will not have a difficulty with that.  In fact, it will give the board the space it needs.

        <P LI="1">In page 32, subsection (2)(<i>d</i>), line 29, after &ldquo;disabilities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;requiring the use of sign language and sub-titles&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments propose to make the use of sign language and subtitles in programming a legal requirement.  The objective is to ensure the full enjoyment of programmes by persons with hearing impairment.  Sign language and subtitles should be designated in the Bill rather than just being implicit in it.  We should be explicit as to the entitlements of hearing-impaired people.  I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that subtitling, in so far as it exists on programmes such as the news and &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, is neither accurate nor timely.  There tends <Col N="27"/>to be subtitling of a question asked by a reporter which appears when the question is being answered.  Subtitling does not coincide with the speaker and this is a technical adjustment which should be made and which I presume would be achieved with the proper expenditure.  It is very important that both this House and the other House should be unambiguous about their commitment to hearing-impaired people and to people who labour under any disability because, needless to say, none of us knows the day or the hour when that list will include ourselves.</P>
        <P>This amendment would enhance the Bill because it would give a full legislative expression to the view that there should be subtitling and the use of sign language at all times to ensure hearing-impaired people get full enjoyment from programmes.  It is an exciting amendment with great potential.  It would be symbolic for the Government to accept the amendment.  I appeal to the Minister to accept it on the level of symbolism and as a message to our hearing-impaired people.  This in itself would not be enough to justify the amendment so I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment as a practical step to ensure the use of the most up-to-date subtitling and use of sign language for hearing-impaired people is legislatively enshrined.  This may be properly more an issue for Second Stage but in presenting the amendment I ask the Minister, whom I acknowledge as proactive in all these areas, to examine urgently at the quality of subtitling as it exists.  I propose this worthy amendment to enhance the legislation and I ask the Minister to accept it in the spirit in which it is intended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.  I referred to this matter on Second Stage last week.  In th past five or six years I have raised this matter of subtitling on a number of occasions in both Houses.  From the point of view of those who suffer from impaired hearing, adequate subtitling of television programmes gives them an opportunity to follow programmes, to derive maximum enjoyment from television and to assist them in their knowledge of news and current affairs.  I presume it is either a financial or technological issue or both but the current quality of subtitling of news, current affairs and live coverage of sporting events leaves much to be desired.</P>
        <P>I reiterate what I said on Second Stage as a challenge to all of us.  If a person with full hearing, which would be most Members, were to turn down the volume of the news, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; or a sporting programme and attempt to follow the programme from the subtitling service, he or she would find it a very inadequate presentation.  From the news perspective, the subtitles can be three, four or five seconds behind the story and it is often worse in a sporting programme.  This is not a good enough service and neither is it fair to people who suffer from hearing problems.  We must put maximum pressure on the broadcasters to improve the subtitling service significantly.</P>
        <P>Many of those who are hearing impaired are elderly and most elderly people have a great interest in news and current affairs.  I appreciate the live elements of the news may cause a difficulty for subtitling but some of the news programming is prerecorded and there should be no excuse for the absence of subtitling in those parts of the programmes.</P>
        <P>There should be a clear signal of intent from the Oireachtas that we want significant improvement in the subtitling service.  This amendment would be a clear statement that we are reaching out to all those who have hearing difficulties and require the sign language service.  In this era of modern technology and communications and digital television by which we can see a spacecraft landing on Mars, it is not too much to expect that we would have a decent quality of subtitling.  I commend RTE on its subtitling and I contrast its efforts with those of TV3 where, as far as I know, apart from some of the imported British programmes, the subtitling service <Col N="28"/>is non-existent.  This legislation provides an opportunity to lay down minimum standards for a high quality service from the broadcasters.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s positive response because the day will come for all of us in this House and for our friends and families when our hearing may not be 100% and when an adequate, proper, sufficient subtitling service will enhance quality of life and the enjoyment of television.  Will the Minister accept this amendment because its provisions will be of long-term assistance to a great many people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14- ?><Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Each of the amendments Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, proposes a range of changes in the objectives as set out in section 25.  This section, by its nature, is focused on high-level goals and objectives of the broadcasting authority of Ireland, BAI, and does not dwell on specifics.  Amendments Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, seek to add specific issues or actions related to the objectives as stated but these are already dealt with in other sections which deal with the BAI and its role.</P>
        <P>The issue of sign language and subtitling referred to in amendment No. 13, is dealt with comprehensively in section 43 in the broadcasting rules where the BAI is given clear tasks in this regard.  I will use this opportunity to refer to certain developments in this area because a certain progress has been made over the past three years following on the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland&rsquo;s rules on levels and standards of promotions for the four terrestrial channels of RTE 1, RTE 2, TG4 and TV3.  We do not have similar control over channels such as Setanta Sports because it is outside the jurisdiction of the BCI and, consequently and regrettably, it does not make subtitling available.  For those channels which provide subtitling, there is a requirement for RTE 1 to move to a target of 100% subtitling over a ten-year period and for TV3 to reach a target of 60% in that ten-year period.  The target for RTE means 100% subtitling within that 18-hour period rather than 24 hour-period and it is a similar period for TV3.</P>
        <P>Further provisions already in place are that all television programmes funded by the Sound and Vision scheme are required to have subtitling available.  The Bill also sets out in detailed provisions that the BAI, which will assume responsibility for the area, would have to review such access rules around subtitling and language every two years and include a progress report in its annual report.  A key requirement is stitched in which includes improved service targets, especially for RTE and TV3.  There is also a reporting mechanism in that two-year report.  We can perhaps include in that report a review of subtitling quality where such concerns arise.  It is not the case that we are inactive or lacking ambition in this area.  I cannot accept the amendment because in this section we are dealing with much wider goals.  Subsequent sections deal in more detail with issues such as sign language and subtitling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that amendments Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, are being discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>While I take the point that there are high-level goals, there is nothing wrong in giving specific, practical expression to them.  It will enhance the legislation to do so.  Later in the legislation, sign language is mentioned &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the previous section&rdquo;, which, in a sense, is a bit loose.  It would enhance this section to include the proposed amendment No. 13, so I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14 seeks to establish a quota of mandatory programming in the Irish language.  I accept that the legislation cites the promotion of the Irish language and its cultural significance as a high level goals, but I would like it to receive practical expression.  On Second Stage, I recognised RTE&rsquo;s extraordinary achievements in the promotion of the Irish language and Irish culture, as well as the success of TG4.  While that is clearly on the record, the objective of this amendment is to establish a mandatory quota &mdash; a specific, stated level &mdash; of Irish <Col N="29"/>language programming.  That is an important issue to enshrine in legislation.  While Senators may be sincere in their commitment to the Irish language as of today, we must protect the language for future generations.  It is an important part of the heritage we pass on to our children and subsequent generations.  Our language is very beautiful as well as being a vehicle for our history, culture and heritage.  It is highly valued and deeply imbued in us.  It would enhance the Bill to enshrine in it the concept of a mandatory quota for Irish language programming.  In the same way as an earlier proposal of mine would send out an important signal to the disability sector, this amendment would send out a positive signal to those who love the language and promote it locally through conversation classes and other activities.  It would be affirmative for them to note that the Oireachtas was making such legislative changes to endorse what they are doing.</P>
        <P>As currently constituted, RTE should have no issue with such a step.  RTE&rsquo;s policy is pro-Irish language, culture and heritage, so the amendment poses no threat to that situation.  All the amendment seeks is to enshrine in the Bill a requirement that that will continue to be the case.  We should be specific about that.  It is vital to maintain our commitment to promoting the propagation and use of the language in all our broadcast media.  Is p&aacute;irt d&rsquo;oidhreacht na t&iacute;re &eacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn go l&eacute;ir an teanga a labhairt.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; r&aacute;ite sa Bhille go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach.

        <P>For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to establish a mandatory quota for Irish language programming.  The mechanism for arriving at a mandatory quota can be discussed on Report Stage.  I accept that there would have to be professional involvement in some of the issues involved, including the authority and the Minister.  There must be a commitment to a mandatory quota, however, setting a level of Irish language programming below which we could not go.</P>
        <P>We spoke recently about dumbing down in broadcasting, but let us ensure there will be no such dumbing down of our national language, culture or oidhreacht.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter.  I will be guided by him and his officials if they reasonably state that alterations must be inserted on Report Stage, but I would like the principle to be accepted now.  It will enhance the legislation as well as enhancing the country.  We cannot slavishly sell ourselves out or dumb ourselves down.  We should maintain what is good and hold what is central to our being and our essence as a people.  Why not be assertive, especially in modern times, as well as being confident about what we are and the great heritage we have.  Let us do so today.</P>

	<P>I will revert briefly to the Minister&rsquo;s response to amendment No. 13 concerning subtitling.  I take his remarks on board and I am encouraged by his indication of the additional quantity of programmes that will be made available under the subtitling service.  As I did on Second Stage, I want to concentrate on the quality of much of that subtitling.  Without labouring the point, I ask the Minister to try to follow either RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo; by way of subtitling alone.  He certainly will not find the experience satisfactory.  Sadly, tens of thousands of people throughout the country are experiencing that difficulty because of the inadequate quality of subtitling in live television broadcasts.  I appreciate that some technological issues may have to be addressed and I am sure financial costs also are involved.  We owe it to all those people whose hearing is less than it should be, however, to invest significantly in subtitling and to demand the highest possible standards.  The Minister should ask the broadcasting authority to concentrate on the quality of subtitling as much as the quantity.  While the quantity is sufficient, the quality is not as good as it should be.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>I support what Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said concerning his amendment aimed at establishing a quota for Irish language programming.  I acknowledge that a sea-change was brought about as a result of the introduction of TG4.  It is, if I recall correctly, approximately 15 years since the former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, ploughed a lone furrow for some time as he sought to impress on his Cabinet colleagues and the Oireachtas as a whole the need to provide funding to establish TG4.  While his endeavours were viewed by many as aspirational and perhaps a little removed from reality, the station has proved a resounding success and long may that continue.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment is aspirational and would be useful in RTE and TV3.  I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>
        <P>A major debate is under way on how best to maintain and develop the Irish language.  For example, we have had political rows about our approach to teaching Irish at second level.  The greater people&rsquo;s exposure to Irish, the better it will be for our language, culture and heritage.  The Minister will recall the continuity announcements one used to hear on RTE in advance of every programme.  Introducing almost every second programme with a phrase or two of Irish may not have transformed the use of the language but it at least marked an effort to use Irish on television on an ongoing basis.  This practice has since ceased.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of consideration as it would take a small step towards protecting and developing the language by making it a stronger feature of everyday culture.  Those who may not have ever spoken a sentence in Irish would at least learn and use a word or two of the language.  It will take a long time to change our culture to the extent that Irish is used frequently by the majority of citizens.  The amendment would be a small and positive step in this direction and I hope the Minister will respond favourably.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the difficulty the Minister faces, we must use legislation to make statements and be aspirational.  We have moved a long way from former President de Valera&rsquo;s aspiration that Irish would again become the spoken language of the country.  Politicians are not as demanding as they were 60 or 70 years ago.  However, if we genuinely want to protect our language and culture, we should take this small positive step in the right direction.</P>

Nevertheless, it would be wise and opportune to include a specific objective regarding children.  For this reason, the amendment proposes to protect children from commercialisation in order that they are not otherwise exposed to broadcasting that could undermine their welfare.

	<P>On amendment No. 13, to give some specific details on the realisation of targets, RTE&rsquo;s subtitling coverage in 2007 was some 6,320 hours and it has given commitments, published in its statement of commitments for 2008, to increase this figure to 6,700 hours, subtitle coverage in all news, current affairs and main weather forecasts on RTE 1 and RTE 2, increase subtitling in children&rsquo;s programming and ensure all GAA coverage is subtitled in 2008.</P>
        <P>I noted the contributions of Senator Bradford and others.  The key issue in subtitling is quality rather than quantity.  Perhaps it will be possible to insert a clause in the provision requiring the broadcasting authority of Ireland to report on subtitling to have it assess the quality of subtitling as well as the number of hours of subtitled broadcasts.  This may take into account Senator Bradford&rsquo;s concerns regarding the current system.</P>
        <P>The section clearly states that it is a broad goal of the BAI to &ldquo;facilitate the development of Irish language programming and broadcasting services&rdquo;.  I am reluctant to accept amendments which would specify means, including mandatory quotas, by which one would achieve this objective.  Other sections of the Bill expand on how the Department is progressing a number of practical measures aimed at achieving this goal.  For example, the decision to increase TG4&rsquo;s budget by 15% at a time of tight budgetary restrictions was an indication from the Government that we take seriously the development of Irish language programming.</P>
        <P>I agree that Irish language programmes are often of an international standard.  I attended the launch of the latest round of the Aifric series of programmes which was made with funding from the Sound and Vision scheme.  This was superb programming which stood up to comparison with programmes in any other language, including English, French, German and Spanish.</P>
        <P>The Bill will include provisions making available specific funding from the broadcasting fund to allow commercial community broadcasters to fund off-peak Irish language programming.  This is an example of a practical step.  The amendment, on the other hand, gives the authority a broad aspirational function.  I am satisfied the current wording is appropriate and on that basis I cannot accept amendments Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive.  One must bear in mind the statement in section 25 that the BAI shall endeavour to ensure &ldquo;that the number and categories of broadcasting services made available in the State by virtue of this Act best serve the needs of the people of the island of Ireland, bearing in mind their languages and traditions and their religious, ethnic and cultural diversity&rdquo;.  Furthermore, section 25(2)(<i>e</i>) requires the BAI to facilitate the development of Irish language programming.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Hannigan&rsquo;s point on the protection of children, the subject of amendment No. 15, section 42(2) and 42(4) require the BAI to develop codes that protect the physical, moral and mental development of children, which protect the general and health interests of children in the context of advertising and which allow for the prohibition of certain types of <Col N="32"/>advertising aimed at children.  There are provisions in this Bill for such measures and on that basis I am reluctant to accept amendments to this section.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We will consider examining on Report Stage the provisions set out in the Bill to require the BAI to carry out a two-year review on delivery of subtitling standards and to ensure the factors in this include not only number of programming hours but also the quality of subtitling delivered.  This will account for the concerns of Senator Bradford about quality as well as quantity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am prepared to accept that as incorporating the spirit of the amendment.  I would have preferred to see the amendment included in the legislation but if we have a commitment that there will be a provision on Report Stage for monitoring quality and quantity, I am pleased to accept the response on that basis.</P>
        <P>Regarding the response of the Minister to the amendment concerning the Irish language, ba mhaith liom mo bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il dos na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; Bradford agus Doherty ar son an taca&iacute;ocht a thug siad dom.  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och d&oacute;ibh mar is rud t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.  I understand what the Minister is saying but I disagree that there is no necessity to include a legislative provision for this matter.  It is important to do so but I am open to negotiation, debate and examining the level of quota on Report Stage.  The principle is a good one and protects and polices the situation.  Future generations, future broadcasting authorities and future Ministers may be prepared to accept a dumbing down &mdash; to use contemporary phraseology &mdash; of the Irish language and the element of that in programming.  The current situation is healthy, with the excellence of TG4 and the programming in Irish on national broadcast media and many local media outlets, but the legislation should protect us into the future.  I cannot accept the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
        <P>Regarding amendment No. 16 on religious programming, the principle is similar to the motion proposed regarding the Irish language.  Whatever the hue, sect or denomination of religion, it is very important to the people.  It is important day to day and as part of our heritage.  It is part of our essence and being and we may be distracted from the fact that the great bulk of people in this country are practitioners of one religion or another.  The bulk of people in the country are Christians, the larger number of which are Roman Catholics.  There is great commitment to religious practice in this country and this is evident at the weekend and all the time.  Religious practice, ritual and belief is central to our essence and I make no apology for stating that religion is important to me, my family and my friends.  I would be the last to suggest that anyone is considering reducing the amount of religious programming or damaging it but the point is that we should enshrine in legislation a specific practical commitment.</P>
        <P>I do not have the benefit of the eminent draftsmen who accompany the Minister and who have expertise in drafting legislation.  We admire and value their expertise which the House needs.  My phraseology refers to mandatory quotas but this could be tweaked.  I have no difficulty if the draftsmen can put it in better language.  We should accept the principle that our religious programming should continue, that there should be a quota of religious programming and that it should reflect people of all religious traditions and the value of religion to our people.  It is an essential part of our existence.</P>
        <P>Many of us decry the growth of secularism and an obsession with materialism that may have become pervasive in recent years.  That courtship may be coming to an end, tragically, but that <Col N="33"/>is a debate for another occasion.  Creeping secularism may be linked to a reduction of focus in volunteerism and such values.  We decry it because it exists up to a point but there is a mass of people who think otherwise and, in so far as that is becoming a phenomenon, it should be the last thing this House should endorse.  This House has a responsibility, prerogative and function to do the reverse and to halt the tide of secularism and materialism.  I ask the Minister to consider the quota system for religious programming to protect the quality of our broadcasting for future generations and for the sake of the rights of many people and the type of society that will evolve.  These people tend to be a silent majority and do not speak out or appear on a <i>vox populi</i>.  There are many people who are taxpayers, pensioners or other legitimate citizens who have contributed greatly to this country and who want religious programmes because it matters to them and they value it.</P>
        <P>If we did not personally believe in the merit of religion, which is not a contention I would assert about anyone, we would still have a legislative responsibility in this area.  It is of great importance and many people will be grateful if the Ministers does the big thing on this one.  As he noticed when he helpfully suggested considering two amendments on Report Stage, I responded positively because we are here to get the legislation right.  I will be equally accommodating if the Minister can suggest other ways of achieving this critical objective.  If I could anticipate the Minister&rsquo;s response, it might be that the aspiration exists and the objective and ambition is included in the legislation, but it should be expressed practically in the legislation.  Many people may not like to say it but they believe it firmly.  Someone must speak for them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for and commend him on an excellent suite of amendments which I am pleased to support.  As I said on Second Stage, when we talk about regulating the broadcasting sector and putting in place the necessary structures, we should give strong and intense regard to the common good.  We should recognise that we are privileged to have broadcasting facilities which are capable of doing much good in the public interest but they are also capable of being exploited for poor purposes.  An essential point is that broadcasting has great potential to build community.  That is why I speak in support of the amendments.</P>
        <P>It goes without saying the needs of people with disabilities should be to the fore and at the centre whenever we talk about the use of public resources and facilities, including broadcasting services.  Everybody here will know people with a hearing impairment, for whom the provision of subtitles makes a huge difference and the absence of which causes huge frustration and them to wonder if anybody ever takes their views or needs into account.  I am very happy to support the relevant amendment.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of mandatory Irish language programming.  We have had huge successes in the story of broadcasting in the Irish language in recent years.  TG4 should be commended for what it has achieved, not only for making programmes in the Irish language and adapting foreign programmes for transmission through Irish but also for getting the context right and adding other programming to the Irish broadcasting diet.  &ldquo;All-Ireland Gold&rdquo;, on which classic GAA matches are shown, is hugely popular.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I have met many people, particularly older people, although it is unfair to single out any one category, who find TG4 a very refreshing source of alternative programming.  However, that in no way takes from the validity of what Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has proposed, namely, the giving of a <Col N="34"/>guarantee that there will be a minimum number of high quality programmes tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios ag an saol gur theip ar an gc&oacute;ras oideachais thar na blianta sa chaoi inar m&uacute;ineadh an Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; na m&iacute;lte daoine sa t&iacute;r a bhfuil gr&aacute;in acu ar an Ghaeilge, faraoir.  M&aacute; iarrtar orthu c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach maith leo an teanga, deir siad go raibh m&uacute;inteoir uaf&aacute;sach acu.  Muna raibh an m&uacute;inteoir lochtach, chuir an chaoi inar m&uacute;ineadh an Ghaeilge i gcoinne na teanga iad.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar scoil sna 1980&iacute;, ba l&eacute;ir an difr&iacute;ocht idir mh&uacute;ineadh na Fraincise, n&oacute; m&uacute;ineadh teangacha eile na hEorpa, agus muineadh na Gaeilge.  Bh&iacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; iontacha agam, ach bh&iacute; an curaclam Gaeilge uaf&aacute;sach.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; bunaithe ar an litr&iacute;ocht amh&aacute;in.  N&iacute; raibh an litr&iacute;ocht sin d&iacute;rithe ar ghn&aacute;th-taith&iacute; na mic l&eacute;inn a bh&iacute; ar scoil ag an am.  T&aacute; an-dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta &oacute; shin, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in maidir leis an gcuraclam ach maidir leis na gaelscoileanna freisin.</P>
        <P>T&aacute; cursa&iacute; craolach&aacute;in r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach m&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun &aacute;r dteanga mionlach &mdash; an phr&iacute;omh theanga oifigi&uacute;il &mdash; a choth&uacute;.  Broadcasting services are a transmitter of culture and messages about many things.  If we are serious about promoting the Irish language, the one area in which we should do so is in broadcasting because such services reach many people.  Even where the school system might let them down, broadcasting services can set a standard.  I am sure others have mentioned Des Bishop&rsquo;s excellent intervention in the debate about the Irish language and the way it is taught and learned.</P>
        <P>Amendments I have tabled express my serious concern about the commercial exploitation of children and people generally, particularly through unscrupulous advertising and, on occasion, certain programming.  As has often been said, the test of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable members &mdash; the elderly and children &mdash; how it protects children from commercial exploitation and ensure the messages they receive about themselves and each other are positive or oriented towards the dignity of the human person.  I commend the Minister for expressing his concerns with regard to preventing inappropriate advertising of junk food products.  I go further in one of my amendments in which I suggest there should be a watershed &mdash; 9 p.m. &mdash; before which the advertising of alcohol should not be permitted.  That is also part of the protection of children from commercial exploitation and unscrupulous and damaging advertising.</P>
        <P>I refer to religious programming.  When I was in America a couple of weeks ago, I was struck by how it had got the balance wrong in the way religion was talked about and interacted with public life.  It is such a pity that is the case because the clear separation of church and state established by its founding fathers was not only about preventing the state from interfering in religious rights but also about protecting the rights of religious believers.  If one looks at the current and previous election cycles, on the one side certain individuals advocate political values on the basis that God is supposedly on their side, while on the other, there is an unhealthy reaction when politicians who are unscrupulous about the moral and social values associated with religion nonetheless feel the need to promote their Christian credentials and distribute leaflets in which they describe themselves as Christian leaders and so on.  That is not a healthy articulation of religious beliefs in the public square.</P>
        <P>We have the opportunity to set a standard because the Constitution, although amended, has always got the balance right.  The preamble to it acknowledges that for the majority, deeper religious values are significant in understanding the meaning of life and the direction a civilised society should take.  However, at the same time, it creates space for individual conscience, particularly in the amendments adopted in the early 1970s which establish clearly that people are free to pursue their own personal search about the meaning and purpose of life.  The Constitution still honours religion.  It must do so because it is essential to the human experience to search for meaning.  What the great religions of the world do is offer an explanation and an <Col N="35"/>analysis of what life is all about.  A few years ago I was struck by what the Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, a Jesuit, said when retiring.  He said the big chasm in the world &mdash; as I am paraphrasing what he said in Italian, I hope Members will be tolerant &mdash; was not between those who did and did not believe but between those who were and were not thinking.  That was a mouthful because he was emphasising the need for curiosity about life and its meaning.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that during the years church leaders in Ireland have perhaps been too successful as lobbyists.  However, we have seen a backlash which has resulted in some in our society, including sometimes at a very high level of policy-making or opinion formation, being afraid to even engage in moral discourse.  That is regrettable because in the Christian experience, in particular, there is huge respect not only for faith but also for reason; in other words, what authentic religion is doing and what should be facilitated by broadcasters is encouraging curiosity about how, in the words of the ancient Greeks, the good life is to be lived.</P>
        <P>I freely acknowledge the faults, failings and scandals of the officer class and ordinary foot soldiers like myself of the great religions.  What religion &mdash; properly understood and practised &mdash; does is that it seeks to bring out the best in people on the basis that there is a purpose to life.  That is what all the great religions have in common.  Therefore, we should not confine religion to the private square.</P>
        <P>We should not allow ourselves to think there is no place for religious discourse in broadcasting.  Religion and philosophy are the stuff of life.  We need to ensure our broadcaster respects them.  I do not think that is the case at the moment.  If one compares the amount of time RTE devotes to arts programming to the amount of time it devotes to theological and philosophical inquiry, one will fairly conclude that there is a certain reluctance on the part of RTE to facilitate large-scale religious discourse.  I listened to an excellent review of Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo; on an arts programme a few years ago.  Although I studied that play in English and in French as an undergraduate, I am none the wiser.</P>

	<P>Perhaps that reveals me to be something of a philistine.  I would rather have eaten it than read it a third time.</P>
        <P>Arts programming appeals to a small section of the community.  It is right and proper that public service broadcasting should deal with the highbrow stuff.  As I have said in another forum in respect of this Bill, it is great that we have Lyric FM, which caters for a relatively small number of people &mdash; myself included &mdash; with particular tastes.  That is what public service broadcasting is all about.  It must also facilitate the search for the meaning and purpose of life, however.  That search, which is not just a matter for consideration by Catholics and other Christians, has to be honoured.  That is why the Government is to be commended for its establishment of a structured dialogue between the great religious communities and other organisations, such as humanist groups, etc., which are also engaged in the search for meaning.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister is as aware as I am of Viktor Frankl&rsquo;s great book, <i>Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning</i>, in which the author, a Holocaust survivor, reflects on why some prisoners in concentration camps acted like barbarians and some guards in the camps had an admirable nobility of spirit.  Mr. Frankl came to the conclusion that one&rsquo;s behaviour in such circumstances depends on one&rsquo;s sense of the meaning and purpose of life.  While some people who find such meaning and purpose outside of religion and live wonderful, noble and wholesome lives, religion brings out the best in many people.  Depending on the tradition one cares to discuss, one can refer to people like Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>I apologise for speaking for longer than I should have.  I commend Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for these amendments.  I assure the Minister that they are worthy of favourable consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his earlier comments on some of the amendments before the House.  I look forward to the further development of his thoughts on Report Stage.  I agree with the remarks of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Mullen on amendment No. 16.  I agree that we need to use the national broadcast service &mdash; our television and radio channels &mdash; for the maximum good.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly argued convincingly that religion is important for the vast majority of people in this country, contrary to the results of the glib surveys about religious practice and attendance we see from time to time.  Religion plays a significant role in the lives of many people on a weekly basis, not just a few days per annum.  It is not a question of responding to that market, or catering for it.  We should try to ensure that our broadcasting service recognises that the majority of people in this country are interested in religious affairs and responds to their needs.  I remember an RTE religious affairs series called &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo;, which was broadcast many years ago.  Many fine religion-based programmes, such as &ldquo;Would You Believe&rdquo; have been made in recent times.  They foster a broad interpretation of life.  We should encourage the production and broadcast of such programmes.</P>
        <P>We spoke earlier about the need for this Bill to provide for an Irish language subtitling service.  Similarly, this legislation should make a statement about what is important and desirable in respect of religion.  We should set out what we feel is good for the body politic and for the country as a whole.  We should set aside space on our airwaves for a certain amount for religious broadcasting.  That will be very helpful and positive in the long run.  I accept that dedicated religious channels are available to many people, given that most households, in this era of Sky Television and digital broadcasting, have access to some type of multichannel television.  It is important that we use this legislation, which pertains specifically to Ireland, to ensure that this country&rsquo;s television services reflect the deep interest in religion of many Irish people.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the only debate we have had about the link between religion and television or radio has related to the broadcasting of the Angelus.  A minority of people have called for the broadcasting of the Angelus to be discontinued.  I will not comment on the significance of the minority of people in question, other than to say that I disagree with their analysis.  The broadcasting of the Angelus is not a sectarian statement &mdash; it is simply a call to reflection.  That is positive.  The main religious symbol that was associated with the RTE of long ago was St. Brigid&rsquo;s cross.  The cross was used as an emblem of the station when its television broadcasts started each morning or afternoon.  I think the use of the cross has disappeared.  We can live with that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has outlined a modest and realistic proposal, which is a closer reflection of the thoughts of many people in society than the presentations of some critics.  While most people in this country would not describe themselves as particularly religious &mdash; they are not the best Christians or Catholics &mdash; they try to live positive lives and are happy to participate, to a greater or lesser degree, in religious practices.  I would like that to be recognised in this legislation.  We have an opportunity to do so.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the comments of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Mullen, who made the case for this proposal in a spirit of inclusiveness and tolerance more cogently and convincingly than I have.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the purpose of this amendment.</P>

        <P>I support in large measure the comments of Opposition Senators about the promotion of the Irish language through our broadcasting services.  TG4 has made a tremendous contribution in that regard.  I am not as impressed by those who are fl&uacute;irseach sa Ghaeilge as I am by those whose Irish is rusty but use the language anyway, perhaps in a bilingual context.  I regretted the demise of Liam &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trom agus &Eacute;adrom&rdquo;, which did tremendously well.  I wonder whether a programme of that nature could be broadcast on Friday evenings instead of &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, which has probably overrun its time.  It does not have the vibrancy it had in the past.  It tends to get involved in controversial issues to keep its ratings up.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting bilingual programme at peak viewing times would go an enormous way towards promoting the language.  I am not sure I would necessarily support that this be mandatory.  I believe we should be encouraging other television channels to produce bilingual programmes.  Anything the Minister can do by way of incorporating this into the Bill would be good.</P>
        <P>I concur also with Senator Mullen in respect of the religious content of programmes.  We are a society afflicted with godlessness.  Human beings are, in essence, spiritual beings seeking the meaning of life and so on.  We hear much about the high rate of suicide in our society.  There are, of course, a myriad of reasons for this, including understanding the meaning of life.</P>
        <P>Our broadcast media in particular can be an important conduit in injecting a balance of views across society so that we are not constantly bombarded with materialism which is an essential part of broadcasting not alone in terms of advertising but in terms of lobbying.  The Bill, which is good, provides us with opportunities to address issues that are essential to the well-being of society.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and in particular Senator Mullen for his Italian and French translations.  On his Italian comments which come I understand from Cardinal Martini, I too would like to see programming which encourages thinking, creativity, curiosity and wonder.  However, I do not believe this is achieved by mandatory quotas.  I disagree with the proposal in this regard as contained in amendment No. 16 and earlier amendments.</P>
        <P>Section 114(3)(<i>a</i>) sets out that RTE must provide a comprehensive range of programmes in the Irish and English languages that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and include programmes that entertain, inform and educate, provide coverage of sporting, religious and cultural activities and cater for the expectations of communities with special or minority interests and which in every case respect human dignity.  I believe this provides direction for any programme maker that fulfils his or her criteria of supporting thinking programming.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 33, subsection (1), lines 5 to 17, to delete paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) prepare a strategy for the provision of broadcasting services in the State additional to those provided by RT&Eacute;, TG4, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel, the Irish Film Channel, and the Heritage Channel,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) prepare a strategy statement under section 29(1),</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>c</i>) direct the Contract Awards Committee to make arrangements, in accordance with this Act, to invite, consider and recommend to the Authority, and the Authority shall follow such recommendation, proposals for the provision of broadcasting services additional to any broadcasting services provided by RT&Eacute;, TG4, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel, the Irish Film Channel and the Heritage Channel under this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments relate almost exclusively to my proposal that the Bill provide not only for RTE, TG4, a new Houses of the Oireachtas channel and an Irish film channel but also for a heritage channel.  This is the effect of amendment No. 17.  Many people are not served to the extent they might be by current broadcasting schedules.  Lyric FM is a good example of a radio station that caters to the need of a particular segment of the market through high quality programming paid for by the taxpayer.  The proposed Houses of the Oireachtas channel will, I hope, facilitate greater public awareness of the business of our national Parliament but it would be naive to suggest it will enjoy prime time ratings.  It will attract the interest of people who follow more closely than others the business of politics on a day to day basis and it would also be good if, in addition to the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas and its committees, attention was paid to activities in county council chambers and so on.  The Irish film channel proposed by the Government is welcome.  Such a channel would fill a gap in the current schedule by bringing to public attention the achievements of Irish film makers and our great cultural heritage in this area.</P>
        <P>However, all these channels will appeal to relatively small numbers of people.  The heritage channel I propose will fill a gap in public service provision in television.  I think, in particular but not exclusively, of older people.  More than 25,000 people are in nursing homes.  I stress I am only using one group as an example and I do not claim my proposal addresses the needs of all older persons.  Television is an important daily companion to older people in nursing homes and elsewhere around the country and they spend a disproportionate time watching programmes.  I have often had the experience of visiting nursing homes where people watch programmes they like but at 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. the channel is changed and they are subjected to &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo; or another programme with violent scenes, which are not appropriate to family friendly viewing.  I do not say some people would not choose of their own accord to watch &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo; or &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; and so on but many others watch television without necessarily choosing the channels they view.  In addition, I refer to the Irish abroad and tourists in the context of my proposal.</P>
        <P>Many subsections of society could benefit from a heritage channel, which would take into account the needs of people across the generations.  Its programming should always be suitable for people of all ages and it should celebrate the best of our culture, which would appeal to an <Col N="40"/>older age group.  The content should include traditional music, sport and programming currently provided by TG4. It should draw on RTE&rsquo;s extensive archive of documentary and cultural programming while focusing on chat shows, light entertainment and reminiscence.  Similar programming can be found on several channels currently but they only hit it in spots.  What about people who watch television for a large portion of the day?</P>
        <P>The heritage channel would bring out the best of our culture in terms of entertainment, music and chat shows.  The popularity of the History Channel highlights the appetite for quality programming in this area.  Many people would like to watch programmes stored in the RTE archive.  I met a journalist yesterday who said he would watch a heritage channel.  I said it might broadcast &ldquo;All Creatures Great and Small&rdquo; more often and he said, &ldquo;Then I would definitely watch it&rdquo;.  We can take on a trendy mentality and found a channel for Irish film, which is wonderful, but we should think about the needs of a wider section of our community, which is less vocal.  I include older people in general and persons in nursing homes.</P>
        <P>I have tabled other amendments that propose a minimum level of content aimed at the interests and tastes of person aged over 65.  However, the heritage channel should be friendly to viewers of different ages and take into account traditional music and culture while drawing on RTE&rsquo;s extensive archive and making programmes oriented towards people of limited mobility.  The channel should be free of the exploitative advertising that sometimes accompanies day time programme, which plays on people&rsquo;s insecurities and appeals to their fears and so on.  I hope my proposal commends itself to the Minister of the State.  If we are to consider providing niche products such as the Houses of the Oireachtas channel and the Irish film channel, we should acknowledge the large number of people who are disproportionately high users of television and whose needs do not receive much attention.  That is the thrust of my proposals.  Older persons in nursing homes should not be stuck with &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo;.  A channel should be accessible at any time of the day that one would be happy to have one&rsquo;s loved ones watching.  It should provide television that educates, informs and entertains, as Lord Reith, found director general of the BBC, said.</P>
        <P>I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to address the need for a heritage radio channel because many elderly people also rely greatly on the radio.  I have turned the radio on for a loved one when a nice programme was being broadcast but found myself wondering what the hell they would have to listen to two or three hours later and whether they would be able to switch the channel.  It is almost glib to say that but it is the reality for many people.  It is not where one would start when considering the provision of services for older persons.  It must be recognised that many older people are active and they should be encouraged and supported but we have the opportunity to address the needs of a large section of the community in my proposal.</P>
        <P>These amendments hinge on amendment No. 106, which provides that RTE shall establish the heritage channel whose principal purpose will be programming material relating to our heritage and culture.  That will be a matter for programme makers but I hope it would not exclude programming targeted, for example, at older persons who might benefit from medical advice and various motivational activities.  The amendment also provides that RTE may enter into contracts to establish and maintain the channel and it provides for the exclusion of advertisements and materials that would constitute a direct offer to the public.  This is an opportunity for us to put a large number of people who are less vocal than other sections in society at the centre of our public broadcasting remit.  Were this amendment accepted, the other four amendments would make the necessary changes to other sections to include the heritage channel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this series of amendments in principle, as I would have supported the previous amendment about religious broadcasting, but I simply do not like mandatory quotas because they tend to get filled up with pap if one has a requirement for a particular percentage.</P>
        <P>I am slightly surprised that the amendment survived because it seemed that if it were to work, as I hope it does, it might create a charge on the Exchequer.  I know the Department of Finance is very finicky in managing to excise from the Seanad anything that might have the slightest appearance of causing a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>It is a very good and well-conceived amendment.  We are all aware of the number of bought-in programmes, especially from the US, which are televisual pap and fillers.  It is not just RTE which does this.  If one looks at the schedules of Channel 4, which was a very advanced station in its day, one sees all these competitions, game shows and programmes about moving house and buying places in the sun.  They are not of any great content and I am amazed they get viewers but, clearly, they must.</P>
        <P>We have some very good stations, one of the best of which is TG4, which is a descendant of the station created by Deputy Michael D. Higgins when he was Minister in a move similar to that suggested by Senator Mullen.  The latter is correct not to limit it just to the examples he gave.  There certainly are large numbers of elderly people, including people in nursing homes, a fair proportion of whom do not seem to notice very much of what is on, although there will be some who do.  It is mind-numbing if they are forced to watch these bought-in game shows all the time.</P>
        <P>Many others would welcome a civilised heritage channel.  During the vote, I asked Senator Mullen what this kind of heritage channel might be.  I have criticised American programmes but the US has some very good public broadcasting channels, for example, the Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, and Home Box Office, HBO.  They show classics of both British, American and perhaps even Irish drama.  They show Jane Austen and things like &ldquo;Moby Dick&rdquo;.  That would be very welcome.</P>
        <P>We need to make it quite clear that if this does get off the ground, as I hope it may, it will not just be so-called &ldquo;diddley-aye&rdquo; music and that we will not define Irish culture in these narrow terms.  I am sometimes quite shocked at the way in which Irish culture is defined.  A friend of mine from abroad has repeatedly said to me, when I complain about drinking and vomiting on the streets, that it is part of our culture.  It is not as far as I am concerned.</P>
        <P>We have things of which we can be very proud, such as the films of George Morrison which rarely get an airing.  We have some very capable and creative people.  There are programmes on architectural heritage going back to the beehive oratories, ranging through the great monastic buildings and cathedrals and taking in remarkable Georgian architecture.  For example, we only have to look at the ceiling of this Chamber which is a masterpiece of 18th century craftsmanship by the stuccodore, Michael Stapleton.  Perhaps some programmes could be broadcast on that.</P>
        <P>How will this station be financed?  If this proposal goes ahead, we need to be clear about the way in which it will be financed and how it will get its budget.  I am very pleased to support it.  I am satisfied that the definition of culture that has been suggested in contributions in the debate is wider than what I, perhaps unfairly, dismissed as &ldquo;diddley-aye&rdquo; music because there is some such music which is very good.  There is also some very good jazz music and some remarkable Irish jazz musicians.  If the definition of culture is to be fairly broad, I am very pleased that we should have a heritage channel.  If it is handled in the same way as TG4, it could be very much to the benefit of people and give enjoyment to a fairly wide range of people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s worthy amendment because the concept of a heritage channel is a good one.  I said on Second Stage that I am a complete believer in and enthusiastic advocate for the film channel and the Oireachtas channel.  The former has considerable potential.  I will move an amendment about the financing of this to which we will come later.  It has immense potential to uplift and improve all our lives.  It will bring quality films.  Many people have a specific niche interest in certain films which will be available on that channel.  It is a wonderful and excellent development and I am all for it.</P>
        <P>Similarly, I am all in favour of the Oireachtas channel.  We have worked very hard today on this broadcasting legislation.  We have heard many superb contributions and have had a very real engagement with it.  This, along with D&aacute;il proceedings, should be available for the electorate to see on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>In welcoming the Minister of State to the House, I repeat what I said on Second Stage and to the Minister on Committee Stage.  Over time and in a selective fashion, local authority proceedings should be broadcast on an ongoing basis on the Oireachtas channel in addition to the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas because wonderful front-line democratic work is done in our local authorities.</P>
        <P>The concept of a heritage channel is a very good one.  I accept the point, which was well made by Senator Norris, that we do not need to have a narrow interpretation of heritage.  Peig Sayers and Gaelic stories are a significant part of our heritage, of which we are very proud.  Similarly, we must have a more eclectic and global perspective on it.  I have no difficulty accepting the qualification by Senator Norris that heritage is not for narrow definition.  It is a wonderful opportunity to show archival material, programmes such as &ldquo;Reeling In the Years&rdquo;, excellent programmes from the past with which older people might identify and would like to see again, and re-runs of a range of current affairs programmes, especially &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;, at certain times to facilitate other audiences.  There is a wide range of elements to our heritage, including jazz and the full range of music and cinema.  Our people are more educated now and we have a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society.  That would all have to gain expression in a heritage channel.  The cultures of immigrants are as worthy of expression as any others.</P><Col N="43"/>
      
        <P>The concept is a good one and Senator Mullen is to be commended for proposing this initiative.  Although I am not an expert, it occurs to me that this is something that could be run relatively cheaply in that a lot of material would be already available and the amount of new programming required need not be prohibitively large.  I also see no reason advertising, with proper control in terms of amount and content, could not be a feature of such a channel to defray some of the costs.  As proposed by Senator Mullen, the channel need not be prohibitively expensive and the potential for advertising should be considered.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Although I do not believe Senator Mullen is arguing to the contrary, a point arose at our group discussions on this amendment earlier today that is worth mentioning.  We must ensure that this channel in no way suggests that we would not still need a good quantity of programming in mainstream media that is aimed at older people, reflecting their interests and ambitions.  We would not like to syphon all such programming off to a separate station<i> per se</i>, and I hope Senator Mullen will accept that on the record, as some of my colleagues were concerned about that issue.  We must ensure that quality broadcasting for older persons remains in the mainstream media but a heritage channel, as such, is an interesting and worthwhile objective.  Such a channel need not necessarily be the preserve of older persons.  While it may be of particular relevance to some of them, there is no reason it could not have a broad appeal.  It could be of particular interest to those arriving here, whether on holidays or to live, enabling them to get a flavour of the country.  Were I to go to live in another country tomorrow, such a channel would be of enormous help at the beginning.  It would be of great benefit in terms of getting a sense of a place, its culture and its heritage.</P>
        <P>In terms of cost, efficacy and the potential for development, the notion of a heritage channel is a good one which we should embrace, but its development must be somewhat incremental.  The Minister may argue that there is an initial prohibition in terms of cost but that could be addressed with advertising.  He should consider an incremental building up of the channel.  We can negotiate those kinds of details but we should accept the principle.  I commend Senator Mullen for the idea, which merits further discussion.  I could say a lot more, but in deference to my colleagues, I will desist.  The channel is worthy of support and is an exciting proposition.  The Senator is to be warmly congratulated on it.</P>

        <P>Undoubtedly, television in particular &mdash; and radio to a lesser extent &mdash; is a very influential medium.  It moulds, to a great degree, public opinion on a broad range of issues.  Often it does so for the good, but sometimes the converse is true.  There are many good programmes on television and TG4 in particular has been an excellent addition to the television landscape here.  BBC 2 also broadcasts a lot of very good documentaries.  However, one must say that many programmes on television are rubbish.  Many are canned, made very cheaply and are promotional more than anything else.</P>
        <P>We must safeguard balance in the media.  It is somewhat like eating &mdash; one must have a balanced diet to be healthy.  It is the same with what one consumes from the media.  It is important, as Senators Norris and Mullen pointed out, that we try to maintain quality.  If one examines what is broadcast, particularly in the off-peak hours, one can see a problem.  I believe &ldquo;Dr. Phil&rdquo;, for example, is on RTE during the day, an American import.  I pick that as one example, but there are many others.  If one was a retired person looking for a bit of diversion during the day and one tuned into some of these programmes, it would not be long before one would go mad or wish that one was dead.  Certainly one would not see great potential in one&rsquo;s <Col N="44"/>retirement.  We need, as part of this Bill, to ensure that the diet that is available to people is of a higher quality than is currently the case.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I very much welcome the Oireachtas channel and, in particular, I welcome the fact that it will include local authorities.  That is a very significant development.  Many Senators were long-serving members of local authorities.  I remember a situation where a delegation from Newtownards, including members of the DUP and the UUP, addressed Wexford County Council on a range of issues.  Wexford county councillors reciprocated with a visit to Newtownards.  Similar events took place with other councils, including Belfast City Council.  At that time, the cross-fertilisation of ideas and the understanding generated was fairly significant in the overall political context of the island.  If such meetings had wider dissemination, their beneficial influence would have been multiplied.  It is a pity we did not have more of that.  I hope the Oireachtas channel will be given the necessary resources so that it is effective and is not just the broadcasting of council meetings or sittings of the Houses of the Oireachtas but also includes some follow-up connection with the politicians and public who are affected by decisions that are made.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should consider the option of developing regional television programmes.  In fairness to RTE, it makes some efforts in this regard, but they are mostly token in nature.  Local radio has the highest cumulative listenership in the country and produces a lot of very interesting programmes.  While I know there would be a cost involved, I would like to see us embarking on such a venture.  Perhaps the Oireachtas channel, with the issues that are thrown up, could be a conduit for addressing the deficit that exists at present in our broadcasting system.</P>
        <P>The heritage channel is a good idea.  I said on Second Stage that I see no reason we could not have a GAA channel, which could be part of a heritage channel, given that Gaelic games are very much part of what we are as a people.  There is tremendous interest in our national games.  A few nights ago I tuned into UTV and watched an early premiership game from last season.  It was a game I had not seen and I enjoyed it.  Celtic Football Club has a great archive of films going back to the 1960s and 1970s, the good years for the team.  We have a great history of sport in this country and a tremendous interest in it.  Whether it is exclusively a GAA channel or a broader sports channel, there is a great opportunity in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I voted against amendment No. 16 out of party loyalty and because I was opposed to its mandatory nature but I did agree with the general sentiments of the amendment.  Religion is a benefit to society and needs to be presented more.  The former bishop of Ferns, Brendan Comiskey, established a Christian media trust for the broadcasting of religious programmes on South East Radio.  All the Christian religions broadcast several programmes which often are peripheral to religion but related to society and are interesting.  The national broadcaster should be obliged to provide a similar service.  The Bill provides an opportunity to enhance our broadcasting system and provide a healthier and interesting broadcasting choice to the public.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment, given his speech on the broad definition of culture.  Considering the direction in which television is moving, now is the golden opportunity to reflect on the excellent programming of RTE.  We have a rich and proud heritage of excellent programming.  The old programmes of &ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Pictorial Weekly&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and the early Radio &Eacute;ireann programmes on music have been locked away, never to be seen again.  We should consider establishing a heritage channel, particularly with the success of UK TV Gold and TG4 with the all-Ireland championship gold series.</P>
        <P>The channel could be used to rekindle the idea of what Ireland used to be like.  We have lost the sense of what it means to be Irish in the direction taken by television.  The proposed <Col N="45"/>heritage channel, like TG4, would be of absolute importance in regaining that sense.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;.  All who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s would like to reminisce on that era and see how we have changed.</P>
        <P>We are a nation rich in culture, music, language and religion.  I agree with Senator Mullen on some of the programmes we import from foreign television stations.  If we had the choice, we would not watch them.</P>
        <P>A heritage channel would also promote Ireland.  Some of the best advertisements on television now are those promoting tourism in different regions.  We should be parochial on this matter.  I support the regionalisation of Irish television broadcasting to highlight what is happening in the regions.  One of the biggest mistakes the Government made was the abolition of RTE Radio Cork in the late 1990s.  It was a calamity for the city of Cork.</P>
        <P>Lyric FM, Beat FM and Red FM have specific target audiences and have created niche markets which should be the same model for the proposed heritage channel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen is happy with the support he has received for this amendment.  However, all good things must come to an end.  He referred to how we tend to forget people in nursing homes.  My one criticism is that those in nursing homes do not have enough stimulation and become bored which affects their health.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to the various television and radio programmes they enjoy.  The other day I heard a radio interview with Jimmy Magee shortly after he buried his son.  For anyone coping with a serious illness or had just lost a loved one, the interview would have given them tremendous hope.  I thank Rachel English and Jimmy Magee for that worthwhile and uplifting interview.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes the establishment of a heritage channel by RTE to be used solely for programming relating to Irish heritage and culture.  Sections 114 and 118 set out the objectives of RTE and TG4, respectively, and requires them to provide for programming relating to Irish heritage and culture.  They are required to be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community.  The programmes must reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, having special regard to the elements which distinguish that culture, and for the Irish language.  They are required to provide a comprehensive range of programming in the Irish and English languages which reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island.  They are to include programmes which entertain, inform and educate and provide coverage of sporting, religious and cultural activities, facilitate or assist contemporary cultural expression.</P>
        <P>Section 114 provides that RTE shall establish and maintain orchestras, choirs and other cultural performing groups.  RTE shall also establish and maintain archives and libraries.  A broadcasting funding scheme is provided for in section 153 for the funding of programmes on Irish culture, heritage and history, folklore, the natural environment, folk, rural and the<?oasys _jy ?>vernacular heritage, the arts, the Irish language and the Irish experience abroad.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as drafted, provides for the development of sufficient programming related to Irish heritage and culture.  RTE is allowed to establish new channels, subject to ministerial approval and the availability of funding.  The Bill provides for the establishment of an Irish film channel.  It was proposed by the Irish Film Board which will have to provide its funding.  No case has been made by a public body for a heritage channel.</P><Col N="46"/>
        <P>It is anticipated the Houses of the Oireachtas channel will be allowed to show coverage of local authority meetings.  The proceedings of meetings of a number of local authorities are already broadcast via their own websites.  The Bill provides that meetings of local authorities may be included as part of the output of the Oireachtas channel and this would be welcomed by us all.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Jim Walsh from Wexford referred to Wexford&rsquo;s biggest win in Croke Park in a long time and he is in favour of a GAA channel.  I suppose this is understandable and we will excuse him on this occasion.  I cannot accept the amendments as tabled by Senator Mullen even though I have a lot of sympathy for the strong case made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>I refer to Government amendment No. 18 which is a minor drafting amendment, necessary to improve the clarity of the text of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the speakers for their support of my now, sadly, doomed proposed amendment.  I am disappointed there are no words of comfort from the Minister of State.  I had hoped that at the very least this matter would be considered and it is not too late for him to change his mind, in my view.  The main argument put forward by the Minister of State was that since RTE had not proposed it, nor suggested it wanted it, the Government did not see fit to go ahead with it.  This fails to take account of our duty as legislators, which is to legislate for the common good and in the public interest and having regard to the things we know are needed by our constituents and the public.  That RTE has not yet come up with the bright idea of a heritage channel is not something we should celebrate nor does it justify inaction on our part.  That this is an idea, the time for which has come, was highlighted in the comments of Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Norris, Walsh and Buttimer.  I thank those Senators for supporting these amendments and particularly the amendment providing for the heritage channel.  I thank them also for their very kind words.  </P>
        <P>Other amendments which I have tabled take account of the fact that more than 10% of the population, at least, is over 65 years of age.  With due respect to the Minister of State, and I know he has a job to do, I did not hear anything to reassure me that more account will be taken of the needs of that section of our population than is the case at present.  I stress that the idea of the heritage channel is not aimed just at those over 65.  In that context, I welcome Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s contribution and reassure him that what I had in mind would not only provide for a heritage channel that would be of interest to the Irish abroad, to tourists and to older people whose current needs are not being met by what is on offer in public broadcasting &mdash; one would not wish to see a ghettoisation &mdash; but it would also mean greater recognition of the needs and tastes of older people in society in the content of the other channels, as their numbers demand no less.</P>
        <P>I will press this amendment to a vote.  I had hoped that at the very least the Government would give this further consideration and come back on Report Stage with a more definitive and hopefully more positive response.  I thank my colleagues for their support. This issue will not go away. The idea was warmly received by interested parties.  I hope the Government will see fit to bring forward an initiative in this area at some stage, and sooner rather than later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comments about the Wexford football win.  I am sure he meant that the victory of a football team which comes from a ten point deficit with 20 minutes to go deserves to be preserved for posterity.  One way of doing this would be to establish either a sports or a heritage channel.  </P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>There is merit in what has been said although I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s point of view.  In his Second Stage contribution, Senator Doherty made an interesting point about an <Col N="47"/>educational channel.  It would be a pity to limit the remit of public broadcasting.  There is a difference between mandating that something be done and setting out an aspirational objective.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this option between now and Report Stage.  There is unanimity in thinking among Senators on this matter.  I suggest that it be considered by the Minister of State and his officials in the meantime.  A very compelling point was made.  The percentage of the population over 65 is increasing and we should gear our policies, including those on broadcasting, to take account of the changing demographic situation.</P>

	<P>I wish to add to what Senator Walsh has said.  I listened carefully to the debate.  I had to attend a committee meeting and was not present for all of the debate.  Senator Mullen made a very strong case and the words of support from other Senators show the strength of that support.  His amendment is worthy of consideration.  Senator Mullen said he feels obliged to put this amendment to a vote if he does not get some words of comfort or support from the Minister of State.  I urge the Minister of State to agree to consider the amendment.  Various speakers made new and novel suggestions and they expressed inventive and innovative thoughts.  The need for such a channel was not acknowledged until Senator Mullen put down this amendment.  I urge the Minister of State to give it some consideration between now and Report Stage.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  I made the point that there is a lot of merit in what Senator Mullen proposes and I note the support he has received.  I do not disagree entirely with the content of the argument.  </P>
        <P>We discussed this proposal in some detail previously and it was the general view that the Bill as drafted provided for the development of sufficient programming relating to Irish heritage without having to include in it a special channel dealing with Irish heritage.  The second point is there is nothing to stop RTE from proposing a heritage channel.  For the first time, this Bill allows for RTE to establish channels if it sees fit.  The Bill gives certain powers to the joint Oireachtas committees and they will be in a much stronger position.  I will reflect on what has been said but I will not give the Senator any promise that I will return on Report Stage with something different.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  I cannot give the Senator any guarantee that we will change anything but I see merit in the points he has made.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
        <P LI="2">In page 41, subsection (5), line 15, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not later than 30th April each year&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">I wish to explain the background to this amendment.  Section 37(5) states:</P>
        <P LI="2">A copy of the accounts referred to in <i>subsection (4) </i>and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon shall, immediately after the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General, be presented to the members of the Authority and to the Minister as soon as practicable and the Minister shall cause a copy of these documents to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am suggesting that we add the words &ldquo;not later than 30th April each year&rdquo;.  When I was first elected to the House some 15 years ago, I realised that many reports which had been audited and passed by various authorities were handed to the Minister of the day who sometimes sat on them.  When I was chairman of An Post, I said we should set an example of promptness in order that semi-State bodies would have standards equal to the best standards in the private sector.  We discovered that a number of Ministers did not use the necessary alacrity to reach that sort of level.  In other words, on many occasions State-sponsored bodies might have accounts audited, finished, approved and passed on to the Minister who then sat on them.  I am obviously not referring to the current Minister, but I am talking about future Ministers.  Since it has become commonplace, I have tabled such amendments for practically every State body.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there will be no delay in laying accounts before the Oireachtas and that the Department will not be allowed to sit on them.  The pro<Col N="49"/>vision is now standard in new legislation.  In addition, it has been provided for in many Bills that have come though the House in the past ten years since I have sought this provision.  I inserted the date of 30 April, but I am not insisting on that particular date.  Where I have previously sought a provision for laying accounts or reports before the Oireachtas within three months, the Minister has usually accepted a delay within six months of the end of the year.  On that basis therefore I am not tied to 30 April, but I believe the proposal is necessary.  As regards current and future Ministers, it will ensure we have standards in State-sponsored bodies that are equal to if not better than those in the private sector.  The amendment would ensure the Oireachtas could see the accounts concerned within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
        <P>On one occasion in January about ten years ago, I sought the RTE accounts &mdash; not for the previous year, but for the one before that &mdash; which had not yet been published by the Minister.  I have experienced such difficulties with Ministers of the day sometimes sitting on accounts and not passing them.  I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this matter.  I would happily accept that if what I am trying to achieve is recognised and approved, the date of 30 April does not necessarily have to be adhered to.  The board must hand over the accounts to the Minister by 30 March, which would give the Minister one month to approve them.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>While I fully appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s concerns in respect of this amendment, I cannot guarantee with certainty when the Comptroller and Auditor General will complete his audit in any given year.  As a consequence, no date is specified for submission of the accounts and the audit report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, section 37(5) specifies that the accounts and the report of the authority must be presented to the Minister as soon as practicable after the audit, at which point they will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  As such, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I have listened attentively to what Senator Quinn has said.  I appreciate the businesslike approach he tries to bring to bear on proceedings in the House, but we have a handicap or hurdle that normal business does not encounter.  In asking the Senator to take that on board, perhaps he will understand why I am not in a position to accept the proposed amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed to hear the Minister of State stating a definite &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Had he said that 30 April is too soon, but proposed another month to 31 May, I could understand it.  Banks currently have the technology to publish their accounts within hours of the end of a financial year. It is not, therefore, impossible for companies and other organisations to publish their accounts in a timely manner.  I know we must go through the Comptroller and Auditor General, which takes a longer, but the Bill provides that it must be done.  &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; is a very vague term and I was trying to set a standard for State bodies that would be equal to, or even surpass, standards elsewhere.  The date of 30 April is not fixed.  Many Bills that came before the House in the past ten years stipulated a term of six months from the end of the financial year.  The amendment does not seek to encourage the board itself to finalise its accounts, because that will be done; it is to ensure the Minister of the day does not sit on them after receiving them.  I urge the Minister of State therefore to consider the matter seriously.  An alternative wording may be possible and I hope he will consider that between now and Report Stage. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a lot of sympathy with the point Senator Quinn has raised.  I have seen local authority accounts covering two or three years being audited together, which is appalling for many reasons.  I am sure the Minister of State is also aware of this.  I have seen bad practices slip in whereby executives and councillors were unaware of accumulated losses <Col N="50"/>because they were receiving historic information.  No business can function on that basis today.  Where we require the private sector to meet statutory deadlines, generally speaking, there is no compelling reason the State sector should not have the same discipline and be as efficient.  We should seek to inject that practice into the public service system.  In the absence of such practices, costs will not be properly controlled and the necessary information will not be available to run bodies in a businesslike way and to put in place remedies at the appropriate times.  The date proposed by the Senator may well be too narrow, but deadlines should be set to which people must conform.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff are not in a position to meet such deadlines, there is no reason local authorities and other bodies cannot be audited by private sector auditors who have their own code of practice, disciplines and responsibilities.  They subsequently may be in a position to report to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the latter&rsquo;s office can refer to the issues involved.  It is a matter for the Department of Finance, but it should be examined.  With reduced income levels in the coming years, we will have to focus on cost overruns, efficiencies and effectiveness within the system.  I make those points in support of the general principle put forward by Senator Quinn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with much of what the two Senators have said.  It is important for us to approach any legislation in a businesslike manner.  When we make demands of the private or public sectors, it is also important for us to set an example and to provide a lead.   However, given the large number of accounts the Comptroller and Auditor General must audit each year, it cannot be said with any great certainty when a particular audit will be done.</P>
        <P>I will discuss with the Minister the possibility of inserting a less specific provision than that proposed by Senator Quinn with a view to working towards a particular date.</P>
      </Speaker>

        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 22, 82 and 90 are related to the amendments we discussed in the context of establishing a heritage channel insofar as they concern the needs and interests of the section of the community the channel would seek to cater for, namely, older people.  Elsewhere the Bill correctly emphasises the need to have regard to children and the nature and quantity of programming aimed at children.  This is an important element of the legislation.</P><Col N="51"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>If the Bill is to satisfy the requirement of serving the public interest in a consistent manner, we must have regard to the fact that more than 10% of the population are older than 65 years.  As Senator Jim Walsh noted, the number of older people is set to increase further.  We correctly seek to ensure older people are not discriminated against in any way and encourage their greater participation in society.  In the area of voting, older people set an example because they have a developed interest in political life and are civically aware, as reflected in the high proportion of their number who take part in elections and referendums.</P>
        <P>In the context of a changing international economic environment and ongoing demographic change everyone is wondering what the future holds in terms of the age of retirement.  Issues will arise regarding how best to recognise the significant contribution older people make to society.  Will people be required to work until a later retirement age or will we take a civilised approach and allow people to retire at 65 years, while recognising that some people will want to continue an active working life beyond that age?  Will we be able to facilitate such an approach and establish a structure which takes account of the different aspirations of older people?</P>

	<P>I should have known there was no danger of me quoting from a poem without Senator Norris responding at will with another quotation.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in our discussion on a heritage channel, I have a sense that in the area of broadcasting older people are taken for granted as civic minded participants in society and their specific needs are easily overlooked.  Perhaps this is connected to the fact that age activism, which I support, is relatively new.  It behoves us, as legislators, to consider whose interests we are trying to serve and whose needs we are trying to meet with this legislation.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, I propose, in amendment No. 22, to insert after section 39(1)(<i>c</i>) the words: &ldquo;in the case of sound broadcasting a minimum of not less than 10 per cent of the broadcasting time is devoted to the broadcasting of programmes at people over 65 years,&rdquo;.  In amendment No. 82 I propose to insert in section 66 a subsection to the effect that in &ldquo;considering the suitability of any applicant for the award of a broadcasting contract to provide a broadcasting service in respect of an area in which more than 10 per cent of the population is over 65, the Contract Awards Committee shall have particular regard to the needs of this population in relation to programming content.&rdquo;  The same spirit inhabits both amendments.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 90 provides for the insertion in section 101 of words to the effect that the nature and number of hours of television programming aimed at people over 65 years should be specified.  The point of these amendments is to increase programming content and encourage commercial channels to provide programming for the elderly in the same way as the Bill promotes Irish language and other programming.  The amendments would also require the public service broadcasting charter to take account of the programming needs of older people, as it does in the case of the needs of children.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>Section 39 deals with the duties of broadcasters, section 66 relates to the awarding of contracts and section 101 concerns the public service broadcasting charter.  Taken together, the amendments would guarantee that a minimum level of broadcasting services aimed at people aged over 65 years would be provided and this would be facilitated accordingly in the management of commercial channels and charter.</P>

        <P>The amendments have merit and a figure of 10% is a reasonable quota to lay down given that the proportion of the population aged over 65 years will increase due to demographic change.  However, it may be difficult to determine which programmes are aimed at those aged over 65 years and those who are younger than that.  I know many people aged over 65 years who enjoy watching &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;.  While the programme is not my cup of tea, some of those in the over 65 age group have been drawn in by its addictive nature or whatever types of subliminal messages it sends out.  In general, amendment No. 22 is worthy and merits support.</P>
        <P>On section 39, I will propose a Report Stage amendment to insert a new subsection requiring all sports coverage to give priority to domestic sports.  Regardless of what major domestic fixtures are taking place, whether championship football, League of Ireland soccer or domestic rugby, reports on English Premiership football games tend to be aired first on RTE sports bulletins.   It is Chelsea this, Manchester United the rest, with no talk of Wexford or Donegal until later in the bulletin.  We need to give priority to domestic sports.  There is also great interest in what is happening internationally and news must be reported but t&uacute;s &aacute;ite or the top story in terms of reporting sport should be whatever domestic sport is the issue of the day.  This may be GAA, soccer, rugby or field sports.  I will table an amendment to section 39 on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I support amendment No. 90 to section 101 which deals with the amount of children&rsquo;s programming.  Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment applies to a number of hours for programmes targeted at the over 65s.  I will propose an amendment to section 101 on Report Stage which will call for the insertion of a new section on the nature and number of hours devoted to Irish culture, including sport.  There will be a further section on the nature and number of hours devoted to the Irish language.  If we can specify the number of hours of children&rsquo;s programmes, I do not see why we cannot do it in respect of the Irish language.  The Minister would not accept an earlier amendment dealing with a quota.  Quotas can be troublesome and fix matters rigidly.  If we can do it for a number of other areas we can do so in respect of the amendment that I will table on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister of State to take it into consideration.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my words of congratulations to Senator Mullen on coming up with this positive proposal.  We often examine, tinker and make minor adjustments to legislation but Senator Mullen has identified a real need.  I say this with the knowledge that I am getting on in years and that I will challenge the future republican candidate in the US for age.  I gather he is in his 70s.  A number of steps must be taken, of which this is one example.</P>
        <P>When I was elected to the House in 1993, one of the first amendments I tabled was to the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act.  The legislation had been circulated to all interested parties, including the trade unions.  My amendment included discrimination on the basis of age as <Col N="53"/>unacceptable for dismissal.  The Minister at the time accepted it because the age of a person is easily identifiable.  The trade unions wrote to me later expressing amazement that they had not identified this as something that was required.  They were surprised that an employer rather than a trade unionist had identified it.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other areas that discriminate on the grounds of age.  I was unaware that one could not be called for jury service after the age of 70.  I gather that will be changed to allow the option.  Tourists who visit Ireland and want to rent a car have great difficulty if they are over 70.</P>
        <P>The former US ambassador to Norway, Mr. Bob Stuart, visited me today.  I have known him for years and he is in Ireland because a relative is graduating.  He and his wife had lunch with me and he told me he is 92 years of age.  He was interested in everything that was happening in Ireland as well as keeping me up to date on matters in the US.  We should not lose the talents of such people.  Senator Mullen has suggested positively discriminating &mdash; if that is the term &mdash; in favour of those who would have been seen as citizens who had served their purpose and no longer had a contribution to make to society.  This is a good way to ensure they do, that they are kept on board and kept interested.  I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to these three amendments which attempt to identify the needs, requirements and benefits that may accrue to people who may not have been regarded as full members of society because they were regarded as past it.  There is great talent and we should use it.</P>

	<P>I agree with the sentiment of this amendment but I am not sure I can agree with the sentiment as framed.  Senator Mullen may be satisfied if the Minister of State agrees to look at this area and give a response to show that this sector of the population is catered for.</P>
        <P>If we are going to boast about age, I am required to tell the House that I shall be 64 in a few weeks.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris has mellowed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think I have mellowed at all.  I wonder about categorising and sectioning people into age groups.  I understand what Senators Mullen and Quinn are addressing, that there is material unsuitable to most people over 65.  Heavy metal is an example and I have never liked it.  Certain things happen as one gets older, the hearing range changes and one can get sound distortion which affects one&rsquo;s pleasure in music.  Certain kinds of music can be distinctly unpleasant for a significant proportion of people in the higher age groups.  I worry about dividing society into different groups without thinking about it carefully.</P>
        <P>Perhaps Senator Mullen can tell us if any market research has been done on the programmes this group would like.  Knowing him as a thorough person, he may well have undertaken this research or he may not have had the resources to do so.  Perhaps this is something one of our academic institutions, the ESRI or a group that functions for the elderly might examine.  We might be quite surprised at the content of such programmes as suggested by the elderly.</P>
        <P>As, I hope, Senator Quinn and I demonstrate, elderly people are not all grim people who want devotional services that prepare them for the grave or programmes that tell them how to rinse their false teeth before they go to bed.  That is what Yeats was getting at and I cannot <Col N="54"/>resist the opportunity to quote from another Yeats poem: &ldquo;We who are old, old and gay&rdquo;.  This has always made me laugh, particularly as it now clearly refers to me as well.  That was not the sense in which the former Senator and Nobel prize winner, W.B. Yeats, intended it but it is one of the reasons that makes me glad we have successfully politically colonised that innocuous and irritating little word.  It now means something more sensible than it did when it referred to goblins tripping down the mountainside.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty echoed a feeling of mine when he referred to understanding the Minister&rsquo;s previous difficulties about quotas.  If that is true, it is also true of percentages, which may be arbitrary.  If there is a resistance to quotas, logically the same resistance exists for a specific percentage.  I am not against the principle but I wonder what will happen if we say we must have 10% for Irish culture, 10% for the elderly and 10% for something else.  What we need, which is in some respect what Senator Mullen has sensitively proposed, is that the broadcasting authorities should be aware of, and sensitive to, the requirements of different sections of their audience.  I applaud the Senator for raising this.  As Senator Quinn said, it is a very positive way to look at it.  We are not howling about discrimination but are saying let us do something positive.  If it is to be 10%, at what time would it be?  Would it all be in one slot at 10 p.m. or would it be at 6 a.m.?  Many practical issues need to be teased out.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is a strong case to be made for being age sensitive.  For example, some programmes deal with the disabled, although I am not sure if it is politically correct to say &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; because the language keeps changing.  Old fogies like me used to refer to the &ldquo;disabled&rdquo; which was a big improvement on what we called them before.  However, programmes such as &ldquo;Outside the Box&rdquo; with Olan McGowan are wonderful and can attract a general audience.  A good programme, which could be elder-proofed to ensure it is not grossly obnoxious to older people, might attain a much wider audience than we imagine.  I am strongly in favour of the amendment.</P>
        <P>We should also have some older broadcasters.  I remember with great pleasure listening to Val Joyce on the radio.  One of the lovely things about him was that one knew he was as old as a bush, and he said it himself.  He fiddled around with the CDs, which used to get lost, and he used to make mildly irritated noises at the machine.  It was all part of the entertainment.  If we sanitise broadcasting to keep this kind of thing out, we do a terrible injustice to the whole spectrum of broadcasting.</P>
        <P>I applaud Senator Mullen for tabling this amendment.  I have some reservations about it as it stands, but I am fully in agreement with the principle of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator Mullen on tabling this worthy amendment which merits serious consideration.  I also take note of the observations and qualifications Senator Norris made in respect of it which also merit serious consideration in terms of how one might practically implement the spirit of the amendment.</P>
        <P>The number of people aged over 65 years continues to rise.  There is much use of the broadcasting media among that sector and, for obvious reasons, they use it disproportionately more in terms of time than other sectors of the population.  For that reason, it is worth proposing that all broadcasting services are aware of the over 65 sector and of producing material relevant to, and likely to be enjoyed by it, bearing in mind what Senator Norris said about this being blurred.  Some people of 20 years will enjoy programming for the over 65s and vice versa.  It is not cut and dried but a reasonable assessment could be made.</P>
        <P>If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, he should consider the spirit of it, what it seeks to achieve and amend the legislation to include the concept it contains.  It is a worthy idea.  It is arguable that all these things are implicit in the broad principles of the Bill but it is <Col N="55"/>no harm making them more explicit and definite in order to preserve such a principle in situations which might not be as benign.</P>
        <P>I hear from the older people I know &mdash; we are all moving quickly in that direction &mdash; that they very much enjoy radio, particularly Radio 1 and their local radio stations, and the content of radio programmes.  If that is the case, we should consider making television more friendly to that sector. I have been told older people enjoy radio more but more research might be required.</P>
        <P>The principle of the amendment is good and the Minister should seriously consider it.  I have no difficulty supporting the amendment.  Senator Norris made very reasonable points about its implementation, delineation, demarkation, etc., in terms of programme content, timing and so on.  I do not propose to go over those issues because he went through them very adequately.  Subject to consideration of Senator Norris&rsquo;s points, we should support the amendment, the principle of which is good.  I appeal to the Minister to give it serious thought.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and concur with the previous speaker.  I appreciate the practical difficulty of implementing what the amendment proposes.  It is, however, a question of trying to be sensitive, of reaching out and of ensuring our broadcasting service is for the entire population and not only the under 30s, 40s or 50s.</P>
        <P>Much lip-service is paid to senior citizens.  However, there is a Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  I hope that person would have a role in this type of legislation and would bring ideas to it which would advocate the type of amendment suggested by Senator Mullen.</P>
        <P>Television and radio are designed to entertain and educate.  That service is required by all sectors of the community and not only younger people.  Senator Norris concluded by referring to Val Joyce and perhaps to the &ldquo;Late Date&rdquo; programme.</P>

If he puts on his leisure hat, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will recall Val Joyce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Airs and Races&rdquo; programme on a Saturday evening.  RTE made an error removing &ldquo;Airs and Races&rdquo; approximately 20 to 25 years ago which gave us all a little insight into the wonderful world of horse-racing.  It also made an error removing the &ldquo;Late Date&rdquo; programme.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Joyce has been removed from the show.  His programme showed that radio broadcasting is not only about young, vibrant disc jockeys and that every sector has a role to play.  Perhaps we are reminiscing a bit too much.</P>
        <P>I am coming across as a fuddy-duddy but another programme which reaches out to the elderly is Donnacha O&rsquo;Dulaing&rsquo;s programme, &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte Isteach&rdquo; on Radio 1 on a Saturday night and to which emigrants listen.  It relays little stories about the Irish community in Britain.  It shows that true public service broadcasting must try to appeal to all sectors of the market and must have a variety of programming not all commercially successful or paying for themselves through advertising revenue, etc.  It is all part of the jigsaw of the sort of broadcasting service we must offer the people.</P>
        <P>The amendment makes a statement that the over 65s matter and that their concerns must be addressed.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, will be able to recognise that sort of thinking by agreeing to the amendment or giving us a guarantee that the thinking behind it will be part of the legislation.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  If <Col N="56"/>we are to have an inclusive broadcasting service, we must recognise the needs of those over the age of 65.  It may be politically incorrect to speak of sectors like &ldquo;the over 65s&rdquo; or &ldquo;the over 50s&rdquo;.  We know the market we are speaking about.  I refer to people who may be retired from work.  Such senior citizens, who built this country, paid their taxes and made this country what it is, still have a major role to play.  I ask the Minister of State to try to respond as favourably as he can.  I look forward to his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the remarks of Senator Norris on this matter.  When one talks about quotas and percentages in this context, one has to understand the subtleties involved if one is to understand what this is really about.  We need to be sensitive to the differences among the people we are trying to cater for.  The valid point has been made it is important to assess such people&rsquo;s needs.  If one asks older people what they want to watch, one might be surprised by the results one gets.  When I sit down with people over the age of 65 in my house or in other houses, I find it incredible to observe that their tastes are not too different from my own.  Some of the programmes they like to watch, such as &ldquo;The Weakest Link&rdquo;, are not shown on RTE.  People of all ages watch &ldquo;The Weakest Link&rdquo; to try to answer the questions and see what Anne Robinson will say to the contestants.</P>
        <P>Similarly, soap operas cross many divides.  It is hard to define the age group at which any given soap is aimed.  I ran into rocky territory when I spoke about &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Those involved in &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; thought I was complaining about product placement.  I had not noticed the picture that was in the newspapers.  If I had, I would have complained about product placement.  I was complaining about the fact that a young pop band that had been brought into the programme, to boost its ratings at that time, was shown to spend most of its time in a bar.  I pointed out that there is more to life than standing in a bar with a glass in one&rsquo;s hand.  Given that soap operas are watched in houses throughout Ireland every day of the week, we should avail of their ability to transmit positive subliminal messages to young people.</P>
        <P>I admire programmes such as &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; that focus on matters of local interest.  Senator Bradford spoke about the importance of documentaries.  We need to reflect on the roles of news and current affairs programmes, soap operas and quizzes.  Senator Mullen suggested that RTE&rsquo;s orchestras be used for classical &ldquo;prom&rdquo; concerts.  We spoke earlier about whether heavy metal is appropriate for people over the age of 65.  Other forms of music are insufficiently exploited.  We are paying for the RTE symphony and concert orchestras, which are not given enough opportunities to display their wares as often as they could.  If the approximately 100 members of the National Symphony Orchestra were to break into groups of three or four, they could give the benefit of their experience to at least 25 schools at a time.  Television programmes like &ldquo;Nationwide&rdquo; could document such work.  Grannies, parents and children would watch such programmes.  It would be as valid as any other event.</P>
        <P>We need to consider the scheduling of programmes aimed at people over the age of 65.  While I think the programmes they require are being made, they are not always shown at appropriate times.  A number of programmes of this nature are broadcast at the same time on Saturday evenings.  Most people would like to enjoy programmes like &ldquo;Casualty&rdquo;, &ldquo;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winning Streak&rdquo;, but they are shown on three different stations at the same time.  When one turns on one&rsquo;s television at the same time on Sunday evening, one might find there is nothing on that interests one.  We need to ensure that programmes are scheduled in a balanced manner.  We should focus on variety, as much as possible.  That is sometimes the biggest problem.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>The fundamental thing I would say about the three amendments before the House is that they demonstrate the value of doing research.  I suggest that much of our programming is good enough, but the best programmes sometimes collide.  The manner in which programmes are scheduled is often as important as the programmes themselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if Senators Mullen and Norris were differing in their interpretations of the work of William Butler Yeats.  I had some difficulty in trying to interpret what Senators Norris and Quinn were saying.  I am not sure whether they are thinking about heading for greener pastures in the near future.  If they are thinking along those lines, I will tell them, as I told my colleague, Senator Walsh, earlier, about a gentleman who recently came to see me.  He told me that he was interested in securing employment.  He said he thought it would be a promotion for him.  When I was taking down his details, I said, &ldquo;Do you mind me asking you, John, what your date of birth is?&rdquo;.  He gave me a date in May 1922.  Senators Quinn and Norris should reflect on that as they consider making an emergency exit from the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 22, 82 and 90 seek to set out specific requirements for programming aimed at those over the age of 65.  In particular, they will require broadcasters to ensure that a minimum of 10% of programming is devoted to people over that age.  Under these amendments, the broadcasting authority of Ireland will have to consider the needs of over 65s when it is awarding contracts in areas in which 10% or more of the population is in that age bracket.  When RTE is drafting its public service charter, these amendments will require it to provide commitments in relation to the nature and number of hours per year of television programming aimed at people over the age of 65.  RTE is currently required to appeal to a wide audience.  If it did not appeal to a wide audience, it would not survive.  A great deal of criticism would be expressed in such circumstances.  RTE is required to provide commitments in respect of the amount of children&rsquo;s programming it makes each year.  This ensures that adequate suitable programming of an educational and general entertainment nature is available to children in their formative years.  Over the years, RTE has been careful to provide a wide variety of programming, including programmes relating to current affairs, sports, nostalgia, music and history, as well as chat shows, films, soap operas and speciality programmes, to suit people in all other specific age groups.  This wide variety of programming offers all viewers a choice.  Therefore, I am not convinced that additional commitments are necessary in respect of adults over the age of 65.</P>
        <P>When commercial broadcast contacts are being awarded, there is merit in ensuring that applicant broadcasters will cater for the needs of all members of the community.  I consider that there is sufficient scope in the current Bill to provide for this.  Section 66(2) outlines the matters to be considered by the contract awards committee when awarding a contract.  Section 66(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that the committee must consider &ldquo;the quality, range and type of the programmes proposed to be provided by each applicant or, if there is only one applicant, by that applicant&rdquo;.  Section 66(2)(<i>f</i>) provides that the committee must consider &ldquo;the desirability of having a diversity of services in the area specified in the notice catering for a wide range of tastes including those of minority interests&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty in accepting the spirit of these amendments.  However, I am confident that these proposals are already catered for in the Bill.  For that reason, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues, Senators Doherty, Quinn, Norris, O&rsquo;Reilly and Bradford, for their general support for this provision.  The Minister of State said it is not needed as the issue is somehow addressed in the Bill.  However, the question that must be answered is what harm would it do to include these subsections.  They would at least have the <Col N="58"/>effect of drawing to the notice of public service broadcasters, commercially-minded broadcasters, the need to have regard to the needs, interests and tastes of older members of our society.  Even if this were purely aspirational or was capable of being achieved by the Bill as drafted, I do not understand the reason it cannot be included as a specific matter.  </P>
        <P>Section 101, which relates to the public services broadcasting charter, makes specific reference to another section of society, namely, children.  It provides that the charter shall address the nature and number of hours of children&rsquo;s television, in terms of the amount of science and technology programmes and so on.  Related magazines and audio-CDS are covered by the charter.  If the needs of children, in terms of science and technology programming and things as relatively unimportant as magazines and audio-CDS related to broadcasting services can be directly provided for and are to be given specific mention in the Bill, then why not require that a minimum percentage of our programming be directed towards the interests and tastes of persons over 65 years of age?</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge a number of contributions in particular.  Senator Keaveney rightly pointed out that we should not assume that older people have radically different tastes.  The effects of the amendments tabled would be to require broadcasters to undertake the necessary market research to ensure the programming diet on offer takes sufficient account of the interests, needs and tastes of older people.  Many people, as they get older, have more time and a greater need for television.  It is for this reason I have selected this particular group as of interest.  People&rsquo;s lifestyles change as they get older.  This requires us to ensure their interests and tastes are addressed.</P>
        <P>I was interested also in Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution in regard to the need for market research.  The Bill could require, perhaps by way of a different version of this amendment, that the broadcaster carry out the necessary market research to ensure that the programming on offer reflects the needs of older people.  I was glad to hear Val Joyce being mentioned.  It was widely stated when RTE made the changes in question, following which Val Joyce left the airwaves, that the commercial decision did not have regard to the needs of many listeners.  It is wrong to give too many specific examples but this would suggest there is a possible ageism in our culture.  There is a risk that those in charge of broadcasting might be overly focused on commercial concerns and might have less regard to the needs of a constituency that might not be the most lucrative in terms of audience but which nonetheless exists.</P>
        <P>I am not forgetting that many older people are active and have tastes not discernibly different from other sectors of society.  For example, I cannot telephone a particular uncle of mine at a certain time of the day because if there is a soap opera on I will be told in seconds to phone back later.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I observe with interest my parent&rsquo;s programming tastes.  The point is that research needs to be done.  We owe it to older people not to make assumptions about what they like.  We should require our broadcaster to do the necessary research to ensure they get what they like in terms of a programming diet.  The merit of these amendments is that they understand that broadcasters are operating in a commercial environment and that there is, therefore, a great temptation to move away from public interest considerations towards purely commercial considerations.  This is the basis for these amendments.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>I note what Senator Norris eloquently said about former Senator William Butler Yeats.  Yeats did not, based on some of his poetry, go gently into old age.  I would like to think were he here he would see the point of these amendments.  I remain hopeful that the Minister will introduce on Report Stage a provision that has regard to the needs, interests and tastes of older people.</P>

	<P>It makes no sense that RTE was able to send so many people to Washington at great expense yet the Cork city marathon received minimal coverage on the 6 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o&rsquo;clock news.  This was one of two major events in Ireland on bank holiday Monday.  </P>
        <P>I believe there is a reduction in terms of news coverage at the weekend.  This is wrong.  I welcome that 20% of broadcasting time must be devoted to the broadcast of news and current affairs.  However, I believe we must take an in-depth look at how current affairs issues are covered.  I welcome also the provision in regard to objectivity and fairness.  I will not impugn anybody but some journalists take shortcuts in the presentation of news.  I am happy they will now be required to be objective and impartial in this regard.</P>

	<P>I believe Senator Mullen has identified a lacuna in the Bill though the Minister of State may say otherwise.  His idea in respect of independent market research could add immeasurably to the scheduling and selection of programmes.  The Bill makes no provision in this regard.  There is a mention of an audience council specifically with regard to children <Col N="60"/>which may do so.  It is discretionary and not mandatory.  Will the Minister of State examine this?  Scheduling and providing audiences with representative programmes should be based on a scientific survey of the audience and of the marketplace being served.  In the absence of this, it is done on the subjective views of the administrators.</P>

    <Title>Charter of Fundamental Rights: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the charter which I believe will be one of the most important elements introduced into European law if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; next week.  I intend to explain the background of the charter which is often overlooked.  I will also take this opportunity to respond to a number of extremely erroneous and false claims set before the public.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty will confer legal status on the charter of fundamental rights.  This will mark a significant development for the status of fundamental rights under the current treaties.  Ireland has been extremely supportive of the charter since its agreement in 2000 and since the convention was established in 1999 to draft its provisions.  The charter is the first formal EU document to combine and declare all the values and fundamental rights to which EU citizens are entitled in their dealings with EU institutions and member states in the application of EU law.</P>
        <P>If the treaty is ratified the charter becomes law and makes our rights as citizens more visible.  The preamble of the charter speaks of a common resolve of the people of the EU &ldquo;to share a peaceful future based on common values&rdquo;.  It continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.  It places the individual at the heart of its activities, <Col N="61"/>by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I fail to understand how any person calling himself or herself civilised or a democrat could find anything to which to object within it.  The charter is uplifting in its language and noble in its intent.  The fact that it has been demonised during the campaign, particularly by the Libertas group, speaks to the credibility of some in the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign. The extent to which Libertas is willing to distort the Lisbon treaty and to demonise the charter is demonstrated by the two most outrageous claims made in this campaign, namely, the assertion that the charter could lead to the detention of children under three years of age and that it could lead to the reintroduction of the death penalty.  I will speak more about both claims later.</P>
        <P>It takes a very negative organisation to convey its messages in such a grotesque form.  However, that is what Libertas has set out to do.  These must be just about the most monstrous charges that have ever been made during 35 years of referendum campaigns in this country, and that is saying something.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the European Union is interested in incarcerating children and even more outrageous to suggest it wishes to reintroduce the death penalty.</P>
        <P>It is ludicrous also to suggest that the 27 member states, their Governments and the batteries of lawyers who follow treaty negotiations would all have agreed to or, alternatively, missed out on these wild notions.  Are we seriously to believe that Libertas is so inspired that it alone spotted these while they passed by everyone else?  I suggest not.  I suggest that the Irish people are being fed the most far-fetched notions about this treaty by this organisation.</P>
        <P>What is more, I believe the Irish people are now alert to them.  We have heard their claims about taxation, abortion and the world trade talks.  These claims have been rejected by, amongst others, the independent Referendum Commission, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, the Catholic bishops speaking through the Archbishop of Dublin, IBEC, the American Chamber of Commerce and the European Commission to mention a few.</P>
        <P>The rights identified in the charter are drawn from the Union&rsquo;s own law, such as equal pay for men and women, existing international treaties, most notably the European Convention on Human Rights, and the constitutional traditions common to Member States, such as the right to property.</P>
        <P>The charter is important because it highlights the values on which the Union is founded.  It brings together in one document the fundamental rights available to citizens under EU law.  Its primary significance is, therefore, that it provides clarity to citizens and to the court of justice of the European Union on the range of rights available.  This point was made recently by a letter from Mr. John Monks, the general secretary of the ETUC, the organisation representing trade unions from all over Europe in Brussels. Mr. Monks called for the early ratification of the treaty to give effect to the charter.</P>
        <P>The original European Communities treaties drafted in the 1950s did not contain a comprehensive set of fundamental rights.  However as the Union developed, it became apparent that it would be necessary for Community law to protect the human and fundamental rights of individual citizens.  In the absence of fundamental rights in the original EC treaty, the European Court of Justice, ECJ, therefore, began to formally recognise the existence of fundamental rights as one of the &ldquo;general principles of Community law&rdquo;.  The concept of fundamental rights as a &ldquo;general principle of Community law&rdquo; was well recognised at the time of Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the Community in 1973.</P>
        <P>Although the European Court of Justice was the first EU institution to recognise fundamental rights, other EU institutions drafted catalogues of rights in the 1970s.  Member states also <Col N="62"/>acknowledged fundamental rights in preamble to the Single European Act.  In the Maastricht treaty on European Union, it was stated the EU would respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional traditions common to the member states.  Following this, the June 1993 European Council adopted conclusions containing the so-called Copenhagen criteria, which made respect for human rights a condition of membership of the EU.  The Amsterdam treaty made it a legal requirement that candidate countries would have to respect fundamental rights to join the Union.  It also introduced a provision for sanctioning member states that seriously and persistently breached human rights, while the Nice treaty introduced a preventative mechanism to deal with member states where there is a serious risk of such breaches occurring.</P>
        <P>While the Union acknowledged the existence of fundamental rights, no authoritative catalogue of rights was available.  When the Nice treaty was being drafted, a convention was established and asked to draft a charter to bring together the fundamental rights protected in the EU.  The Government representative at the convention was Michael O&rsquo;Kennedy, and the Oireachtas was represented by the current chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Bernard Durkan, and Des O&rsquo;Malley.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted initially by the EU institutions at Nice as a political commitment to fundamental rights.  During negotiations on the constitutional treaty, it was agreed the charter should be given legally binding force.  There was considerable enthusiasm for this measure in the convention because members such as myself saw the move as adding considerably to the Union&rsquo;s social dimension.  I recall sitting through long sessions, particularly on the social Europe section, where there was enthusiastic support for the incorporation of the charter in European law.  For example, I recall Proinsias De Rossa saying we were making one of the most important fundamental breakthroughs, a sentiment with which I agreed completely.  It was decided the charter would be given the same legal status in the Lisbon treaty but that it would not form part of its text.  That is one of the answers to those who say we can vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; for a better &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The position of the charter slipped between the first and second treaties because the UK had difficulties with it being included.</P>
        <P>The original convention that drafted the charter also provided a set of explanations explaining the provenance and background to the rights set out in the charter.  They were also drafted at the request of a number of member states, including Ireland, which wished to ensure the charter consolidated existing rights rather than radically altering them.  The explanations are not legally binding, but will provide useful guidance for the European Court of Justice.  The explanations were amended during the negotiations on the constitutional treaty to reflect the changes to the so-called horizontal clauses in the charter.</P>
        <P>Having explained the background to the charter, I will highlight its contents because they have been grotesquely misrepresented in the debate in Ireland.  The charter sets out in clear terms the rights that must be respected by the Union&rsquo;s institutions and the Member States when they are implementing EU law.  The charter comprises 54 articles, divided into seven sections entitled dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens&rsquo; rights, justice and general or horizontal provisions governing the interpretation and application of the charter.  The rights covered are diverse and include the prohibition of torture, respect for private and family life, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial and citizens&rsquo; rights such as the right to vote and stand as a candidate at elections to the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>For example, from a trade union point of view, the charter provides clarity on the extent of workers&rsquo; rights.  The general secretary of IMPACT has described it as a &ldquo;prize&rdquo; that trade unions across Europe had pursued for &ldquo;many, many years&rdquo;.  He is correct.  I refer to the letter from Mr. John Monks in which he said he wanted member states to ratify the treaty quickly <Col N="63"/>because it would give legal effect to the charter and that had the charter been law prior to the recent court cases it would have informed the judgments handed down.  He recently stated he wants to see a social progress clause added to the treaty but that it would be a separate measure.  He made clear, &ldquo;To reopen the Treaty at this stage is neither practical nor desirable&rdquo;.  He acknowledged there is an inherent danger in reopening the treaty.  Ireland has achieved absolute equality, for a small state, in the negotiations.  One cannot do better than equality in negotiations.  From the point of view of workers and people interested in human and fundamental rights, we have a charter.  It will not be improved by a return to negotiations.  David Begg, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, said it would &ldquo;be a serious error of judgment to miss the opportunity to give legal effect to the Charter&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The charter has been the subject of some of the most destructive and untruthful commentary in the debate in Ireland.  Among other areas, the charter deals with the prohibition of child labour, fair and just working conditions and protection in the event of unfair dismissal.  The provisions highlight the Union&rsquo;s values in the area of workers&rsquo; rights and will have relevance in the event of future cases at the European Court of Justice on labour issues.  The charter also contains a number of so-called horizontal provisions clarifying the scope of its application, for example, providing that the charter does not extend the scope of application of EU law.</P>
        <P>Bearing in mind these horizontal provisions and the explanations of the charter, I will underline what the charter does not do, particularly in light of the more extraordinary claims that have been made to date.  These are dishonest claims that define the type of campaign that some opponents are running.  They are wild-eyed claims which, in the past few days, have given the electorate cause to take a closer look at the people making them and to question the agenda behind the case they are advancing.</P>
        <P>It is important to be clear that the charter does not introduce new rights previously unrecognised by member states.  It does not replace or dilute the constitutions of member states, as it applies only to the EU institutions and to the member states when they are implementing Union law nor does it extend in any way the competences of the EU.  In recent weeks, I have heard an expanding list of scare-mongering claims about the charter such as it will be used to introduce abortion &mdash; which, thankfully, the Referendum Commission hit on the head earlier &mdash; hard drugs, prostitution, the detention of children or the death penalty in Ireland.  I reassure the public this will not happen.</P>
        <P>The charter will not extend the capacity of the EU to interfere in areas of domestic competence.  For example, where the member states act within their own competence with regard to the prohibition on drugs, the EU has no jurisdiction.  As far as abortion is concerned, Ireland&rsquo;s position is protected by the Maastricht protocol on the right to life of the unborn which is unaffected by the Lisbon treaty.  I am delighted that Archbishop Martin has confirmed this in the clearest language.   The EU institutions have fully respected Ireland&rsquo;s position in this regard and will continue to do so.  Any suggestion that the charter overrides the provisions of the protocol, which specifically states that nothing in the EU treaties or any further amendments to them can affect the application in Ireland of our constitutional protection of the unborn, is at best wilfully misleading.  It is simply a distortion of the facts, the truth and the reality and is intended to confuse and mislead.  Sadly, those people who propagate this particularly mendacious approach have had unfortunate effects in some parts of the public</P>
        <P>I find it extraordinary that opponents claim that the Charter of Fundamental Rights could re-introduce the death penalty in Ireland.  Such a claim, based on a spurious misreading of the explanations of the charter, leaves the public nonplussed and questioning the credibility that attaches to those who make the claim and to the other far-fetched claims on issues such as taxation and abortion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The European Union actively <Col N="64"/>campaigns for the universal abolition of the death penalty.  Indeed, abolition of the death penalty is a requirement for countries seeking EU membership.  This is the bizarre thing about the claim by Libertas.  One cannot even apply to become a member of the EU if one retains the death penalty.  The death penalty was completely abolished in Ireland in 2001 on foot of a constitutional referendum.</P>
        <P>The opponents are using the explanations to the charter on which to base this claim and others, including the detention of young children.  The explanations simply outline in certain areas the permissible limitations set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, which Ireland ratified as far back as 1953.  The claim about the detention of children goes back to a document which we ratified back in 1953 and which we incorporated into domestic law in this country in 2003.  Significantly, the convention and protocols set out minimum standards for the protection of human rights and do not prevent more extensive protection under domestic law.  Furthermore, they do not prevent more stringent standards emerging in international law.  For example, the 13th protocol to the ECHR wholly outlaws the death penalty, even in time of war.  Ireland and 22 of our fellow EU member states have ratified this protocol and the other four have signed it, subject to ratification.</P>
        <P>There is absolutely no suggestion under either the ECHR or the charter that any member state would be required either to impose the death penalty or to detain children.  Moreover, the EU does not even have competence in respect of the use of the death penalty or the detention of young children by member states.  Once more, opponents of the treaty are attempting to mislead the voters with these wilfully unfounded allegations.</P>
        <P>We must continue to embrace and protect the freedoms and principles as set out in the charter.  To do otherwise is to reject the statement of fundamental values on which the Union is founded, values which are sacred to the Irish people.  Conferring legal status on the charter is a progressive step for the Union and it is my view that the Government&rsquo;s endorsement of the charter will be shared by the Irish people when they vote next week.  It is just one of the many positive aspects of the Lisbon treaty.  Next week&rsquo;s referendum is an opportunity for Ireland to reaffirm our place in Europe and our standing as a guardian of human rights.</P>
        <P>I will quote from the preamble of the charter which sets out clearly the principles and values which are central to the document and to the EU envisaged in the Lisbon treaty.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.  It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It takes a very perverse and fevered mind to find anything to fear in those positive statements of human rights which most civilised people hold dear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is not very often that I find myself in full agreement with him and the content of his speech but I certainly agree with practically all of his speech in respect of this subject, especially its refutation of some of the outrageous allegations that have been made throughout the debate on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of the most important features of the Lisbon reform treaty.  Divided into six sections &mdash; dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens&rsquo; rights and justice &mdash; it is based on the fundamental rights and freedoms recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, the constitutional traditions of the member states, the Council of Europe&rsquo;s social charter, the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers <Col N="65"/>and other fundamental international conventions to which the Community, the Union and the member states are parties.</P>
        <P>The charter is a radical document, a unique feature in the Union and one which I believe every citizen of the Union and its member states should read.  It asserts in clear and readable language what the principles behind our Union are, what rights we all have within the Union and what rights we will share as a community of peoples in this Union of peoples.</P>
        <P>The charter&rsquo;s origins date back to a European Council meeting held in June 1999 in Cologne.  There, the leaders of Europe entrusted the drafting of this fundamental document to a convention created for that purpose.  That convention first met in December 1999 and adopted a draft of the document less than one year later on 2 October 2000.  Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann was represented in the convention that drew up the document by the members mentioned by the Minister of State, including Deputy Bernard Durkan, Madeleine Taylor Quinn, Paschal Mooney and Desmond O&rsquo;Malley of the Progressive Democrats.  At a meeting held from 13 to 14 October 2000 in Biarritz, the European Council unanimously approved the draft and sent it to the Commission and the European Parliament.  The European Parliament approved the text on 14 November 2000 and the Commission approved it on 6 December 2000, with the presidents of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission signing the charter on behalf of the respective institutions on 7 December 2000.</P>
        <P>As the European Union itself notes:</P>
        <P LI="1">The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights sets out in a single text, for the first time in the European Union&rsquo;s history, the whole range of civil, political, economic and social rights of European citizens and all persons resident in the EU.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The then President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, summed up how the Commission sees the Charter.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the eyes of the European Commission, by proclaiming the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Union institutions have committed themselves to respecting the Charter in everything they do and in every policy they promote . . . The citizens of Europe can rely on the Commission to ensure that the Charter will be respected.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Speaking on the same day in Nice, the President of the European Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, was similarly glowing in praise for the document and its importance.  She said:</P>
        <P LI="1">A signature represents a commitment . . . I trust that all the citizens of the Union will understand that from now on . . . the Charter will be the law guiding the actions of the Assembly ... From now on it will be the point of reference for all the Parliament acts which have a direct or indirect bearing on the lives of citizens throughout the Union.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Speaking five days later in Strasbourg, the then President of the European Council, Jacques Chirac, reacted to the text on behalf of the governments of the member states.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In Nice, we proclaimed the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, a text which is of major political importance.  Its full significance will become apparent in the future and I wish to pay tribute to your Assembly for the major contribution it has made to its drafting.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Many people have spoken, correctly, about the difficulty in understanding the Lisbon treaty.  If the treaty itself is full of complex, difficult language, the same cannot be said of the charter which has a clarity of language that would enable it to be read and, indeed, understood by schoolchildren and adults alike.  The preamble of the document gives the reasons Europe needs the charter.  It states &ldquo;it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the <Col N="66"/>light of changes in society, social progress and scientific and technical developments by making those rights more visible in a Charter&rdquo;.</P>
      
        <P>It is hard to find fault with a document like the charter which confirms that everyone has a right to life, that bans executions, cloning, torture and human trafficking, affirms respect for privacy as well as the right to marry, to freedom of religious thought and conscience, to fair and just working conditions, to collective bargaining and many other rights.  It is a sign of the frequently ridiculous and off-the-wall claims of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in the referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty that even the charter is now being misrepresented by the likes of Libertas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Recently Libertas claimed on TV3 that the charter would effectively allow for internment of three year olds.  Even by the bizarre standards of the campaign such a statement was mind-boggling.  If ever there was a moment when the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign hit rock bottom, that was it.  I wonder who Libertas thinks is running the European Union.  All the treaty actually says is that children have a right to compulsory education.  In other words, no neglectful parent can deny children a right to be educated.  How Libertas can twist something as decent and positive as a right to education into some form of internment of children is beyond the logic of<i> </i>most people in this State. Yet it continues to peddle this ridiculous claim rather than admitting it has got it very badly wrong.</P>
        <P>We are told that the treaty will not offer protection to workers.  In fact, workers rights are stressed throughout the document.  Article 28 speaks of the &ldquo;Right of collective bargaining and action&rdquo;, Article 30 of the right of &ldquo;Protection in the event of unjustified dismissal&rdquo;, while Article 31 refers to  &ldquo;Fair and just working conditions&rdquo;.  Many unions would like more and I understand that.  Nevertheless, this document is anything but anti-worker, a claim which is being peddled by some groups.</P>
        <P>Apart from the ever more bizarre claims of Libertas, another of the weird claims about the charter is that it will introduce abortion to Ireland.  It cannot do so because abortion is a matter for national law, while the charter is about EU law.  These are two different types of law, two entirely different categories.  Groups like C&oacute;ir seem not to understand, or do not want to understand, that difference.  Not alone is abortion not part of EU law, Ireland has the<?oasys _jy ?>Maastricht protocol as a second protection.  To read the charter as an abortionists&rsquo; charter is ridiculous, foolish, and suggests either a chronic lack of knowledge of the treaty or a desire to tell any old lie to frighten people into voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a welcome addition to the body of EU law.  It augments the rights we have built up under Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and the European Convention of Human Rights.  I commend the Europe Union for producing this charter.  It is something all our descendants will look at with pride, a clear statement of the fundamental rights we all share in the great European family of nations that is the European Union.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  I commend him on his speech and the detail therein and for his work on this campaign.  He has campaigned throughout the country on the Lisbon treaty.  Very few people have the knowledge of the Minister of State of the content of the treaty.  He has made a very big impression and did so when he canvassed with me in County Roscommon recently.  I also commend Senator Cummins for a fine report on the background to the charter and his rebuttal of many of the issues that were raised by other organisations.  </P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty will result in greater recognition for two different, already existing, human rights documents.  Some confusion has arisen between these two documents and it is important, therefore, to briefly discuss the different nature and origin of the two, before explaining why <Col N="67"/>the greater recognition of both of these texts is one of the most compelling, and regrettably overlooked, reasons to support the treaty.</P>
        <P>The European Convention on Human Rights entered into force in 1953 and created the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The ECHR is the cornerstone of human rights protection in Europe and the 47 member states of the Council of Europe, including Ireland, are parties to the convention.  The convention was incorporated into Irish domestic law by the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty will require the EU to accede to the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Convention on Human Rights.  This means that the institutions of the EU, when making and implementing EU law, will be subject to the same judicial control in respect of human rights as the individual State parties to the convention.  An individual EU citizen will be able to make a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg against the EU.  Citizens will also retain the right to make a complaint against their own country. At a meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in April, the assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a report and resolution which I proposed on the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights, thus setting in motion what the Lisbon treaty will complete.</P>
        <P>The ECHR and its permanent court have already contributed greatly to the vindication of human rights in Europe and to the improvement of domestic legislation in areas such as freedom of expression, criminal procedure and sexual orientation.  The accession of the EU to the ECHR will add to the accountability and transparency of the European Union.  The possible scrutiny of the actions of the Union&rsquo;s institutions by independent judges of the European Court of Human Rights can only strengthen the democratic credentials of Europe.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we are discussing this evening, sets out the civil, political, economic and social rights recognised by the EU, including the rights that citizens currently enjoy under EU treaties and related case law, the European Convention on Human Rights; the social charters of the Union and the Council of Europe and the constitutional traditions and international obligations common of the member states.  The charter was agreed at a special convention which met in 1999 and 2000 and was subsequently approved by the institutions of the EU.  Currently, it is a political document that is not legally binding or judiciable.</P>
        <P>The charter is a simple and excellent document.  It covers some areas which are not explicitly mentioned by other human rights documents.  It makes provision for questions which arise in light of modern medical technology which are not explicitly catered for in our Constitution or the ECHR.  It specifies a right to the protection of personal data concerning a citizen.  In light of recent losses of such data by various institutions throughout the EU it is particularly appropriate that this should be in the consideration of the EU bodies when legislating.  The charter also specifies that &ldquo;The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty gives the charter the same legal value as the main treaties.  It will enable the European Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, to use the charter as a reference point on human rights.  The principles of the charter will apply to EU member states only when they are implementing EU law.  EU law only exists in areas in which the member states specifically grant the Union competency.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on the Lisbon treaty verifies that the Charter &ldquo;does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union&rdquo;.  Therefore, the Court of Justice will only review the actions of the member states when they fall within the scope of Union law, including fundamental rights standards.  In addition, as with the ECHR, in practice the charter <Col N="68"/>will be used primarily as a reference for national courts and with reference to its interpretation by the Irish Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>There has been some speculation as to why the charter specifies rights in areas in which the EU has no competency or power.  For example, the right to marry and found a family, the right to criminal due process and the right to health care are all specified in the charter but the EU has no jurisdiction in these areas.  This has led some commentators to suggest that the European Court of Justice will be granted powers which would eclipse those of our Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>However, the text of Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is unambiguous.  It is addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the member states only when they are implementing Union law.  It is a natural consequence of the roots of the charter that it is a broad exposition of human rights.  The completeness of the text in no way means that the scope of its jurisdiction can be beyond the limits specified by the charter itself.  The granting of legal status to the charter is simply a consolidation of well-established principles as the charter is by its nature is a codification of rights already enjoyed by EU citizens at domestic and European level.  The European Parliament, in its rules of procedure, has committed itself to being bound by the charter when exercising its legislative function.  The European Commission also considers itself bound by the charter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many points made by opponents of the Lisbon treaty are a distortion of the facts.  Some parties claim the full incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights will lead to the legalisation of abortion.  However, a protocol to the Lisbon treaty provides that nothing in the treaty shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  This was confirmed by the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, who has an expertise in this area.  While he allayed the fears of many in this regard, those making the false claims are guided neither by the Pope nor the archbishops.  They have their own theological assessment of the situation.</P>
        <P>Some claim the charter will affect Irish sovereignty in decisions concerning marriage and the family.  Article 9 of the charter states, &ldquo;the right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with national laws governing the exercise of these rights.&rdquo;  The explanation of this article, also incorporated in the Lisbon treaty, states, &ldquo;this article neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to unions between people of the same sex.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The legal recognition of the Charter of Fundamental Rights proposed in the Lisbon treaty is a compelling argument in favour of the treaty and should enjoy widespread support.  It will not drastically change the nature of our rights and obligations.  The scope of its application is clearly limited by Article 51 of the charter itself and provisions such as the protocol on abortion.  The document is essentially a consolidation of rights already enjoyed by citizens of all EU countries.</P>
        <P>It will fully and formally recognise the criteria for the protection of human rights which the EU must abide by and recognise.  Coupled with the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights, it will provide two strong, independent, Europe-wide human rights safeguard mechanisms.  These are very strong grounds for supporting the ratification of the Lisbon treaty on Thursday week.  People often ask me what is in the treaty for them.  The treaty will guarantee their rights through the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Ireland will have an historic decision to make on 12 June.  To vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; will keep Ireland in the heart of Europe.  I hope people will come out in strength to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 12 June.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House and want to be associated with what was said earlier about his personal contribution to the campaign.  It should be appreciated and acknowledged.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights is seen by the Irish trade union movement as the prize in the Lisbon treaty.  Three years ago when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was negotiating the treaty, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made strong representations that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should form part of a future treaty.  It was not acceptable at the time in Europe and the Government was not very enthusiastic about it either.  Through a series of negotiations, the trade union movement made it clear to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it saw no prospect of a treaty being adopted by the people without the Charter of Fundamental Rights being incorporated in it.</P>
        <P>John Monks, general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, was disgusted to find that he was presented in Ireland as being opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  He shares my view, and that of the leadership of the Irish trade union movement, that the charter must be part of the treaty.</P>
        <P>The charter brings to bear certain rights such as the freedom to join and form a trade union and be represented by one.  What bothers me is that people believe this is not really a matter of concern.  I remember in 1972 my wife had to resign &mdash; effectively she was sacked &mdash;  as a teacher in a Dublin secondary school when we got married.  It could not have happened two years later when Ireland joined the EEC.  Every significant advance in workers&rsquo; and women&rsquo;s rights has come from Europe.  Those canvassing on doorsteps must point out this out to people.</P>
        <P>Some of my colleagues with strong pro-church views would be well advised to read the charter.  On the Order of Business this morning, I referred to a recent statutory instrument that provides for the Church of Ireland College of Education to ensure a quota of people from its own cultural background is available to it.  The way we are dealing with it does not make me jump up and down with delight.  However, I have no problem with a denomination maintaining its numbers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Article 14.3 of the charter &mdash; which a well-known Irish commentator claimed is very difficult to read and understand &mdash; states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The freedom to found educational establishments with due respect for democratic principles and the right of parents to ensure the education and teaching of their children in conformity with their religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions shall be<?oasys _jy ?>respected . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One wonders if those opposed to treaty on right-wing religious grounds have even read this article.  Are they aware of this simple commitment to people&rsquo;s rights in this document?  Contrarians &mdash; those opposed to the treaty for the sake of it and with whom I also share these benches &mdash; should be required to give an intellectual basis to their arguments against the treaty and the charter.  The rights enshrined in the charter are important to many.  Some Members may have exploited and survived the education system and the establishment.  However, many people depend on this charter to have their rights articulated.</P>
        <P>Article 20 states in the simplest terms, &ldquo;Everyone is equal before the law.&rdquo;  It goes on to say that any discrimination based on the grounds of race, sex, colour, ethnic origins, etc., is not allowed.  The Minister of State might have been present in the House when on one occasion in the past 12 years, Senator Shane Ross tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion which I seconded, in an attempt to outlaw capital punishment in this country.  People read this and think it is like the Middle Ages but these are matters we dealt with in the past ten or 15 years.  The EU charter will be a protection for people in other countries where capital punishment is still legal. <Col N="70"/> This charter is about protecting people and about advancing human rights, issues which no rational person would oppose.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The charter aims to develop cultural, linguistic and religious diversity.  T&aacute;imid ag caint mar gheall ar dhaoine a thagann &oacute; Ghaeltacht bheag ar imeall na hEorpa, mar shampla.  Sa Nice treaty, tugadh st&aacute;das agus gradam nua don Ghaeilge.  Bh&iacute; seans ann go nainmeofar an Ghaeilge mar cheann de theangacha oifigi&uacute;la na hEorpa.  D&uacute;radh go mbeadh fosta&iacute;ocht i gceist do mhuintir na nGaeltachta&iacute; agus daoine le Gaeilge sa Bhruis&eacute;il agus timpeall na hEorpa as translators or whatever<b>.  </b>It has given a status to the Irish language which was never there before.  We were fighting for it here over the years; we fought for it and spoke for it before the Nice treaty was being discussed.  T&aacute; s&eacute; againn anois.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil s&eacute; mar phointe l&aacute;rnach d&rsquo;aon d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; againn mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge sa chonradh.</P>
        <P>I refer to that latter point and the issue of diversity and language because I want to recall that every time we have discussed the advancement of the European project, I have listened to people talk about how Irish culture would be lost, buried, choked, drowned or whatever, in the broader European culture, but this has not happened, it will not happen and on the basis of this charter, it cannot happen.  The Community has a respect, recognition and a sacred place for diversity and cultural values, for languages, etc.</P>
        <P>I come from the Gaeltacht and I spent my whole working career either as an educationalist, a trade unionist or a public representative.  As an educationalist I struggled to get education included in the treaties.  It was not allowed in the Treaty of Rome but was included in one of the later treaties.  I made a recommendation to two Irish European Commissioners in order to have the matter advanced.  As a trade unionist I fought for the rights that are contained in this charter.  As a public representative I regularly criticised the fact that the elected strata in Europe did not have sufficient input or influence, to coin a phrase, I spoke with sadness about the democratic deficit.  The democratic deficit has been significantly narrowed.  This brings us to a far more democratic Europe than what was there previously.  This should be said loudly and everywhere.</P>
        <P>People have asked what happens if the treaty is rejected.  They are afraid of the obvious.  Nobody wants to say we can come back with Lisbon 2.  I do not know whether it will be possible to come back with Lisbon 2 but I know for certain that with the change of government to the right in Italy and in a few other places, there is not the remotest chance, from the perspective of the left, that a revised treaty would contain the attractions that are in this treaty now.  I will certainly support it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge and recognise the Trojan work he has undertaken in this campaign over the past number of months.  I acknowledge his commitment and dedication to ensuring we will achieve a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State because he has always made himself available to all of us when we are out on the hustings trying to get our message across.  He has always been available to help us along the way.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to speak on this issue.  The European Union contributes to the preservation of the development of common values while respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the people of Europe, as well as the national identities of the member states and the organisations of their public authorities at national, regional and local levels.  The Union seeks to ensure free movement of persons, services, goods and capital.  It is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in light of the changes in society, social progress and technological developments, by making those rights more visible in the charter.  Enjoyment of these rights also implies responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons, to the Com<Col N="71"/>munity and to future generations.  This treaty gives legal status to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  The charter is significant in moving towards a more citizen-friendly Europe.  The European Union now places the individual at the heart of activities.</P>
        <P>The charter consists of 54 articles and is divided into seven sections.  I will not speak about all 54 articles because we would be here until doomsday.  The most important sections are those dealing with dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, citizens rights and justice.  I refer to provisions for the prohibition of torture, respect for private and family life, the right to a remedy if one&rsquo;s rights are violated and the right to a fair trial.  Citizens&rsquo; rights include the right to vote.  The charter will be legally binding on the institutions, on any offices, on the agencies representing the institutions.  There is an obligation on all member states to provide appropriate judicial means to ensure effective protection of these rights and the right to effective remedy.</P>
        <P>The charter includes certain economic and social rights.  It recognises workers&rsquo; rights, the right to information and to consultation, the right to collective bargaining and action.  It protects workers against unjustified dismissal and protects the social rights such as workplace rights as well as the traditional civil, political and citizen rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have listened to the distorted views expressed by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign about abortion and the claim that the charter will interfere with our laws on abortion.  Article 46.2 of the Constitution provides that a referendum is necessary before any amendment is made to the Constitution.  This is my answer and I wish to make it as clear as possible.  Anything to do with abortion has to go back to the national Parliament and to our Constitution.  I have listened to Libertas saying that this charter may have implications such as the internment of children of three years of age.  I cannot see the reasoning behind this argument.  I do not believe anybody in their sane senses will bring up this argument on the doorsteps because it does not make sense.  I have not met this yet at any door and I would be pleased to confront it if I did.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has made a clear statement.  The Government has endorsed the charter.  It is a progressive step for the Union.  We must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;  in order to reaffirm our rights, to reaffirm our status in Europe.  I have no doubt that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will be carried clearly on 12 June.  We must reaffirm our position.  We are a model for Europe, but I do not want to find us being isolated and made to feel inferior should we decide to rebuff this treaty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House.  The Labour Party is grateful to the Leader of the House for allowing a debate on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a key aspect of the reform treaty.  It is a simple and eloquent document containing just seven titles and 54 articles.  These detail an inventory of fundamental rights granted to every citizen of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The preamble to the charter states that &ldquo;Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity&rdquo;.  All of the Union&rsquo;s activities must ensure those basic functions.  My colleagues have spoken eloquently about many of the articles in the treaty, but I wish to focus on four particular areas of the charter: human trafficking, privacy and the protection of personal data, workers&rsquo; rights, and rights to non-discrimination.</P>
        <P>Article 5 of the charter prohibits human trafficking in addition to ensuring the dignity of human beings by protecting citizens from forced or compulsory labour.  It is estimated that over 100,000 people are trafficked through European countries every year, the overwhelming majority being women, many of them very young.  An estimated 78% of those women originate in eastern European countries.  With its established agreements in cross-border policing, the Lisbon treaty will go a long way to combat this horrific problem.</P><Col N="72"/>
        <P>Article 8.2 protects the personal data of citizens.  The charter states that &ldquo;Everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified&rdquo;.  We are now living through an information revolution whereby data is readily available and more accessible than ever before.  Personal or private information is no exception to this reality.  European governments are becoming increasingly concerned with the private information of citizens and residents, so people must be entitled to access, inspect and even correct all that information if it is recorded incorrectly.  The charter guarantees that right.  In an age where various details of a person can end up being filed or even published, citizens must be able to protect their privacy.</P>
        <P>Title 4 of the charter is of great importance.  It consists of a number of articles that ensure modern, just and varied rights for workers throughout the Union.  For instance, the right to negotiate and establish collective agreements is enshrined in article 28, which gives workers in every corner of the Union the right to organise and deal collectively.  Crucially, it recognises the right to strike.  Protection against unfair dismissal is listed in article 30.  This protection for every worker in the Union is bolstered by articles against discrimination that I will refer to in due course.</P>
        <P>Article 34, which has become known as the social clause, is one of the most imaginative and bold aspects of an already comprehensive charter.  It sets out objectives of the Union &mdash; including the promotion of full employment, social protection and a commitment to fight social exclusion &mdash; which will become central points around which all European polices must exist.  An employed Europe is a prosperous Europe, but the charter recognises that when harder times arrive &mdash; as they can in an economic cycle &mdash; every citizen is fully entitled to social protection from his or her government.</P>
        <P>Article 21.1 of the charter, which is a non-discrimination clause, protects the rights of every European citizen.  No person or group of people can associate themselves with anything that makes them unique or special under the law.  Most importantly, no person or group of people can be discriminated against for similar reasons.  The article is even broader in its protection against discrimination than the UN&rsquo;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.  It lists 15 separate categories that go to make up the broadest set of protections against discrimination that can be seen anywhere.</P>
        <P>Article 21.1 states that &ldquo;Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited&rdquo;.  That is just one article within the charter, which is one of the most important parts of the Lisbon reform treaty.  It will establish a standard of European equality, including rights that can be fought for at European level if any country does not recognised them in domestic legislation.  The charter is one of the most positive developments to have emanated from the EU and we welcome its attachment to the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am glad of this opportunity to debate the charter of fundamental rights that is attached to the Lisbon treaty by means of a protocol.  The treaty sets out to bring the EU and its institutions closer to citizens, as well as making itself more relevant to the citizenry of the Union.  The charter helps to do just that.  The treaty itself clarifies and explains what EU citizenship means, it does not replace national citizenship but complements it.  Therefore it is additional to, rather than replacing, an individual&rsquo;s national citizenship.  People may ask what EU citizenship means, why it is so important and what added value it bestows.  The treaty clearly outlines that the EU is a community of values.  Even though it comprises 27 member states with diverse cultures, traditions <Col N="73"/>and backgrounds, they have common values, including human dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy and the rule of law.  More specifically, the charter sets out the fundamental rights and freedoms to which not just EU citizens but also all those legally resident in the EU are entitled.  The Green Party believes this is an very significant and positive element of the overall treaty.  Effectively, this is a progressive bill of rights, which reflects best practice in the many areas it touches upon, including civil, political, social and economic rights.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Those working in the human rights field know there is quite a battle to get states to recognise not just traditional civil and political rights but also to extend that recognition to social and economic rights.  This is what the charter does by enshrining social and economic rights in addition to civil and political ones.  Therefore, the EU will have its own bill of rights.  Although some have said there is nothing new in it &mdash; in a strict sense that is true &mdash; the charter pulls together rights from various international treaties.  The charter has existed since 2000, although it did not have legal status until it was proposed as part of the Lisbon treaty.  In addition, it includes constitutional traditions and provisions of individual member states, some of which are reflected in rights contained in the charter.  Even though they are not new rights, by attaching them to the treaty via a protocol they become more visible, thus providing a focus point around which citizens and others legally resident in the EU can mobilise.  They will be very important in future given the inevitable struggles we witness within states and polities such as the EU, where citizens seek to have their rights vindicated.  Those rights are clearly and visibly outlined in this charter.</P>
        <P>It is important the European Union has taken this step because it has in many ways presented itself to citizens as an alternative to unfettered, free market economic globalisation.  In a sense the EU is a project which sets out to democratise globalisation.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights strengthens the Union&rsquo;s social and environmental dimension, a development citizens should recognise as positive.</P>
        <P>The Green Party welcomes the rights and freedoms set out in the charter.  Chapter 1, on dignity, contains important provisions and rights for citizens and legal residents of the European Union in the area of the right to integrity of the person.  It is made clear, for instance, that in the fields of medicine and biology the free and informed consent of persons is required according to procedures laid down by the law.  The section also includes a prohibition on making the human body and its parts a source of financial gain and prohibits the reproductive cloning of human beings.  Ten or 15 years ago, we would have considered it fanciful and far-fetched to set out such prohibitions in a legally binding charter.  However, owing to recent developments in the area of reproductive cloning and so forth, we now know the importance of establishing them in law.</P>
        <P>Article 4 prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  For those of us who have observed with concern some of the practices accepted in Guantanamo Bay, it is reassuring to note the European Union is firmly and clearly committing itself to such a prohibition.  The prohibition on trafficking of human beings is also important given that human trafficking has became an unfortunate part of the globalised world to which we belong.</P>
        <P>Article 8 setting out the right to have one&rsquo;s personal data protected is also very important.  The House regularly debates the abuses and infringements of the right to privacy in relation to personal data.  This is a strong article which reassures individual citizens that they have a fundamental right to have their personal data protected, access data being collected and have such data corrected in the event that it is inaccurate.</P>
        <P>The Green Party welcomes the rights to education and asylum enshrined in the charter.  It is reassuring to note that no citizen or legal resident of the European Union may be removed, expelled or extradited to a state where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected <Col N="74"/>to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  That is a standard to which this State must sometimes be pushed to observe.  The charter also enshrines the rights of the child and the elderly and refers to the key issue of equality between men and women.</P>
        <P>My sole reservation about the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the reference in the chapter setting out general provisions which, in referring to the scope of guaranteed rights states that limitations may be made &ldquo;only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others&rdquo;.  Certain European Court of Justice rulings, specifically in the Laval, R&uuml;ffert and Viking cases, have been raised repeatedly in the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  It appears from these judgments that the court might be interpreting the interests of business, such as the rights of establishment and to provide services in other parts of the EU, as objectives of general interest recognised by the Union.  Given the tendency of courts to reflect the political consensus of the day, member state governments must make clear that where a conflict arises between the fundamental human rights of citizens and the rights of businesses, the latter must not be seen to win out.  Otherwise, citizens will lose confidence in the European Union, view it as a<?oasys _jy ?>neoliberal project and withhold support from it in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate on a section of the reform treaty which has not yet been discussed in great depth.  Most of the European treaties on which we have held referendums have focused on economic issues.  Greater emphasis should be placed on the importance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the most important part of the Lisbon treaty.  Although the text is primarily focused on economic issues, people have grown accustomed to economic matters and are sufficiently mature to deal with them.  They are not convinced by the wild arguments being made by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side when they set out economic reasons for voting against the treaty.  They have moved far beyond these arguments.</P>
        <P>In the coming days, we must highlight that the Charter of Fundamental Rights affords a range of rights to every Irish and European citizen.  This is the best argument in favour of the reform treaty and I am surprised the media have not focused on it.  The charter is the most radical change in the treaty.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights does not aspire to afford all European Union citizens a set of rights but will, if we pass the treaty, become a legal document providing new rights to citizens.  The importance of the role of Europe in protecting citizens&rsquo; rights was highlighted to me by the case of a lady who, on failing to secure timely access to health care in the United Kingdom, took the national health service, the largest employer to the world, to the European Court of Justice.  She took on the British Government and NHS and succeeded in having her rights enumerated by the court.</P>
        <P>When so-called left-wing groups claiming to campaign on social grounds oppose the Lisbon reform treaty, which will give legal effect to aspirations to secure rights, it calls into question their ideology and reasons for opposing the charter.  If they read the judgments of the European Court of Justice over the past 30 years, they would see how difficult it is for citizens to secure their rights at national level.  One must exhaust national court systems before one can take a case to the European Court of Justice.  The charter will make it much easier to have one&rsquo;s rights protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Charter of Fundamental Rights sets out rights in areas such as employment, health care, education and citizenship.  I believe it will be developed in the years ahead and become extremely important to those on the margins of society who believe they cannot take on the system.  If the ECJ has demonstrated anything in recent years, it is that it allows individual <Col N="75"/>citizens to take on large corporations and state organisations.  Any left-wing group which claims to have a social conscience is a disgrace if it opposes this part of the Lisbon treaty.  The same cannot be said of groups with a more fundamentalist right-wing approach.  Organisations such as Libertas cannot make up their minds on economic matters and produce crazy arguments to attack what they consider to be an excessive number of rights for ordinary people.</P>
        <P>The treaty appeals to the majority of people, the great bulk in the middle who do not belong to the far left or right.  It appeals to those who want everyone, whether here or in the rest of Europe, to be given a fair chance.  This is the essence of the treaty and the issue on which the debate should focus.  As I stated in the House last week, we should focus on the Charter of Fundamental Rights because people will become confused about many aspects of the treaty, including economic provisions.  The most important point is that the charter is not aspirational.   This is not a case of saying it would be nice and woolly if we had something like this.  This will be the law, the foundation of people&rsquo;s rights in the EU for the next 40 years.</P>
        <P>There are groups that would rather see us throw this away.  If anyone ever felt they had a grievance with this State in the next 30 years, he or she would have to go through the tortuous and expensive process of getting justice through the European Court of Justice.  That could be denied to them because some group feels the charter should not be made law.  We should all talk about this and Ministers, from the Taoiseach down, should emphasise the importance of this.  It will not bind people.</P>
        <P>It is in the interests of certain groups such as Libertas to pander to a right-wing, fundamentalist view-point to scare people into thinking we are giving too many rights to people.  This is how some people think but the charter does nothing of the sort.  It makes it easy to prevent people being exploited and to ensure people have access to services that all of us take for granted.  Those who are lucky enough to have an education, experience and contacts can get these things already.  That is what is important about this.  I ask the Minister of State and other Ministers to put the focus on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and make it an emphasis for the next few days.</P>
        <P>The economic arguments have been won and it is time to move onto the social side of what the EU is about.</P>

	<P Just="Left">N&iacute; bheidh orm mo chuid ama uilig a ghlacadh.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Rialtas, a chur na r&aacute;itis seo ar an gcl&aacute;r inniu.  Is deas an rud &eacute; deis a bheith agam mo chuid tuaraim&iacute; a nocht&uacute; sa Seanad ar an gcairt seo, at&aacute; mar ph&aacute;irt de chonradh Liosp&oacute;in.</P>
        <P>I am glad to address the Charter of Fundamental Rights that is attached to the Lisbon treaty.  I have been listening to the debate in my office and in the Chamber and that type of name-calling makes me angry.  Perhaps it is not done intentionally.  Talking about people being crazy is the wrong way to behave in the Upper House of the Irish Parliament.  People have a right to argue their viewpoint, whatever view they come from, that the Lisbon treaty is a bad deal and that we should send our negotiators back to get a better deal for Ireland and Europe.  They have the right to do this and those who are calling them names outside the House and in the media should realise that their own party supporters, who have traditionally voted for that party, are some of those who share the view of Sinn F&eacute;in on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  It is wrong.  If we want to engage in a proper debate on the Lisbon treaty, let us talk about the facts.  I have listened to some of the nice things about the Charter of Fundamental Rights but some of the facts have not come through and it is to this subject that I want to address my comments.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in strongly supports any measures that enhance the protection and promotion of human rights and equality at home, in the EU and in the wider world.  However, the idea that <Col N="76"/>the Charter of Fundamental Rights is somehow a major step forward in human rights is an illusion.  Even its advocates acknowledge that it is little more than a restatement of existing human rights law.  In its analysis of the charter the Institute for European Affairs argues that it &ldquo;does not create any new rights&rdquo; and that the social and economic rights in the charter &ldquo;do not give rise to direct claims for positive action&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>What is missing from the previous speaker&rsquo;s contribution is that the charter is already part of the jurisprudence of the European Union and is regularly cited by the European Court of Justice in making its determinations on cases where the charter has relevance.  Including the charter in the Lisbon treaty will not add to this fact in any way or give additional rights.  The cases to which the Senator refers, of people approaching the European Court of Justice, are already part of the jurisprudence of the EU.</P>
        <P>Some advocates of the treaty, such as Senator de Burca, have gone as far as suggesting that the inclusion of the charter in the treaty will prevent future ECJ decisions such as the controversial Laval judgement.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In making its determination in the Laval case, the ECJ explicitly recognised the right to collective bargaining in the charter.  However this did not prevent the ECJ from deciding that it was legal for the Latvian company to undercut the agreed wages to the Swedish workers in question.  Again, contrary to claims by advocates of the Lisbon treaty, there are no rights contained in the text that are not already provided for by either the Irish Constitution or the European Convention of Human Rights.</P>
        <P>Most importantly, the application of the charter is subject to national laws and customs and the objectives and values of the European Union.  This point is important as it means that access to the rights contained in the charter is reliant on the existence of relevant member state legislation.  The decision by SIPTU to withhold support for the Lisbon treaty until the Government commits to providing new domestic legislation securing and strengthening the right to collective bargaining is a clear demonstration that the charter does not provide any new protection in the field of workers rights, specifically with regard to the right of collective bargaining.  Contrary to the claims made by some trade unionists and politicians, SIPTU, UNITE and the TEEU are clear in their understanding of the limitations of the charter and are demanding greater domestic protection, without which the charter would be worthless.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has a strong record in advocating and supporting human rights, at home and in the European Parliament.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights but would have preferred a much stronger and clearer instrument.  However the suggestion that the charter represents some great advance in rights protections at an EU level is false.  It is more likely that the inclusion of the charter in the Lisbon treaty is a cynical exercise aimed at assisting some politicians and trade unionists sell what is in all other respects a bad deal for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty can and must be renegotiated in order to get a better deal.  The first step is to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June and give the Government the strongest possible mandate to enter any new negotiations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his personal drive and enthusiasm in presenting the case for the Lisbon treaty, the charter we are debating and the broader European political project.  The Minister of State has been in the House on many previous occasions and even his greatest opponents must concede that he has total commitment to the work of the EU and total belief that Ireland&rsquo;s interest is best served by being at the heart of Europe, playing a full and rightful role and not shouting from the sidelines.</P>
        <P>I agree with the initial comments of Senator Doherty, that this debate should not involve name-calling or demonising.  It should be a rational debate on the question before us, the <Col N="77"/>Lisbon treaty, and the part of it we are debating here, the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  There has been much talk about the fact that the question posed to the Irish people is a complicated one.  It is not complicated or complex, it is technical and I have every confidence in the ability of the Irish electorate to understand, to digest and to make a decision.  I hope the Irish people will vote for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing advancement and involvement in the EU by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on Thursday week.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights is a significantly important document.  The previous speaker outlined that it does not change anything in one sense because the rights are already in place and the courts already refer to it.  I do not disagree with that analysis but the Irish people, along with the parliaments of the other 26 countries, are taking a positive step by incorporating this charter into law as part of the Lisbon treaty with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My first trip as a Member of the Oireachtas was in 1988 when I and a group of my colleagues from Fine Gael attended a meeting in the former West Germany.  Part of our trip involved a visit to former East Berlin and former West Berlin.  To see a city, a country and a Continent divided by a physical wall was a frightening recognition of the failure of politics and the despair and destruction caused by a Continent working apart rather than together.  We must all concede that the European political project over the past 20 years has been phenomenally successful in uniting a city, a country and a Continent, and long may that continue.</P>
        <P>If the European Union is responsible for nothing other than bringing together the people of Germany and Europe, east and west, it would be a magnificent achievement.  That must be one of our political starting points but we must go further, work even harder together and co-operate together.  The Lisbon treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights play a significant role in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The language of the charter is enthusiastic and wonderful.  It refers to sharing a peaceful future based on common values and to the spiritual and moral heritage on which the Union was founded.  It speaks of universal values, human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity.  It also speaks about strengthening the protection of fundamental rights in light of changes in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments.  All of that paints a very positive picture of what the charter and the Lisbon treaty are about and about what the people must decide on Thursday week.</P>
        <P>A significant amount of misinformation has been circulated, some of which was deliberate.  It is important we keep addressing the facts and not the fantasy.  When Article 1 refers to human dignity and Article 2 to the right to life, it is disappointing that some anti-Lisbon groups have so brazenly, unfairly and provocatively presented the treaty in such a negative and erroneous fashion.  Surely there is nothing more important than human dignity and the right to life.  A considerable number of decent people have been concerned about the issue of abortion but we can be assured that the pro-life position of the vast majority of the people is protected under the charter and treaty.  The Lisbon treaty fully accepts the entitlement of the people to retain our pro-life amendments, and long may that continue.</P>
        <P>I refer briefly to some of the articles of the charter, including the right to the integrity of the person, the right to marry and found a family, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, respect for private and family life and the right to liberty and security.  They are all fundamental and are protected and expanded under this charter.  I cannot understand how anybody could oppose such developments.</P>
        <P>I take great satisfaction from the references in the charter to the rights of the elderly.  We debated the elderly earlier in the context of other legislation.  I hope the specific reference to the rights of the elderly in the charter will give the elderly in Ireland and throughout the <Col N="78"/>European Union a stronger role in the political life of the Union, greater rights and that our legislation on healthcare, nursing home care, etc., will be seen to respond to this right which is part of the charter.</P>
        <P>We do not have sufficient time to debate the charter in detail but it is a splendid expression of all that is best about Europe, that is, the Continent which has come together after two World Wars and the spilling of the blood of tens of millions of people and which has decided that co-operation and not confrontation is the way forward.  That is summed up in this charter and in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>It is so important the people to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on Thursday week and that Ireland continues not only to play a role but to lead the political process, thinking and co-operation in Europe.  Of all that has happened since we gained our freedom, we can be proud of our involvement in the European Union.  Like Robert Emmet&rsquo;s epitaph, we talk about Ireland taking its place among the nations of the earth but we have only truly done so since we joined the European Union, and long may that continue.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators who contributed.  There is possibly only one thing on which I agree with Senator Doherty and that is that in a democratic society everybody has the right to express his or her opinion.  That is one of the fundamental rights we all enjoy as part of our democracy, and I agree very firmly with him on that.  I also agree that whether people are Fianna F&aacute;ilers, Fine Gaelers, Troskyites or otherwise, they all have the right to express their view.  What no citizen in a democracy has the right to do is to invent stories or truths.  Truths are truths and facts are facts, and facts speak for themselves.  </P>
        <P>The reality is that this charter is a very important addition to European law.  I say that because I had the honour of being the first and possibly the only Irish person to date to hold a human rights fellowship in the United Nations.  It is very important on the international stage that we show what the Union stands for.  The great benefit of the charter and of incorporating it in, and attaching it to, the treaty is that it makes more transparent than ever before those values, freedoms and realities which we, as democrats, whether we agree or disagree on Lisbon, hold true.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of the central features of the Union.  Unlike Senator Doherty, I find myself in complete agreement with the general secretary of IMPACT who described the charter as a prize which had been sought for many years.  Unlike Senator Doherty, I sat through the long discussions in the Convention on the Future of Europe.  Although I was not a member, I sat through the sessions on social Europe because I believe giving a social dimension to Europe is critically important.  I am painfully aware that not everybody in the European Union and not everybody in the political groupings of Europe share the views the Senator and I have on the requirement of a social dimension to Europe.  It would be very unwise to take for granted that an automatic improvement would be gained from renegotiation.  We sought to reach a position of equality between the smaller and larger states in the negotiations and we cannot ask for any more in a democracy.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the charter enjoys near full cross-party support.  I especially acknowledge the very strong role the Labour Party has played in this.  I mention, in particular, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, who I got to know and respect even more than I did previously during the course of the convention.  He was one of the people who very strongly articulated the cause of the charter.  The charter is described as a prize by the general secretary of IMPACT while the general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation said he wanted the Lisbon treaty adopted quickly by member states with the introduction of the charter of fundamental <Col N="79"/>rights becoming legally binding.  I do not want to continuously harp back to Senator Doherty, but the reality is that John Monks knows more than most of us in this House about European labour law.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Bradford that Fine Gael has put a specific focus in its documentation on the need to seek the support of the Irish people for this charter.  It is No. 7 on Fine Gael&rsquo;s list of reasons to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Senators Bradford and Twomey are right to suggest that this issue has not been the subject of sufficient discussion on the positive side of the treaty debate.  At the launch of its campaign, the Progressive Democrats acknowledged the positive role and importance of the charter and recognised that Des O&rsquo;Malley was one of those who drafted it.  Senator de B&uacute;rca rightly made the point that the charter is a glittering political prize for people of her political viewpoint.  I explained in my opening statement that the strengthened status of the charter is a positive aspect of the Lisbon treaty.  It has been argued that the charter does not introduce a raft of new changes.  One should focus on the reiteration of rights, as well as responsibilities in respect of children, we already enjoy.  We have been misled in this debate by those who deny that being more imaginative would not be as easy as it seems.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise what Article 24.2 of the charter says about the rights of the child.  A Senator spoke about the importance of children.  One of the most extraordinary and mendacious arguments that has been made against the charter is the suggestion that the European Union and the democratic parties which represent the wider spectrum of people in Europe are somehow trying to do something in the charter to injure the child.  This argument has not been made by Senator Doherty&rsquo;s party, I hasten to add, but by an extraordinary organisation that seems to have sprung out of nowhere.  This suggestion is somehow insulting to democracy.  Article 24.2 of the charter states that &ldquo;in all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the child&rsquo;s best interests must be a primary consideration&rdquo;.  It is perverse to argue that the article in question somehow gives one the right to incarcerate a child.  I do not aim these comments at Senator Doherty&rsquo;s party.  He has not made the argument in question, which is being promoted in the interests of misleading the Irish people.</P>
        <P>It injures and aggrieves me that there have been so many misrepresentations of the charter.  I refer, for example, to the suggestion that abortion will somehow be introduced into this country on foot of the Lisbon treaty.  It is to the great credit of Senator Doherty&rsquo;s colleague, Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, that she has consistently said throughout the campaign that the treaty has nothing to do with abortion.  One or two Sinn F&eacute;in canvassers on the ground have mistakenly been dragged into this aspect of the debate.  I would like to give credit where credit is due.  When we talk about the charter, as when we talk about the treaty, we have a responsibility as democrats to focus on the facts rather than the imaginings of those who wish to demonise the work of the EU.  One must admit, regardless of whether one agrees with the Lisbon treaty or the charter, that they result from the hard work of many people who are democrats.  The treaty and the charter both come from conventions which were drawn up by elected representatives from the left, the right and the centre across Europe.  The treaty, like the charter, deserves support.</P>
        <P>My personal belief is that the charter is one of the prizes that will come our way if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Senator Bradford made that point.  There are other prizes too.  We will get a more effective, efficient and democratic Union if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We will have achieved all of that while at the same time protecting our own interests, such as our neutrality, our taxation policy and our positive position in respect of abortion.  As someone who is strongly pro-life, I believe Ireland has a positive position on the right to life of the unborn child.  I respect those who may take a different view.  The reality is that the protection of our position is one of the prizes we <Col N="80"/>will get, as a people, if we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to ratify the Lisbon treaty on Thursday, 12 June next.  I thank the Members of the House for their interesting contributions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was suggested on Second Stage that the advertising area as a whole should be examined.  A number of Senators raised the issue of curbing the advertising of alcohol and have tabled amendments in this regard.  We also need to examine the issue of betting.  A number of bookmakers advertise on television.  Recent reports highlighted the problems associated with betting for individuals.  The report states that in many instances betting addiction is a bigger problem than alcohol addiction.  One report suggested that up to 10% of the population are affected by betting addiction.  I accept a great deal of betting is done on-line and as such cannot be easily controlled.  </P>
        <P>Perhaps this matter, which is giving rise to serious problems for individuals and their families could be considered in the context of this Bill as it makes it way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Walsh&rsquo;s proposal.  When flicking through the television channels one night around 11 p.m., I came across an American bought programme which was glorifying betting and poker games.  There appeared to me to be quite large sums of money involved.  Whether they were real, I do not know.  </P>
        <P>I take Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point that there are people who are addicted to betting.  The programme which I saw related to a young female lawyer in America who sued a Casino which continued to offer her facilities to bet when she had exhausted her funds.  Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point is well made.</P>
        <P>Along with a proliferation of drink outlets there now exists a huge proliferation of betting outlets not alone in Ireland but in Cyprus and other countries.  I am astonished by the staggering number of glitzy betting shops which not alone permit traditional betting in respect of horse-racing and so on but permit betting in regard to card games such as poker.  I do not know how they do it.  I strongly support Senator Walsh&rsquo;s remarks in this regard.  Also, I reassure him that a number of amendments in this regard have been tabled.  Senator Mullen has tabled an amend<Col N="81"/>ment in regard to the control of betting outlets while I am much more draconian in that I am seeking that it be totally banned.</P>

	<P>I find it easier to deal with the amendments in this way.</P>
        <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 43, subsection (2), line 33, to delete &ldquo;any hour&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any two hours&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 seek to achieve something simple and practical.  The Bill provides that there should be only ten minutes of advertisements in any hour, a principle which is accepted across the House as being in the best interests of good programming.  We do not wish a total commercialisation of our television stations.  Anyone who has been to America and watched television there will have noticed it appears programmes are interrupting the advertisements.  Nobody aspires to that happening here.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for a maximum of ten minutes advertising in any hour.  It is not mandatory that ten minutes of advertisements be broadcast in any hour.  On the face of it, that is fair enough.  However, there could be exceptional circumstances &mdash; this issue has been raised with me by people in the industry &mdash; where this should not apply.  For example, the Dalai Lama is to be invited to address this House, a proposition put to the House and readily accepted.  If this visit occurs and is to receive live coverage on a given media surely it would wrong to interrupt that coverage with a sequence of advertisements.  It would make sense in that situation that the advertising quota be averaged out over two hours.  This is a simple and practical measure which could apply in respect of a football match, a special event or ground-breaking interview.  We do not need silly examples in this regard.  Are we to interrupt a special interview just to run a sequence of advertisements?</P>
        <P>I am proposing the deletion of &ldquo;any hour&rdquo; and substitution of &ldquo;any two hours&rdquo; thereby providing that in exceptional circumstances there be no more than ten minutes advertising in any two hours.  This would facilitate coverage of for example outside broadcasts, big events, festivals and so on.  Nobody is seeking a <i>carte blanche</i>  for advertisers or radio stations.  I fully support the objective of maintaining a maximum standard.  I have no difficulty with that.  The amendment seeks only to adjust that standard in exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>It would not be in the interests of a radio station to broadcast 20 minutes of advertisements in any given hour.  It is in their interests to balance them out over one hour.  I am sure this is what their clients would want.  The likelihood is that in reality the Minister&rsquo;s objective will be achieved.  My proposal relates only to exceptional circumstances.  It would not make sense not to run the advertisements for ten minutes in any hour.  One hopes that in some instances there would not be ten minutes of advertising within an hour.  We have a horror of those awful stations which, thank God, are not national stations but are beamed to us from satellite, and <Col N="82"/>one cringes at the horrific sequences of advertisements which are awful drivel.  We do not aspire to that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My amendment aims to facilitate programming in certain instances, and the flow and rhythm of programmes.  It aims to facilitate the industry but not to give on the principle or concept in any shape or form.  The practice of a good broadcaster would be to average its advertisements on an hour and its commercial supporters would require that it do so.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the Minister for serious consideration and I ask him to do his best to take it on board to give practical expression in the real world to what is a good concept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment.  I was concerned when I received the initial brief on this in case it meant commercial pressures within radio stations would lead them to seek to increase the revenue by expanding the amount of advertising but this is not the case.  It is exactly as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly described.  From my inquiries I realised that radio stations do not want to increase advertising revenue because over the ten minutes advertising operates as a disincentive to listenership.  Advertising revenue is mathematically related to audience penetration.  Radio stations want to maximise their audience and not put them off by saturating them with advertisements.</P>
        <P>Exceptional occasions do exist and I am not sure they are quite as infrequent as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly suggests.  It may be that they are.  I do a certain amount of broadcasting and on a couple of occasions I filled in for other people with far more glamorous programmes than mine with live feed to Hollywood for the Oscars.  One does not break that because if one does the people on the other end will buzz off.  With regard to coverage of the US elections, stations in the US break in with advertising right at a vital point and this is regrettable.</P>
        <P>The idea of averaging out the advertising time in a manner which ensures no increase in advertising is good.  It would be silly to penalise a station simply because it had an important item and did not want to break the link.  If a programme has a feed from Iraq or Afghanistan by satellite phone and connection is lost it can be difficult to re-establish it.  It might be lost if a commercial break is taken.  This is a reasonable and non-threatening amendment and I hope the Minister will be able to consider it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I met with representatives of the independent broadcasters association who made a logical and cogent case for flexibility in this area from a practical point of view, which was stated by Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Norris.  The suggestion made is for 20 minutes advertisement over two hours rather than ten minutes over one hour.  A variation of this might be to allow some flexibility within the system, such as using eight minutes in one hour and carrying forward two minutes, averaging out over the broadcasting day as not more than ten minutes per hour.  Perhaps the Minister can construct something on this for Report Stage.</P>
        <P>Local radio has been a great success.  Those radio stations have an obligation to produce a certain amount of current affairs programming during the day.  Often, an interesting debate can take place involving people on the telephone.  To break it can lose the audience or the thrust of an interesting part of the debate.  We should avoid taking from the quality of the content.  I do not see the necessity to be rigid.  This case was strongly and fairly made by the independent broadcasters.  As Senator Norris stated, the same principles apply to national radio.</P>
        <P>The Minister may be disinclined to take this amendment on board but he should re-examine the matter.  I cannot see good cogent arguments not to provide flexibility.  It is all about controlling the overall advertising time rather than when it takes place during the day.</P>

	<P>I support the comments made by my colleagues Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Reilly &mdash; who proposed the amendment &mdash; and Walsh.  I was also in touch with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland.  It seems to be a reasonable proposal.  It is a good principle to limit the amount of advertising in any one hour.  However, like many principles it can be stretched to an absurdity.  It would be an absurdity if quality programming had to take second place to the observance of a particular rule when that rule might have been expressed more flexibly in legislation.  This is our opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>Given that the Bill has yet to go to the D&aacute;il, I encourage the Minister to be open to this suggestion.  I know the Minister and his officials have given careful consideration to the proposals and I am sure they also heard from the independent broadcasters.  I cannot imagine a reason not to make such an amendment and on this basis I support it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators make strong arguments and Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s offer of visits from the Dalai Lama is a clever means of enticing me towards a certain thinking.  However, this involves a principle and I do not believe it is absurd to maintain a balance in our broadcasting between obvious commercial interests and our interests which are to represent the viewing public.</P>
        <P>This involves a general principle as to what nature of public broadcaster we want.  There is a possibility of moving towards a model we see in other countries, such as the United States and elsewhere, where advertising has a far more dominant position.  I do not believe making a move in this direction would serve the Irish viewing and listening public well.</P>
        <P>I quite like listening to and watching some advertisements.  One can pick up a sense of what is going on culturally as much from the advertisements as from the programme.  I am not against advertising or commercial and public sector broadcasters raising income from the showing of advertisements.  However, it has its place and should not dominate our programming.  One of the means by which we maintain this is by having a principle of a limit in the hour.  To weaken this principle is to immediately invite all types of special circumstances for which one could argue but which would fundamentally alter the balance.</P>
        <P>There is a world of a difference between advertising at 5.10 p.m. and 6.10 p.m. just after the news or advertising in the few minutes prior to a major football game and advertising an hour earlier.  Any flexibility, the likes of which is suggested in this amendment, would lead to a distorted situation where we would see intensive advertising at key points when advertising is valuable being made up by quieter times when the station has a fraction of the viewers.  Once this is allowed, the commercial instinct will drive towards an intense concentration of advertising at peak periods.  These peak periods can be precise and measurable.  It is right for us to maintain a principle of ten minutes per hour and 15% of programming of the day.  While I listened with interest to the persuasive arguments of the Senators, I am not persuaded.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted the amendment or at least the spirit of it and considered other ways of dealing with this matter.  In light of the fact that the Minister will not yet accept it, we will try further persuasion on Report Stage and I hope the Minister reflects in the interim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated advertisements would be loaded into a prime slot and there would be overloading, which is extremely irritating, particularly on television.  I agree some of the advertisements are very professional.  I am not totally opposed to advertising and <Col N="84"/>advertisements are absolutely necessary, particularly in the independent sector, which is not served by the television licence.  However, our contributions have centred on radio, not television, but the examples given by the Minister all related to television.  Not all broadcasters are as professional as Gay Byrne, with whom I had the pleasure of working from time to time.  He had a genius for bringing an item to a close exactly on the button of the commencement of an advertisement.  Some people go over during live feeds and so on.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s argument about the relative value of the different slots, although initially attractive, is not at all persuasive.  The amendments refer to adjacent hour slots.  We did not refer to a ban on advertising during peak times in the morning and evening and all advertising to be slotted in at 3 a.m. for an hour.  If, for example, advertisements could interrupt a programme in mid-flight to fulfil the hourly quota, they should be aired in the following hour at the end of the interview, which might cause a dislocation in the time loading.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to sensitivity and he treated this subject from an aesthetic point of view.  A number of programmes, especially on talk radio, deal with serious subjects and it would not be appropriate to interrupt them with advertisements.  For example, I will treat the Minister to a little Vermeer scene on North Great George's Street.  A few Saturdays ago I was washing my breakfast vessels late in the morning and I was riveted to an interview between Marian Finucane and the late Nuala O&rsquo;Faolain.  A series of advertisement slots would not have been appropriate during that interview and none was used.  Extremely jarring material could have interrupted an extraordinary powerful radio broadcast.  In those circumstances, it would be appropriate to examine not only the one-hour slot but the two-hour slots and average them out.  The difference in audience participation between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and 11 a.m. and 12 noon is not substantial enough to back up the Minister&rsquo;s case that there would be a loading of advertisements from one hour to the next, which would cause a distortion, for grossly commercial reasons.  That is not the intention.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the response of those who briefed me.  They were horrified and they said they did not want more advertising, as it deters listeners.  My colleague and friend, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, will not press the amendment but that gives the Minister an opportunity to consider the arguments made and perhaps review his position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>On earlier amendments, I stated I was a great supporter of the concept of a film channel.  It is welcome and I congratulate everybody concerned with that initiative.  I am delighted it has been included in the legislation.  Senator Mullen tabled a well thought out amendment relating to a heritage channel.  Amendment No. 105 provides for five minutes per hour of advertising on the film channel, which, at a minimum, would make it self-financing and which would cause little interruption.  I hope the advertising would be run at the end of a film or at appropriate times.  I do not wish to have good cinema interrupted ridiculously by advertisements.  Five minutes per hour with occasional interruption could mean the channel becomes self-financing.  Niche advertising relevant to the audience of the films would be involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The five minutes per hour would readily finance the station and it might even provide for further expansion by the public service broadcaster without over-commercialisation or anything ugly or distorting.  I fully agree with the Minister that we do not want to go down the road of overly commercialised broadcast media.  That is not being proposed and we should adhere to that principle.  That will not be challenged by amendment No. 105, which provides for the film channel to be self-financing and money could be in the coffers to fund another station or other developments in broadcasting.  There is an advertising sector particular to film, which would be happy to pay the money to advertise and the result would only be for the good when it is <Col N="85"/>controlled and considered.  It would not destroy film, the audience or anything else.  This would be positive and a number of advertisers could use this niche channel to reach a target audience.  They might not necessarily wish to advertise at other times of the day or on other stations and, therefore, an additional revenue would be attracted into the broadcasting sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a reasonable amendment but I remind the Senator it states &ldquo;advertisements should not interrupt film showings&rdquo;.  He weakened this in his contribution by saying they could be interrupted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it is reasonable that if a film channel is introduced, it should engage in some element of self-financing.  I am not acquainted with the figures and, therefore, I am not sure whether the advertising proposed by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly would pay for the entire station.</P>
        <P>I am amused and perhaps we will hear more about what niche advertising in this sector implies.  Is it that everybody boozes at home watching huge liquid television screens, which are large and flat and transmit good colour and precise definition and so on?  To make it feel more like a cinema, will popcorn be advertised?  I recall a wonderful film I saw years ago called &ldquo;The Smallest Show on Earth&rdquo;.  It was about a young couple who inherited a cinema, which they mistook to be big and flashy.  It turned out to be a little bijou flea pit.  To maximise their profits, they showed a film about a man struggling across a desert in great heat and conditions of extreme thirst.  They turned up the heating to the maximum and then there was a slight intermission during which the ice cream girl was mobbed.  Is that what is meant by advertising or some equivalent for television?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an interesting section, as it provides for a film channel and an Oireachtas channel.  I wonder how they will be funded.   With the advent of digital broadcasting, there will be an opportunity to roll out more choice.  Reference was made to regional channels, which the Oireachtas channel could become because local authorities will be involved.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I was watching MUTV, the Manchester United channel, and saw advertising on that for golf clubs, as well as a programme on golf.  It strikes me that some of these niche stations could attract niche advertising which might not necessarily go to mainstream channels.  I do not know whether it is allowed.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify whether advertising would be allowed on some of these channels and possibly other channels that might be rolled out.  If not, the question arises as to how they will be funded.  Given the success of local radio and the number of local radio stations, there is great potential in this section to roll out many new Irish channels which would reflect the culture and heritage of the country.  Through satellite technology, we now have myriad foreign channels, some of which are fairly alien to what we stand for as a people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of Senator Norris&rsquo;s point about radio advertising, the same principle applies.  Radio has an even more powerful effect.  The connection to the radio in our kitchen, car or bedroom is far stronger in many ways.  It goes right into one&rsquo;s mind and is a connection that is particularly important to the Irish people.  In every house in this country throughout the day and evening, people return to radio as a key communication in their lives.  </P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>It is appropriate for us to define and limit the advertising input, not because I am against advertising, but because it breaks that communication.  The one thing about radio advertising that irritates me is when the advertising break is too long.  I get deeply frustrated because I want to get back to the communication for which I am looking.  It could well be in the short-term interest of a particular station to apply such a policy but it is not in the long-term interests of radio in this country.  It is our job as regulators to set the long-term interest.</P>
        <P>I imagine that there is a world of difference between radio advertising between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., and 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.  If I was an advertising manager and was given complete freedom, I would stack my advertising between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. because my audience is much larger.  Perhaps I would not do so if I was the controller of the station in the long run.  I do not want to hear more than ten minutes of advertising while I am putting toast on, feeding the kids and am in a hurry.  In such situations I want the content and the connection.  In those circumstances, it is right for us to put a limit on advertising in the long-term interests of radio and television in this State.  We must recognise that there is a limited pool so that those stations that are the best and get the largest audiences will get the higher price for an advertising slot to make them commercially viable.  Simply spreading it out into larger and more flexible mechanisms will not necessarily expand the pool of advertising that is available.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the chance to speak on the concept of the film channel in respect of this amendment.  It is a new channel in a new broadcasting era.  We have what is known as the long tail in communication terms.  Previously the vast majority of the population&rsquo;s broadcasting viewing, listening or reading was concentrated on a small number of channels and outlets.  This is changing radically with the development of the Internet where one can access a range of different channels and supplies of books.  One is not limited to one&rsquo;s local bookshop anymore because one has a huge choice available on the Internet and through different providers.  One&rsquo;s interest might be in a very small and specific niche area but it can now be served.</P>
        <P>This is a similar concept in terms of the development of the film channel.  We are not necessarily looking for a mass audience.  Within such a channel, we will often look for niche audiences that might not otherwise be served in a commercial television world.  We have the opportunity with such a channel to show world cinema.  This might be of real interest to certain immigrant communities in this country.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen asked whether we would have programming with a religious content.  We could look for something that some people might consider to be an utterly non-commercial niche area in which nobody is interested.  With this channel, we could have a slot where one could show such a film that might be of interest.  I do not want to restrict the editorial freedom of the organisers of this channel by putting commercial advertising into that mix.  As sure as night follows day, that would colour some of the editorial decisions one would make in terms of what niches one wants to serve, whether it is commercial or what sort of viewership one will get.</P>
        <P>It is far better for us to create a new public service channel that will be very creative in how its resources can be used.  Advertising will not pay for such a channel but the channel could take advertising revenue from some of the other channels that are already dividing up that pie.  This channel will not be expensive to run.  The reason one gets this long tail development is that the cost of digital platforms is a minute fraction of what it cost previously to broadcast a television channel.  This is particularly so when one is dealing with something like film where one has long sections with the material already available so one does not have to do considerable production or processing work with it.</P><Col N="87"/>
        <P>As a State, we have already invested hundreds of millions of euro in tax breaks for the film industry and other support measures we have given to studios.  We have hundreds of films gathering dust in the archive that will never be used unless we take them out, convert them to digital form and give them a platform.  The costs are minimal.  We are talking about a small studio space that allows a simple introduction facility and gives viewers a short history of a film, for example, that it was made in 1950 in Waterford.  Perhaps only 5,000 people will watch it.  Perhaps only Waterford will tune in that night but that is a great service to the people there.  One goes to the Waterford newspapers and says &ldquo;Do you know what is coming up next week?  A picture made here back in 1950.&rdquo;  Otherwise, the film will not be shown but it will be of interest to those 5,000 people and would be a real service.  Perhaps 5,000 Chinese people would watch a Chinese film in the afternoon.  Perhaps we will go to the colleges involved in making all sorts of short films and productions and tell them they can put them up on our film channel.  Perhaps only 1,000 relatives, friends and college mates of the people who made that film will watch it, but they will be proud because their work has been shown.</P>
        <P>Those are the possibilities we have in this new long tail broadcasting environment.  More than anything else, film fits into it because it is an hour and a half of production that is already available to us.  We will not be making films; we will show them.  This can be done very cheaply and is better without advertising because it gives us real freedom to be creative and innovative and to provide thinking television.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister said about the film channel is very interesting and exciting.  On the basis of my own experience, the Chinese, with whom I am quite familiar because Chinatown is at the bottom of my street which is Parnell Street, already get Chinese films so I do not think 5,000 Chinese people will watch whatever RTE or anyone else can dredge up because they are already running.  I frequently see them in the little restaurants.</P>
        <P>The Minister addressed the earlier point in a very interesting way.  The BBC used to be the broadcasting equivalent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was unarmed and had the proud boast that it did not have advertisements at all but now it does.  The BBC has advertisements on its international service which are mainly for banks and big institutions like that so advertising has penetrated there.</P>
        <P>What we were talking about, as I understand my brief, was a situation which would not be a particularly regular one but which might occur from time to time.  Supposing there was a four-minute advertising slot, it would run over on the hour, for reasons Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Mullen and I have already suggested.  In other words, if, because of a very important interview on a news programme, one started the advertisement sequence at 9.58 p.m. instead of 9.56 p.m., there would be no technical infringement by leaking over into the next hour.</P>
        <P>How will this be policed?  Will there be a monitoring service?  In many ways, I would like to think there would be.  I am a great fan of RTE but I do not think they listen to themselves.  Sometimes they go off the air, one gets bleed from another studio, music pops in unexpectedly, one hears conversations between presenters and so forth.  It seems that nobody in RTE is actually listening and I would like the Minister to explain, in order to make sure this is efficient, if there will be an agency monitoring broadcasts.  How will we be able to tell if the advertisements go over time or are broadcast at an inappropriate time?</P>
        <P>Such monitoring seems to be a useful option and perhaps could operate like the telephone-based home security services.  Companies offering such services send the garda&iacute; to one&rsquo;s home if one&rsquo;s alarm is activated but if they send them out on a false alarm more than three times in six months they cancel one&rsquo;s cover.  That is an option which could be examined.  Let us imagine a would-be margin of appreciation whereby a radio station that had a current affairs obligation allowed occasional leaks of advertisements from one hour to another.  If there was somebody <Col N="88"/>monitoring the broadcasts, we would know if such leakages were on the cusp of the hour or not and a system of three, six or eight strikes and the station is out could apply.  I ask the Minister to explain how he will know if there are infringements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Minister&rsquo;s objection to the amendment but surely it is possible to either accept this amendment or  change it to ensure it does not allow the situation to which the Minister referred whereby broadcasters could consciously and premeditatedly load advertising into a particular hour slot.  Surely it is possible to legislate to allow for the situation whereby, in the interests of good quality broadcasting, one can, on an occasional or emergency basis, allow for a programme to run on and to make up the advertising time in the next hour, but not to allow broadcasters to market their advertising on that basis or to sell it at a particular price, based on such a commercial strategy.  I would have thought it was a simple matter of drafting to allow for the exception, namely, not to stretch the principle to the point of absurdity but to legislate for the exception while making it clear this cannot become part of a commercial drive of the kind the Minister suggested, whereby there might be no advertising between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and a glut of it between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.  As I said already, I would have thought it was a drafting matter.</P>
        <P>I was very interested to hear what the Minister said regarding the Irish film channel and I am a fan of what he is talking about.  However, it prompts me to refer back to the heritage channel which, as some of my colleagues mentioned, was proposed in an amendment I tabled earlier.  It seems the spirit the Minister is seeking to promote is a respectful focus on the small communities here.  It is a very good idea to look out for niche groups and give them quality programming which stimulates and interests them.  That is what I had in mind with the proposed heritage channel except that I argued that far too often we cater for niches who are politically influential or powerful from the point of view of advertisers.  My suggestion regarding the heritage channel would, like the Minister&rsquo;s Irish film channel, be low cost to a considerable degree in that it would draw on the RTE archive.  Also, it notes the fact that as people grow older &mdash; although it would not focus just on older people &mdash; they are more likely to watch television during the day but we easily forget their needs.  The Bill as it stands does not even provide for consultation with older people.  I welcome what the Minister of State said earlier regarding a possible review of section 96 providing for audience research and allowing for consultation with older people as well as children.</P>
        <P>Given the Minister was not in the Chamber earlier, I would like to briefly revisit the subject of my proposed heritage channel.  Broadcasting is a communications business and communication is complicated.  The Minister did not give me any comfort that my proposal might be considered but the <i>Irish Daily Mail </i>reports his spokesman as saying that the Minister would examine the amendments with interest and investigate whether the new digital output would have capacity for the heritage channel.  The Minister made my day. I had the second sausage on reading that.  However, I am left wondering whether the Minister is really going to consider my proposal.  I ask the Minister to revisit the issue, not only because he was not here during that section of the debate, but because the type of thing to which he is aspiring with the Irish film channel is exactly what the heritage channel would be all about.  It would attend to the needs of different groups like tourists in Ireland, the Irish abroad and older viewers.  I have visited people in nursing homes and wondered why they had to be subjected to &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo;.  It is fine if it is their choice but surely we can have family-friendly viewing for nine, ten or eleven hours a day, drawing on archive material, our great cultural tradition and heritage of ceol traidisi&uacute;nta, drama&iacute;ocht, cl&aacute;racha faisn&eacute;is and of course, putting on specific programmes directed towards the greying population.  However, I am anxious not to ghettoise the proposal because such programming would be of interest to a much wider community than <Col N="89"/>merely older people.  I apologise for that little side bar intervention but I thought the Minister might like to make some reference to the matter, given how related it is to the spirit that animates his proposal regarding the Irish film channel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this issue.  With regard to the film channel, his argument is reasonably persuasive in that the only cost really is the transmission of the films, which may be two or three hours long.  I can see that it would not require much ongoing expenditure to run such a channel.  </P>
        <P>We had a debate earlier about the heritage channel, a sports channel, a GAA channel as part of the heritage channel and so forth.  We also talked about the Oireachtas channel and the necessity of making it interesting, particularly in the context of local and regional television, via the involvement of local authorities.  If we transmit the Oireachtas and council meetings only in session and leave it at that, we will sell it short.  If we want to make it a success, we will have to go further and include interviews and encourage public participation at local level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the general policy on options for channels?  Is it decided on a case-by-case basis?  Many options have been mentioned already but a very obvious one would be a European channel.  We do not really get a lot of exposure to mainland Europe through our own television network.  If Mr. Gordon Brown sneezes, we hear about that and if something happens in the United States, we hear about it too.  However, when it comes to other European countries, we have very limited coverage, unless there is a disaster somewhere, like an aeroplane crashing.  We should encourage a European channel of that type.  The only thing that would remotely reflect what I am suggesting is the French news service broadcast by TG4 very late at night, when most people are in bed, which is a very good service.</P>
        <P>We need more exposure to mainland Europe.  We had a debate earlier about the Lisbon treaty.  If people here could be connected on a daily basis with interesting issues in other European countries, the connection with the whole concept of the European Union would be enhanced.  However, I do not think such a channel would run unless it was supported by funding from the Exchequer through the television licence, or through advertising.  I suggest to the Minister that advertising is a good means, in a controlled way, of providing those types of extensions to the broadcasting media that are highly desirable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more in agreement with the Minister than my two colleagues on this side of the House.  I ask the Minister, however, to reconsider amendment No. 105 and advertising on the film channel.  Programmes broadcast on public service stations &mdash; not the core ones but stations such as TG4 and TV5 &mdash; need support.  I recall the excitement when the UK&rsquo;s Channel 4 was established.  It moved from an arts channel to &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; and so-called reality television in the most surreal environment.  Film4 is a film channel showing modern and good quality films with advertising.  Its advertising does not have the same format as TV3&rsquo;s.  When one watches a film on TV3, there is an advertisement every 12 minutes which makes one lose the run of the film.  Film4 has an advertisement every half an hour and it does not feel the movie is being constantly interrupted.</P>
        <P>The Minister used the term &ldquo;world&rdquo; when describing the format of the film channel.  I know what world music and films are but I am not sure the world does.  If the same idea is used to support making local films of a cultural and artistic nature for this channel, it will need funding.</P>
        <P>This channel will begin with large public support and the Minister will be well-congratulated.  However, when the mandarins who decide how much money goes where on an annual basis get their hands on this channel, it will become like the Asgard list.  Who will care if &euro;100,000 is dropped from the channel&rsquo;s funding as only 5,000 people watch it, despite it being important to them and our cultural values?  The Minister has proposed the establishment of an oversight <Col N="90"/>body to ensure the moneys provided for the channel are properly spent within the Minister&rsquo;s objectives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is tradition?  Tradition was once somebody&rsquo;s good idea.  If someone produced a 20-minute film in Waterford 50 years ago, can someone afford to do it now?  Could this money be used to support the making of local community world film-type movies?  While such a mechanism may seem similar to the Arts Council, I am not suggesting we replicate this.  I am thinking of films that are reflective of local culture or history but are not commercial.  These would be films that would not be made by large film-makers or shown in cinemas but are nevertheless important.  Would that be good enough reason for the Minister to accept Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment No. 105?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding the question of radio advertising and the hours between 7 o&rsquo;clock and 8 o&rsquo;clock and 8 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o&rsquo;clock, with commuting times, there is little difference between these two times.  Radio advertising is sold on a time-slot basis.  Prime slots attract a particular rate.  It is not conceivable that anyone could make the argument that there was an accidental overrun necessitated by a particular non-recurring circumstance.  They could not make the case that it was accidental if they were selling it.  The only advantage to a station would be if it were selling it as prime time slot.  It could not honourably or legally do that.  That, I believe, counters the Minister&rsquo;s argument.  The Minister claims this is done to generate extra revenue.

	<P>No one is looking to hammer or punish an accidental breach.  The Bill sets out that the compliance committee would look to the adherence of duties, codes and rules for broadcasters and it will carry out similar work to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  It will carry out random checks on an intermittent basis to see what advertising is being carried.  It is not going to pick up on an accidental breach and call the Minister urgently that Gaybo has run on into the 9 a.m. slot.</P>

	<P>The nature of these codes is that there is an authority that applies them.  Where there are routine and flagrant breaches, it would take a certain decision.  I am sure it would have ways and means of dealing with such cases.</P>
        <P>The proposed Irish film channel will also run popular and commercially successful movies which will be typically Irish.  This concept came from the Irish Film Board which recognised the large store of brilliantly crafted Irish films that will attract an Irish audience.  In many of these cases, the film was not commercially successful because it did not have, say, a distribution agreement.  The film will be shown on the channel which will not be commercial and not carry advertising.  As well as the benefit of not influencing editing decisions, such a set-up will be easier to sell to the industry.  Rather than having a film languishing in the Irish Film Board&rsquo;s archive, it has proposed this outlet.  The channel could also broadcast, say, a French film at a certain time in the morning which schools could use.  Another time slot could be used for a particular age group for a movie they might not see on other channels.  One can do all sorts of things so long as it is cheap.  One of the principles of this type of channel in this new digital platform is not to break the budget because it will not be big.  There will not be the annual row with the mandarins, as one Senator said, because the nature of what we will be trying to do is to use what is already easily and freely available.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement which promotes the merits or otherwise of fortune-telling services, psychic services, palmistry or tarot card services.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments deal with a number of related areas.  Amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 31, relate to section 41 and amendments Nos. 33 and 36 relate to section 42.  Section 41 deals with advertising.  My proposed amendment No. 27 deals with the broadcasting of advertisements which promote the merits or otherwise of fortune-telling services, psychic services, palmistry or tarot card services.  Amendment No. 28 is related.  Amendment No. 31 deals with the promotion of sex services.  Amendment No. 36 deals with section 42 which deals with broadcasting codes and the area of sexually explicit advertising.</P>
        <P>What I am proposing here is to delete a section of the Bill relating to religious advertising and to replace it with a proposed ban on the advertising of the kind I have described, promoting the merits or otherwise of fortune-telling services, psychic services, palmistry and tarot card services.  My second amendment proposes to delete subsection 41(6) in light of the previous amendment proposed.</P>
        <P>Subsection 41(4) currently provides that a broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement which addresses the issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation.  This is qualified somewhat by subsection 41(6) which says that nothing in the aforementioned section would be read as preventing the broadcasting of a notice of the fact that a particular religious newspaper, magazine or periodical is available for sale or supply or that any event or ceremony associated with any particular religion, will take place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am proposing the deletion of the subsection which prohibits the broadcast of an advertisement addressing the issue of the merits or otherwise of adherence to or becoming a member of any religion.  I am linking this with a proposed ban on advertisements which promote the merit or otherwise of fortune-telling services, etc., because the two are connected.  Taken together &mdash; the presence of one ban and the absence of another &mdash; is not only very revealing of perhaps a certain mentality that as a society we have slipped into, but is also quite unjust when one considers the ramifications of it.</P>
        <P>The ban on advertisements for membership of a religious organisation or becoming a member, made a lot of sense at a time when Irish society was more homogenous than it is <Col N="92"/>today.  The Constitution provides for freedom of expression and freedom of religion.  We could see the advantage of such an exclusion of this kind of advertisement when we were a more homogenous society because people would find it rather difficult and it would be controversial to have advertisements of the kind that could proselytise.</P>
        <P>I argue that the situation has changed; we live in a more heterogenous society.  In light of what is now permitted to be advertised on television and radio, it is bizarre that we should still have such a ban.  It is all the more bizarre when one considers that the State has set up a structure for dialogue with religious organisations and other faith-based and philosophical bodies, including humanists.  There is a recognition of the public value of religious adherence.  Despite the many controversies over the religious dimension of Irish society in recent years, few would deny the enormous contribution made, not just within the Catholic tradition but in all the traditions, by committed people of faith.  I refer to the role of religious orders in the provision of education, health and other services in the State.  It is not beyond argument, and people will courteously disagree on different aspects of what they have done, but by and large, the service to Irish society has been phenomenal.</P>
        <P>Given the current situation, it is bizarre but one could probably have an advertisement on television for a book like <i>The God Delusion</i>, in which Richard Dawkins sets out to debunk religion but one cannot have an advertisement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I might agree to disagree on that.  One cannot have an advertisement for the Franciscans who might want to advertise or encourage people to consider vocations to the religious life.  This suggests to me that a new intolerance has taken hold, almost by accident.  What was originally a very sensible exclusion of a certain kind of advertising is now acting in a quite oppressive way.</P>
        <P>It is in this context that I ask the Minister to consider the even more astonishing anomaly that there is no proposed ban in this Bill, unless my amendment is accepted, on psychic services, tarot cards and such like.  People who live for others, who do not charge money, who promote a communitarian-based vision of society, may not advertise their way of life.  However, others purport to tell you what will happen in your life tomorrow or next week and they prey on the gullible.  We have heard in recent times just how much these psychic services and these supposed tarot card operators and various such tellers of the future prey on gullible, vulnerable people and some people have lost astonishing amounts of money when they have dialled up these services hoping for good news about their future and so on, only to be exploited.  It was recently stated by one of the operators of these psychic services that he never used them himself.  It reminds me of the story of the clairvoyant who was sacked by the tabloid newspaper.  She was informed of the news by the editor in a letter in which he began, &ldquo;As you will have no doubt foreseen, we will be dispensing with your services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a parable of our individualistic society that people who adhere to a particular vision of life which happens to be a religious vision with which not everybody need agree, but who none the less promote a message that is broadly speaking one of harmony and solidarity, may not advertise themselves as membership of their organisation or way of life while these charlatans can advertise as they do.  I have not seen them on RTE but I certainly have seen them on other channels, including TV3.</P>
        <P>There is another anomaly to be found in the ban on religious advertising and the way in which it is qualified.  The legislation purports to allow a religious newspaper to advertise for sale or supply or that a particular event or ceremony associated with any particular religion <Col N="93"/>can be advertised.  On one reading of the Bill, however, this means that <i>The Irish Catholic</i> can say it is on sale, but cannot say &ldquo;New survey says religion is good for you&rdquo;.  That would be prohibited under the legislation, at least on my reading of it.  Presumably also, the Archbishop of Dublin could advertise that a Corpus Christi procession is taking place somewhere in the city but he could not say, &ldquo;Come along; you&rsquo;ll have a great time&rdquo;, because that would be promoting the merits of the religion.  It would be like the GAA saying, &ldquo;Come to Croke Park to see the match next Sunday&rdquo;, but not saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a great day out&rdquo;, because one cannot promote the merits involved.  How ridiculous would that be?  Meanwhile, another more secular newspaper could advertise a feature in its weekend edition saying that religion is going down the tubes.  We have an anomalous situation therefore because the Government is trying to re-establish healthier lines of Church-State dialogue, recognising that the plurality of faith communities and humanist communities is good for civic society, yet those people are hobbled in advertising terms.  Others who exploit people by charging a fortune for tarot cards, psychic services and palmistry, are not so constrained, however.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 31 provides that, &ldquo;A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement which is directed towards the promotion of sex services.&rdquo;  It would be easy for politicians to be concerned about being considered moralistic.  Not too long ago, however, Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I spoke on the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act and tabled amendments that would have criminalised those using persons involved in prostitution.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole eloquently observed that there was an anomalous situation whereby pimps and prostitutes could be criminalised but not their clients.  On that occasion I asked, as did other Senators, what message that sent out concerning women&rsquo;s dignity and the respect that is due to people in this society.</P>
        <P>It is remarkable that it is lawful to run advertising, albeit late at night, which is targeted at vulnerable, sad people, inviting them to spend lots of money on the telephone to talk to somebody who supposedly is interested in talking to them.  It is time for some leadership, which is why I have tabled these amendments.  As I said on Second Stage, I do not consider it paternalistic to table such amendments.  It is allowing media operators to be paternalistic for us to abandon the field and not legislate in the common good.</P>
        <P>In summary, I am asking the Minister to scrap the restriction on religious bodies from advertising membership.  I am not suggesting that there do not need to be controls of a certain kind, but I am sure it is not beyond the genius of the Parliamentary Counsel to provide a legislative framework for bona fide advertising, if that is what these organisations wish.  I have not been lobbied to date by any of them to argue for it.  As a matter of civil rights, however, they should be allowed to advertise.  I cited the simple example of the Franciscans who might want to promote vocations to the religious life.  There should be some mechanism whereby it is possible for them to do that.  By the same token, we should move to exclude the possibility of advertising by charlatans who hold out sexual, fortune-telling or other nonsensical services to vulnerable people to raid their pockets by holding out some kind of false hope in their lives.</P>
        <P>I have no problem if people want to establish such channels, but we are talking about public service broadcasting.  For example, one could have a gambling channel which would be available to people on a pay-per-view basis whereby they make a conscious decision to buy access to it.  Channels that come into an ordinary person&rsquo;s living room, however, which they might just happen on at night because they pay the basic television licence, should be regarded as privileged space.  We must ensure there is nothing on those channels at any hour of the day that is based on falsehoods or false promises, which exploits people or promotes negative attitudes to other citizens.  I am moving the amendments on that basis and I hope they will be considered favourably.</P>

	<P>They were predicting it earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If we were to start gagging the psychics in this great House, we might have some very silent debates indeed.  I agree with Senator Mullen that the Franciscans should be allowed to advertise for vocations.  If they want to tell us that it is one true, Catholic and apostolic church, I do not have a problem with that either, but neither do I have a problem with psychics selling their services.  They might be right sometimes.  The amendments before us go too far into regulation.  These issues could best be dealt with through the advertising standards process.  I agree with what is in the section concerning advertising for a political end, but any objections of mine would have more to do with the political process than with content.  Generally speaking, I am satisfied with that section.  Psychics have been dealt with efficiently and effectively by investigative stories, newspaper comment and radio and television programmes.  We do not need to do it.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made a strong point in commenting about restrictions on a group, such as a church, putting forward a point of view.  I do not see why anybody should object to that and neither do I see why it creates a problem.  If people want to advertise a Corpus Christi procession or some aspect of church community life or church beliefs, they should be allowed to do so.  Any kind of restriction on that is impossible in a republic.  As I have said many times before, there must be room in a republic for the woman who used to sing the rosary down in O&rsquo;Connell Street as much as for elected public representatives.  Once one starts trying to stop people from doing this, that or the other, it is dangerous territory.  I am uncomfortable with it and I do not want to go down that road.</P>
        <P>I would be concerned, however, if the content of the Bill prevented members of a religion from talking about or expressing aspects of their religion.  Religion is a personal choice and in a free society I would be uncomfortable with any aspect of controls or regulations which prevented the active participation in religion, if that is Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point.  We do not need to be proactive but if it is the case that an interpretation of the section has the consequence as outlined by Senator Mullen, I would be concerned about it.  I would not be concerned about psychics, however, and would let them at it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Senator Mullen is using this amendment to make an ideological point and there is merit in some aspects of it.  I was rather surprised, however, to hear him &mdash; even with a sense of irony &mdash; appearing to equate the Roman Catholic Church with tarot cards, fortune tellers and that sort of business.  From time to time, I have criticisms of the Vatican and even of the distinguished hierarchy of this country and some of its organs but I would hesitate to put them at that level.  Senator Mullen is a braver man than I am.</P>
        <P>It is true that members of the public are routinely gulled by people who present themselves as being able to forecast the future, read palms and so on.  These activities, for example, reading the horoscope in evening newspapers, are often harmless but they become inimical to people&rsquo;s interests when considerable sums of money are extracted from people through telephone charges and the lengthy introduction and preamble one has before getting to the meat of the situation.  This practice has been exposed on radio programmes and by investigative journalists and I understand the communications regulator has intervened on occasion.</P>
        <P>I assume the same circumstances apply in the case of sex services, although having not called them, I am not 100% sure what they are.  I might try to do so this evening &mdash; prompted by Senator Mullen &mdash; to find out what takes place.  I imagine the process is similar to the other practices to which the Senator referred.  I am not sure if it involves telephone sex or whether tarts are available on the other end of the line.  I imagine the telephone sex lines operate in exactly the same manner as tarot card lines, with callers being required to go through a long build-up during which they are asked whether they are sitting comfortably or what is the colour of the wallpaper and told the weather is nice.  They might then be told by the person on the end of the line that they are feeling warm and will now remove a glove &mdash; that sort of thing.  The whole point is not so much to get one excited but to keep one on the telephone for as long as possible.  If the caller gets too excited, it all might come to the boil which would end the conversation.  I am not sure it can be taken entirely seriously.</P>
        <P>While I would not be very happy with the idea of proselytising, it would not bother me that much if it would satisfy some people.  However, it would be an extraordinary device and one I would not like if politically motivated religious groups had an opportunity to intervene in political matters and use paid advertisements to attempt to influence decisions from outside the House on what are viewed as moral matters, such as sex services or whatever terms are used.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mullen on one point.  I remember a number of occasions on which perfectly reasonable advertisements, some of which were religious, were refused on RTE.  It was prim of RTE to exclude these advertisements in the manner it did.  It was wrong also not to allow radio advertisements for concerts organised to protest against the Iraq war.  People do not have to go to such concerts and it was not as if the organisers were making arguments in paid advertisements, which merely stated that those who opposed the Iraq war might like to attend the concert.  The advertisement was banned.  On balance, Senator Mullen has raised a point, albeit one that is not as substantial as he believes and is likely, if the discussion is prolonged, to lead to levity and low humour in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will confine my remarks to amendment No. 33.  I do not see a great deal of difference, other than the inclusion of the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;, between the amendment and the wording in section 42(2)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).  I welcome the inclusion of these two paragraphs.  It would be wrong of the House to introduce provisions preventing broadcasters from making critical comments or implied criticism and we would be accused of censorship and ridiculed for doing so.  Equally, however, it is unacceptable that broadcasters can peddle personal prejudice in their programmes.  There is a justifiable expectation that comment will be fair and reasonable and programmes impartial.  That this expectation will be underpinned in legislation is welcome.</P><Col N="96"/>
        <P>I am concerned that in many cases broadcasters do not need to display prejudice on air as they can promote their personal bias and prejudice in editorial and topic selection.  The provisions of section 42 should be extended to cover this practice because by setting their own agenda, broadcasters can influence important social issues and promote their personal bias.  The principle of impartiality should apply not only in broadcasting but also in the editorial and selection of programming.  I strongly welcome the inclusion of this desirable and necessary provision in the Bill.</P>

	<P>While I believe we could amend the legislation to permit this type of advertising, I am concerned by the possibility that removing a prohibition on religious advertising could be used by the Church of Scientology and other sinister sects to influence young people in a negative manner.  Senator Mullen clearly has no such ambition and I support his objective of clearing the way for the Franciscan order or other Christian groups to advertise a positive community initiative or recruitment campaigns which are good, wholesome and socially worthwhile or at least provide an alternative for people.  However, we must also prevent circumstances arising in which a vulnerable teenager could be lured by means of subtle advertising into a group which could keep him or her under effective house arrest for a number of years.  The Church of Scientology is the organisation which comes to mind.</P>
        <P>On the potential of chat lines to exploit vulnerable people, in the course of my constituency work I came across a case of a family which was landed with an astronomical telephone bill because a young member of the family had been calling chat services advertised on satellite channels.  The family was living in marginal economic circumstances and I, as a public representative, mediated with Telecom &Eacute;ireann, as the company was known then, on the family&rsquo;s behalf.  There is scope to provide protection against such circumstances.</P>
        <P>I empathise with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point that there also is scope to provide protection in the case of tarot card lines where people are being charged very expensive tariffs.  I accept Senator Norris&rsquo;s point that this activity can be harmless and people who believe in fortune telling, a light-hearted activity which is not inherently wrong, can go to festivals and so on.  If a sinister type of advertising is used to promote these lines, however, premium rate telephone charges are applied and, as Senator Norris noted, one must first listen to a long introduction costing up to &euro;7 or &euro;8 before hearing the message one seeks, which may not be good news.  It is an expensive activity which merits restriction.</P>
        <P>While I do not have a problem with benign or positive religious advertising being placed by religious groups which do good, I have a problem with some religious organisations which could advertise if we are not careful.  I have no problem with the avoidance of expensive telephone chat lines or tarot card lines which cost vulnerable people a lot of money.  There is a sense of Irish fun about people going to the Ballinasloe horse fair and going to a fortune teller in a caravan.  It is a tradition that goes back to pre-Christian, pagan times.  It is in our culture and there is nothing malevolent in it.  As a local representative I have come across cases where the chat lines that cost a fortune have caused hardship to vulnerable families.  There are sad people who are using them, as Senator Mullen says, and it is tragic when people are lured into it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank my colleagues for their comments, particularly those that were supportive.  I am a little disappointed by some of the comments because when we make light of psychic services in that way, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole appeared to do, it can have a chilling effect on legislators trying to legislate in the public interest.  We are talking about channels coming into people&rsquo;s living rooms, not pay-per-view.  We are operating in a world where people of all ages are watching television at all hours of the day.  Although I have an amendment that refers to a watershed of 9 p.m., in many ways watersheds are a theoretical phenomenon because people are watching television at all hours of the day.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly outlined the way in which people can be vulnerable and be gulled, and how young, immature people can spend a fortune.  That was a much more healthy contribution than that of my esteemed colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who gave the vaguest hint that telephoning psychics is a bit of fun.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have no problem with people going into Gypsy Lee at the Ballinasloe horse fair.  The question is whether Gypsy Lee can advertise on television.  I ask people not to be nervous of protective legislation.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole talked about going too far by way of regulation but Senator O&rsquo;Reilly more correctly points to the fact that there are vulnerable people in society who get hurt in different ways.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole would be the first to come into the Chamber and speak strongly in favour of the consumer if we were talking about false advertising of some product.  This is exactly what is going on in respect of psychic services.  People are being told that they can have certainty about their future lives and are being encouraged to pin their hopes on it at considerable cost to themselves.</P>
        <P>That is my major theme, religious advertising is a minor theme but the contrast is remarkable.  One is legal, the other is not.  One is in the public interest, the other is not, but it is the one that is not in the public interest that is allowed to operate untrammelled.  It is interesting that RTE has no truck with this advertising but other commercial stations do.  I encourage the Minister to state that this is an area that must be examined.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris suggested I was making an ideological point.  I do not know what he means by that.  My only ideological point is that we should not be afraid of having the law exercise a protective effect where, in the case of tarot cards or sex chat lines, people are being exploited.  Their personal sense of inadequacy is being exploited and their pockets are being filleted at the same time.  In the case of chat lines there is the collateral damage of objectification of women in particular because it tends to be women that one is invited to dial up late at night.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Can we move beyond these fears?  These debates suffer from a backwash from the 1960s, when people were scared stiff of moral debate because they thought it was taking us down the road of having to subscribe to some religious dogma.  We have moved on from that.  Ireland is a free country, and always was, but never more than today are people free to choose how to live their lives and to what values they adhere.  Can we get back to the discussion on legislating in the public interest to protect the more vulnerable members of society?  It is not good enough to suggest the television advertising of high-cost services offering to tell people about the future is some harmless fun when we hear repeatedly of vulnerable people being gulled into spending large amounts of money.  Are we so market-oriented that we do not care about that and are happy for it to go on?</P>
        <P>Let me give the House proof that we should consider restricting this area.  I do not suggest that there should not be channels for which people can pay to have access to these services but we are talking about the public thoroughfare in broadcasting terms.  Is it not interesting that although we show the races on a Saturday and give the betting prices, we never invite people to dial a number at high cost to place a bet on Lucky Lad?  We recognise that there are people who would gamble away a lot of money, not only at their own expense but at the expense of <Col N="98"/>their loved ones.  We make a distinction, the law does operate in a protective way and we do establish standards.  It is not for any desire to recreate a nanny state that I put this on the agenda.  I do so because it is in the public interest.  The debate deserves better than the nudge-nudge, wink-wink, &ldquo;This is all a little bit strict, Reverend Mother&rdquo;.  That is not where we are at in the 21st century and we should legislate in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s point that if we were to lift the ban on religious organisations advertising membership or merits, there would have to be a regulatory structure.  This is where codes come in, it is not a question that the law would establish a free-for-all.  Given that the State has established a structure for dialogue with religious organisations and non-faith based organisations, it has a mechanism to decide what groups it does and does not talk to.  By the same logic could we not have a code permitting certain kinds of ads and excluding others?  Judgment calls must be made.</P>
        <P>I have referred to tarot card and chat lines.  I have two other amendments that are being discussed in this group.  One relates to fairness and balance, a proposed amendment to section 42 of the broadcasting code, the other is an amendment to section 42.  The broadcasting code deals with advertising and I have suggested the insertion after section 42(2)(<i>f</i>) of: &ldquo;A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement which is sexually explicit in nature,&rdquo;.  Everything that I have said in respect of chat lines can be applied to this without my going on <i>ad nauseam</i>.</P>
        <P>The rationale involved is about the law exercising a protective effect with confidence, not worrying about the sneers.  We already have codes on alcohol advertising to the effect that it should never promote sexual or social success.  By the same token, and given the fact that watersheds are increasingly a theoretical concept and people of all ages watch television at all hours of the day, our legislation should specifically prescribe that advertising should not be sexually explicit in nature.  This can be characterised as a narrowly moralistic aspiration but I remind Senators, not that they need reminding, that to do otherwise would be to condone exploitation.  We have had the debate on trafficking and we know that women, in particular, are exploited in the sex industry, which is run on trafficking.  Anything that adds to that by engaging in the exploitation of people, especially women, is not in the public interest nor is it conducive to the common good.  Under our employment law, the display of sexually provocative or explicit posters or calendars in the workplace can constitute sexual harassment.  By the same logic, is it not a form of public harassment to engage in advertisement which is sexually explicit?  I am not saying there is a huge problem in this area at present but we might be getting there, particularly as broadcasting services become more commercially driven.  An axiom in the advertising industry is that sex sells so for that reason, we should have a specific legislative bar on advertisements which are sexually explicit in nature.</P>
        <P>Turning to the issue of fairness and balance, I propose the deletion of paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of section 42(2), which relates to broadcasting codes.  I propose that all news broadcast by a broadcaster be reported and presented in a balanced, objective and impartial manner.  The word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; appears twice in my amendment.  The reason is that the issue of balance is a very controversial one.</P>
        <P>During elections, referenda or in situations of intense public controversy, complaints about impartiality are often made.  I have tabled another amendment which refers to the need to speed up adjudication on such complaints.  I believe the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme engaged in discussions with women who had abortions and had not regretted them a day or two before the 2002 abortion referendum and before there could be any redress on the balance front.  It was a highly ideological intervention in a matter which was to be determined by the people.  That type of thing goes on from time to time.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>I hope one does not have to be a social conservative on some issue to see the point because it is visible from outer space.  I mentioned on Second Stage that RTE&rsquo;s former director general, Bob Collins, said in the wake of the divorce referendum that if somebody had come down from Mars, he or she would never have thought the referendum result would be as tight as it was given the type of media coverage of the issues at the time.  I hope people on all sides of the argument would be willing to be authentic liberals and see that there has been a problem in this area in the past.</P>
        <P>As I said on Second Stage, it is not only in regard to controversial social issues that this arises.  There may well be other bodies who feel that broadcasters and public service broadcasters steal a march sometimes and allow their own agenda to be set in the context of supposedly fair and balanced coverage.  The absence of any clear obligation on RTE &mdash; I would argue there should be one &mdash; to provide urgent redress in such situations can allow individual broadcasters to conduct totally partisan and biased interviews, for example, on the eve of an election or referendum even though a moratorium is supposed to be in place &mdash; I gave one such example &mdash; safe in the knowledge that no redress can be sought until it is too late.</P>
        <P>I am aware of occasions where people have made complaints to RTE.  They have received letters which state it must be fair and impartial but that it does not have to be balanced.  It has sought to be &ldquo;Jesuitical&rdquo;, if I may use that word, on the issue of its obligations to balance.  Senator Alex White is a former producer with RTE and I look forward with interest to hearing what he might say on this amendment if he speaks on it.  There has been a repeated failure on the part of our public service broadcaster to ensure objective and impartial programming.</P>
        <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that he was promoting a light regulatory touch and he sought to reassure us that fines would not be too punitive in certain situations.  However, the possibility of financial penalties where there is a failure to comply with broadcasting duties, including the issue of balance, needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>Only in the past couple of weeks there were debates on stem cell research and same sex parenting and those debates were not balanced.  Whatever one might think of the issues, where one introduces a real life, emotionally wrenching story and then tries to have a two person interview, supposedly to debate the intellectual dimension when the emotional agenda has already been set, is a very subtle kind of agenda setting and I do not care whether it is the liberal or conservative side of the debate which is on the losing end on any occasion.  It should not happen.</P>
        <P>My amendment would require a very explicit commitment not only to fairness and objective and impartial programming but a guarantee of balance.  In considering this amendment, will the Minister consider the precise mechanism under which this commitment to balance would be brought about and more thoroughly enforced than has been the case to date?</P>

	<P Just="Left">What constitutes an advertisement on radio, for example, with these soothsayers, fortune tellers and so on?  Sometimes they will say that if one wants to telephone the programme, one should telephone a particular number.  Is that an advertisement?  We need to look at this issue.  I am a little concerned about people who are moulted for large sums of money.  However, I believe that is already handled and we may be using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.</P>
        <P>I am slightly concerned that Senator Mullen appeared to say it did not matter if people accessed gambling and other channels if they paid for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I will clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="100"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That would seem to sell out the principle regarding the sex channels and telephone lines as well.</P>
        <P>I use the word &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; and do not see anything wrong with it.  It is a neutral word.  &ldquo;Ideological&rdquo; could be used as a word in a negative fashion but it need not necessarily be.  To say that an item is ideological means that it is formed as a result of a systematically formulated response to a situation and it may well be in concert with other people&rsquo;s ideas and so on.  I do not necessarily believe it is always a bad thing.  Certain positions I would take could be described as &ldquo;ideological&rdquo; but it does not mean they are inappropriate or incorrect.  I would certainly espouse a left-wing ideology, and I am utterly unashamed of that.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I have not observed the nudging and winking nuns to which Senator Mullen referred nor have I had the pleasure of seeing the various referendum phenomena which he apparently viewed from outer space.  I have not been there so I do not know whether they are visible from outer space.</P>
        <P>In regard to amendment No. 33, the business of balance is a moot one.  It is important things are objective and impartial but sometimes this notion of balance can be abused just as much as the question of impartiality.  In other words, to give equal weight to an absolutely unsustainable view logically and every other way seems daft.  It is this old stuff about there being two people in it or that one is as bad as the other.  That is not always the case.  I refer to this idea of a kind mechanical balance.  I understand the idea of balance but it is covered by impartiality and fairness.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even in regard to the expression of a broadcaster&rsquo;s view, I agree with Senator Mullen in that it would not matter to me whether it was a right-wing or left-wing view or whether it was ideologically or not ideologically driven.  Sometimes it is quite interesting to hear a broadcaster&rsquo;s view.  I quite like to hear it and it does not matter whether I agree with him or her.  Perhaps this is a weakness in my argument but I would probably agree with most of the people who come to my mind straight away.  It would be a pity not to have the views of people like  Robert Fisk or Tony Benn or people of interest on the other side aired.  I do not see why they should not express their views.   I am happy to hear the expression of a broadcaster&rsquo;s point of view, as long as he flags that is what it is.  I do not like the points of view of broadcasters to be presented to me as facts.  That is the danger.  It is sometimes better for one to be told by a broadcaster &ldquo;this is my point of view&rdquo;.  One can then add a few pinches of salt to what the broadcaster says.  If broadcasters were not permitted to express any point of view, it would be terribly bland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have reflected on the question of religious advertising.  It may help the debate for me to point out that, as the Minister may be aware, an EU court authority is considering the proposition that it is lawful to exclude religious advertising from public broadcasting.  I do not have any of the relevant papers with me.  This matter has been the subject of some discussion and controversy at EU level.  I have some sympathy for Senator Mullen&rsquo;s argument in this regard.  Superficially, it seems reasonable to suggest that it is somewhat excessive to say one can never carry an advertisement advocating a particular religion or religious viewpoint.  I suggest to Senator Mullen that if we move towards a regime in which religious advertising is allowed, we will inevitably change the manner in which the broadcasting sector engages with religion and religious topics and controversies.  Not only will such issues be the subject of controversy and debate in current affairs programmes, but they also will be the subject of advertising.  I respectfully ask Senator Mullen to pause for a moment to question how such a move would change the character of broadcasters&rsquo; engagement with these matters.</P>
        <P>In fairness, Senator Mullen has not proposed a similar deletion or amendment in respect of political advertising.  Many of the same issues arise in that context.  His argument does not fall <Col N="101"/>down because of his failure to propose the deletion of references to political advertising.  An analogy can be drawn between the two.  I would be resolutely opposed to any suggestion that our broadcasters should be allowed to carry political advertising.  One only needs to examine the position in the United States to see that the manner in which politics operates and is funded is transformed when political advertising is a factor.  There is a marginal risk that if we were to provide for or allow religious advertising, the bigger, more powerful and better funded religions might prevail in such circumstances.  I am putting that out as a thought.  Senator Norris mentioned earlier that RTE has been a little too restrictive on one or two occasions when interpreting the question of what constitutes an advertisement advocating a religious position.  RTE might have been a little more generous in its response to a request to advertise a certain book, for example.</P>
        <P>The second issue I would like to address is the question of balance in programming.  A Senator mentioned that I worked as a radio producer for ten years.  I gained some experience from that background.  I do not suggest that I have a particular interest to declare in this regard, as 14 years have passed since I worked in broadcasting.  When people ask me whether I miss RTE, I have to remind them that a decade and a half has passed since I worked there.  It is not as if I have a direct involvement in RTE, although I am interested in the subject of broadcasting.  I would like to respectfully say to Senator Mullen that I am opposed to the introduction of the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; to sections 39(1)(<i>a</i>) and 39(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill.  As Senator Norris said, public and private broadcasters have to give coverage to a wide variety of opinions and arguments, including those which may seem extreme or one-sided.  They can do that as long as a regime is in place to ensure a measure of fairness and impartiality across each broadcaster.</P>
        <P>I would like to give the example of an interview about the Lisbon treaty on tonight&rsquo;s 9 o&rsquo;clock news.  That might not be a particularly good example at a time when we are just over a week from the referendum.  I do not think anybody feels a strong view on either side of the debate on a big issue of public concern needs to be immediately balanced with the opposite view.  Audiences are sufficiently sophisticated to tell that someone they hear on the radio is strongly in favour of or against a certain proposition.  People tend to have a reasonable expectation that the strong views they hear will be matched at some point by similarly strong views from the other side.  That might not happen tonight or tomorrow night &mdash; it might happen on some other evening.  We can rely on the good sense and professionalism of broadcasters to ensure the overall sweep of the coverage of any issue is balanced.  Senator Norris hit the nail on the head when he suggested that the notion of a &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; balance is completely anathema to the concept of a free press or, in this case, free broadcasting.  We must give broadcasters some latitude.  The quality of our broadcasting system would be undermined if we were to provide that there needs to be balance within a half-hour or one-hour programme devoted to a person with strong views on one side of a controversial issue.  Senator Norris mentioned Robert Fisk, but one could think of many other examples.  It would be wrong to advocate such a mechanical way of managing broadcasting.</P>
        <P>I respectfully remind the House that the wording of sections 39(1)(<i>a</i>) and 39(1)(<i>b</i>) is familiar to broadcasters.  A similar wording was used when changes were made to the Broadcasting Acts in the 1970s.  A great deal of it was used in the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960.  It has served us well.  People will continue to make complaints when they feel a debate is focused too strongly on one side and is not balanced with the other side.  I do not wish to belittle what Senator Mullen has said when I say I have often found that people tend to perceive an imbalance in the context of where they are coming from themselves.  It may sound patronising, but I do not mean it like that.  When people are genuinely upset, they have a right to make a complaint.  A comprehensive complaints system, which I welcome, is carefully provided for in this Bill.  It would be wrong of us to require what Senator Norris has rightly called a &ldquo;mechan<Col N="102"/>ical&rdquo; type of balance in each programme.  It would change the nature of the news and current affairs sectors of our broadcasting system.  I have given my observations in respect of these amendments.</P>

	<P>The amendments before the House relate to codes.  The children&rsquo;s advertising code has already been drawn up.  We are seeking to continue to develop such codes under section 42(9).  Some of the provisions which have been suggested are contained in the existing codes.  There are restrictions in the codes on one&rsquo;s ability to advertise that one can tell the future and to accrue commercial benefits from such advertisements.  The interest that has been shown in the debate we have had is an indication of the importance of this area, which is difficult to legislate for.  The crucial assessments of programme material and content that need to be made are subjective.  That this is such a complex area supports the case for the use of codes, which can be amended, updated and monitored, as opposed to the introduction of legislation.  Work is needed to put in place an authority and a system of compliance. It does require judgment.  </P>
        <P>We could say in respect of recent examples that people got it right or wrong.  The religious area was mentioned in this regard.  This works better when an independent body rather than legislators make some of those margin calls or attempt to foresee what margin calls might have to be made.  That is the purpose of the authority.  It will also set out the codes within the broad constraints we have set.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the codes come up for review we, as legislators, like anybody else, will be able to make submissions and suggestions in regard to how they should be updated and improved.  I was involved in such a manner in the children&rsquo;s advertising code.  A  mechanism exists for the continual updating and amending of the codes.  A question arises in regard to the broader issue of what direction we should give to the new authority in regard to political and-or religious advertising.  As I understand it, the religious advertising code, as set out in the Bill, dates back to 1960 and was certainly in place from 1988 onwards.  In regard to the political code restriction, the general direction from the Legislature is that we should not open up political advertising as it would be almost impossible for an authority to judge the political aspect of such advertisement and to make calls in terms of whether it is accurate, inaccurate, acceptable or unacceptable.  It is a difficult and grey area.</P>
        <P>A similar situation would pertain were we to give to a regulator or authority the responsibility to assess religious advertising following the removal of any restriction.  In essence, religious advertising deals with metaphysical issues for which I contend it would be difficult for a regu<Col N="103"/>lator to set codes.  I say to Senator Mullen that we should be careful here because unintended consequences could ensue from good intentions.  Senator Mullen cited his experience in America where the intermingling of politics and religion has taken on a consequence not alone for politics but for religious communities.  One could foresee circumstances, following the removal of a restriction, where it would be difficult, given we are speaking about metaphysical issues, for a regulator to impose certain restrictions.  For instance, a wealthy church from outside the country could decide on a missionary basis to canvass here in a way with which we would not be comfortable and we would not be able to restrict it.  The same would also apply in respect of religious messages.  I harbour a concern that we would be creating a difficult situation for a regulator in that the regulation of that type of advertising <i>per se</i> might  be difficult.</P>
        <P>Senator White is correct that the prohibition which we are continuing has been upheld in the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights when tested.  The debate is interesting and worthy.  However, my instinct is to be cautious and careful in terms of whether we should open up advertising to political and religious content in particular and, at the same time, to ensure we do not restrict even the faintest reference to religious or political activity or event.  We must rely on the regulator to interpret our intent and to represent the public in a flexible manner.</P>
        <P>The amendments are well grouped.  The issue of whether current affairs and news broadcasting should be balanced relates to code.  What we are proposing in this Bill &mdash; it is an innovative measure &mdash; is the establishment of a broadcasting code to complement advertising and other codes which provide a mechanism for a check on what broadcasters are doing.  Section 42(2)(<i>b</i>) provides that the broadcasting treatment of current affairs, including matters of public controversy or the subject of debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcasting matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner and without an expression of the broadcaster&rsquo;s own views.  One could argue whether &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;fair to all interests&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>People could contend that circumstances can exist whereby the truth is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest.  Surely, in news and current affairs broadcasting, the search is for the truth.  We must ensure we do not let the search for a good story get in the way of the truth.  We know that in politics as in elsewhere when one is acting politically one is looking to hammer one&rsquo;s opponent and to make the facts fit into a good story.  I imagine the instincts of those involved in broadcasting are similar.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>People chasing a good current affairs or news story may tend to continue on that route and thus lose sight of the truth.  I am concerned about this.  We must ensure news and current affairs broadcasting is accurate and truthful.  Whether that is encompassed in the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; or is represented by &ldquo;fair to all interests&rdquo; is difficult to know.  This is a matter for which it is difficult to legislate.  It is appropriate for us to set into a code the long-established rules in regard to broadcasting duties and to allow for them to be applied by a regulator.  It would be difficult to find the appropriate wording which would allow us to legislate that people should seek the truth.  It is the job of politicians to be brave and to challenge something in the media which they know to be inaccurate.  A healthy tension exists between politics and journalism in this regard.</P>
        <P>I listened to the debate with interest.  However, I am reluctant at this stage to accept amendments given we are dealing with complex, important and crucial issues.  While the debate has been worthwhile and useful, I am reluctant at this stage to amend the codes as set out in the <Col N="104"/>Bill.  While many of the codes will allow us to achieve what we want we must leave it to the authority to establish, monitor and implement them.</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  I do not wish to hold up the House.  This is an important issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris rightly sought clarification on the subject of gambling.  I was not suggesting it would be right for people to be  provided with numbers which they could dial up in order to gamble.  My point is that the channels which people receive simply by having a television in the House should not and do not provide for gambling services.  By extension, we should exclude advertisements for psychic services, the promotion of sex services and so on.  I do not blame the Minister for not addressing that issue in his reply.  Perhaps he will address them now.</P>
        <P>It would be censorship to suggest people could not subscribe to particular channels or pay extra to receive certain television channels which may provide these kind of services.  My point is that we should treat ordinary accessible channels as a public thoroughfare to be respected and monitored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Alex White&rsquo;s raising of the issue of political advertising was thoughtful.  However, I believe there is a distinction to be drawn here.  Political advertising relates to who gets their hands on the levers of power to regulate people&rsquo;s lives whereas religious advertising relates to people making, as the Minister rightly said, metaphysical propositions.  Here is the interesting matter.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s concern about unintended consequences and I stated earlier that given it is possible for the Government to establish a structure for dialogue in which it engages with certain people and not with others, then it is not outside the bounds of human ingenuity for us to similarly provide for certain types of freedom for certain types of religious organisation.  This is not something which we would specify in legislation.</P>
        <P>If we are worried about the unintended consequences to people of allowing certain religious organisations, such as well-funded sects from abroad, to advertise and people are that much in need of protection why are we not worried about the impact of tarot cards and psychic services?  Why are we not worried about the impact of advertisements directed towards the promotion of sex services?</P>
        <P>On the issue of balance, the fundamental philosophical issue all of us must consider is whether we believe a problem has existed with regard to fairness and balance in terms of the representation of certain ideas and values particularly on issues of public controversy.  It is easier for those on the liberal side of the argument to think there has not been a problem because by and large the coverage of these issues by our public service broadcaster has tended towards their point of view.  I do not ask anybody in the House to take my word for it.  I gave the House the words of Bob Collins, the former director general of RTE.</P>
        <P>On Second Stage, I mentioned an excellent chapter, namely, &ldquo;The Discordant Drum&rdquo; from <i>Jiving at the Crossroads</i> by John Waters.  It discusses how people were preached at by a Dublin 4 elite for many years on a range of issues.  If one does not see the problem, one does not see the point of this amendment.  I ask the Minister to consult widely on this issue prior to Report <Col N="105"/>Stage.  There is a strong feeling among many decent members of society that we have not had balanced treatment of certain issues.</P>
        <P>What is missing from the Bill is the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; and, interestingly, this is the word cited by RTE where it states it is not required to be balanced.  We should not prescribe every detail of this in legislation.  However, we could consider having a body which would have the right to examine the matter if a complaint is made.  For example, it would be good if an independent body could consider a complaint made with regard to coverage of stem cell research and have the right to examine six months&rsquo; coverage of the issue by RTE and make a judgment on whether all sides of the argument were properly respected.  If they were not properly respected, it should be within the remit of such an independent body to levy a fine.</P>
        <P>My amendment does not provide that every programme must be balanced, rather it provides that all news broadcasts by a broadcaster be presented in a balanced manner and, more generally, that broadcast treatment of current affairs be balanced.  It is a carefully worded amendment and with great respect to the Minister I do not believe I heard a good reason from him for not including the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Prior to Report Stage, will the Minister come up with something new, innovative and reforming to reassure many Irish people that their most cherished values are not treated with contempt in RTE or journalism generally but that stringent requirements exist for honourable treatment of sensitive social issues with the possibility of penalties where such honourable treatment is not forthcoming?  It is not a lot to ask.  It promotes harmony in society when one tries to ensure with a slightly heavier touch than has been the case heretofore that there is fair treatment of various legitimate points of view on sensitive social issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confine myself to two specific points.  I was not completely supportive of the earlier proposition of the amendment by Senator Mullen.  However, he made a point which struck a chord with me.  Some of these advertisements take advantage of vulnerable people.  This is incontrovertible.  In the Bill, the Minister has outlined that we will have a specific prohibition on advertising certain foods which target children.  We will do this because it is against the interests of the child and children are vulnerable and need protection.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With regard to the advertisement of sex services, I started with the view that adults can make choices for themselves and have entitlement to do so.  However, this loses sight of the fact that some sections of society are extremely vulnerable and at certain stages of their lives people may be susceptible to this.  I have come across people who accumulated substantial bills in this area because when they were at a low ebb it seemed like a comfort or escape and they had no one else to talk to.  As a consequence they were taken advantage of.  There is no doubt that this happens.  If we have an obligation, it is to protect the vulnerable in society.  The Minister might usefully examine this area to see whether there is an element of truth in what was said in this regard and introduce an element of protection, without necessarily having total prohibition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to amendment No. 33 and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;, I probably did not make myself clear when I spoke earlier.  I intended to put a question to the Minister to elicit a response because this is an important point.  I do not fully support the point made by Senator Mullen that we must add the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; with regard to individual programmes.  A requirement already exists for them to be objective and impartial and when it comes to current affairs and controversial matters that they be fair to all interests concerned.  I welcome the inclusion of this in the Bill and compliment the Minister.  It is a significant initiative.</P>
        <P>Broadcasters are human beings like all of us.  They have their prejudices and biases.  They have issues and agendas which they want to promote.  The producer and presenter can select a <Col N="106"/>liberal or conservative topic and the participants in the discussion.  In this selection process, the broadcasters can plough their prejudices even though the broadcast can come across as objective, impartial and balanced.  This is the lacuna in the Bill.  If we feel, as the Government obviously does as it included this clause, that we want matters to be presented in an objective and impartial way because this is the essence of public broadcasting then we need to extend this.</P>
        <P>I suggest to Senator Mullen that the word &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; may be more appropriate in section 42(2)(<i>f</i>) rather than in sections 42(2)(<i>a</i>) and 42(2)(<i>b</i>).  It stresses the desirability of maintaining the independence of editorial control over programme content.  In exercising this independence there should be an obligation to be balanced.  The question I wanted to put to the Minister earlier was whether he feels we need to extend it so that for the programme to be objective then the foundation stones upon which the programme is built must be balanced.</P>

	<P>I will limit myself to stating I will take into account what was stated and re-examine the wording.  My instinct is that &ldquo;fair to all interests&rdquo; is as close to &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; as makes no difference.  I must examine the difference whereby Senator Mullen stated he received an answer from RTE that it does not need to be balanced.</P>

	<P>The situation is one of ministerial availability and the fact that at this stage and after opening up the debate earlier today and resuming at 7.30 p.m., we have reached amendment No. 27 of 130 amendments.  It does not seem technically feasible to reach all those amendments this evening.  Neither is it in the tradition of this House to put in place a guillotine.

I do not know if the word &ldquo;conclude&rdquo; was used on the Order of Business.  In that sense, the House could decide to finish its business at some stage.  On the other hand, the point made by Senator Cummins is correct.  It might be unfair for people who have already made diary arrangements for tomorrow afternoon in that sense.  Perhaps that is the in-between position.  Some closing time should be agreed tonight but that the debate would not necessarily resume tomorrow afternoon.  That is unfair on people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment No. 28 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 29, 32 and 35 are related and will be discussed together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 44, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(7) A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement, promoting alcoholic beverages, which is aimed at minors.</P>
        <P LI="2">A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement promoting alcoholic beverages before 9 p.m.</P>
        <P LI="2">Any advertisements for alcoholic beverages shall not encourage immoderate consumption of such products.</P>
        <P LI="2">A broadcaster will ensure prior to transmission that any such advertisements conform with appropriate broadcasting codes.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Some Members will argue this matter should not be provided for explicitly in legislation but in codes for advertising.  I contend, however, that the issue of alcohol abuse in our society is so serious that we as legislators need to make prescriptive statements in our broadcasting legislation.</P>
        <P>I note the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to examine the banning of junk food advertisements aimed at young people.  On the immoderate consumption of junk food or the immoderate consumption of alcohol, there is no doubt about which poses the greater danger to young people in our society.</P>
        <P>The Government is concerned about the problem of drink.  Legislation is proposed to restrict to some degree the sale of alcohol.  Alcohol is an issue on which we as legislators must be determined.  We must attack the way alcohol is supplied to young people, even if it means the Garda using underage people to purchase alcohol to identify such shops.  The harder task, however, is to tackle the demand for alcohol.  It goes deep in our culture with the immoderate consumption of alcohol associated with many different occasions in Irish life.  Some Members have expressed concern about the link between alcohol advertising and sporting events, for example.</P>
        <P>The watershed is increasingly becoming more of a symbolic gesture considering the lifestyles people now have.  People of all ages watch television at all hours of the day.  This is linked to changes in family lifestyle, some of which are not for the better.  An increasing number of young people have unsupervised access to television at late hours of the day.  On Second Stage, I pointed out how television was a great gift to society but we never learned to use it and be discriminating consumers.  The watershed, it can be argued, is an artificial distinction to provide that there would be no broadcasting of advertisements for alcoholic beverages before 9 p.m.  It would, however, be a start and a statement from us that legislation is not just about pandering to commercial interests but the common good.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris also has an amendment on this issue which goes further than mine.  Mine is a limited strike and I ask the Minister to look favourably on it.  The control of alcohol advertise<Col N="110"/>ments would signal a serious intent on the part of the Government and the Legislature to bring about lasting change.  We need to act more radically than we have done to date in tackling alcohol consumption patterns.</P>
        <P>The other parts of the amendment provide that advertisements for alcoholic products conform with appropriate broadcasting codes.  Codes already provide that advertisements for alcoholic products should not be associated with sexual or social success.  It would be timely for us to examine the current practice of alcohol advertising because it still manages to convey ideas of social credibility and kudos.  Some advertisements show people doing stunts on their way to enjoy a pint.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for remaining to take the Adjournment of the House despite the late hour.  I await his response to the issue of homelessness.  The true extent and scale of homelessness in this country is grossly misunderstood.  A total of 6.9% of households are living in constant poverty.  Homelessness is evident on the streets in villages, towns and cities throughout the country.  One only need walk across the road down Molesworth Street and Dawson Street to see homelessness at first hand.  In 2005, 185 individuals were sleeping rough in the city so I expect that figure is much higher by now.  We need to stand side by side with charities such as the Simon Community which are committed to eradicating homelessness.  It is not good enough to aim only at reducing homelessness.  The number of people who are homeless each night on our streets is growing and 46% of these are aged between 26 and 39 years of age.</P>
        <P>It is predicted that we are set to face an enduring economic recession.  With the price of oil at a record high of $138 per barrel and the cost of food and other consumer goods soaring, there is a frightening tenor to the Government&rsquo;s tune that previous targets to help homeless people will not now be met and homelessness will fall off the Government agenda.  This is my grave concern.</P>
        <P>The Homeless Agency partnership action plan on homelessness aims to have eradicated homelessness in Dublin by 2010.  There has been inter-agency long-term professional planning around the provision of housing for the most vulnerable, but there is uncertainty now about Government funding.  The recent revelations uncovered by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; indicate that the Health Service Executive has substantially cut its funding to homeless services and this cannot be justified.  Social inclusion is no longer a priority for the HSE.  In this time of growing economic uncertainty, it is imperative that the funding is provided for these essential services.</P>
        <P>The Simon Community is at its capacity and urgently needs more resources.  I am speaking specifically about the Simon Community in the midlands.  Since 2005, that charity has contended that a service for homeless people in the Athlone area and in Mullingar is an urgent priority.  Planning has been undertaken and it was hoped that the service would be in operation from <Col N="111"/>September onwards.  I believe the service in Mullingar is ready to proceed.  However, no operational budget has been published by the HSE.  I am aware of an inter-agency strategy but Government budgets do not complement this strategy.  None the less, I hope this will happen.  There needs to be certainty and assurance for charities such as the Simon Community to help them follow through on their professional long-term planning.  They have been working on planning with the HSE and the local authorities for many years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the national strategy on homelessness is to be launched in a few weeks.  Along with other agencies I welcome this but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Will the provision of funding and resources and timetabling for delivery of services be announced at the launch?  There must be guarantees from Government to support the agencies in their work.  Will the Minister outline exactly when the new buildings in the Athlone area and in Mullingar will be suitably staffed?  The HSE promised it would provide the staff for these facilities, but nothing has been done.</P>
        <P>We cannot allow people to continue to live on our streets without shelter, food, warmth, education and all the basic necessities we take for granted.  We are talking about people, not percentages and statistics.  The Government and the HSE must continue to play a central role.  The State has a duty to protect and vindicate the rights of all citizens and this extends to homeless people.  They have equal rights.  The Government is failing the homeless and denying them their rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The HSE in its research conducted in July 2005 recommended a dedicated service in the Athlone area.  The midlands Simon Community aims to have this service operational in September 2008.  Despite the high level of inter-agency working and planning undertaken at a local and regional level since 2005, an operational budget has yet to be confirmed by the HSE.  The stark statistics show that the average mortality rate for homeless people is 42 years.  This is a crime in this day and age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue of revenue funding for the provision of care staff in shelters for homeless adults.  The provision of revenue funding for in-house care staff in homeless shelters and outreach health services to homeless adults is managed by the Health Service Executive.  The provision of capital funding for the accommodation of homeless adults is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities, as is the funding of non-care staff.</P>
        <P>Funding to local authorities for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons has increased significantly since the adoption in 2000 of the integrated strategy on adult homelessness.  A sum of &euro;15.8 million was provided in that year, increasing to &euro;52.9 million in 2007 and amounting to &euro;366 million in total over the seven-year period.  This has delivered a wide range of accommodation and services for homeless persons throughout the country, from emergency hostels and transitional accommodation programmes to outreach and resettlement services and long-term supported accommodation.</P>
        <P>In the period 2000 to 2007, &euro;171 million in revenue funding has been allocated for the provision of health services to homeless adults.  More than 2,000 individual beds and 180 family units in 145 projects have been provided with this funding.  Primary care services such as dental, general practitioner, nursing, chiropody, alcohol detoxification and counselling services have been provided in hostels and day centres.  Outreach teams and dedicated multidisciplinary mental health teams also have been established.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P Just="Left">A revised Government strategy on adult homelessness is nearing completion.  It has been developed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the aegis of the cross-departmental team on homelessness with input from the national homeless consultative committee, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  Its core objective is the elimination by the end of 2010 of the long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation and the need to sleep rough in Ireland.  This builds on the commitment made in Towards 2016 regarding emergency accommodation.  The intention is to ensure homelessness is of a short duration and that appropriate housing and other supports are facilitated while minimising the risk of homelessness occurring through effective preventative policies and services.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the HSE will spend &euro;33 million on the provision of in-house care in hostels and on outreach community health services.  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will make available a sum of &euro;53.2 million towards accommodation and related costs.</P>
        <P>The Minister is aware that the opening of some homeless facilities has been deferred because of funding issues which has affected the provision of care staff required to run these facilities.  The Department and the HSE are in active consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the voluntary service providers involved with a view to resolving the issue of funding and enabling these facilities to open as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The last paragraph of the Minister&rsquo;s reply is what touches on the wording of my motion, so I am not really impressed by it.  I am quite well aware of the services that have been provided, but I do not accept this response.  When will these facilities be provided?  I accept that a great deal of capital funding has gone into this area but the Minister is aware that the opening of facilities for the homeless has been deferred because of funding issues and this has affected the provision of care staff. That is the kernel of the issue and the basis of my decision to table this Adjournment matter.  I ask the Minister to revert to the Minister for Health and Children to obtain a different response because I need a date.  These facilities are ready to go but there is no staff.  It makes no sense.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm go bhfuil an Aire anseo linn um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag obair go crua inniu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; anseo d&eacute;anach san o&iacute;che.  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuil Aire sinsear anseo chun na ceiste a ghlacadh.  I appreciate the presence of a Cabinet Minister in the House at this time of night to take this Adjournment matter.  It reflects his personal commitment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, which I acknowledge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Earlier today I was involved with a delegation from the County Donegal Vocational Education Committee which met the Minister for Education and Science regarding a project in my constituency.  The Minister outlined difficulties concerning the current financial situation within the Department.  In addition, the Minister is new in the Department and is only finding his way around it.  I have raised this issue to impress upon the Minister the urgency of this particular project in my own village of Gortahork.  It is a building project at Gortahork national school, scoil n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Gort a&rsquo; Choirce, at&aacute; lonnaithe i gcro&iacute;l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta i dT&iacute;r Chonaill in aice le sl&eacute;ibhte an Mhucais agus an Earagail agus an Mhuir Atlantach.  Scoil l&aacute;n-Gaeilge at&aacute; i gceist anseo.  T&aacute; thart ar 120 scol&aacute;ire ag freastal ar an scoil a th&oacute;gadh i 1929.  Rinneadh obair feabhs&uacute;<Col N="113"/>ch&aacute;in ar an scoil i 1957.  As I said in Irish, this particular school was built in 1929 and renovation was carried out on it in 1957.  A staffing complement of five teachers are working in the school, while year-on-year the pupil numbers are approximately 120.  It is a mixed Catholic school.</P>
        <P>The current accommodation provision available to the school is insufficient to meet the needs of its pupils and the teaching staff.  This has been acknowledged by the Department of Education and Science, particularly in recent years.  Following that acknowledgement and following lobbying by the school board of management and political representatives, the Department sanctioned approval to examine new sites that would be more accessible, available and suitable to the school&rsquo;s needs.  A number of sites were looked at.  Following work carried out by the board of management, the Department of Education and Science and the Office of Public Works, an agreed site has been located which is on the edge of Gortahork village.  It is the most suitable site and the only one available.  Gortahork is a small village and very few sites are available there.  This particular site it available and the Office of Public Works has been negotiating with the landowner concerning it.  It is critical that the site be purchased by the Department of Education and Science to allow the project to proceed.  The current accommodation is not fulfilling the needs of the pupil cohort.  The site is located between the N56, the national secondary route which runs through the village, and Gortahork bay.  There are issues concerning odour, sewerage and road safety given the increasing number of vehicles using the N56.</P>
        <P>The discussions between the school board of management, its chairman, Fr. Se&aacute;n Gallagher, and the Department on the site&rsquo;s acquisition have been going on for five or six years.  The projected pupil numbers remain constant.  I wish to impress upon the Minister the need to move this project forward.  I realise we must be realistic but no other site is available for this school building project.  If this site came on the open market, it could be swallowed up by developers.  We cannot expect the landowner to hold on forever.  We need a commitment from the Department to purchase the site so we can examine the construction phase.  I am seeking movement to allow the project to progress.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not responsible for the Department of Education and Science but he might raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, as I will be doing in the weeks ahead.  I believe it is important to raise the issue on the Adjournment given that we now have a new Minister in the Department of Education and Science.  I wish him well in his new role.  By the same token, however, I wish to impress upon him the urgency of moving forward with this project, which has been standing still for the last ten to 12 months.  The site has been earmarked since summer 2007 and now, a year later, we want to see some movement in this regard.  The board of management is starting to get frustrated so it is important for us to move the project forward and provide facilities for the current and future pupil intake in the Gortahork primary school&rsquo;s catchment area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter in this House as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on allowing the site acquisition for a new school at Gortahork, County Donegal, to proceed to the next stage.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge and one which the Minister for Education and Science intends to be one of his priorities.  This Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost &euro;600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be <Col N="114"/>invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  It will underpin a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to develop on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the country.  It will enable also the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, OPW, which acts generally on behalf of the Department of Education and Science concerning site acquisitions for schools, was requested to source a suitable site for Gortahork national school.  On foot of advertising, a number of proposals were received and one of these was identified as the preferred option.  The OPW entered negotiations with the vendor for the acquisition of this site, but agreement could not be reached with the vendor on price and the OPW readvertised.  On foot of readvertising a number of proposals were received, including the previous preferred option.  The OPW again deemed this site to be the most suitable and entered negotiations with the vendor for its acquisition.  Agreement was reached on price and the acquisition of the site is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>I understand that Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher has had various meetings with the school authorities on this particular matter and has also discussed the matter directly with the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and his predecessors outlining the urgency of the situation.  The Senator will appreciate that the progression of all large-scale building projects, including this one, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project.  I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for being in the House at this hour to take this Adjournment matter given that he is not the Minister responsible and has had a long day in the Chamber.  We all realise the importance of the Abbey Theatre not only to the greater Dublin area but the country at large.  It is our national theatre and the idea of developing a new theatre at another location in central Dublin has been mooted for a long time.  The Ceann Comhairle, when he was Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, probably did something to advance the idea in 2002.  His successor in that portfolio, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, announced more than a year ago that the design phase would be completed by mid-2008.  We have recently learned that the international design competition has been delayed.  According to a recent newspaper report, the competition has not yet been initiated despite promises from the former Minister and perhaps others.  What is the position regarding the design phase?  </P>
        <P>I understand the Office of Public Works appointed a group as theatre consultants and a site at George&rsquo;s Quay in the docklands was agreed.  Recently, the possibility of using the old Carlton site on O&rsquo;Connell Street has been discussed.  I ask the Minister to provide further details in this regard.</P>
        <P>I understand the project will be pursued under a public-private partnership.  Will the OPW act as project manager and technical adviser?  What is the role of the National Development Finance Agency?  What role will be played by Jacob&rsquo;s Engineering Group, which I understand <Col N="115"/>has been appointed?  I look forward to obtaining all available information to bring us up to speed in the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for raising the matter to enable me to outline the current position on the proposals for a new national theatre.  In 2006 the Government decided to proceed with the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre by way of a public private partnership project on a site at George&rsquo;s Dock on a build, finance and maintain basis.  This site was chosen following an extensive exercise conducted by the Office of Public Works which involved the examination of a number of options and the project is being progressed on the basis solely of the George&rsquo;s Dock site.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Government decision, an interagency steering committee was set up to oversee the project.  The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, Office of Public Works, Abbey Theatre and Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  At its first meeting the steering group decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Office of Public Works should prepare the documentation necessary for holding an international design competition for the new Abbey Theatre.  An international design competition was one of the conditions of the offer of the site by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
        <P>A project team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and comprising representatives of the same agencies as the steering group, has also been established and is overseeing the arrangements for holding the international design competition and advancing the PPP process.  The Office of Public Works has asked the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland to organise the competition.  The competition regulations are currently nearing finalisation.  The technical documentation for the competition must be very carefully specified, in particular the detailed accommodation brief for the new theatre.  Work on this is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>A jury for the international design competition was appointed late last year.  The jury has representatives from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Office of Public Works, Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Arts Council and Abbey Theatre.  It also features international figures in the architectural and theatre worlds.  It is expected that the design competition will be completed before the end of 2008.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Office of Public Works is working on drafting output specifications in collaboration with the Department, Abbey Theatre and National Development Finance Authority.  Technical, legal, insurance and financial advisers have been appointed to guide and advise the interagency teams in the procurement of this epochal and crucial project.  A theatre consultant and acoustic consultant have also been appointed.  Furthermore, a process auditor is in place in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.</P>
        <P>The project is complex and there are myriad factors to address in making progress on it.  It remains a priority for the Department and Government in the programme for Government and national development plan.  The same teams progressed the National Concert Hall to competition initiation last week and resources will now turn to advancing the Abbey Theatre public-private partnership.  When a winning design has been chosen, the National Development Finance Agency will oversee the PPP procurement process in accordance with PPP guidelines.</P>
        <P>I am confident that when the international design competition is complete we will have a world class design for a new iconic landmark building for the city and the new quayside theatre will be a dynamic structure reflecting Dublin&rsquo;s growing reputation as a global capital of culture and creativity.  I look forward to a new national theatre building that makes a bold and visionary statement about modern Ireland, while at the same time acknowledging the historic significance <Col N="116"/>of the Abbey Theatre to Irish life over more than a century.  It will be a cultural institution that will act as a magnet to draw all of our citizens and those visiting towards enjoying the inspiring drama and creativity our country has to offer.</P>
