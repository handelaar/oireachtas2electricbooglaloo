	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on plans for a new school building for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole girls&rsquo; national school, North Wall, Dublin 1; and if he will meet with the staff and board of management of this school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business for today and tomorrow is No. 1, motion re the US agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance; No. 2, motion re recognition and supervision of suspended sentences; No. 3, motion re European Police Office (Europol) back from Committee; No. 4, statements on scrutiny report on EU climate energy package.  It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together and without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business.  No. 4 will be taken at the conclusion of Nos. 1 to 3 and will conclude not later than 1.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and other Senators for seven minutes.  Senators may share time by agreement of the House.  The Minister will be called upon ten minutes before the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from leaders and spokespersons.  </P>
        <P>The Seanad shall sit tomorrow, Friday 17 October, at 10.30 a.m. and there will be no Order of Business.  The business to be transacted shall be a motion re the regulations to be made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes.  Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader clarify the arrangements for tomorrow?  It was my understanding that the Minister would come to the Seanad at 11.30 a.m., when he had spoken in the D&aacute;il.  I also understand there will be a question and answer session in the D&aacute;il.  Will the Minister take questions on the guarantee in this House tomorrow?  There are many questions which Senators would like to put to him.  Can the Leader clarify this matter at this <Col N="562"/>point?  Will the Minister attend the debate in this House at any stage tomorrow?  I would like the Minister to attend this House and take questions at some stage of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader answer Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s question now, before other Senators comment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will reply to questions raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that.  I respect your ruling, a Chathaoirligh.  However, Senators will not be able to question the Leader following his reply.  The Order of Business could be amended if the Leader wished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has outlined the Order of Business to the House.  He will reply later to questions raised on the Order of Business.  We will see what takes place at that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is confusion as to whether or not the Minister will attend tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.  Yesterday, Members on this side of the House were told he would attend.  I expect him to do so.  I ask the Leader to respond to that point at the conclusion of the Order of Business. </P>
        <P>We are used to confusion from the Government.  Confusion surrounded the bank guarantee, third level fees, stamp duty and e-voting machines.  We now see it in the bank guarantee scheme regarding the role of directors.  There is a lack of clarity about their role.  More confusion emerged yesterday.  Every Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy stood up and applauded the budget on Tuesday, yet it removes the right to a medical card to an elderly person, which could cost him or her up to &euro;2,000 a year.  Many elderly people were on radio yesterday and many called our offices because they are concerned and anxious about the additional cost and whether they will have to make a decision between paying for physiotherapy or medicines and paying for fuel.  Many of them are afraid they will have to make such decisions having planned as they thought for their retirement and feeling secure about their medicines and so on.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il bought the 2002 election with that decision, and in harsher economic times the medical card is being taken away from people who face significant uncertainty and concern.  Age Action Ireland has had to call a public meeting to explain what is going on.  There is confusion among Ministers.  Different rates are quoted on the HSE website and by Ministers for the means test.  We have become used to confusion from the Government on many issues but a line must be drawn when it causes upset and stress for elderly people at their most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain the means test, how it will apply to elderly people and how their savings would be affected.  I heard a woman on radio yesterday who said she could have spent her savings on a property abroad or in many other ways but she put her money away as a fall-back for when she was older.  What will happen to her savings?  What will be taken into account?  There is complete confusion, which was not helped by the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s comments on radio earlier.  He is also confused.  Does anyone in Government know the criteria?  Can anyone allay the fear and confusion and come into the House and explain the rules that will govern the medical card scheme when thousands of elderly people reapply in January, given their sense of certainty has been taken away?  Could the Minister for Health and Children be brought to the House to bring clarity about what will happen?  Does she know what is happening?  Will she come to the House to answer these questions, which are upsetting many people around the country?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="563"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I would like a commitment from the Leader that there will be questions and answers tomorrow.  I agree with the points raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  During a discussion two weeks ago on related matters, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance took questions from Members and it is difficult to go along with this change without debate.  Like Senator Fitzgerald, I understood a question and answer session would take place.  If the Government is afraid of that, it sends out a bad message.</P>
        <P>The issues raised about the budget are absolutely right.  I appeal to my Government colleagues.  We recognise the practicalities of politics whereby they must be loyal but they should not allow the spin doctors to take over.  This is a classic case of changing the words to mean something else.  There is a clear difference and let them not try to convince us that a horse chestnut is the same as a chestnut horse, to use that adage.  One has a head, tail and whinnies and the other does not.  I ask Government Members to examine this issue.  There is great anger, which will come back to haunt us.</P>
        <P>On the one hand, people refer to the perfect decisions in the budget.  The cutbacks are bruising and they will hurt people.  It is like a person at the guillotine.  There is a perfect head and a perfect body but there is an absolute disconnect between them.  The budget does not hang together and when the grey brigades of the over 70s together with the platoons of parents outraged at the school situation and the battalions on the minimum wage flanked by Joe Duffy&rsquo;s private army emerge, the Government will be overwhelmed.  This will not work.</P>
        <P>It is reported the deal being brought forward tomorrow will allow the banks to select the people who are supposed to look after the public interest.  That is an absolute abrogation of responsibility left, right and centre.  We are walking into difficulties.  Let us deal with it and talk honestly about it.  The views of both Government and Opposition Members were the same when we discussed the banking crisis two weeks ago and they should not differ tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate that we want the Minister for Finance in the House tomorrow.  He was kind enough to attend the all-night debate a few weeks ago and it is only fair that he comes to the House tomorrow to discuss the scheme.  Having spoken to my colleagues, we are happy to do our bit and be in the House until whatever time it takes tomorrow night and come back Saturday, if needed, but we need to see the Minister in the House.  We do not want to be fobbed off with a junior Minister.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An international conference on world hunger takes place today, which will be attended by Kofi Annan, former President, Mary Robinson, Jeffrey Sachs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power.  I wish the conference well in its deliberations.  It is important to recognise that while we are experiencing hardship, many millions of people throughout the world can only dream about the lifestyles we have.  That is one reason I am disappointed by the cutbacks in the foreign aid budget for 2009 but I recognise Ireland is still on target to meet the 0.7% of GDP commitment, which is welcome.  It is important to obtain value for the money spent.  I am concerned that Vietnam, one of our nine programme countries, has jailed a journalist, Nguyen Viet Chien, for two years for investigating corruption.  Ireland gives Vietnam &euro;20 million in foreign aid.  He was investigating a Government agency that distributes foreign aid and, therefore, it is vital clarification is sought from the Vietnamese Government about what is going on.  We are investing in foreign aid and we need to make sure corruption is not associated with its distribution.</P>
        <P>Next week the new musical, Jekyll and Hyde, will open in the National Concert Hall.  I am sure it is fully staffed but if an understudy is needed, perhaps the show&rsquo;s producers could talk to the Minister for Finance because he is excelling in the role.  During his Budget Statement on Tuesday, he said he would abolish universal coverage for medical cards for the over 70s.  Yesterday he implied he was willing to consider examining the decision again if there were <Col N="564"/>anomalies.  Earlier on radio, he said he would stick to his original decision.  I attended a cross party meeting earlier where this issue was discussed.  None of us knew the full details of how the scheme would work and confusion abounded.  If we do not understand, one can only imagine what it is like for people in their 70s trying to get their heads around how they will be affected by this proposal.  It is clearly ridiculous.  It will cost more in administration and excessive charges than the Government will reap from the scheme.  Will the Government think again?  The people affected built the country and they scrimped and saved for years to feed their families and to put them through school and college.  Let us drop this idea.</P>

	<P>We will have opportunities during the debates on the Social Welfare and Finance Bills to go into the detail of the budget.  If the Leader can arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House in the near future, it may help.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators referred to confusion, some of which has been caused by misleading statements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier, I heard on radio that if the Government is to effect &euro;100 million in savings from the Estimates, it will be paid by pensioners.  This cost will be borne by the members of the Irish Medical Organisation, who receive four times as much for treating patients under the medical card scheme for the over 70s as they do under the normal scheme.  That is where the money will be saved.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leader will arrange a debate on this matter to clarify that people on State pensions with the medical card will continue to hold the card.  The only certainty is that those on incomes of more than &euro;650 per week will not have any cover by way of the medical card, the doctor only card or &euro;400 per week.  If Members of the Opposition would like to justify why people on that income level should be subsidised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Buttimer will have his opportunity to speak.  He has indicated his wish to contribute to the Order of Business.  I will afford him that opportunity, but I do not want people interrupting others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle is wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reiterate the call for clarity because confusion exists.  Perhaps the budget has not been well handled, but much of the confusion has been implanted by misleading statements by those trying to make political capital out of the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We debated this important matter when we passed a Bill.  Confusion seems to be reigning supreme.  There are important issues at stake and, given the number of serious reservations, the Leader must allow a proper debate.  In fairness to him, he does not want to mislead the House.</P>
        <P>During a question and answer session, the Minister&rsquo;s presence would be necessary.  If he is in the Lower House at 10.30 a.m., he cannot be here.  Will the Leader comment in this regard?</P>
        <P>Concerning serious reservations, there is the question of public interest appointments.  My party agreed to allow the Minister to make the appointments.  It is important that the Minister makes the appointments in the public interest, but such is not the provision in this scheme.  For this reason, we require a question and answer session with the Minister.  I say this with the utmost respect to the Senators opposite, many of whom would agree with me.  It seems the banks will make the appointments from a list supplied by the Minister.  Are we to risk further cosy relationships, which had a part to play in destroying confidence?</P>
        <P>Regarding risk assessment committees, the people who the Minister is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Leader about something.  Will the Leader confirm whether those people will be only observers?  The &euro;1 billion guarantee will cover the entire period of the scheme instead of being an amount per annum.</P>
        <P>There are serious reservations and questions that must be teased out with the Minister.  It was the Leader&rsquo;s intention for the Minister to be in attendance.  Will the Leader comment?  We cannot be expected to agree the Order of Business without knowing the details.  For this reason, I believed the Leader would have taken the opportunity to amend the Order of Business to allow our comments.  We will not know until the Leader&rsquo;s response and I do not know what we will do afterwards if there is a difference between us.  It seems that will be the case.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put a question to the Leader regarding the over 70s medical card, which was first issued some years ago.  The Minister stated that, if there are anomalies in the scheme, he is prepared to consider the matter.  It is for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to do so.  Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House next week to debate this issue in greater detail?</P>
        <P>I will make a straightforward suggestion.  As a former member of a health board, it would be simpler if all new applicants under 70 years of age applied in the normal manner from <Col N="567"/>budget day on.  There is a strong case for those with the cards to retain them because they planned ahead.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As Government Members, it is our job to table reasonable suggestions.  The cost is not too prohibitive.  In fact, the cost of reassessment will be significant.  There is too much assessment already as far as the HSE is concerned.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>In many instances, more money is spent on assessing a medical card than the cost of the card itself.  This morning, I contacted the HSE.  It is working on the basis of the 2006 guidelines for medical cards, as no new guidelines have been issued in the past two days.  There is confusion.  As the Minister stated, let any anomalies be clarified.  Naturally, I will vote with the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to hear Members on the other side being so critical of the budget.  It confirms Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on the reigning confusion.  The more that Government spokespersons speaking on radio concede that there are anomalies and the more that Senator Boyle and others state that the budget may not have been well handled, the more confusion and anger there will be about its effects on the vulnerable, the elderly and those on low incomes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is evident that the budget has been poorly handled.  There is a lack of clarity on all sorts of measures.  Why are the figures on funding for arts institutions on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website different from those outlined in the document given to us?  This is a small example of the types of anomaly in the budget.</P>
        <P>Why was a radical approach not taken to carbon tax, particularly given the inclusion of the Green Party in the Government?  A Green Party Minister more than hinted at the introduction of a carbon tax next year, but the Minister for Finance did not commit to it in the budget.  He only hinted at its introduction.  This could have raised revenue on more radical and imaginative basis yet it has not been done.  There is a question of why it has not been done now.</P>
        <P>As we debate increased rates of carbon emissions and the poor record of Ireland in meeting its Kyoto target, it is important to note that the carbon budget has been criticised by Friends of the Earth as too patchy, piecemeal and slow.  I ask the Leader why a stronger carbon budget was not introduced in this year of all years when people are willing to make sacrifices to meet environmental targets.</P><Col N="569"/>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Health and Children to answer questions about the medical card scheme, which has not been thought through and lacks clarity.  I do not often agree with Senator Leyden but he is right.  It seems completely wrong to remove medical cards from people who have been given them and who have made plans on the basis of being granted medical cards by this Government in a previous term of office.  It is extraordinary that they are proposing to take them away and introduce an unclear form of means testing.  We have seen great injustice in means testing in the past and will see it in the future.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my invitation to Members and colleagues to the seminar on youth justice.  It has been somewhat overtaken by events but is due to be held at 11.30 a.m. in the audio visual room and will be addressed by the Irish Penal Reform Trust.</P>

	<P>I refer to the medical card scheme for over 70s and support the call for clarification, regardless of whether we have a debate today or later.  Politics is being played with this issue.  Those who are missing out are vulnerable people who need to know the circumstances.  The way politics is being played serves only to put fear into older people who are vulnerable.  It galls me to listen to Fine Gael refer to this as an unfair measure.  It must embarrass the party to its core that the party&rsquo;s health spokesperson negotiated the deal to get four times the amount for the doctors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are so self-congratulating on the strong measures taken but they are measures taken by the Government to correct mistakes of the Government.  The Government provided free medical cards for over 70s.</P>

	<P>Negotiated by the Fine Gael spokesperson.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government created the quangos it is now trying to amalgamate and the Government reduced taxes but is now imposing the income levy on gross level.  The Government is correcting its mistakes, the Leader might agree with me on that.</P>
        <P>Whether speaking about the budget, the world financial meltdown or the economic recession, the elephant in the room is the Lisbon treaty.  Discussions in the European Council and comments by MEPs, including Mr. M&eacute;ndez de Vigo in <i>The Irish Times</i>, speak strongly about the difficulties the rejection has caused for the European Parliament.  Mr. M&eacute;ndez de Vigo states: &ldquo;To me it is shocking that a government that held a referendum and failed is still in office. A government that puts a question to a referendum and loses has to resign: that&rsquo;s democracy&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Whether he is right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be a question to the Leader.  If the Senator wants a debate on the Lisbon treaty, he should say so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a specific question.  Whether the MEP is correct, it is a symptom of the change from understanding the Irish position to anger, particularly with regard to the European Parliament elections next year.  The failure to pass the Lisbon treaty referendum means that the European Parliament elections will be based on the Nice treaty.  This affects 12 member states and in the case of Spain four fewer MEPs will be elected.  We have alienated 12 member states in Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it a democratic decision by the Irish people or not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The institutional arrangements for the European Parliament were never an issue in the referendum.  No constitutional issue arises.  It is a problem we have created and there are no objections to the European Parliament elections being held on the basis of a change in the number of MEPs, as envisaged by the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on the Irish Government to contribute to a solution to this immediate problem.  I accept that the rejection of the treaty will not be easily resolved but we have an immediate problem with the alienation of many people in Europe in respect of the effect on the European Parliament elections.  Ireland should come up with a proposal on how this could be resolved.  This could be done before the European Council meeting in December.  The Seanad can play a role in this.  We have an interest in good relations with the European Parliament and in fostering good relations throughout Europe.  This will have a negative effect on this country and it is an immediate problem to which we can contribute a solution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but have been overshadowed by one issue.  There is confusion, with which I will ask the Leader to assist us.  The confusion is over a genuine concern about the proposal to withdraw medical cards from those who, heretofore, qualified for a medical card on an eligibility basis.  It is important to send a clear message from this House.  I support the views of my colleagues who stated that there is dirty, bad politics being played on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made a request, we are now seeking questions to the Leader.  I do not want to get involved in to and fro across the floor of the Chamber over politics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.  I have raised issues with the Cathaoirleach and the Leader about the HSE.  I have stated that the jury is out on certain matters.  In March 2007 I raised an issue and was told that my figures were incorrect.  I was told this by the HSE and many other authorities.  The matter I raised on that occasion has been ruled on this week by the courts and the HSE was found wanting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue relating to pharmacies is not the first one on which it has been found wanting.  There is confusion regarding medical cards.  It is regrettable that the HSE has not given clear explanations to those who have a long-term illness, a cancer-related illness or other medical need.  Those people with medical cards who have these needs will retain their cards regardless of their income level and that message must be clearly despatched.  Those on a restricted income, who feel fearful and insecure, who have escalating hospital and medical bills, must be clearly told that their cards and their medical needs will continue to be covered.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue with my colleagues in the parliamentary party and we will meet shortly.  I have also said publicly that I believe this issue will be revisited with regard to the eligibility criteria.  I ask the Leader to get a briefing document, rapidly, in order to dispel the confusion concerning these figures and to clarify what is and what is not permissible under the medical needs criteria and the applicable guidelines.  It is to be hoped that this matter will be revisited and the confusion overturned to the satisfaction of all concerned.</P>

	<P>Tomorrow is International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.  It is shameful that the Government is trying to dismantle the Combat Poverty Agency.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The bank bail-out scheme details were finally published yesterday after much delay and have raised as many questions as they answered.  I have a number of issues to put to the Leader.  There is no indication that senior bankers will resign or will be removed, as was the case in the United Kingdom.  There has been no apology from anybody in the banking sector and there is no accountability.  The scheme is vague as to whether salaries will be limited for top executives and there is no cap on bankers&rsquo; salaries.  Will the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, come to this House to answer our questions in as much detail as is required?</P>
        <P>The medical card controversy began because the Government has not been clear about this measure.  This morning the HSE published the guidelines on its website.  It is clear that &euro;210.50 per week is the income limit for a single person and that anybody above that limit will lose the medical card.  Has the Government sought to find out how many people are in that bracket?  Has it consulted with GPs?  We know it did not do so in 2001 when the measure was introduced as an election gimmick in order to buy the general election of that year.</P>
        <P>We are not playing politics with this issue but are doing our job as parliamentarians, transmitting the messages from our constituencies to Government.</P>

Therefore, it is the better off in our society who will be the fall guys rather than those aged over 70.  </P>
        <P>Yesterday members of the Opposition referred to the VHI and stated that the over 70 age group would now be left in the lurch, unable to get back into the VHI.  That was an untruth.

This is not politics but fact. The reality is that as a consequence of this budget, people are now afraid to get sick.  Elderly people who should be content at this hour of their lives are now confused, upset and worried.  That is a fact.  If one walks into any chemist&rsquo;s shop they will tell you that.  </P>
        <P>In regard to the banking scheme, it is imperative that the Minister for Finance comes to the House and answers questions.  I want clarity.  Under no circumstances should the people have to pay for bailing out the banks which have betrayed their trust.  The scheme published yesterday, to which Senator McCarthy referred, is not clear on details such as who will pay and, more important, who will service on the boards of the banks.  Will it be another cosy cartel of friends of the banks and Fianna F&aacute;il in order that what happened before can be allowed to happen again?  Is that what the Government wants?  We must have the Minister in the House.</P>
        <P>We are talking about people here.  I am not playing politics.  People matter and it is our job to represent them.  This Government has let them down, particularly in the past 48 hours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In recognition of what was already said in the House by the Opposition about a world financial meltdown, I ask the Leader to convene a debate.  Once the scheme of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill 2008 has been agreed, the House should discuss the membership of bank boards and whether banks need further capitalisation. <Col N="574"/> Should that be the case, the Government should step in and take a financial stake in the banks.  The State would probably secure a large stakeholding for a relatively small sum which could prove financially lucrative.  A number of the Independent Senators who spoke on financial matters would make good representatives on some of the bank boards.  This would provide a direct link between the House and the financial institutions and demonstrate a degree of independence.</P>

An interesting report was published yesterday by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland and BirdWatch Ireland.  It points out that of 199 species of birds, seven, including the corncrake, barn owl, curlew and yellow hammer, have been placed on a list of endangered species.  While these types of problems do not attract attention during times of financial difficulty, Senators should ensure we discuss the matter.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on conservation in the coming weeks to divert the attention of the House from financial matters to other issues that matter to us.</P>
        <P>On the budget, as one who is ashamed to admit to no longer travelling to the House by bicycle, I have no problem with the introduction of a &euro;200 levy on car parking spaces which will apply to Members of the Oireachtas.  However, I have a problem with an 08 registered car licensed in County Westmeath which is repeatedly parked in the yellow box in the car park, thus preventing Members from leaving the car park in the normal manner.  While I am sure the vehicle is not connected to the Leader, perhaps he will find out to whom it belongs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the day is out, a clear statement should be made outlining the position on medical cards for old people.  There is a palpable fear among old people who are terrified by the prospect of being means tested and incurring additional expense as a result of the Government&rsquo;s <i>faux pas</i> on the medical card scheme in the budget.  The Leader should convey that message to the Minister.</P>
        <P>It is difficult in the case of those aged 75 years and over to establish where illness begins and ends and what constitutes an illness which would necessitate a medial card.  There is also major confusion as regards means testing.  For example, the figures cited by Senator Boyle on means testing do not correspond with figures provided by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and Feeney suggested the Opposition is engaging in scare tactics or dirty politics on this issue.  We are doing no more than fulfilling our role which is to seek clarification and improve and parse budget announcements and legislation.  The suggestion that we are doing the contrary stems from confusion and a realisation that the proposal is a mess.  The Senators are trying to get out of the mess.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Finance the need to make a clear statement by lunchtime clearly identifying those who will not be subject to a means test for a medical card?  This information should be available in time for the evening news broadcasts.  People on non-<Col N="575"/>contributory old age pensions should not be means tested as it would be ludicrous to subject anyone who qualifies for an old age pension to a further means test.  As Senator Leyden stated, this is a farcical proposition and a waste of public funds as the means test would cost more than the outcome.</P>
        <P>The Leader is a compassionate, sensible businessman.  I ask him to devise a solution which will provide clarity by this evening.  We are all receiving telephone calls from people who are in real fear.  Yesterday evening, for example, I received a call from a bachelor who cares for his mother.  Senator Wilson knows the man well.  He is fearful about his mother because she was anxious all day yesterday.  This is an horrendous state of affairs.  The issue must be clarified by this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is considerable confusion about this medical card business which has to be cleared up as it could become the equivalent of the tax on shoes which brought down a previous Government.  The Government seduced old people into leaving the VHI and then left them hanging.  We have to scotch the nonsense from Senators on the Government side that nothing has changed and pensioners will be able to rejoin health insurance schemes on the same terms they enjoyed previously.  Insurance companies have to make profits on their clients and may offer such disadvantageous terms such that rejoining is of no use to the applicant.  There is, therefore, a cost.</P>
        <P>As to the argument that the &euro;80 million will be paid by doctors, while general practitioners may not receive a cheque from the Government, they will, as sure as hell, extract it from their sick and elderly patients.  The one constant in this business is that the pensioners will still pay.</P>
        <P>While I have no problem with means testing, it has to be done properly and one has to hit those who can pay.  It must also be a two way system in that one should means test people not only to exclude them from a system but also to ensure people are included in a scheme.  This is not currently the case with the result that we are not protecting the weak.</P>
        <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, used to say he was a socialist.  I know the socialist credo &mdash; from each according to his means and to each according to his need.</P>

	<P>The Senator should address questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We are taking from people and failing to give to those who are needy.  The same applies in the case of university fees.  It is a nonsense to suggest we have free fees.  It was another vote getting exercise.  While the question of whether fees should be reintroduced should be examined, we are taxing people by doubling the capitation fee to &euro;1,500 for all students.  This approach targets everyone.  If one were to introduce fees with a proper ceiling, one would target the people who are in need.  This is exactly the same as in the case of means testing.</P>
        <P>I was amazed to hear Senator Regan, a distinguished lawyer, suggest that we flout a treaty.  He also said our democratic vote had alienated large numbers of people in the rest of Europe.  On the contrary, it alienated a large number of senior politicians, whereas the people of Europe were pleased with what we did and they were right to be so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Coghlan, Hannigan, Boyle, Leyden, Bacik, O&rsquo;Malley, Regan, Callely, McCarthy, Feeney, Buttimer, Hanafin, O&rsquo;Reilly and Norris expressed strong views on the budget.  We had a good debate yesterday evening during which Senators expressed their opinions on the budget.</P><Col N="576"/>
        <P>Considerable uncertainty has arisen regarding old age pensioners on medical cards.  The medical card gave senior citizens peace of mind and certainty, which I would like restored.  Commentary in the political system and media is stifling the reality of what is taking place.  I want there to be a means test for those who can afford to pay, but any person over the age of 70 in receipt of only a contributory pension or social welfare benefits is entitled to a medical card.  That is my understanding of the measure from what I heard just before the Order of Business.  That should allay the fears of in excess of 70% of those currently entitled to a medical card.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly was correct when he said that this message need to be got across loud and clear.  The responsible media might let the public know that this, as far as I understand, is the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Callely, a former Minister of State, gave the House the benefit of his experience and advised that any person who is terminally ill be given a medical card.  It will be a comfort to such unfortunate people to know that.  Clarification of this measure is needed and we will do all we can to obtain that.</P>
        <P>I will accede to the request to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, back to the House to discuss this matter at the earliest possible time, perhaps next week.  She has been most helpful and is probably the one Minister who is fully in support of coming to the House every time I ask her to do so following requests made by Members on the Order of Business.  I will request today that the Minister come to the House to clarify Members&rsquo; various concerns to ensure the public knows the up-to-date definitive position on the medical card measure.</P>
        <P>Regarding tomorrow&rsquo;s Seanad business, I always discuss the business ordered with the party leaders out of courtesy and I have always made substantial progress with their assistance.  I will do everything I possibly can in regard to tomorrow&rsquo;s business, but I cannot order it, as the matter will be taken in the D&aacute;il at the same time.  As matters stand, the business for tomorrow is ordered as I outlined this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan raised a matter concerning the allocation of &euro;20 million in foreign aid to Vietnam.  I will pass on his strong views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the issue of funding for the arts.  I fully support the allocation of whatever funding is available for the arts.  Senator Keaveney, in previous comments on the Order of Business, has also spoken of her full support for such funding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Regan and Norris raised the issue of the Lisbon treaty.  The Government has set up a special sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs that comes under the remit of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin.  The committee has 12 members, five of whom are Members from this House, some of whom were on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side and some of whom were on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  The Government or Fianna F&aacute;il side of this House proposed an Independent Member who was on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to express our views and to try to reach a consensus on this matter.   The sub-committee is sitting three days each week for four weeks.  Its deliberations are being treated with the utmost urgency by the Minister and the Government.  I congratulate those who allowed their names to go forward to participate on the committee.  It is a considerable commitment of their time.  I will afford whatever time is required of me by the members of the sub-committee on the conclusions of their deliberations to ensure Members of this House will have an opportunity to discuss fully  the sub-committee&rsquo;s proposals in regard to the Lisbon treaty and the decision of the people of Ireland to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Quinn in extending our best wishes to Kofi Annan in regard to all he is doing.  The Senator reminded us of the alarming statistic that 850 million people go to bed hungry <Col N="577"/>every night.  That puts things in perceptive.  I thank the Senator for bringing this information to the attention of the House.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s request for a debate in regard to statistics on wildlife species announced yesterday.  I heard a member of the royal society in the UK and a member of our equivalent society talk on the radio this morning about the importance of wildlife, in particular the species highlighted by the Senator with which we would have all been familiar during our childhood, especially those of us who lived in rural Ireland.  Our wildlife is a huge asset to our heritage and I want to see it protected.  We will allow time to have this matter discussed in the House at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <Title>Report on EU Climate-Energy Package: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for inviting me today to discuss the Oireachtas joint committee&rsquo;s report on the EU climate package.  Before addressing the report, I wish to make a few general comments on climate policy.</P>
        <P>The 7 October was a milestone in terms of the people of Ireland and Europe taking responsibility for the future of the climate.  On that day, the European Parliament&rsquo;s environment com<Col N="579"/>mittee voted overwhelmingly to support the 2020 emissions targets set out in the climate package.  Earlier on the same day, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security published this report supporting the overall framework of the climate package.  It is clear to me that there is a strong democratic mandate, at national and European levels, to seriously tackle greenhouse gas emissions.  It is up to governments to respond to and match the ambitions of that democratic mandate.</P>
        <P>I also want to covey my appreciation of the work of the Oireachtas joint committee and, in particular, its Chairman, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, which held more than a dozen public sessions to discuss the package and to listen to the views of the many stakeholders in climate change policy.</P>
        <P>I want to make clear that I welcome the committee&rsquo;s all-party endorsement of the 2020 greenhouse gas targets that are contained in the climate-energy package.  When I entered Government, as the leader of the Green Party, I made it clear that our priority was to agree an all-party approach to climate change.  I applaud the committee&rsquo;s Chairman and its members for moving beyond party politics to address the most serious environmental challenge that will affect us all and future generations.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Oireachtas committee members that we should accept the proposed 20% reduction target for Ireland by 2020 compared to 2005 and that we should move to a 30% reduction target as part of a comprehensive and global climate change agreement, provided the overall package is robust and balanced.</P>
        <P>This decision cannot be taken lightly.  I assure the Members of this House as well as the members of the committee that our 2020 climate change policy is being treated as a matter of top priority across all of Government.  The Taoiseach chairs the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security, which ensures a whole-of-Government involvement in the negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s 2020 climate-energy package.  All relevant Departments are involved intensively in assessing the implications of the overall package as well as various elements of the proposals.  These issues, many of which have been identified also by the committee, form part of Ireland&rsquo;s negotiating mandate for the ongoing discussions on the package.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet committee, and its supporting officials&rsquo; groups, is engaged also in ongoing extensive analysis of policy options that will form the basis of our strategy to reach the eventual target that Ireland takes on for 2020.  At this stage, there is still some uncertainty about the ambition level, shape and rules of the international climate change agreement which is due to be reached by 2009 in the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.  None the less, the work we are carrying out now across all Departments will underpin the implementation of our 2020 international commitments.</P>
        <P>A key issue for Ireland will be the identification and implementation of measures in all sectors across the economy as a whole which will deliver the required cuts in the most cost-effective way.  As we have seen, the Oireachtas joint committee has endorsed, on an all-party basis, greenhouse gas emissions reductions for Ireland of 20% under the a balanced EU package and 30% as part of a global climate agreement.  These are challenging targets to be met by all sectors in Ireland.  I encourage the committee to build on this all-party approach and to consider and support the necessary policies that will need to be implemented to reach the targets they have endorsed.  To this end, I look forward to myself and my Department working with the members of the committee.</P>
        <P>Turning to the committee&rsquo;s report, which examines in detail the European Commission&rsquo;s climate-energy proposals, it is a timely and very welcome contribution.  Given the scale of the challenge we face and the commitment that will be required from all sectors and citizens, the proposals should be examined and debated at every level of society.  This report makes an <Col N="580"/>important contribution to this process of broadening the debate and informing the national position.</P>
        <P>On numerous occasions I have said we are facing one of the biggest challenges ever to face humanity and we, this generation, will be judged on how we respond.  The proposals put forward by the European Commission in January 2008 provide us with the context within which Ireland&rsquo;s efforts will become part of the greater European and international whole.  It is consistent with the EU&rsquo;s goal of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 2&deg; Celsius.  It is worth keeping in mind that even this best case scenario will have a significant impact on the climate system.</P>
        <P>The proposals put forward by the Commission are based on the most up-to-date science available as set out in the IPCC fourth assessment report.  We must make very significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  To meet the 2&deg; Celsius goal, we will have to stabilise global emissions within the next decade or so and then cut them by at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2050.  This means that developed countries will need to reduce their emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050.</P>
        <P>Last year, the European Union set out its aims for a comprehensive and fair international agreement to come into force by the end of 2012.  The EU made an independent commitment to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020 and agreed to increase this to 30% as part of an effective international agreement.  The EU will expect other industrialised countries to take on reduction targets that put them on a similar level of ambition so that developed countries as a whole reduce their emissions by 30% by 2020.  Commitments to take action on rising emissions will be required also from developing countries, and the assistance they will need to make those commitments will need to be agreed also as part of the international negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s emissions are, at 17 tonnes of carbon <i>per capita</i>, the second highest in the EU and it is right, as the committee acknowledges, for Ireland to play the fullest role possible in finding workable solutions.  The Government considers the package to be both comprehensive and integrated and feels it will provide a credible framework for climate and energy policy within the EU.</P>
        <P>The Government fully supports the European Union&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions goals and the architecture of the proposals.  However, we have raised some concerns, especially with regard to the effort-sharing proposals.  We also recognise that agriculture contributes a significant proportion of the emissions in the non-ETS sector.  Taking into account the difficulty in reducing emissions in this sector, the Government has been pursuing discussions with the Commission to ensure proper account is taken of these factors.  We accept that ambitious reductions are required of member states and, along with other member states, have proposed various flexibilities within the overall EU reduction to ensure these targets can be met in the most cost-efficient manner possible.</P>
        <P>I welcome the committee&rsquo;s support for the proposals in general  and its positive views on auctioning for the ETS sector.  The Government&rsquo;s position is to have auctioning to the maximum extent possible as it is the most efficient means of allocation and the most effective means of ensuring least cost emissions reductions by encouraging appropriate investment by industry.  The Government believes the step up to the EU&rsquo;s 30% target should be subject to a new legislative proposal accompanied by a full impact assessment &mdash; I am pleased to see the committee has come to the same conclusion &mdash; to ensure the EU has the best chance of success in meeting its ambitious, world-leading targets.  A rigorous assessment must be applied to ensure member states&rsquo; targets are fair and equitable and can be achieved at the least cost.</P><Col N="581"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The joint committee has proposed flexibility with regard to effort sharing and the idea that member states could trade non-ETS entitlements is receiving careful consideration by member states.  The Government believes that open, market-based trading of effort-sharing allocations between member states is an important and necessary flexibility that will help Ireland and all EU member states to reach their ambitious targets in the most cost-effective manner.</P>
        <P>Ireland has proposed also an additional flexibility of using ETS allocations to comply with a member state&rsquo;s effort-sharing target, although we recognise there is some concern over possible risks to the ETS market.  None the less, we believe it will be possible to negotiate a range of flexibilities that are consistent with the overall reduction target and permit its achievement at low economic cost.  Ireland has made clear throughout this process that the inclusion of sinks is essential if we are to meet our effort-sharing target.  However, the Government is not in favour of extending the use of forestry credits to the ETS given the difficulties in accounting for such credits and the often temporary nature of those credits.</P>
        <P>Concerns about potential carbon leakage are shared by all players.  The relocation of industry emissions and jobs outside of the EU is not in anyone&rsquo;s best interests since it will not reduce global emissions and could result in increased emissions.  Obviously, the risk will be lessened in the context of a global agreement.  However, discussions on how best to assess the risk of carbon leakage and the measures which may be appropriate are ongoing.  The Government is seeking to ensure all sectors at risk are assessed.  To this end, we have raised concerns about the potential for carbon leakage in non-energy intensive industries, including from agriculture.  Discussions on the best means of addressing this issue are ongoing as part of the overall negotiation process.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the positive all-party endorsement by the Oireachtas joint committee of the overall package of climate proposals, the 20% reduction target for Ireland under the current EU package as well as a 30% reduction as part of a global agreement.  I look forward to continuing on this all-party approach when we need to make the difficult decisions to implement measures to reach these targets.</P>
        <P>Some valid suggestions have been made by the committee and many of these are reflected in the Government&rsquo;s position.  These proposals and the related internal EU negotiations form the basis for a future international agreement and represent the best means of tackling the significant climate change challenge that faces us.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Glactar leis go bhfuil fadhb againn le athr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide domhanda ag an bomaite seo.  T&aacute; seo le tabhairt faoi deara sa t&iacute;r.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn n&iacute;os m&oacute; b&eacute;ime a chur ar fhuinneamh glas inathnuaite.  I join the Minister on his remarks to the all-party committee and his endorsement of its findings and support for EU and national targets.  I am proud that one of the most senior and respected parliamentarians in the Oireachtas, a member of my party, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, chairs that committee.  His approach and the insights he brings to discussion are a source of pride to the Fine Gael Party.  I appreciate that Minister has acknowledged his contribution.</P>
        <P>We no longer need to remind people that global warming is real or there is a problem because it is now accepted fact.  There has been a gradual disappearance of Arctic Sea ice, we have heat waves and the risk of more and flooding and hurricanes, etc.  The monsoon-type rains we have had and the change in our climate also suggest global warming.  It is reasonable to begin the debate by accepting global warming as fact.</P>
        <P>The EU target is a 20% reduction of carbon emissions by the year 2010.  We must acknowledge the importance of that target and the greater emphasis on the use of renewable energy sources.  Ireland currently achieves 3.1% use of renewables, but hopes to have a minimum 16% use of renewables by 2020.  Our target for the use of bio-fuels is 10%, although there are issues <Col N="582"/>with regard to the production of these fuels and food supply.  Renewable energy sources must be given priority in the attempt to achieve our targets.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility for developing annual network emission projections and assesses what we need to do to reach the Kyoto and European Commission targets.  The EPA report released on 8 October 2008 is quite damning of our under-achievement to date.  It predicts we will be 6.5 million tonnes over target by 2012, which will result in hundreds of millions of euro worth of taxpayers&rsquo; money being used to purchase credits to fulfil our Kyoto obligations.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has argued we need to do more to deal with the problem of our carbon emissions.  The criticism I would make of the Minister&rsquo;s speech is that it is high on aspiration but low on achievement.  To date, Ireland has under-achieved in this area.  I realise the Minister acknowledges this but it is an indictment of Government and its efforts that we have not done better on our targets.  I will put forward practical suggestions in that regard later.</P>
        <P>We had a 1% reduction in carbon emissions last year, a painfully slow rate of progress.  The net reduction was 700,000 tonnes.  This brought us from 69.6 million tonnes of carbon emissions to 68.9 million tonnes.  This was aided by afforestation and by fewer carbon emissions from the agricultural sector.  Obviously the slowdown in the economy is also assisting in this regard.  It is one of the beneficial by-products of the reduction in economic activity.</P>
        <P>There should be more radical efforts to deal with the question of carbon emissions.  For example, throughout the country there could be feeder buses to central bus routes.  Around my own nearest national road, the N3, feeder buses could bring people to the main route to connect with the main bus to Dublin, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road.  There is a need for a new emphasis on rail freight and better use of the railway system, but there was no indication in the budget that this was being considered.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  This is of great concern.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to address with urgency another major concern, which is the fact that it is not easy enough for producers of wind energy or other forms of renewable energy to gain access to the grid.  The ESB seems to have a monopoly and to be blocking the entry of renewable energy.  A great alternative enterprise would be for a group of farmers to come together and set up a local co-operative wind farm, but if they were to do so, they could not readily gain access to the grid.  That is a critical omission in the current policy.  I sincerely appeal to the Minister to consider this much more radically and to take a hands-on view.  If a small industry sets up a micro-generator &mdash; for example, a wind turbine or water energy installation &mdash; to supply its own electricity at local level, it should be able to sell its excess electricity to the grid.  These are the radical, practical steps that are needed immediately.</P>
        <P>There is a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce carbon emissions by 3% per annum and to reach a target of producing 40% of our energy from renewables by 2020.  It is clear that so far, if one were to adopt a school report approach to the Government&rsquo;s progress, one would have to say &ldquo;Failed &mdash; but could do better&rdquo;.  It is in the hope the Government can do better that we exhort it to deal with the issues as I suggest.</P>
        <P>It is not clear what the impact of yesterday&rsquo;s carbon budget will be in terms of insulation of homes.  I ask the Minister in his reply to be specific about this.  For many months I have requested on the Order of Business that the Government consider the introduction of a comprehensive insulation programme, and have received a positive response from Senator Cassidy, who liaises with the Minister in Cabinet.  On the premise that cavity wall insulation in a standard house should cost roughly &euro;2,200, a grant of &euro;1,000 per house would be realistic.  I would like to hear the Minister spell out the provisions in the carbon budget in this regard.  I understand the amount provided is in the region of &euro;5 million.  With 2 million homes in the country, the degree to which this is possible is questionable.  Is it too much of a marginal effect?  Can the <Col N="583"/>Minister explain to us what he is proposing in terms of insulation projects and alternative energy?</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il partners in Government have succeeded in sending the issue of carbon tax back to the Commission on Taxation, which is obviously an effort to get it outside the timeframe for the local elections.  The Minister should not have acquiesced to this.  Senator Glynn is looking across sceptically but he knows well it is the case.  The objective is to make sure the commission will report around the time of the local elections and that the carbon tax will be introduced after that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean the Senator supports the carbon tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The point we are making&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the support of the Senator for the carbon levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should have been up-front about this.  It is a concession by his party in Government to let it go to the Commission on Taxation for a year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>So the Senator supports it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion, my proposition to the Minister is that we prioritise access to the grid for renewable energy projects.  The ESB needs to be taken on head-on.  If competition needs to be introduced to achieve this, it should be introduced.  We also need to consider rail and buses as an immediate public transport alternative which will allow us to reduce emissions.  We should examine the issue of micro-generation of energy by wind turbines for homes and factories, and the provision of access to the grid for these micro-generators.  Enterprising people who want to generate green energy should be encouraged, but they are currently faced with obstacles such as an inability to access the grid or to obtain an outlet for their energy and the impossibility of making money from it.  This is horrendous.  I ask the Minister to deal with this as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis agus leis an Rialtas as an dea-obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu ar son an chomhshaoil.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte speisialta roimh na molta&iacute; &oacute;n gcomhchoiste.  Admha&iacute;m go bhfuil a l&aacute;n d&eacute;anta, ach t&aacute; a l&aacute;n le d&eacute;anamh f&oacute;s.  I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him and the Government on the initiatives they have taken with regard to protection of the environment.  I especially welcome the proposals from the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  To use the adage, there is a lot done but quite a bit more to do.  This is an extremely important subject and I compliment the Minister, and the Government in general, on the proactive manner in which they have approached it.  There is a dawning realisation in society in general that there must be a clear focus with regard to protection of the environment.  We all share this planet and we have a collective responsibility to ensure it is maintained not only for the current generation but for those who live on it when we are long dead and gone.</P>
        <P>I welcome this report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, the first since it was established in November 2007.  The report examines the potential implications for Ireland of the highly significant EU proposals on climate change and energy security.  These include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, as has been mentioned, and a target of 20% renewable energy to be used throughout the EU by the same year.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned co-operatives and shared energy.  I agree with him.  We must look back at what happened in the old days when we had the old methods of farming.  These were a practical way of ensuring that the amount of energy used was kept to a minimum and used with maximum efficiency.  We are of course talking about asses and carts, ponies and carts <Col N="584"/>or horses and carts, while today we are talking about tractors, combine harvesters and a whole range of farm machinery.  In those days there were few of these around &mdash; in most places they did not exist at all.  There was the reaper and binder and there was the mowing machine, which in some cases was horse drawn, and there was the hay buggy.  We had the ass and cart or the horse and cart drawing home the hay.  Five or six people &mdash; maybe more, maybe less &mdash; got together and helped each other out.  That does not happen to any great extent now, and it is a pity.  Especially in this mechanised age, it would be a good way to reduce atmospheric emissions from machinery.</P>
        <P>There is great talk today about alternative energy.  We have to examine it seriously.  We are fortunate to be in Western Europe.  We are fortunate, for many reasons, to be an island country.  I will not elaborate but they touch on other strata of life that does not make good hearing.  We can return to this aspect on another occasion.</P>
        <P>We have some very important natural resources.  Our peat bogs are a natural resource that is fast disappearing.  There has been mention of the abolition of the farming of peat on a commercial but not a domestic scale.  That is welcome but we must realise we are unique in Europe in respect of these resources.  In many other countries they have disappeared.  To borrow a phrase that might pertain to the north eastern part of the country, &ldquo;What we have we will hold&rdquo;.  We will not give them away.  I have no apologies for saying that.</P>
        <P>We must look at how we do our business.  We have to look at how we travel to work.  For example, the members of 20 households could travel to work in 20 cars, or more in some cases.  Is that necessary?  Are we putting public transport to its optimum use?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Are we making use of the Minister&rsquo;s <i>modus operandi</i>, the bicycle, as much as we should be?  Again, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We are not walking as much as we should.  The result of this is rising levels of obesity.  We are the highest in the league for this, and must deal with all the attendant difficulties.  That is a debate for another day.</P>
        <P>Are we engaging in the appropriate education of our children and teaching them that our environment is the most important thing we have, and the poorest and most deprived, socially and economically, can make a serious bequest to prosperity by ensuring they do their bit to ensure they leave behind a clean environment?  It is a common objective we should all share.  We have not been doing so.  We have been whistling past the graveyard, and now the graveyard is on both sides of the road.  What are we doing to address this?</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly raised the matter of insulation grants.  The princely sum of &euro;45 million has been provided this year for insulation.  That is for all schemes.  It is a sizeable amount of money.  There are issues regarding house insulation and construction.  We all live in houses; we have the highest home ownership in Europe.  That is a proud boast.  In making it we are not saying we are great but perhaps we agree with those who say we are.</P>
        <P>We must adopt a more proactive approach to the matter of climate change and protecting the environment.  We must also ensure the flora and fauna on this planet and island remains, and we do our bit to protect it.  We must maintain the right ecological balance.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions represent only 1% of EU emissions, but our <i>per capita</i> emissions are the fifth highest in the world.  It is not a great place to be.  There is nothing to brag about.  This indicates we need to play our role within the EU to find workable solutions to reduce our level of emissions.  This report examined EU proposals regarding EU emissions trading, sharing of emissions, and reductions and promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.  I touched on that.  As a country we must react to these proposals.  There must be a cut in carbon emissions and a reduction in the use of fossil fuels.  Adaptation is the key.  I used the word &ldquo;react&rdquo;.  It is a pity we have to be reactive and it is a great pity we have not been proactive.  It would be far better if we were.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P>It is becoming apparent that climate change is everybody&rsquo;s business, no matter who they are.  It is nothing new.  The world&rsquo;s climate has changed in the past due to natural causes.  At present, however, our climate is changing due to human causes.  The earth is heating up at a rate which poses a major challenge to all.  There is no doubt human activities are adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.  This enhances the greenhouse effect and is making the world warmer.</P>
        <P>Experts suggest that over the last century, the average surface air temperature in Europe increased by almost  1&deg; Celsius.  The 20th century was the warmest century and the 1990s was the warmest decade of the past 1,000 years.  That is not a great boast.  Some reports predict a rise in temperature by 2100 of between 1.4&deg; and 6.4&deg; Celsius worldwide.  The European environmental agency suggests it may be between 2&deg; and 6.3&deg; Celsius in Europe.  As a planet, the probable consequences of global warming for our natural environment include more powerful and destructive storms and hurricanes, more flooding and natural disasters, more extreme heat waves, less productive agriculture and reduced availability of a very important factor in food production, fresh water.</P>
        <P>There is also the challenge of endangered food security, more fires and drought, high sea-levels and increased coastal erosion, extinction of species and increased spread of vector bourne disease such as malaria.  All of this highlights the importance of tackling this issue.</P>
        <P>We have all inherited this planet.  We can make a major contribution to those who follow.  Hopefully they will take on the mantle that we have taken on board, doing our bit to ensure there is a clean and vibrant environment.  The Government is doing its bit; let everyone else do theirs as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am glad he is in office at this time because of his commitment and enthusiasm for this topic.  I was on &ldquo;Tubridy Tonight&rdquo; on a Saturday night a number of years ago.  I was asked if I was going into business now, what business it would be?  Would I go back into the business I started with at the age of 23?  I answered that I would look at alternative energies.  There must be a future in it.  I was amazed and delighted to receive, within weeks, letters and messages from all over Ireland from people who had ideas concerning not only wind but wave, tidal and solar energy.  The ideas and concepts have come from the enthusiasm of the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
        <P>Al Gore has stated:  &ldquo;Ireland, with its successful business model and unique political positioning, has a key role to play among developed nations in driving the environmental agenda&rdquo;.  That message is getting across and I welcome the debate and this scrutiny report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must look at innovative ways to do this.  What struck me about the scrutiny report was its emphasis on wind power and the country&rsquo;s stagnation in this area.  Ireland&rsquo;s offshore area covers 900,000 sq. km of seabed.  That is ten times the land area of the State.  We must move with the times and invest in such projects.  The scrutiny report found that our planning process hinders the development of such offshore projects and needs to be brought up to date.  The National Offshore Wind Association stated that five companies are waiting to get the Government&rsquo;s go-ahead to develop projects worth &euro;6 billion, which could provide 40% of the Republic&rsquo;s total electricity needs.  Some of these were referred to by the Minister.  In addition, a recent Indecon cost benefit analysis report of offshore wind in Ireland argued in economic terms for investment in this sector.  The report suggested a potential return of &euro;3.8 billion for the country from the deployment of 1,000 MW of offshore wind.  There are, understandably, local concerns, not least from an aesthetic and tourism perspective, but there is evidence to back up the clear economic rationale for investment in this sector.  We need movement on this issue.  Considering our advantageous location &mdash; facing the windswept Atlantic &mdash; which other European countries cannot avail of, it seems a sin not to exploit this emission-free, quiet and renewable source of energy.</P><Col N="586"/>
        <P>I recently heard an Irish man speak at a conference on this topic.  He said it was taking him years to get permission to build three wind generators.  He went to Texas and found an area suitable for his planned 120 wind generators.  When he asked how long it would take to get permission to install them he was told he could be given permission in seven days.  There must be a way around our planning difficulties.  I do not have the answers.  However, unless we commit ourselves to wind energy we will fall even further behind and miss a huge opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Agriculture and transport, what we call cows and cars, are sectors that contribute to climate change in Ireland.  The scrutiny report found that agriculture must be addressed in order to meet climate change targets.  Agriculture contributes 26.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall emissions, predominantly caused by methane from livestock, whereas the EU average is 9%.  The report recommends that the EU include afforestation in its calculations for reducing greenhouse gases in the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P>However, in the wider context, almost every EU country has found reasons why climate change promises may be impossible to meet in their current form.  The European target to produce 20% of all energy, including transport, heating and electricity, from renewable sources by 2020 is ambitious, to say the least.</P>
        <P>In a time of economic downturn, livelihoods of the farming community must be properly considered before setting targets which would cause them further hardship during the downturn.  Farmers are concerned they will have to reduce the bovine herd and are worried that restrictions will force them to stop food production.  I am  not known as an advocate of farmers because I usually find myself representing the consumers.  In this regard they have a very strong case and their concerns must be taken into account.  However, in the broader context &mdash; the macro level &mdash; if we do not address climate change now, it could bring irreversible changes to agriculture in Ireland.  Changes in temperature and rainfall and climatic extremes are already adding stresses to agricultural resources around the world at a time when food price rises and population growth are already major concerns.</P>
        <P>At the end of August, I attended a meeting in Asia on this topic.  I took part in a workshop on sustainable agriculture throughout the world and the threat to food prices.  Earlier today, I mentioned that I met Mr. Kofi Annan last night at a function to mark the 40th anniversary of Concern.  We discussed the fact that 850 million people go to bed hungry each night.  We face a huge challenge of food production.  We may not think so in Europe but we must recognise the challenges the world faces.</P>
        <P>Farmers are concerned by this issue.  We need to balance the two concerns I have mentioned and work for a viable model that addresses climate change and also recognises the vital contribution that agriculture plays in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The scrutiny report believes that Ireland has potential for developing forests which act as a carbon sink to reduce greenhouse gases but so far, the EU does not factor this into official emission figures.  Deputy Liz McManus, who is a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, urged increased afforestation development across the country to remove carbon from the atmosphere.  I would argue for a programme of afforestation on even broader terms.</P>
        <P>A new report commissioned by the EU, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, was published on 10 October.  It found that the global economy is losing more money from the disappearance of forests than through the current banking crisis.  It puts the annual cost of forest loss at between $2 and $5 trillion.  Whereas the United States has lost between $1 and $1.5 trillion in the financial sector, the report estimates that the global economy loses between $2 and $5 trillion every year.  The figure comes from adding the value of the various services forests perform, such as providing clean water and absorbing carbon dioxide.  The report states, <Col N="587"/>&ldquo;As forests decline, nature stops providing services which it used to provide essentially for free.  So the human economy either has to provide them instead, perhaps through building reservoirs, building facilities to sequester carbon dioxide, or farming foods that were once naturally available&rdquo;, or does not have use of such services at all.  The report highlights an issue that is under-recognised.  In this country, we have a strong tradition of maintaining and planting forests.  However, in the light of the scrutiny report, which recommends afforestation, and this new study on the economic benefits of forests, the issue needs more attention than it currently gets.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that Deputy Gormley is Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If anyone is going to do anything about this problem it is he.  I recommend that the words he has used today be supported and I support his motives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that I was not in the House to hear his words but I have read them.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  commendation of the work of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  During the life of the last D&aacute;il, his party colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was very keen that this issue should be dealt with on a cross-party basis.  This is the only way to deal with it properly.  This issue does not divide us politically.  This is why the joint committee works so well.  I thank the Minister for his warm comments. </P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the exclusion of forestry from the emissions trading scheme mechanism.  This is unfortunate.  The consequence of this could be that fewer forests will be planted in Ireland.  Our climate is suitable for the development of forestry and there is considerable untapped potential for a bio-fuel industry.  This potential must be harnessed.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to know how to deal with the question of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from agriculture.  One must consider the size of the national herd.  An obvious and radical solution would be for farmers to diversify into forestry.  Why can forests not be treated like other crops, albeit with a longer rotation?  If we do not look at agriculture differently and consider different solutions in the area of climate change we will not meet our targets.  This is made clear by the very small decline in our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, particularly in the area of agriculture.  Equally, the Minister yesterday outlined statistics relating to transport.  Transport emissions targets have increased and no one knows more and understands the complexities and the scale of the challenge more than the Minister.  How will CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions be reduced in the transport sector without the development of a much more comprehensive public transport system?  For example, the public and private sectors must work hand in hand to deliver bus services throughout the State in order that people will leave their cars at home and avail of public transport systems, which will reduce emissions.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to convert public service fleets to electricity, which cannot happen fast enough.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn touched on how we can deliver the infrastructure to reduce CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions, which is what the directive is about.  The Minister is responsible for foreshore licences.  As Senator Quinn outlined, permissions are granted readily in other jurisdictions.  The Minister will be aware of the time and complexities involved in the grant of foreshore licences, which is a barrier.  The Government should be in the business of removing barriers to enterprise and facilitating its own policies.  This is one area in which swift action could be taken.  Deputy Barrett has asked umpteen times when legislation will come to the Houses to amend the regulations governing foreshore licences.  That cannot happen quickly enough and I would love the Minister to back calls for that to happen as a priority.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the carbon trading proposals in the directive.  I am an environmental realist, which means that while I am committed to looking after the climate and everyone trying to reduce their impact on the world in whatever way they can, at the same time I live in the real world in which people must make a living and an economy must survive and thrive.  That has an impact on our carbon footprint.  The lack of agreement on a global carbon trading <Col N="588"/>system could be detrimental because, until that happens, carbon trading will be a mess similar to the financial sector.  One system is needed throughout the world because this is a global problem.  The European Union should not go down the road of operating separately from other trading mechanisms.</P>
        <P>With regard to carbon leakage, we have a responsibility to ensure industry and business do not move operations outside the Union because of our stringent emissions regulations.  We should facilitate rather than prevent progress in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome broadly the publication of the scrutiny report which contains many useful recommendations.  I agree with the committee&rsquo;s recommendation that we lend our support to the policy framework proposed in the document.</P>
        <P>Over the past six months, every country has been affected by a period of sustained financial turmoil as the global economy stumbles from one crisis to another and, as a result, the environmental agenda and our commitment to reversing the adverse effects of climate change will face a stern test, to which Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred.  These are difficult economic times and it must be ensured our enthusiasm for fighting climate change remains absolute.  The economic crisis has proved that if we ignore tipping points through inactivity, greed and misinformation, we do so at our own peril.  There were many red flags and warning signs in advance of the financial crisis but they were not heeded.  We are at an environmental tipping point and we need to act soon.</P>
        <P>While the findings and deliberations of the committee are broadly welcome, I worry that there is no sense of urgency about how important it is to deal with these issues soon.  It is important to protect our competitiveness and it is vital we defend our agricultural sector, but these issues should be recognised as challenges rather than impediments.</P>
        <P>I refer to the work done by a number of expert organisations and institutions to outline the scale of the problem we face.  In a report published in July, Sustainable Energy Ireland found that the average Irish household consumes 27% more energy than the average UK household and 31% more than the average EU household.  The report found that household fuel use decreased by less than 0.5% between 1995 and 2006 while the average electricity use per person increased by 62%, almost two thirds.  These figures are not reflective of a society taking the threat of global warming and climate change seriously.</P>
        <P>Another report published earlier this month by the Environmental Protection Agency accurately sets out the enormous scale of the challenge that Ireland faces if we are to turn our fine words into action and a co-ordinated national response.  The report says Ireland will face huge difficulties in meeting its Kyoto limits and proposed EU targets by 2020.  The EPA included projections for environmental pressures and, even under the most favourable scenarios, Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions will exceed the 2020 reduction target by 7 million tonnes.  That equates to two tonnes of excess gas produced by every man, woman and child in the country and, therefore, it is clearly something on which we need to take action</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A report from the University of Zurich published in July that measured countries&rsquo; co-operation under five key indicators is even more worrying.  The mechanism the report proposed takes into account whether and how fast countries have committed to the UN Framework on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Other indicators such as reporting, financial contributions and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> were also examined across 198 nations.  On a scale of one to six, with one being the least co-operative and six the most co-operative, Ireland achieved a three, way behind France, Spain, the UK and most of central and Eastern Europe.  We are in the same company as Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Niger, Chad and Burma.</P><Col N="589"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Portugal also scored a three but it is moving ahead aggressively to meet clean energy targets.  A recent EU report maintained that, by 2020, Portugal will be generating 31% of all its energy from clean fuels by 2020.  There are parallels between Portugal and Ireland.  Both countries lack significant oil and coal reserves but Portugal is leading Europe&rsquo;s clean energy revolution and it has successfully mobilised and energised its population in the task of weaning them off imported oil.  Over the past three years Portugal has trebled its hydropower capacity, quadrupled its wind power and has introduced comprehensive legislation to speed up the release of land for renewable energy projects.  A recent report in <i>The Guardian</i> praised the impact of Portugal&rsquo;s enormous investment in wind energy and noted that it is in the process of creating thousands of jobs in this sector, replacing jobs disappearing owing to manufacturing closures.  An economic downturn should not be used as an impediment to investment in policies that reduce climate change.  A fair weather climate change policy should not be a medium or long-term option.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for that clarification.  We are close to the tipping point and we will not use climate change as a political football.  We need fresh thinking across a range of ideas, including nuclear power.  There are people in all parties who would welcome an open debate on this subject.  We need urgency in our consideration of all options.</P>
        <P>We have no oil or coal of our own, but we generate only 3% of our energy from renewable resources.  We are fourth from the bottom of the EU renewable energy league and we lag behind other EU countries in investment in green research and development.  We must move quickly.</P>
        <P>Last October, a climate change Bill was before the House, which agreed that the legislation should progress.  A year has passed, but we have seen nothing further.  The Bill seems to be stalled on Committee Stage or somewhere.  It should return to the House and be passed into law.</P>
        <P>Our level of commitment is not satisfactory.  There must be action.  As outlined in the report, it is vital to communicate these issues to the wider public.  I suggest that a national awareness campaign be undertaken to highlight the dangers of inaction and how it would affect everyone&rsquo;s life.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The report examines the potential implications of three significant EU proposals on climate change and energy security.  The proposals aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% and to achieve a level of renewable energy usage of 20% by 2020.</P>
        <P>The report examines EU proposals on emissions trading, including the regulation of the buying and selling of GHG emissions from electricity plants and major industrial installations.  The proposals suggest an EU-wide cap on the number of emission credits issued rather than the current system of individual national caps.  Emission credits will no longer be issued for free.  Rather, they will need to be paid for.  It is envisaged that this will provide an incentive for investment in lower carbon technologies.</P>
        <P>On the sharing of emission reductions, the proposals seek decreases in emissions from small-scale emitters, such as the transport, building services, residential, agricultural and waste disposal sectors.  These reductions will be divided among member states in proportion to their share of emissions.  Member states will have individual reduction targets based on percentages of GDP <i>per capita</i> set for them in these sectors.</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P>The promotion of the use of renewable energy is an important aspect of the proposals.  It will be established by a binding EU target of 20% usage by 2020.  Ireland&rsquo;s target will be approximately 16%, whereas our current level is 3.1%.  It will be a significant challenge for the Government, business, industry, farming and the general population.  Workers and trade unions must play their part if change is to be brought about.  They must be involved and consulted at all stages.</P>
        <P>Doing nothing is not an option.  We must tackle and not only make dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, but reduce our dependency on fossil fuels within ten years.  We must adapt to meet the new challenges.  Everyone will be affected.  If the emissions reduction targets are implemented, we must drive home the message that climate change is everyone&rsquo;s business and cannot be left to anyone else.</P>
        <P>The report has positive elements.  Given the presentations made to an Oireachtas joint committee and provided that implementation is guaranteed, the proposed investment by utilities, such as the ESB and other renewable energy operators, should enable Ireland to meet its emissions reduction target.  If the Government&rsquo;s national energy efficiency plan is fully implemented by 2020, certain proposed reduction targets may be met in part.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for attending.  I join with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in congratulating the committee on this excellent report.  I also congratulate my party colleague, Deputy Barrett, on his excellent job in chairing that committee.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been exposed in this report.  It is a fallacy to state that we are a green isle, as it is no longer the case.  The desperate water quality in County Galway is an appalling situation and other counties, including mine, have poor water quality as well.  In County Westmeath, it is proposed that 700,000 litres of water will be extracted from Lough Ree to accommodate Dublin despite the 50% wastage of water.  These issues should be examined and addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn referred to the EU&rsquo;s proposed target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.  It coincides with the aim to increase renewable energy infrastructure by 20% across all EU member states.  We are a small nation, but the figures are most alarming when put into perspective.  I agree with Senator Glynn that Ireland&rsquo;s level of greenhouse gas emissions <i>per capita</i> is the fifth highest in the world.</P>
        <P>Tuesday&rsquo;s budget was disappointing.  It afforded the Government an opportunity to address the issue.  Instead, the Government decreased the local government fund by 5% and changed local authority waste management funding.  We have taken meagre measures to reduce emissions.  Regarding the targeted 3% reduction in emissions, it was misleading of the Government to state that the 2009 budget would be green.  The Green Party is dressed in the colours of Fianna F&aacute;il, not its own.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, there was only a 1% reduction in carbon emissions, nowhere near the targets previously set by the Government.  Why is it taking us so long to catch up with the rest of Europe?  The reduction was accounted for by the decreases in the <Col N="591"/>energy and agricultural sectors, the latter of which was referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Malley.  We must give credit where it is due, as the Government is complying and doing its best.  The level of afforestation must be also commended, another factor in our emission decreases.</P>
        <P>Emissions from transport increased from 13.7 million tonnes to 14.4 million tonnes, while waste emissions increased from 1.83 million tonnes to 1.93 million tonnes.  There is an opportunity to open the Mullingar-Athlone link to provide transport for people from Sligo through to Mullingar and Dublin.  This is just one instance which could assist to reduce emissions.</P>
        <P>This budget aims to reduce carbon emissions by 400,000 tonnes throughout 2009.  Vehicle registration tax and changes to motor tax will account for the majority of this reduction.  Encouragement of more organic farming methods and longer grazing seasons will also contribute.  What about all the other areas where we continue to emit high levels of carbon and greenhouse gases?  We must consider seriously all the ways we could reduce our dependency on certain forms of high cost energy.</P>
        <P>The failure to meet the target set out has forced the Government into a position where it must purchase carbon credits which will amount to &euro;50 billion in 2009.  How far &euro;50 billion could go to improving public transport.  We must change the patterns of our behaviour and must be able to honour our obligations.  I am aware a number of cases are currently before the European courts where Ireland is in breach of EU environmental law.  There is no alternative to the simple and plain fact that we must change our policies.</P>
        <P>Newspapers have noted the frustration of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on the slow progress that has been made.  The Green Party has achieved no more than if it were not in Government.  The Minister has also stated he wants a more radical approach.  To this end he announced &euro;200,000 for a bicycle scheme.  This is not a radical move.</P>
        <P>Driving habits will not change following the &euro;200 levy for car parking spaces for all workers in urban areas.  Due to the lack of alternative transport, this will just be another burden for commuters.  These people are victims of the failed policies of the Government.  Commuters have no choice but to drive to work because they had to buy houses in rural parts of Ireland.</P>
        <P>We have made commitments to the Kyoto Agreement.  We must honour them and unless we take radical decisions, we will never reach these targets.  My party colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, said we must drive home the message that climate change is everyone&rsquo;s business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and welcome the opportunity to discuss the scrutiny report on the EU climate-energy package produced by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  I remind Members that the Green Party was instrumental in having that committee established.  It has been an active presence on the committee, as have all the committee members.  The committee has produced a fine report that we have the opportunity to debate.</P>
        <P>The policy framework to which Ireland is responding has come from the EU.  Ireland&rsquo;s track record in addressing climate change and our contribution to climate change has been poor.  Ireland&rsquo;s <i>per capita</i> emissions of greenhouse gases are the fifth highest in the world, which is incredible when one considers the size of the country and our small population.  We have an enabling framework from the EU policy framework that has set targets and put mechanisms in place.  We must now examine this and we are now reacting to the proposals made in respect of what the EU sees as Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities and potential contribution.  We must see how we will implement the specific commitments we are obliged to make.</P>
        <P>In examining any response to climate change we must be prepared to make fundamental and radical changes to how we do business.  Unfortunately, the Opposition is good at complaining and attacking the Green Party, saying it has made no difference in Government.  If measures are introduced that call for change, which no one likes, the Opposition is very oppor<Col N="592"/>tunistic in jumping on them.  At a recent meeting, the Labour Party stated it was opposed to the introduction of a carbon levy.  I find it difficult to understand how the Labour Party will make a transition to a low carbon economy, which is effectively what we must do, if we do not put a price on carbon.  I am delighted the Fianna F&aacute;il Party recognised this and, in the programme for Government, we made a firm commitment to introducing a carbon levy, planned for next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
        <P>The shift to a low carbon economy does not have to be bad news.  It is something we must do and the quicker we do it, the more advantage this country gets in terms of leadership, being ahead of others, new technologies, economic activities and the possibilities for green business and enterprise that open in the shift to a low carbon economy.  With Ireland&rsquo;s potential renewable energy resources, this country stands to benefit considerably if we are to take a leadership position and seize the opportunity before others.</P>
        <P>I refer to Senator McFadden&rsquo;s comments that the Green Party has achieved nothing.  Yesterday, the carbon budget was announced by the Minister.  It was welcome and, while no one is saying it is perfect, the way in which we use it can be refined and improved.  Since the Green Party entered the Government, this is the first time the Government has evaluated and assessed the extent to which budgetary decisions and the working of the economy has an impact on carbon emissions.  This also gives us the opportunity to identify areas of transport, agriculture and waste as high contributors to our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions.  We must examine new and innovative ways to shift to lower emission levels.</P>
        <P>In this year&rsquo;s budget I am happy with the &euro;45 million dedicated towards energy efficiency measures.  Some &euro;10 million will be spent on the greener homes scheme, &euro;20 million on home energy schemes and &euro;5 million on retrofitting council houses.  In better economic circumstances, we would hope to have more revenue to dedicate to these areas but in straitened and difficult times, our commitment to energy efficiency is clear in this allocation.</P>
        <P>I point out to Senator McFadden that in difficult economic times, the metro north project, the extension of the Luas and the Cork-Midleton line remain on track.  These are public transport projects that will go ahead despite difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>We welcome details of the scrutiny report on the climate-energy package.  We welcome the changes to the EU trading scheme whereby there will now be an EU cap on credits issued rather than the current system where each member state has its own cap.  We also welcome that emissions credits will no longer be issued for free but must be paid for.  These are more realistic market conditions for the shift to the low carbon economy and this will provide an incentive for investment in lower carbon economies.  We welcome the overall binding EU target of 20% use of renewable energy by 2020.  Ireland can go further and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is convinced we can reach a target of 40% by 2020.  It will be challenging but it offers economic opportunities.  I welcome the report and look forward to its implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that we will return to a fuller debate on this topic in the near future.  It would be preferable if the debate was to adjourn rather than conclude but that is the order of business as agreed this morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak and I congratulate all those involved in the publication of this report, including my party colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett.  It is very much an all-party consensus in so far as far as an analysis of the problem is concerned.  When we seek solutions I imagine there will be some political difference.</P>
        <P>The one word of caution I would speak at this stage is that in the new economic dispensation and the so-called more difficult times it becomes more problematic to sell environmental concerns and the need for constraint in this area, and to find new ideas and new programmes.  Two <Col N="593"/>years ago, when the Celtic tiger era appeared to be booming, most people took on environmental concerns almost as part of a guilt trip.  They felt somewhat confused about being so well off while they also decided to become concerned about the environment.  It was very welcome that they did so, notwithstanding the reason.  Now, however, with the State&rsquo;s finances in a more perilous position, people will look more to their own finances rather than to the State and to the environment.  We should be a little concerned about this and must keep environmental concerns at the top of the political and economic agenda.</P>
        <P>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley raised the topic of agriculture and I got the impression she believes that if the whole country were planted with forestry all our problems would be solved.  If only it were so.  I recognise that forestry has a role to play and the Irish target for forestry growth is not as advanced as it should be.  There is an onus on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith to look at the grant schemes for forestry.  Perhaps it is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, however, because that Department is always moving.  It is disappointing that we have one of the lowest achievable rates of growth in Europe.</P>
        <P>I have a number of constituents who are investigating the possibility of erecting their own micro-turbines in order to power their farms.  There is an ongoing difficulty in regard to linking up with the ESB grid.  It should be entirely possible to resolve this and it might make a small difference.  All these steps will not make a big difference on their own but put together they are part of the domestic jigsaw.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan spoke about the consumption rates of electricity in this country versus those in Britain and Europe.  We should debate this matter in detail because there is no reason why the average Irish household should use so much more electricity than its average British counterpart.</P>
        <P>I am sorry that in my short contribution I could neither analyse nor solve the problem but I hope we will return to debate this matter in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  We discussed the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Scrutiny on the EU climate package and I congratulate the Chairman and the members of the committee.  The climate-energy package is one of the most significant policy developments to be proposed by the European Commission.  It is a response to the call by the EU Heads of State and Government to transform the European Union into a highly energy-efficient and low greenhouse gas-emitting economy.  The package also provides the cornerstone of the EU&rsquo;s leading role in the international response to climate change.  It will offer a robust basis on which the EU can achieve its independent reduction targets</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the challenge we are facing and the commitment that will be required from all sectors and citizens, the proposals should be examined and debated at every level of society.  This report and today&rsquo;s discussions make an important contribution to this process of broadening the debate and informing the national position.</P>
        <P>The proposals put forward by the European Commission in January 2008 provide the context within which our national efforts will become part of the greater whole.  This is our contribution to EU and international efforts that are intended to meet a very ambitious goal, namely, to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to limit the increase in global temperatures to 2&deg; Celsius.</P>
        <P>The proposals put forward by the Commission are based on the most up to date science available as set out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Fourth Assessment Report.  All countries, as varied as those of the EU, the United States, China, India or Saudi Arabia, have recognised that the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report represents the most <Col N="594"/>comprehensive and authoritative assessment of climate change to date, providing an integrated scientific, technical and socio-economic perspective on relevant issues.  That research concluded that climate change has been caused by man-made emissions, and if these emissions continue to grow they will have potentially catastrophic effects throughout the globe by the end of this century.</P>
        <P>The challenge is as clear and unambiguous as the science.  We must make very significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  To meet the goal of 2o Celsius we must stabilise global emissions within the next decade or so, and by 2050 cut them by at least 50% below 1990 levels.  This means that developed countries will need to reduce their emissions by 25-40% by 2020, compared to 1990.</P>
        <P>Last year, the EU set out its aims for a comprehensive and fair international agreement to come into force by the end of 2012.  The EU made an independent commitment to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020 and agreed to increase this to 30% as part of an effective international agreement.  The EU will expect other industrialised countries to take on reduction targets that put them on a similar level of ambition so that the developed countries reduce their emissions by 30% by 2020.  This will keep us on track to meet the 2o Celsius target and it is consistent with the IPCC findings.  Commitments on action to address rising emissions will also be required from developing countries and the assistance that they will need to make those commitments will also need to be agreed as part of the international negotiations.</P>
        <P>The European Commission&rsquo;s package of proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions reductions and renewable energy targets, to develop a framework for carbon capture and storage and to facilitate environmental investments under State aid guidelines provides a solid and robust basis on which the EU can work to meet its ambitions.  As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stated earlier, the Government considers the package to be both comprehensive and integrated and believes it will provide a credible framework on which to base negotiations within the EU.  The package will take some time for full consideration by all member states and it is possible that EU discussions will last into early 2009.</P>
        <P>A key aim for the Government is to ensure that all sectors can contribute to the attainment of emissions reduction targets for 2020 and that reaching these ambitious but necessary targets should be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the overall targets approved by the EU Heads of State and Government and is also cost-effective for member states.  The Government believes that it will be possible to negotiate a range of flexibilities consistent with the overall reduction target that permit its achievement at low economic cost.</P>
        <P>The Government has also made it clear throughout the negotiations that the inclusion of carbon sinks is very important if we are to meet our targets on the effort-sharing side. On this basis, forestry should not be transferred into the emission trading scheme, ETS.  Sustainable forestry is encouraged under the Kyoto Protocol and it is important that the full potential that it can make to addressing climate change is also incorporated into the 2020 package.  Similarly, it is important that carbon leakage, particularly in the area of agriculture production, should be avoided.  There is no environmental benefit gained by simply transferring emissions out of the European Union. Therefore, it is necessary to address this concern in the context of the on-going negotiations on the package.</P>
        <P>The positive endorsement of the overall package of proposals by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security is to be welcomed.  Some valid suggestions have been made by the committee and, as the Minister outlined, a number of these are already reflected in the Government&rsquo;s position.  I believe that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals and the related internal EU negotiations form the basis for a future international agreement and represent the best means of tackling the significant climate change challenge that faces us.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, for coming before the House. </P>
        <P>The matter I raise is a building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s school for girls in the North Wall area of my constituency.  The school is located in an area which is desperately in need of focused intervention to address educational disadvantage and illiteracy.  Early intervention is also needed in the lives of young families to ensure their children can be put on the right path in life.</P>
        <P>For many years, St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s national school has done tremendous work in difficult circumstances.  In recent years, it has stepped up this work and found new ways to look after students attending the school and their families.  Part of this approach has involved focusing on what it can do with the facilities and buildings in which it must teach children.  With the docklands located immediately adjacent to the North Wall area, the Dublin Dockland Development Authority has assumed a pivotal role in the building project by agreeing to contribute three quarters of the funding required to build the new school.  This has created a unique circumstance in that much of the money required to build a new school &mdash; the focus of most discussions on schools building projects &mdash; is in place.</P>
        <P>The provision of a new school building with a range of new facilities would transform the way in which the community is looked after and its children taught.  It would serve as an icon in the area and demonstrate that the State is serious about tackling educational disadvantage and looking after families in most need.</P>
        <P>The authorities of St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s national school have been waiting for some time for a meeting with officials from the Department of Education and Science to have an update on the position regarding the provision of a new school building.  A meeting planned for earlier in the year was cancelled leaving school staff, parents and the wider community uncertain about the status of the project.  They want the Department to re-engage with them by holding a meeting with representatives of the school, parents and teachers to give an update on the current position and work with them to provide the new facilities the community so desperately needs.  I look forward to a response from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position with regard to the proposed building project for St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s national school, North Wall, Dublin 1.</P>
        <P>By way of background, three existing schools in Seville Place, North Wall, have amalgamated.  These are St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s junior girls school, St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s senior girls school and St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s junior boys school.  It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to provide a new building to accommodate this development and provide for extra demand for pupil places coming on stream from the ongoing development of the Dublin docklands area.  The new building, which is being provided in association with the Dublin Dockland Development Authority, will be developed on the existing site.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>The new school&rsquo;s enrolment at 30 September 2007 was 116 pupils.  It has a staffing level of a principal, five mainstream assistants, one amalgamation concessionary post, one disadvantaged concessionary post, one permanent urban band one post, two permanent learning support teachers, one post for an administrative principal, one permanent support project post and one permanent home school liaison teacher.  Based on an assessment of the projected enrolment, demographic trends and housing developments for the area carried out by the school planning section of the Department, the long-term projected enrolment suggests that a 24 classroom building would be needed.</P>
        <P>The building project is in the early stages of architectural planning.  In this regard a stage one submission, which deals with site suitability and initial sketch of the proposed building, has been submitted to the Department and is being examined by the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff.  The site is extremely difficult as it is limited in size and has a church located on it with a protected feature which, it has been suggested, should remain visible from the street.  Both these issues present not insignificant implications for the design process.</P>
        <P>While there is no difficulty in devising imaginative architectural responses, the Department must bear in mind that the building will be used by young children and the end product must be an effective and efficient learning environment, meet all health and safety requirements for the intended users and be conducive to effective management by the principal.  This is not an easy task given the limitations imposed by the site.  Imaginative architectural solutions also invariably add up to expensive buildings.  While the financial contribution from the Dublin Dockland Development Authority is both significant and welcome, the cost to the Department is likely to be over and above that normally provided for a school of this size.</P>
        <P>Having said that, the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff are nearing completion of their review of the stage one submission for the project in question.  When completed the next step will be to discuss its findings with the board of management.  Once the review is finalised officials from the Department will arrange such a discussion.  Thereafter, further progress on the project will be considered in the context of the schools building and modernisation programme.</P>
