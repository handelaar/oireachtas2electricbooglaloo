	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the BreastCheck service is rolled out in Donegal as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to formally commit to a plan to develop a rail line from Sligo to the city of Derry, creating an all-Ireland rail loop.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the progress on the development of a new school at Rahan, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline the reason the benchmarking pay award has not been paid to some staff (details supplied) who work for local drugs taskforces.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give proper recognition to rehabilitation facilities such as Whiteoaks in Burnfoot, County Donegal which support those at the core of alcohol and drug abuse.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to restore respite beds in St. Laurence Cheshire Home in County Cork.</P><Col N="1082"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to clarify the reason his Department has made a substantial cut in funding to the national chamber choir for 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, Pearse Doherty, Paul Bradford, Frances Fitzgerald, Cecilia Keaveney and Jerry Buttimer as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, Pearse Doherty and Paul Bradford and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Frances Fitzgerald, Cecilia Keaveney and Jerry Buttimer may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Paschal Donohoe as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Title>Standing Order 31. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have notice of a matter of concern from Senator Pearse Doherty under Standing Order 31, namely, the need for the Government to promote the wearing of the Easter lily as a symbol of commemoration of all those who gave their lives in the pursuit of Irish freedom, and this matter will be taken at 12.50 p.m.   </P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on education for persons with special educational needs, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m., if not previously concluded.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, other Senators may speak for eight minutes and Senators may share time, with the agreement of the House.  The Minister is to be called upon ten minutes from the conclusion of the debate for concluding comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister is coming before the House for this debate on education for persons with special educational needs because everyone here is aware of the importance of applied behaviour analysis, ABA, in the education of children with autism.  Government representatives have appeared in local media outlets throughout the country claiming to fully support parents and I want to see that support in this House this morning.  I want the Minister to pay attention to this issue because we will put a motion before this House seeking the aforementioned support for parents.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by a number of issues relating to education in this country.  The Minister for Education and Science said in the D&aacute;il chamber yesterday that there will be large cutbacks in devolved grants and in summer work schemes. <Col N="1083"/> We must have another debate with the Minister to discuss the significant cutbacks that are occurring at the Department of Education and Science and find out whether they are due to reduced funding.</P>
        <P>The report of Dr. Jim Port, published yesterday, indicates that the decision to upgrade Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to university status is an entirely political one.  I request that the Leader of the House ask the Minister to make a quick decision on this matter to allow us discover what is going on.</P>
        <P>Last week I asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, be brought before this House to discuss the special areas of conservation he intends to introduce under a European directive.  I feel it is urgent that he discuss this matter with us to ensure the social and economic needs of areas throughout the country are not superseded by the requirement to fulfil a European directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Leader whether we can have a discussion in the coming weeks on Ireland&rsquo;s heritage, particularly the vital role played by the Irish Georgian Society.  It is appropriate that this issue be raised today because this is the 50th anniversary of the Irish Georgian Society set up by Desmond and Mariga Guinness.  This is especially relevant to Senators in this beautiful part of Leinster House.  Desmond Guinness was incited to start the Georgian Society by the vandalism perpetrated next door to here when two magnificent 18th century houses in Kildare Place were destroyed on the instructions of the Government to the great disadvantage of the Irish people and to the disservice of culture.  It was done as a specific, deliberate, wilful and gleeful act of vandalism as was clearly indicated by the fact that the Minister for Defence at the time, the late Kevin Boland, stated he was glad to see them go as they stood for everything he hated.  This is astonishing, crude and ignorant in its way.</P>
        <P>Prior to this we had the destruction of Coole Park.  What an extraordinary reward for Lady Gregory.  The Gore Booths were hounded out of Lissadell and their few pathetic acres of land taken from them and administered in an appalling way.  I heard on radio a local representative, I believe from Sinn F&eacute;in, state they deserved this because they had walked over the Irish people when their mouths were stained green from the grass they had been eating.  This was a deliberate and calculated lie.  These people bankrupted themselves at the time of the famine feeding the people.</P>
        <P>We need to understand the complexity of our history and pay tribute to people such as Desmond and Mariga Guinness and review what is happening now.  Thanks to the Georgian Society, its members derided as though they were <Col N="1084"/>only belted earls, Castletown and Roundwood in County Laois were saved.  Vernon Mount near Cork is in imminent peril.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on East Timor and this is an appropriate time to do so because the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is there at present.  The country recently had a traumatic episode when the Prime Minister, Jos&eacute; Ramos-Horta, was shot and severely injured.  I am pleased to state that today, for the first time, he has regained consciousness.  Tom Hyland is also there in a semi-official capacity.  He has represented his country with great dignity and pleaded the cause there.</P>
        <P>We should have an opportunity to congratulate the Government on its vision in establishing the conflict resolution unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Its first mission will be in East Timor and I welcome the appointment of Nuala O&rsquo;Loan as she is a most wonderful woman who can only do good.</P>
        <P>This is an extraordinary day as far as I am concerned because for the first time &mdash; and it is traumatic &mdash; I find myself in agreement with Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  I never thought the day would come.  On RTE radio this morning he was absolutely right in what he said about the air traffic controllers dispute.  The person representing the trade union movement did a disservice in refusing to answer the questions which were asked and in seeking 15% for air traffic controllers to be on standby before overtime money is received.  RTE did a damn good job in putting him in a corner and extracting the answer.  It is a day of woe for me when I find intellectual rigour compels me to agree with Michael O&rsquo;Leary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for providing us with a note on what I understand to be legislation which will be introduced in the Houses next week.  It is a note for the Government meeting this week.  I repeat what was stated by many colleagues in December with regard to the health legislation.  It is not satisfactory in any parliament for legislation to be published and go through all Stages in both Houses in one week.  We are not afforded sufficient opportunity and time and I do not mean late night sittings.  I mean the time between the publication of a Bill and its final promulgation.  A parliament debating its relevance should not be asked to consider legislation sight unseen within a week.  It still has not been published and all we have is a summary.  When will it be published?</P>
        <P>As I have done previously and as others have done also, I call for a comprehensive debate on child care.  We had a debate on the subvention scheme prior to Christmas.  I want to discuss the wider question of child care.  What is this country&rsquo;s child care policy?  It comprises two or three elements, the subvention scheme, the early child care supplement of &euro;1,100 and an excessive concentration on buildings and places rather than monitoring quality.</P><Col N="1085"/>
        <P>Child care is about children and ought to be child centred.  We are way behind other countries in terms of our commitment, funding and attention to a real and comprehensive child care policy and system.  Even the Government of Scotland has made major advances in recent months and years in putting in place a comprehensive system.  What type of child care policy should we have?  Who should pay for it?  Should it be available universally?  Should it be subsidised and if so, who should receive a subsidy?  How should this be done?</P>
        <P>We need a proper debate in this House and not simply have the Minister come in, important though this is, and give us lists of figures and places.  Let us have a debate about what vision we have for child care.  We have had at least ten years of prosperity.  Working patterns of families have changed completely and they have to muddle through when it comes to child care provision.  Let us have a visionary debate and not an element of self-congratulation by way of a ministerial speech.  This House should ask what type of system we think we want and how we want to fund it.  This would allow us to do what we should be doing as parliamentarians and offer people a vision of what the future could be like.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The statements on a national waste strategy are proceeding through the House and we will return to them next week.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be in the House to take this debate.  The opportunity of the Minister&rsquo;s presence should be used to make a definitive statement on waste management policy.</P>
        <P>Last evening, an application was made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la through the strategic infrastructure plan by Indaver to place a second incinerator in Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  In doing so, the company has shown the utmost contempt for the local community.  Many statements were made since the formation of this Government and within the programme for Government itself.  We have ongoing processes for reviews of waste management practices and these will report later this year.  Pending legislation will introduce an incineration levy which will make incineration less economically viable.</P>
        <P>For companies to use existing legislation in such an underhand way undermines the efforts to put in place a sensible and sane waste management policy.  I look forward to this opportunity and to the encouragement of the Leader of the House for the making of such a definitive policy statement when we resume this debate next Wednesday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the comments made by Senator Boyle on a need for further debate on a waste management strategy.  The problem is that we have never had a national waste management strategy.  Perhaps we have booklets, documents and departmental guide<Col N="1086"/>lines.  However, individual local authorities have their own plans and strategies and these can contradict with those of other local authorities.  The local authority previously represented by Senators Boyle and Buttimer, Cork City Council, virtually refused to co-operate with my local authority, Cork County Council, with regard to a waste management strategy for the entire county of Cork.  If we cannot get it right for one county, our aspirations for a national waste management strategy will end up in the refuse bin, if one excuses the pun.  I look forward to the debate.  We have had debates <i>ad nauseam</i>, sadly with no progress or action.</P>
        <P>I request a debate as soon as possible on the world trade talks and their possible negative impact on Irish agriculture, in particular the future of the Irish beef industry.  For many months, this House was unanimous in its views on the importation of Brazilian beef.  The progress on this issue led us to believe the Irish beef industry would be in a position to thrive.  However, facts and figures emerging from Brussels indicate the proposals by Commissioner Mandelson, which he is trying to sneak through, will result in the end virtually of the Irish beef industry and will put 60,000 beef farmers out of business.</P>
        <P>This would be a calamity for the Irish economy and for Irish agriculture.  It appears Commissioner Mandelson is on a solo run.  We must intervene and use this House and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to have an urgent debate and take charge of the position from an Irish perspective.  We cannot allow one Commissioner on a solo run to ruin the Irish beef industry.  It is on the verge of happening within weeks unless the Government and the Oireachtas take action.  Is it possible for the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue for next week?  It was discussed briefly at the Joint Committee on European Affairs this week and this morning at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is imperative the debate takes place in the immediate future.  The Oireachtas and the Government must send a strong signal to Commissioner Peter Mandelson, &ldquo;Hands off the Irish beef industry; you will not be allowed dismantle it&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on those involved in the air traffic controllers strike to call it off immediately.  I agree with Senator Norris on this.  &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and RTE deserve great credit for having both parties involved discuss the issue on this morning&rsquo;s show.</P>
        <P>Considering the long-term implications I hope the Leader will have a debate in due course on ensuring essential services are maintained at all times.  We have the Army and Air Corps.  The Air Corps should be trained to take over air traffic control during a time of crisis like this.  We are <Col N="1087"/>an island nation and we depend on air and sea transport to maintain ourselves.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We, as a nation, should have essential services controlled and maintained.  People should be on stand-by, trained to take over air traffic control at a time when a strike is called like this one.</P>
        <P>The strike is outrageous.  It is national sabotage.  It is about time we took action in this regard.  I hope the Labour Party Members use their influence with the people who fund them to ask them to call the strike off.</P>

	<P>I support the calls made for a debate on data retention policies.  The recent incident in which the Irish Blood Transfusion Service lost a large amount of information, which will cause much distress to many, indicates a new political issue is emerging regarding how we look after our citizens&rsquo; information.</P>
        <P>In a matter of weeks, the Government will introduce, through EU directive, a regulation that will require the retention of all e-mails sent over the previous three years.  This is alongside the most stringent policies regarding mobile telephone calls, telecommunications and so on.</P>
        <P>While there is a need for such information to help with security issues and criminal behaviour, there is a clear balance between broader issues of how we look after the privacy of our citizens and the State&rsquo;s ability to do that well.</P><Col N="1088"/>
        <P Just="Left">I also call for a debate on arts policy and how we fund our national and local artistic organisations.  On yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business Senator<b> </b>&Oacute; Murch&uacute; made this point regarding another request I had with the Cathaoirleach.  I respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s decision to rule it out of order.  Nonetheless, many artistic organisations are experiencing changes in the funding they are receiving to provide entertainment and art to their communities.  They provide great comfort and joy to many.  We are entitled to discuss the changes that are taking place and give our view as a House of the Oireachtas into what can be done better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to a Horse Racing Ireland press release from yesterday concerning enhanced links between the Irish racing industry and the industry in Slovakia and the Czech Republic.  It will be sending several Irish stallions to stand at stud in Slovakia.  It is a welcome development and there has been a long tradition of national hunt racing in that part of the world.</P>
        <P>Less satisfactory is the news that F&Aacute;S is attempting to recruit apprentice jockeys into Ireland from those eastern European countries.  This has been a matter of concern for some time.  Jockeyship has been always an important element of the Irish racing industry.  Our jockeys have earned fame all over the world, from the days of Pat Taaffe and Willy Robinson to today&rsquo;s Tony McCoy and Ruby Walsh.  We already have been recruiting apprentices from within the EU and it now seems we are going outside the EU.  This has serious implications for Irish racing because Irish jockeyship is of a particular nature and is an essential important element in our racing game.</P>
        <P>I ask F&Aacute;S to examine why we are not getting sufficient apprentices.  There was a time when every major stable in the country was turning away would-be apprentices.  Now we seem to be recruiting outside of the EU.  I am concerned about this and ask the Leader to refer it to either the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended a function this morning announcing eating disorder awareness week.  It drew attention to the fact that eating disorders can be fatal if left unattended.  Later on, I discovered a friend&rsquo;s sister, a woman of about 60 years of age, had died from anorexia nervosa yesterday.  I had not realised the seriousness of this disease.  I was not aware of our almost lack of attention to it.  The country has three public hospital beds for people who suffer eating disorders.  It is a serious situation that has been left unattended.  We must draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to this serious area.  It jolted me that the sister of someone I knew very well had died overnight in hospital but not in one of those beds allocated for eating disorders.</P><Col N="1089"/>
        <P>I seldom criticise the Taoiseach in the House.  Yesterday, however, I was jolted by the words he used to describe opponents of the EU treaty.  I understand we will have a debate on the EU reform treaty soon.  As with Senators Bradford, Ormonde and others, I have spoken on it at the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  I have asked for both sides of the debate to be moderate in the terms and expressions used.  If we are going to have a logical debate on the issue, we must be careful.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach used words such as &ldquo;loo-las of every kind and shape&rdquo; who advocate &ldquo;loonie-left policies&rdquo;.  Those I hear who are concerned about the EU reform treaty are moderate, rational and deep-thinking people.  When I read the Taoiseach also said some fundamentalist groups following the same nonsense they followed since 1972, I know he is not giving the opportunity to have a logical and comprehensive debate.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach also said that they will &ldquo;succeed in doing what St. Patrick did not do by bringing the water all over Ireland, and every other nonsense&rdquo;.  These are the very words someone in his position should avoid.  If we are going to have a debate on the treaty it needs to be logical.  People on both sides of the debate are concerned about making the right decision.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A European in a senior position who I know has told me he had suffered for 40 years by having a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; in Moscow looking after his country until they got their freedom.  He told me he does not want a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; in Brussels.  He is using an expression I have heard used by enthusiastic Europeans who want to see the European ideal succeed.   They want to have a logical debate on the treaty.  Let us have this debate and avoid using terms which may close it down.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with great reluctance that I rise to put on the record of the House my concern about today&rsquo;s report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that it is proposed to remove the poetry of Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh from the Leaving Certificate syllabus.  I say &ldquo;rise with reluctance&rdquo; because it is almost impossible to say anything about this terrible matter without being misunderstood.  For the record, I do not approve of the alleged actions of Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh, if he abused his position in a Third World country to secure sex with under age boys.  That, however, has not been brought before a court nor proven.  He has been tried, hanged, drawn and quartered without any proper trial or due process  If he is found guilty, I am not defending him.  However, I want it on the record that it is not a good thing in any society to talk <Col N="1090"/>about removing books from a syllabus.  It is especially not a good thing in this House, where many more eloquent voices than mine have been raised to protest censorship, to propose to remove the work of one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest homoerotic poets.  The young people I teach and meet are well able to discuss the morality of these issues.  It is patronising not to allow them to engage in the debate.  Poetry does not come pre-moralised.  Poets have had all sorts of lives.  Poetry must engage us, force us to deal with ethical issues, to liberate our minds.  It would be the best thing in the world if the boys and girls of Ireland were to engage with the politics and sexuality of Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh&rsquo;s poetry and with the moral issues raised by it.  That would educate our people.  I am glad to see many young people among our visitors today.  I trust that every last one of them would be able to handle this issue.</P>

	<P>I was struck by the silence of <i>The Irish Times</i> on this issue.  Everyone is petrified of the &Oacute; Searcaigh case.  There is total silence &mdash; not a word of protest &mdash; from the great liberal organ <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning.  I deplore any abuse by Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh of his position in the Third World, but I also deplore any measure that would remove a poet from the syllabus in Ireland.  We should now be a grown-up society which is prepared to engage with moral and ethical issues and with the problem posed by a good poet who may not be such a good man in human terms.  These are the moral issues which help our children to grow up.</P>

	<P>Like Senator Norris, I was delighted to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, unveil the conflict resolution unit whose first mission will be in Timor-Leste.  Timor-Leste is one of our Irish Aid programme countries, which means it is one of the nine or so countries which receives special assistance.  At present Irish aid represents 0.53% of GNP, and the Government has made a commitment to increase this to 0.7% of GNP within four years.  That further increase gives us more possibilities.  It allows us to not only increase the amount of aid to our programme countries but also to increase the number of programme countries.  I ask the Leader to speak to the Minister about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I believe east Africa is well covered under the aid programme, as there are programme countries all down the east African coast.  I would like us to increase the number of programme countries on the west coast of Africa to include countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and perhaps Niger.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to consider putting those countries on our programme list as the amount of aid increases.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I agree with the remarks of Senator Quinn and express my regret at the comments attributed to the Taoiseach this morning in the national newspapers.  He is reported to have said that those opposing the Lisbon treaty were on the &ldquo;loonie left&rdquo;, and made other comments to which Senator Quinn referred.  I say this with reluctance because if it were not for the Taoiseach I would not currently be a Member of the Seanad.  I know the Taoiseach is passionately committed to seeing the Lisbon treaty supported by the Irish people in the referendum that is due to take place in a couple of months, but it is important, as I have said before, that the climate in which the debate is conducted is one of tolerance and respect.  The essence of democracy is the recognition that others hold different political views which should be respected and listened to even if not agreed with.  I hope that is the way in which the debate on the Lisbon treaty will be carried out, not just in this House but nationally.  I do not think that name-calling or derision of the Opposition members and their motives is a good way in which to conduct the debate.</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House to discuss Ireland&rsquo;s position on Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence, because this issue is causing much tension within the EU.  The Irish Government has expressed its support for Kosovo&rsquo;s independence.  However, it is a complex issue because other newly formed states will also wish to declare independence in the future and there is a question of whether the EU will recognise these.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to come to the House to explain the reasoning behind the Irish Government&rsquo;s support for Kosovo&rsquo;s independence.  I also ask that the Irish Government contribute to the debate within the EU by proposing something like the Copenhagen criteria.  These criteria, which apply to any aspiring member of the EU, are clear conditions that countries must meet before being allowed to join the EU.  Similarly, the EU could draw up a set of criteria for recognition of the independence and sovereignty of newly formed states.  This will allow us to move away from what appears to be an arbitrary situation in which the EU may recognise the independence of certain newly formed states but not of others.  I ask that the Minister come before the House to discuss this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for his kind offer of a debate on the proposed closure of the vital coastguard stations at Valentia and Malin.  Could he clarify whether he intends to have this debate next week or the following week?  The issue has become more urgent since we recently spoke about it, as a Deputy in the other House has obtained, under the Freedom of Information Act, a report which recommends the closure of the stations, despite the fact that the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, signed off two years ago on a Deloitte &amp; Touche report which recommended that the stations be upgraded in view of their strategic importance and sterling service to the State.  The document recommending their closure relies on false assumptions and inaccurate data on electricity and telecommunications which, as I said here the other day, have been blown out of the water by the former chairman of the ESB.  I thank the Leader for his kind offer but it is important that we arrange the debate soon.</P>

	<P>About a year ago Senator Mary White raised the issue of the demise of various petrol filling stations around the city.  Since then we have also seen the demise of many important landmark hotels in the capital city.  I have concerns that the planning process is now developer-led.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently published planning guidelines, which include welcome aspects such as the requirement to include transport, schools and community facilities in the consideration of planning applications.  However, I am strongly at variance with the continuing mantra from the Department of the need for high-density development.  The current proposals are for 50 dwellings per ha., which equates to 20 residential units per acre.  There may be some argument in support of this for cities such as Dublin.  However, in provincial Ireland this will give rise to serious problems down the line.  Rather than increasing densities, we should be reducing them.  I recently spoke to planners in my own county who favour a density of eight to ten dwellings per acre, which was the case 20 or 30 years ago.  Unless we move back to this plan-led approach, we will create a severe social cost for future generations, which I do not support.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca for a debate on Kosovo.  Her argument for this was well articulated.  The question of whether to support the independence of Kosovo is not cut and dried, and it warrants a debate in order that all sides of the argument are fully presented and considered.</P>

	<P>I wish to comment on two of the issues raised by colleagues this morning.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s language in the context of the Lisbon treaty were welcome.  A few months ago, the <Col N="1093"/>Taoiseach spoke about how he was worried about &ldquo;lulus&rdquo; jumping out at him from behind bushes.  I now know that was is talking about &ldquo;loo-las&rdquo;.  </P>

	<P>The Senator should confine his remarks to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach knows my views on that.  The Taoiseach may bring about a situation where people will be cheesed off with the attitude of proponents of the Lisbon treaty and vote accordingly.  It is in the interests of those who propose a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote to this treaty to ensure they get their language right, propose, as Senator Quinn has suggested, a rational debate based on the issues and not engage in name calling in respect of those who disagree with them.</P>
        <P>I also welcome what Senator Harris said about the Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh affair.  I have refrained from commenting on this.  I am very disturbed by the alleged events but would tend to be of the view that we should not talk about or criticise people&rsquo;s behaviour in this House unless we can establish that they have broken the law in some way.</P>
        <P>There is a distinction, however, to be drawn between censorship, where we prevent books from being sold on the market, and legitimate prudential decisions that can be taken on behalf of the community by those who set the syllabus.  It is not an issue of censorship if people make a judgment call or try to make a statement.  I privately canvassed the views of my colleague, Senator Norris, about how we would feel if the films of Leni Riefenstahl, who made pro-Nazi films, were taught.  Sometimes, there is a judgment to be made by those who set the syllabus and they may want to register their disquiet at certain behaviour.  We should call that censorship <i>per se</i> because we are not talking about preventing people from having access to these books and films as a matter of free choice.  We are talking in the educational system about forming the minds of the next generation and moral issues do arise there.  There is such a thing as setting a good example to the rest of society and those who make these decisions should be allowed to act accordingly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise again to ask the Leader if we could have an urgent debate on the future of the fishing industry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the restructuring plan announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food yesterday.  I accept that under the Cawley report, which was the plan for fishing going forward, the fishing industry has, by and large, agreed to the decommissioning of its vessels.  However, in this instance, 75 trawlers will be removed from our fishing fleet, which will have a considerable impact on communities like <Col N="1094"/>Castletownbere, Union Hall, Rossaveal, Killybegs or Dingle.  We should look beyond that and see what can be done by way of regeneration for the communities in those areas because the trawler owners would get reasonably substantial and proper compensation for taking their boats permanently out of the fishing fleet.  We accept that fishing stocks are dwindling and that this is, in one sense, a double-edged sword.  We need to do this even though it is sad when one sees the vessels.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">My concern is that most of these vessels have five or six crew members.  What will be the fate of these people?  Some of them have families, mortgages and commitments and are active in the community and involved in football or other sports and social activities.  If 500 or 600 jobs around the coastline are lost, we must see what can be done to ensure that there is a sustainable initiative or package into the future, which should be supported by Europe for coastal communities.  In the short term, one can look at the salient features of this package but there are knock-on effects about which I am deeply concerned.  The future of coastal communities, particularly the fishermen who have sailed the seas in these trawlers, should be looked at and I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate and invite the Minister to the House to see what can be done to have a soft landing, if I can use that term, for the people concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything about which I will speak this morning is a crisis.  I asked the Leader to intervene last week with regard to the pharmacy issue.  We are within ten days of the deadline.  Have we given up on talks?  Has the Leader had any success in persuading the Minister for Health and Children to pull back from the 1 March deadline so that talks can be reopened with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union?  I fully support the &euro;100 million savings, as do the pharmacists who are more than willing to find ways to identify those savings without closing rural pharmacies.  Again, we will hurt the sickest patients and I do not believe in putting pharmacists in rural areas out of business.  Carraghroe is at risk, to name one.  </P>
        <P>I support the call for a debate on the funding of schools.  The Minister will be in the House this morning but she will not be dealing with the funding of schools.  The summer works scheme has been pulled, while the devolved scheme has been slashed.  We know about water charges and the serious underfunding of primary schools.  It shows that the Minister has done no forward planning and is desperate in respect of financing the new model of schools.  I ask her not to let our schools fall apart.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to examine what is nothing less than an environmental crisis in Galway in respect of water and sewerage.  I was in Connemara last <Col N="1095"/>weekend attending clinics.  Clifden Bay is contaminated.  A total of 80% of the water tested by the Environmental Protection Agency is below acceptable safety levels.  If anyone fell into Clifden Bay, he or she would be killed.  That is how bad the situation is.  A fatal accident could occur there.</P>
        <P>Many activities in Clifden Bay, such as boating, sailing and fund-raising events, have been called off because of the state of the water.  The same is true of Oughterard.  One person told me that a report they read in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> last month about the stage the sewerage scheme was at was the same as that read in the same newspaper in 1999.  I ask Green Party Members to convey to the Minister the extent to which the environmental situation in certain counties, particularly Galway, has been left behind.  I have a feeling that the water crisis that has gripped Galway is bubbling in many other counties.  Let us address this issue.  A boiled water notice is still in use in Clarebridge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

There is a unanimous decision by all the political parties in this House this morning that it is so.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Harris&rsquo;s comments about Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh.  It is not the first time in Ireland that a person was presumed guilty because their name was in the media.  Where is our presumption of innocence?  I am reminded of how, in the 1950s, John McGahern was fired from his job in Belgrove national school because of his personal life.  This was a person who we subsequently feted for his tremendous literary work about Leitrim and rural life in Ireland.  I heard about it on the radio but had not read the newspaper earlier this morning.  Listening to the radio, a shiver went down my spine because I wondered whether we were going back to those dark and suppressing days of censorship.  As Senator Harris stated so eloquently, young <Col N="1096"/>people need to be provoked, to have their thoughts stimulated and to make up their own minds.  They are well able to do this.  </P>
        <P>The library in Newbridge, County Kildare, contained a reserve list of books which young people were not allowed to read.  I always went after them when I was 14 or 15.</P>

	<P>I rise to support my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Coghlan, in respect of Valentia and the debate on the issue which I hope will be brought forward next week.  The report to which he refers was incompetent at best and, at worst, contained lies.  It was written by Department officials and supported by the Irish Coast Guard with information it supplied.  That information was entirely inaccurate.  The report refers to the electricity supply in Valentia as being inadequate because it experienced blackouts.  What those involved did not realise is that the mother of the chairman of the ESB at the time lives in Valentia, and he was brought up in Valentia, and he was able to reply that the electricity supply in Valentia is as good as the supply in the rest of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>He demolished those arguments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>They referred to the Eircom connection being inadequate, which was refuted by Eircom, as my learned colleague on the opposite side of the House stated.  They said the staff did not live within the county, which was untrue, and referred to the buildings being inadequate, which again was false.</P>
        <P>Last year, Valentia Island was involved in almost half of all the emergency calls to the Irish Coast Guard, more than Malin and Dublin combined.  When the United Kingdom and Spain closed down their coastguard stations they realised it was a mistake and reversed the decision.  Valentia coastguard station is the only one in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and France that can communicate with Spanish trawlers in any emergency call involving Spanish trawlers.  When the RAF and the English coastguard lifeboats must winch stricken captains and seamen off their vessels, it is Valentia that is called in by the English and the French to co-ordinate such responses.  Valentia staff learned Spanish of their own accord.  When they asked the head of <Col N="1097"/>the Irish Coast Guard for Spanish tapes, they were refused.</P>
        <P>The men in Valentia are doing an excellent job.</P>

	<P>Senator Twomey expressed serious concern regarding the applied behavioural analysis issue.  The Minister for Education and Science will be in the House at 11.30 this morning until 2 p.m.  He called also for a full debate on education.  We can discuss that at the leaders&rsquo; meeting and perhaps next Tuesday could be considered.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the 50th anniversary of the Irish Georgian Society.  On behalf of the House, I offer our congratulations to the society for its commitment and a job well done in protecting our heritage.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s sentiments, especially regarding Desmond Guinness and his family and all those whom the Senator correctly pointed out have done excellent work.  The least we can do is acknowledge that work and show our appreciation for what they have done in poor times in the past 50 years.  One only has to consider how the economy was performing and how expensive it is to restore Georgian buildings to their former splendour and glory.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan and other Senators called for a debate on East Timor.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed to come to the House for a wide-ranging debate on his foreign affairs portfolio.  We wish him well on the remainder of his trip to East Timor.</P>
        <P>On the issue raised by Senator Alex White, that Bill is being published tomorrow.  It is a Seanad Bill, the Second Stage of which will be taken in the House next Thursday.  It is being initiated in the Seanad.  I thank Senator White for his understanding in that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator White called also for a debate on the future of child care and the need for a new vision in terms of the substantial funding being spent on child care.  There have been considerable improvements in the past four budgets in the funding for child care and a debate as soon as possible on the funding being spent on it would be worthwhile.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle and Bradford expressed views on the waste management policy and asked that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, would come to the House.  I am pleased to be able to arrange for that to happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford expressed serious concern regarding the World Trade Organisation talks.  I had the pleasure of attending the WTO talks two years ago and I agree with him on the threat to the Irish beef industry and the route Commissioner Mandelson appears to be taking.  An <Col N="1098"/>urgent debate should take place in the House.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, on her steadfast refusal even to contemplate some of the proposals which pose dangers to our beef industry.  She has not taken &ldquo;No&rdquo; for an answer in the past two to three years.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for the air traffic controllers to desist from taking strike action and said that as this was an essential service, the Army should be trained to undertake it.  I understand certain personnel in the Army are trained in this area.  It is an essential service, like the ESB, and is an area the Minister should examine.  We should have a debate at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a debate on information on citizens.  I understand an EU directive will be forthcoming on that area.  We will try to provide time at the earliest possible opportunity but the Senator might discuss the issue with his leader with a view to using Private Members&rsquo; time.  It is an issue he could prioritise and assist the Leader on also, if that is possible, particularly in regard to security issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called also for a debate on arts policy and the changing trends in the public domain in terms of the difficulty of obtaining new funds and assisting voluntary organisation, especially those who have kept arts alive in our country over many generations.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views and will consider if time can be set aside at some future date to review that area.</P>

        <P>Senators Quinn, de B&uacute;rca, Mullen and Mary White expressed views on the European referendum debate which will take place with the President of the Commission in early April.  I look forward to the participation of many Senators in that regard.  The proposal is that the Commission President will come to the House following the Order of Business.  We will then have the Minister for an entire half day after that which means that everyone will have an opportunity to express their views.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn highlighted eating disorders and the serious problem we face in that regard.  That can be brought home forcefully to the Minister on her next visit to the House.  I agree with the sentiments the Senator expressed.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris, Mullen and Mary White expressed strong views about Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh.  We all must recognise this man&rsquo;s talent and ability as one of our foremost poets.  The Senators <Col N="1099"/>correctly covered all the other aspects which are in the public domain but everyone is innocent until proven guilty and we should not move away from that under any circumstances.</P>

        <P>Senators Coghlan, O&rsquo;Donovan and Daly called for an urgent debate on the coastguard stations at Valentia Island and Malin Head.  I have endeavoured to have this take place next Wednesday.  I propose that it will take place from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh expressed concerns about planning regulations, as a public representative with experience at local authority level and through his officership of the national organisation of the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA.  This concerns where we are going and how we wish Ireland to be for the next 50 years.  Whatever is the density in Dublin, this is not to be the same in rural Ireland.  As a member of Westmeath County Council, I found that the Dublin planning guidelines were taken as planning guidelines by the neighbouring county, such as Meath.  Then the next county, Westmeath, would take it from the neighbouring county.  The planning guidelines for a city such as the capital city, Dublin, could stretch 80 miles from O&rsquo;Connell Street, which is not relevant to the quality of life in which we were reared.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the fishing industry, particularly in respect of the announcement made yesterday.  I will endeavour to facilitate the request, either before or after Easter.  Senator Healy Eames referred to the pharmacy issue.  She is not quite correct although she is correct to call on me to hear the up to date position.  I am endeavouring to have this debate take place next week.  It is a matter of finding time in the Minister&rsquo;s diary.  Major negotiations and discussions are taking place in various committees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Healy Eames also raised environmental difficulties in Galway.  Galway County Council did not spend its money in five years.  Funding was made available by the Government in 2002 and it remained unspent in 2007.  The council cannot blame the Government, the Minister or parliamentarians in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  If the money was allocated it should have been spent. <Col N="1100"/> In Westmeath, when there was a difficulty in Lough Ennell, we awarded the contract within seven months and the work was completed within a year and a half.  That is what happens in the real world.  I know the area in Galway to which the Senator refers because I frequent it often.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Special Educational Needs: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith anseo san tSeanad.  I thank the Leader for giving Government time to discuss this important issue.  There are quite a number of children of varying needs across the system who need extra attention and care.  There have been a number of occasions over the past three years when this House has debated this topic.  I know it is of interest to many Senators.  We recognise that very little attention was given to children with special educational needs.  We have been playing catch up because it was not given the attention it deserved.  In the past ten years everyone must agree that there has been a transformation in educational policy for children with special educational needs.  In the lifetime of the Government over the past ten years, the changes give an indication of the progress in this area, while we recognise that the area needs investment and support.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago there was no automatic entitlement to teaching or care support for children.  Provision for children with special needs in mainstream schools was virtually non-existent.  The vast majority of schools did not have resource or learning support teachers.  Ten years ago there were only 252 special needs assistants in total, nearly all of which were in special schools.  If a child had any significant educational or care need, the parents had no choice but to send the child to a special school.  Special schools are excellent and do tremendous work but there was no opportunity to mix with other children who did not have special needs but who were in the same community.</P>
        <P>At that time there were eight classes for children with autism throughout the country.  Within ten years, vast changes have taken place.  The first was when my colleague and predecessor, Deputy Martin, adopted the policy of automatic response.  For the first time a child with a special educational need had the right to additional teaching or care support.  Since then, the services have improved dramatically, particularly the right of each child to the maximum appropriate level of inclusion, in line with abilities, has been recognised and supported in legislation and in practice.  I referred to the small number of special needs assistants, less than 300 ten years ago.  There are now 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools, a figure that speaks for itself.  Senators may think this is just a statistic but that is not the case.  These <Col N="1101"/>are people working with children in our schools to enable them to get the support needed to learn.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>They are untrained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>They are special needs assistants.  I challenge anyone to state that the 10,000 special needs assistants in our schools are not playing a valuable role in supporting our children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what we said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Equally, the number of teachers working solely with children with special needs has increased to 9,000 fully qualified teachers.  The continued support for them and our special schools has helped education throughout the country and has also helped children and the provision of excellent service to children with varying degrees of need.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of these improvements have come about in the past ten years and many in the past three years.  Significant improvements have taken place since I became the Minister for Education and Science because I made it a priority.  This needed to be developed following the work of my predecessors, Deputy Martin&rsquo;s work on automatic response, and Deputy Noel Dempsey&rsquo;s introduction of legislation.  This had to be built on but no work had been done by a previous Minister until 1997.  In the past three years, investment in special needs has doubled to over &euro;900 million this year.  In the same period, 6,000 of the additional special education staff have been appointed, 4,000 special needs assistants and 2,000 teachers.</P>
        <P>The application process has been completely overhauled.  It is no longer a centralised system whereby one had to apply to the Department.  It is more customer friendly, more user friendly and more family friendly because we now have 82 special needs organisers working locally.  At least people need not contact the Department centrally but can have their concerns and needs met at a local level.</P>
        <P>Every primary school in the country has an allocation of resource teachers based on its enrolment figures.  This means the needs of children with what we call high-incidence special needs, namely, the more frequently seen special needs, and those who have learning difficulties such as dyslexia can be met immediately in the school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all adequate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The majority of primary school pupils with special needs no longer require assessments in order to get extra support.  When one recognises that there are 9,000 teachers and <Col N="1102"/>10,000 special needs assistants, it is a particular priority and has ensured there are major improvements for our children.</P>
        <P>Training has been improved significantly as well.  This was an area where little had been done but there has been a major expansion of the special education support service.  The service was set up in 2003 but last year alone it was in contact with 15,000 teachers.</P>
        <P>The day-to-day funding for special classes has been significantly improved, and has been almost doubled for classes for children under 12 with a physical disability.  A new package of extra resources &mdash; higher capitation grants, teaching principles and priority status on the building programme &mdash; has been made available to encourage schools to set up special classes for children with autism.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have bits of pages through which I am working.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Classes for children with autism have increased from 150 in September 2004 to 277, 100 of which were established in the past year.  Significant advances have been made to support children and their families.</P>
        <P>I mentioned at the outset that the only option for children with the complex or more severe special needs ten years ago was the special school, whereas now there are three options available.  For the child who is able to integrate and be in the mainstream classroom, that is an option, particularly with the extra supports available to them.  There is the option of a special class attached to a mainstream school, which is becoming a more frequent option throughout the country, and there is also the special school.  Children and their needs change as they get older and more mature.  The aim has been to establish a continuum of education in order that children can move from one setting to another according to their changing needs.</P>
        <P>Equally, in all of this talk about the changes that have come about in our mainstream schools, it is particularly important that I should acknowledge and recognise the valuable and continuing role of the special schools, which are becoming centres of excellence.  I see great potential for them to be centres of excellence and to offer outreach supports to other schools in their areas.</P>
        <P>We are also committed to developing a new procedure for dual enrolment in order that the children can attend both a special school and a <Col N="1103"/>mainstream school, as appropriate.  Therefore, there always will be a strong role for the special schools and children will be able to get both supports.</P>
        <P>Many parents prefer integration.  They prefer their child to go to the local school along with his or her siblings and that he or she would be able to mix and play with other children from their local area, and many of these children need intensive support.  It is the wish of the majority of parents, and the guiding ethos of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, that educating children in the least restrictive environment is the norm in developed societies in recent years.  From talking to parents I know they value not only the quality of education but also the socialisation that brings with it.  Only last week, the parent of a child in one of our special units for children with autism with whom I spoke stated how the attitude of her local community has changed towards her child because they now see her child as just being another who is able to go to the local school and able to play. It had a wider impact which was encouraging to hear.</P>
        <P>I mentioned at the outset that not only have all of these services &mdash; extra teachers, extra supports and so on &mdash; been put in place, but there is also the legislative support and the legislative background.  In aiming to make our service one of the best in the world, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 was introduced.  That Act includes an entitlement to an educational assessment for children with special needs.  It also includes an entitlement to an individual education plan, recognising that every child is different and every child has a range of needs.  It provides for parents to be consulted and informed at different stages of the process and they will also have recourse to an independent appeals board.  Given the sheer scale of the improvements provided for under the Act which will lead to a significant transformation of educational services in a short period of time, the legislation specifically provides for a phasing-in period over five years.  Obviously, it involves training, resources, supporting the schools and the children, and at the beginning we set out clearly that it was vital to have the supports in place to assist the schools before they become subject to new responsibilities under the Act.  We are on target to have that Act, as was set out in the legislation, fully in place by October 2010 and are working towards that.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the work that we have been doing in that regard.  In addition, we have also issued advice to schools on how to devise and implement an individual education plan.  Second level schools have received specific advice on how to meet the challenges associated with including children with special needs at second level, and that certainly is a challenge and something we constantly aim to improve.</P><Col N="1104"/>
        <P>A cross-sectoral team has been established bringing together the Department of Health and Children and my Department.  We recognise that one must provide cross support for children with special needs between the two Departments, and with the HSE and the National Council for Special Education, to ensure there can be co-ordinated delivery of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  A sign of the commitment of Government to ensure that we get this co-ordination was the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, between the two Departments to ensure that the interests of the children will be better served by it.</P>
        <P>The members of the independent special education appeals board were appointed in April 2007.  At present, they are working to ensure that the structures and processes will be put in place and ready for when the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act comes into effect.  We are working ahead of ourselves on that.  The important work is being undertaken so that when the Act comes into effect the entitlement to recourse to an independent appeals board can be met.</P>
        <P>We expect that many of the appeals will be on the individual education plans, IEPs, to which children will be entitled.  Obviously, it is important that the schools are given an opportunity to prepare for the introduction of the IEPs and that people are trained properly in that regard.  It is in train but rather than merely implementing the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act without having the back-up support, training and processes put in place, we are doing it in a sensible and planned way to ensure it works efficiently.  In the meanwhile parents can appeal allocations and supports through the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is important.  It will be fully in place, as set out in the timelines in the legislation, by October 2010, but it is important that we get it right.</P>
        <P>Of course there are a number of children throughout the country who have different special needs.  For example, we do much work with the Down&rsquo;s syndrome association and, as I mentioned already, younger people with dyslexia.  Of course, I have frequently met many parents of children with autism.  These are parents who are extremely committed, as are all parents who have children with special needs.  They make many sacrifices for their children.  It takes much time and a great deal of energy, and they do everything they can to ensure the development of their children and to ensure they get every opportunity in life.  I know from parents of children who have autism that it is particularly difficult when that child is physically and emotionally distant from them.  It is a considerable challenge, for families <Col N="1105"/>and for all of us, to ensure such children get the best opportunity in life.  It is an area to which we have given major priority as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Autism was specifically recognised as a special educational need only in the past ten years or so.  Since 1998 the Department has been trying to work along this continuum of being able to support children.  It is not easy because of the historical lack of service.  As I mentioned at the outset, we are all the time playing catch-up but considerable progress has been made in this regard.</P>
        <P>In trying to prioritise early intervention, we put in place a system of home tuition for pre-school children.  Senators will be aware that children up to the age of three are entitled to ten hours of home tuition a week and up to school age this entitlement rises to 20 hours a week.  In addition, 23 autism-specific special pre-school classes have been set up around the country.  Again, this is something we wish to expand as we have seen its value in responding to the need that exists.</P>
        <P>The major increases to which I have referred, in provisions of special education teachers and assistants for our schools, have enabled 2,100 children with autism to be integrated into mainstream classes in their local schools.  These are children on the autistic spectrum who are receiving the benefit of integration in addition to specialised education and care.  Places have been created for nearly 1,000 further children in the autism-specific classes I mentioned.  Senators will know that for the 500 children in special classes in special schools, six children are catered for by one teacher, two special needs assistants and more assistants if an individual children requires it.  There is one unit where there are five children, five special needs assistants and one teacher, a total of six adults present for the five children.  The particular need of the individual child is identified and one to one support is available if the child needs it.  In addition, there are 244 children attending the centres currently being funded under the ABA pilot programme.</P>
        <P>The emphasis always is on the children, trying to ensure that their needs are met, given that autism is a complex area and that every child has a range of needs, including children with autism.  In setting up these classes throughout the country, 100 of which have been set up in the last year, the Department will also arrange to pay transport to get the child to the nearest one if there is not one immediately local to an individual family.  If a family cannot get a placement home tuition is available to them.  The number of children availing of this service is now very small because we are expanding the service throughout the country to meet needs.</P>
        <P>Children in these special classes have the benefit of fully qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children and who understand the pedagogy involved.  They also have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches.  A range of different approaches is used.  These include PEX, Picture Exchange <Col N="1106"/>Communication system, ABA, Applied Behaviour Analysis and TEACH, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication-Handicapped Children.  Training is available for teachers in all these approaches.  The teachers are also qualified in child development, which is important.</P>
        <P>I would love if there was a consensus among the autism community that one method of educating autistic children was superior to all others, one which would give these children the best chance in life.  There is no such consensus.  I wish there was an agreement that one intervention could meet all needs of these children.  There is no such agreement, not merely regarding their behaviour, but also in developing their speech and communication skills and in helping them to become independent.</P>

	<P>One size does not fit all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Researchers throughout the world have differed on this.  If there was a clear consensus across the education and research communities of the world this would not be a difficulty.  There is no consensus.  In recent weeks people have heard top psychologists debating the merits of the different systems.  What is clear is that there is merit in all of the different approaches and methods in use for children with autism.  That is why because there are so many interventions and so many needs in every child with autism, it is important to ensure that we offer a flexible approach so that those needs can be met.  This has been borne out by the Irish task force on autism which conducted a review of international research on the whole spectrum of autism spectrum disorder.  That report identified that even ABA, an intensive intervention for young children with autism, &ldquo;will continue to be the subject of peer review controversy&rdquo;.   The general finding of the task force was that &ldquo;no definitive approach that supports one approach as being better than others for all children with autistic spectrum disorders or supports a single approach for all aspects of development, nor is there any evidence by which children could be matched by particular approaches&rdquo;.  Individual members of the task force have held different views but that was the group finding of the task force.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It recommended a range of methodologies for all children in all school settings.  That is precisely the advice that we are following. This is also what autism groups in the UK are saying, what is said in Canada, in the United States, and even in Northern Ireland the group said that what is required in education is a child-centred approach rather than a method-centred approach.  That is borne out with every child.  One can always have <Col N="1107"/>flexibility of methods in dealing with a child but one cannot fit a child to a particular method.  I <?oasys _dc28- ?>have seen the methods PECS, TEACCH and ABA in use and I find each of them to be valuable.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?><P Just="Left">I assure Senators that my Department will ensure that children who would benefit from ABA will have access to it.  That is important and is very much a central part of our policy, though that message is not getting across.  Our commitment to this in the Department and in Government is shown in that we have ensured that a range of ABA training programmes, varying from on-line to ten week courses as well as post-graduate qualifications, have been undertaken by teachers who are working in our special classes.  Within the Department training opportunities have been expanded by having a specialist behaviour team, headed up by a person with a Ph.D. in ABA.  Consultancy grants for ABA have also been provided to schools.  It is wrong to say that I, or, indeed, Department officials, are against ABA.  That is not the case.  What we are conscious of is the fact that international best practice and research warns against relying on one method.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have to be flexible and provide a range of methods.  Given that our education system is child-centred and given also that teachers who are familiar with different interventions are the best trained people to tailor the approaches to the child rather than the other way round, this is the approach we are taking with children with autism all over the country.  We believe that where a child needs a specific approach, be it TEACCH, PECS or ABA, that one will be available to that child.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that the impression is given that we are completely against ABA.  The situation is that we have a specific team in the Department headed up by a person with a Ph.D. in ABA, training is available for teachers in ABA and we give consultancy grants for schools to provide ABA.  This should allow people to see that we recognise that every child with autism is different and that every approach is different.  Children change and their needs change and that is why they need to have access to different approaches in our education settings.</P>
        <P>I recognise that the pilot programmes for ABA established over the past ten years, were set up when there was nothing else on offer.  The parents involved came together to make sure that an education would be provided for their children.  Now there is a network available of special classes throughout the country.  As we continue to expand our service throughout the country we would like to draw on the expertise that I acknowledge has been developed in ABA centres. In the programme for Government we have guaranteed to give long-term funding to <Col N="1108"/>these centres provided that we can have agreement on reaching certain standards such as qualifications of teachers and a balanced education programme for the children.  We will be working with them and are having positive talks with them.  The Senators will have heard on the radio, not just from myself, but from groups such as Irish Autism Action, that we are working well together to ensure that we are best meeting the needs of children throughout the country.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">We are all come from the perspective of wanting to do what is best for all children with special educational needs, including children with autism.  The first of those pilot ABA projects set up in the country, based in Cork, has already applied to become a special school and to work with us in agreeing standards.  I hope that others will do that as well and will recognise that children change and have different needs.  It is important in such a fast-changing area to keep on top of research throughout the world.  We certainly will do that to see what is happening and how our education system can evolve in the years ahead.  We will continue to ensure we put in place a nationwide network and incorporate best practice into our system.  I look forward to hearing Senators&rsquo; views but I am committed to introducing the Student Support Bill in the D&aacute;il at 1 p.m.</P>
        <P>This is a complex, emotive area which is very personal for families and children.  I appreciate that more than anyone but I also appreciate that each child deserves the best option for education and the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  That is as true of a child with special educational needs as of any other child.  That is why I have focused on this.  It was identified in this House yesterday as a priority and I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for that.</P>
        <P>The energy, effort, commitment not to mention resources and teachers that go into this specific area is recognition that we are coming from very far behind and that this is an area of need on which we are working to try to meet all the needs of these people.  It is difficult to do all this very quickly, but the Government&rsquo;s commitment has been demonstrated over the past ten years and will continue over the next few years.  We will continue to meet the needs of all these children in a way which is child centred, friendly towards their needs, allows the flexibility of responding to their changing needs and ensures every child has access to fully qualified people who are able to work with and support him or her.</P>
        <P>There is no better philosophy or policy on offer from any government or department of education.  There is no better commitment to providing what is necessary for these children.  There is also a commitment to ensuring we try to meet the needs of all children and to working very hard with all concerned, be they parents concerned about autism or Down&rsquo;s syndrome or parents of children with mild, moderate or severe general learning difficulties.  The needs must be met right <Col N="1109"/>across the spectrum.  I recognise we need to do more but we have shown our commitment.  I look forward to hearing Senators&rsquo; views on the wide range of needs of children with special educational needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to what the Minister has had to say.  There is no doubt there has been more of everything in recent years.  However, any educational provision is not good enough.  It is the quality of that education that counts and the outcomes the child gains as a result of the intervention that matters.  This is especially the case with children with learning difficulties or special educational needs.  Children with special educational needs typically do not learn at the pace of their peers and can get lost in large classes.  This does not mean they cannot learn.  To be given a fair chance or a level playing field they need timely intervention and various forms of quality support.  The quality support must be from appropriately trained competent teachers and special needs assistants.  It is not just a question of numbers.  For example, I have been a teacher but it does not mean I am a specialist in these disabilities and difficulties.  I make this critical point at the outset.  Special education needs exist on a continuum from mild to severe.  It should be easy for class teachers to spot the difficulties of all children, but that is not the case.</P>
        <P>Children at primary and second level should not necessarily need a psychological assessment to access resources for learning needs.  I agree it is a different matter for resource level and specific learning difficulties.  In the past, learning support was only available for children below the tenth percentile.  This has now stretched to the 12th percentile using the general allocation model.  As an educator and observer of practice, I have seen that children below the 25th percentile are in difficulty in many of our classes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For inclusion to be effective &mdash; the stated policy of the Department of Education and Science is for inclusion of children with special needs &mdash; the school needs to be equipped to respond at a whole-school level to all children&rsquo;s needs.  This means better training and competency.  Can the Minister say if the general allocation model of learning support for a school is now more effective at picking up and treating a wider range of children, given that children with dyslexia or special learning difficulty are now <?oasys _dc28- ?>lumped into this category?  I am amazed that those children are being lumped in with the general allocation model.  Previously, they received resource hours along with other low-incidence children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Down&rsquo;s syndrome or autism.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0- ?><P>Will the Minister look at that area and the outcomes for children with dyslexia?  In schools in my area in Galway, the learning support teacher now feels overloaded with needs under the general allocation model of provision and does <Col N="1110"/>not have the time available to give to new children as needs arise.  The special education needs organiser, SENO, is now called the &ldquo;Say No&rdquo; where I come from because he or she says &ldquo;No&rdquo; to too many children seeking learning support hours.  They do not have the time.  This is not good enough.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to this?  I am aware we need to be very specific and not lump everything together in how we discuss children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, presents a major difficulty.  Where there is a learning blockage or problem that cannot be figured out, the child needs to have a psychological assessment to receive appropriate help and so the school can formulate the right individual education plan, IEP, for that child.  The problem is only 1,303 primary schools out of 3,200 and 456 out of 720 second level schools have a NEP service.  Even when the service is in place, it is inadequate.  My local school has 200 children.  They get two to three assessments each year when they need ten.</P>
        <P>What is the alternative for the parent of a child that has a difficulty?  The alternative is what happened with my seven year old child.  I had to pay &euro;400 for a psychological assessment.  My other option was to wait two to three years for a free assessment for my child.  What if I could not have afforded that?  The NEPS formulated in this way is no service because a child will lose too much critical learning time unless the parent can afford to pay.  This is not good enough.  The child falls behind in learning but more importantly, how does he or she feel?  No one is estimating that.  The nature and extent of the child&rsquo;s problems will deepen, making later remediation more costly to the State.  This is why these students will have a right in the future under the education legislation to sue the State if they establish that their needs were not met.</P>
        <P>At present the needs of many children at primary and secondary level are not being picked up, assessed and treated properly.  I know this because I am in the schools.  I have been brought into second level schools to look specifically at learning gain.  We have a famine in this country at second level because, whatever the Minister likes to think, the system is not child centred.  It is subject centred because it is an exam-based system.</P>
        <P>In my child&rsquo;s case we diagnosed, with the help of a psychological assessment, a verbal comprehension difficulty which is being successfully remediated because we were lucky to get speech and language therapy.  My child had no learning difficulty but the verbal comprehension blockage was preventing learning.  We then fought for six sessions of speech and language therapy and because the level of expertise was so good and so targeted, she has made major gains in confidence and competence.  That is the type of intervention that must take place.  Six sessions is not enough.  Much more will be needed in the future.</P><Col N="1111"/>
        <P>Upskilling in special educational needs is needed for mainstream class teachers.  A qualified teacher does not necessarily have specialised training in the area.  The child spends the majority of his or her time in the mainstream classroom so the teacher needs to understand the various difficulties and disabilities as well as how to differentiate instruction within the mainstream.  I know teachers are doing a wonderful job but they need more help to become more specialised.  The pull-out model of learning support, where a child is taken out of the classroom, is not always the right model.  Many children begin to feel bad about themselves, especially as they grow older.  I know there is a place for this model but we must have concern for the child&rsquo;s self-image.</P>
        <P>We must look at new developments.  In this regard, I welcome the new on-line course in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra on special educational needs which is geared towards classroom teachers.  It should be resourced and widened and all teachers should do it.</P>
        <P>Another issue needing attention is training for the 10,000 special needs assistants, SNAs.  The Minister is correct in saying she has appointed many more, but training is an issue.  I welcome their appointment because they play a major role and are a great help.  I have seen them when supervising teaching practice in classrooms.  However, the majority of them are untrained to address the disabilities presented by the students they are intended to support.  Therefore, policy aspirations such as inclusion can only be met partially by the Department.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to look at ways to better support special needs assistants in providing services to schools.  For comparison purposes she should look at the skills level of applied behaviour analysis tutors, which level is the result of training.  They are similar to SNAs in terms of background.  She should also look at the training level of child care assistants in Early Start.  This is the type of investment that must be made if inclusion is to work effectively.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a famine at second level for children with learning difficulties and special educational needs.  Major difficulties arise in this area.  Children with special educational needs services at primary level should be allowed carry these resources on to second level, but that is not the case.  They must start all over again.  They lose time, need an assessment and can be embarrassed in front of their new peers.  It is a major transition from primary to second level and I ask the Minister to examine that area.</P>
        <P>I have completed a survey on second level education with 500 public representatives and have its preliminary findings.  I targeted second level because I believe it is the area most in need in terms of special needs.  The results show that what is needed most at second level is greater teacher attention, including help with special educational needs.  Frequently, the help needed at second <Col N="1112"/>level is subject-based.  What is a child&rsquo;s entitlement when a school does not address a child&rsquo;s specific needs in subject areas?  Many are told to go and get private help, which is appalling because the child does not need an overall assessment.  Will the Minister ensure I get a written response on that from the Department?</P>
        <P>On the subject of autism and the issue of ABA or the eclectic approach, I ask the Minister to listen what I say.  Listening is critical if we are to improve outcomes for our children who are all entitled to a fair and appropriate education under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I observed two schools, Claddagh national school in Galway city which has an autistic unit in a mainstream school, and &Aacute;balta national school in Knocknacarra, which is an ABA method school.  In the latter there was a 1:1 pupil-tutor ratio, a focused, targeted programme of intervention, speech and occupational therapy every day and trained ABA tutors under a lead teacher or psychologist on autism spectrum disorders.  This can be compared with what I saw in the very caring environment of the Claddagh national school.  There were 16 children in the autism unit in a cramped space.  They had very hard-working diligent teachers but they were overworked and found it difficult to cope with the 6:1 ratio.  They had no speech and language therapy and no occupational therapy.  How can the two compare?</P>
        <P>Children with autism have communication and behavioural difficulties and for them not to have speech and language therapy or occupational therapy is criminal.  I plead with the Minister to examine the situation in Claddagh national school.  The school has a privately financed occupational therapist, at &euro;642 per day, to help its autistic children with gross and fine motor co-ordination difficulties.  Will their entitlements improve with the implementation of the Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act?  Does this situation describe the Minister&rsquo;s preferred model of appropriate eclectic education for children?  If so, it is a raw deal for children with autism.</P>
        <P>Unless children get the same hours, services and quality interventions under the eclectic model, the two models do not compare.  This may be where the drawback is.  With autism, early diagnosis is critical, followed by sustained intervention.  If the Minister is not arrogant and is committed to autism education, she must conduct research that tracks autistic children&rsquo;s progress to see what interventions they have had and what has worked.  It would be wrong of her to make final decisions on the provision for autistic children unless we have a more informed Irish-based view.  It would only take some weeks or months for the Department to track children who have gone through the system.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for her time and hope she has been listening.  She must give all children a fair chance.  I know that is what she intends, but <Col N="1113"/>she must look at the specific requirements to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is easy to come to the House and criticise issues in the area of education.  One does not need a PhD to find problems because we do not live in a perfect world.  As Government spokesperson in the Seanad on education I have much to say, but there is too little time to cover as wide a debate as that on special educational needs.</P>
        <P>As in other areas of Government, there have been significant moves forward in the past decade.  One of the first issues I raised on the Adjournment debate in the D&aacute;il, which is almost 12 years ago, related to Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Buncrana.  I was distraught, like my constituents, when we were told the one classroom support post that existed for their mild mental handicap class was to be removed when a profound handicap class was to be established.  I was even more distraught on the night of the Adjournment debate because not only did the Minister at the time, Niamh Bhreathnach, not turn up for the debate in person, the Minister of State at her Department, Deputy Bernard Allen, was sent in to deliver a speech on the wrong school.  Those were the days.  Thankfully, things have changed.</P>
        <P>I must put on record what has happened since in that school, from 1997 to 2007 because it is worth comparing.  Enrolment was 552 in 1997 and staffing included one principal, 18 mainstream class teachers, one remedial teacher, one teacher for mildly mentally handicapped students and one resource teacher.  The school had 651 pupils in 2007, an extra 100 pupils, and staffing includes one principal, 25 mainstream class teachers, three learning support teachers, two resource teachers, eight teachers in eight special classes, three temporary language support teachers, one post for administrative deputy principal and 32 special needs assistants.  The school has four special classes for children with autism, two moderate classes, one class for severe-profound and one class for specific learning difficulty.  The school acquired its deputy administrative principal so that the principal could act in the role required to support the services available in the school.  It has services for low-instance special needs and more in-depth needs and embraces issues above and beyond particular issues, be they autism or Down&rsquo;s syndrome.</P>
        <P>It is good to put on record the then and now.  There has been a major move forward.  I commend the Minister.  Far from being arrogant, she is active, interested and on the ground.  She has visited these schools and seen the situation for herself.  She has seen the action that has taken place.  I am delighted that this week we saw 20 special needs students graduate from Trinity College Dublin with a third level qualification.  Perhaps in 1997 people might have scoffed at the idea that these people would even aspire to a <Col N="1114"/>third level qualification.  I raise my hat to all involved in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to underline the tremendous work of some groups in my area who are trying to improve facilities in the special needs sector, especially inside and outside school.  These include iCare, Cashel na Cor, and North East Inishowen Special Needs Association.  Their work is to be seen locally in the bricks and mortar and in the advanced planning stages of other activities.  The group iCare is autism specific and is made up of parents of autistic children.  It is supported by many in the community and there has been significant fund-raising to add to funding received for extra-curricular activities.  That has been embraced by the entire community.  Everybody now knows about the iCare group.  There is no child hidden in the closet, as would have been the case a number of years ago.  The children are very much a part of the community and the community is very much a part of them.  Part of that stems from the fund-raising activities they carry out in the community.  While I am not endorsing the fact that they must fund raise, it has a beneficial spin-off through the community involvement in the special needs area.</P>
        <P>They have bought a bus to enable the children to get beyond the home-school environment.  They have developed a facility for after-school activities, which was opened by Mr. Keith Duffy recently.  As a result of Government funding provided last year, we are in a position to have a music therapist <i>in situ</i> for children with special needs across the peninsula.</P>
        <P>In respect of the recent debate on ABA, I offer my opinion, not my expertise.  As time is progressing, new information is coming to light practically every day.  I have spent some time studying the emerging scientific evidence relating to music therapy.  Having reported on the topic two years ago, I have continued to read into it and have learned of the value of music therapy for the development of speech and the reduction of repetitive behaviour in autistic children.  These are two aspects which are becoming more widely accepted in terms of the evidence emerging scientifically that music therapy intervention is as valid as any other intervention for those with special needs.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue to display the fact that there is more than one approach that can be of assistance to a range of special needs students.  The scene is constantly evolving.  That is not to say I reject anything I have heard to date regarding the effectiveness of ABA, an approach that is very much favoured by people in my area, as is PECS and TEACCH.  However, not all children gain from any one approach and therefore I counsel against closing the door to other options.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the results of the report on CABAS in Cork, which was a pilot scheme set up a number of years ago.  This work has been evaluated and lessons have been learned.  I understand that those involved have made an appli<Col N="1115"/>cation to become a special school, which is an interesting issue in itself.  I hope the Minister will meet those who evaluated the work on music therapy carried out in Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in as those who have been touched by the approach are extolling its virtues.  This is not just relevant to autism, but cuts across the whole spectrum of special needs.</P>
        <P>I know that speaking of an unrecognised or misunderstood therapy at a time when conventional therapies are seen to be less than satisfactory will wind up some people.  However, I ask people to be informed before they are angered and to read into the subject and not dismiss it idly.  I also accept that we need far more access to all therapies, but I stand over the central value of the arts therapies in this area.</P>
        <P>Unlike<b> </b>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, I feel that the starting point that is not really accepted in the area of special education is that of assessment.  How do we know what works best and what is a quality intervention for a child if we have not evaluated him or her?  It seems wrong that in schools that are currently serviced by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, it will not carry out assessments on, observations of, or visits to children who are enrolled in special classes.  This is the current experience.  Should such children not be priority students by definition of their placement in a special class in either a mainstream or special school?  I am led to believe there is a recruitment issue involved here but in the meantime, these children have no psychological interventions.  In practice, this leaves teachers very much on their own at a time when the spirit of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act advocates a multi-disciplinary approach.  There are very few schools that are not trying to embrace the idea of integration.  There is an enormous level of willingness to work with the Minister to support special needs children in each classroom.  The difficulty arises when a teacher does not have the required expertise in a particular area, especially if he or she is just a general classroom teacher who came out of the training system before the current retraining and support systems were put in place.</P>

	<P>Senator Keaveney did not interrupt Senator Healy Eames.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I call into question the role of the Department of Health and Children on the issue.  I know of a case where a NEPS psychologist recommended support for a student and a psychiatrist from the Department of Health and Children did likewise.  However, that student did not receive the support that was needed, when it was needed.  I was please to hear the Minister say the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science are discussing <Col N="1116"/>this issue and trying to deal with it in a joined-up way.  The lack of joined-up planning and thinking, which does not only relate to education, means that teachers, schools, students and families must pay the price, as appropriate therapies and approaches are denied.  In that context, education delayed is education denied.  This problem should not be laid entirely at the feet of the Minister and perhaps she has found a lever for progress by ensuring both Departments now work together on the issue.  </P>
        <P>If a school fund raises and pays for a psychological assessment for a child, at least then it has a label to work with and some idea as to what type of education the child would benefit from.  However, this leads back to the issue of access to services.  We must evaluate whether we are training enough specialists to cater for the needs that exist, as well as whether there will be funding levels sufficient to meet demand.  These are issues for the Departments of Health and Children and Finance and we cannot let them abdicate any responsibility in this regard.</P>
        <P>I know, from a geographical point of view, that there can be difficulties in attracting professional staff, as is the case in my own area.  That has repercussions within the health service itself, as well as in broader areas such as in the provision of speech, occupational and other therapies.  With regard to the arts therapies, we do not even have the professional qualification recognition that would enable people to be paid at an appropriate level.  Such issues must be tackled.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to evaluate the work of the new National Council for Special Education and that of the special needs assistants.  The council has been operational for only a short time but valuable lessons can already be learned.  We must ensure that where things are not working well between schools and specialists, there is an appeals mechanism that is completely independent.  The Minister alluded to such an appeals mechanism in her speech.</P>
        <P>I have seen an enormous level of improvement in services from the time of my initial introduction to politics.  However, the difficulty for parents is that their child is a child of his or her time.  Time does not stand still and the child&rsquo;s chance is now.  The earlier a diagnosis is made, the better the chance that interventions will have maximum effect.  Our goal must be to assess early, have specialists trained and recognised in order to embrace as many new scientific approaches as are available at any point in time.  This is likely to result in a number of good interventions.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government on the success achieved to date but add my voice to the quest for those who are special in our communities to be cherished by our communities.  I also ask that those who face the challenges of coping with the specialness of their new baby are given support, and not hurdles, as they struggle through those very important early years.  All children deserve support, particularly those under six, who have <Col N="1117"/>not been focused on strongly in Ireland to date.  That is true across the board, not just in the area of special needs.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>Early investment will save euros in the future, if one is to look at the issue impersonally and coldly.  However, I have found the children of whom we speak today are far from impersonal and cold.  I look forward to the positive changes that will be embraced in the next decade and wish the Minister well in her difficult role.  I reiterate the fact that there have been significant improvements, with which I am very impressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Ross, with the agreement of the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister and agree with many of the points made by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole regarding the effort she has put into this area.  However, I believe she is misguided.  Autism is now recognised and identified as a condition but it is very complex.  One does not speak of autism on its own, but rather an autistic spectrum.  That means that each child needs an individual assessment, which is not provided at present.</P>
        <P>The Minister is wrong when she refers to fully qualified teachers.  While they may be fully qualified as primary school teachers, they do not have the professional, focused expertise that is absolutely necessary in dealing with this situation.  The &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family visited this House recently.  Theirs is a celebrated case, with which I will not deal in great detail now.  However, I have read some of the transcripts of the court case and it appears the evidence was unmercifully dragged out.  That raised the costs enormously.  I know they are not being pursued for those costs but they still have been left with an enormous bill.  It seems that the case was an attempt to give a bloody nose to the front-runner to intimidate others and discourage them from taking a similar action.</P>
        <P>The young man at the centre of this case was assessed by numerous psychologists but has been denied the treatment that is regarded as appropriate by his parents and by the psychologists, on the say so of civil servants.  This is what is behind the statement by Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke in the D&aacute;il recently.  She obviously did not make that statement for partisan motives.</P>
        <P>Many Senators spoke on the Disability Bill in this House.  We fought a battle to try to ensure that the Act would be rights based.  However, despite everything we did, as the Bill was passed, the caveat of &ldquo;resources allowing&rdquo; was added.  That means there is no right to an individual assessment of needs for children with autism, which is absolutely vital for them.</P>
        <P>I refer to an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 February.  I will not list all of its authors, but it was written by the leading scien<Col N="1118"/>tists in the field, working in universities in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  They begin by stating that they were dismayed, yet no longer surprised, by the justification given by the Minister for depriving so many children with a diagnosis of autism of the only scientifically validated treatment approach to autism, ABA.  This contradicts the Minister&rsquo;s comments, which are also contradicted in a letter I received from a senior research scientist.  He stated that, as a former research scientist, he can testify that ABA is the only remediation approach for which there is a strong peer reviewed scientific basis for its effectiveness in helping the children in question.</P>
        <P>The Minister refers to it as teaching behaviour, but it is not a question of teaching behaviour.  Children with autism manifest behavioural problems, such as hand-clapping, head-rocking, self-harming and so on, which means that it is impossible for them to have real access to education before the behavioural problems are addressed.  As such, ABA plays a clear role.  Having qualified primary teachers does not address the situation.  To dismiss the matter as only teaching behaviour is, with the greatest respect to the Minister, incorrect.</P>
        <P>The idea that there is a range of methods and that the eclectic approach is appropriate is disturbing.  We all know that autistic children do not respond positively to changes in routine.  If an eclectic approach is taken, they may find it disturbing and their learning may not be assisted.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The unbiased literature reviews and related research of the task-force undoubtedly found that following the method of applied behaviour analysis was by far superior to other approaches.  ABA was also consistently advocated by other bodies which had researched this same issue (eg New York, California, Canada).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The next article is also from <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The first paragraph praises the Minister and no one suggests that she has malign intentions, but it is suggested that the children have been failed in a number of ways.  At pre-school level, part-time home tuition with a primary teacher is primarily offered.  Few of these teachers are available or have the relevant teaching qualifications, leaving it to overwhelmed parents to source it.  There is the question of age.  Everyone states that it should not be based on age specifically, but on intervention from the point of diagnosis, which must be early.  What of the millions spent in fighting court cases?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the House after several appeals from me and many others for a debate on this issue.  I do not agree with many of her comments, but I appreciate that she is prepared to explain her position to both Houses.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator Norris on costs.  I do not care about costs as it is not a cost issue.  However, there were some unnecessary costs in the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in case.  I would appeal to the Minister to not take precipitative action that would bankrupt people taking a court case on behalf of their children.  The high-profile case has stimulated debate in the Houses and has challenged many of us to face up to a serious and nasty problem that we have not successfully confronted.  To discuss costs is irrelevant and wrong.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but she has continuously maintained that cost is not the main issue.  Rather, the issue is more complicated.  Costs should not be an issue because, while we as public representatives may not understand the details of the different treatments, a wave of parents have approached us with their cases since the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in case.  They are dissatisfied because their children are not getting the treatment they believe is deserved.</P>
        <P>Whatever the Minister states about the different virtues of the cases, there are some unhappy parents who claim they are being blocked by the State from getting the treatment they believe their children should get.  In response, civil servants and politicians claim they know better.  No one knows better in a situation such as this than the parents.  The Minister was right to point out that there is no consensus and that there are different opinions from experts, task forces, etc.  Politicians should not be dictating to parents about this issue.  If anyone can make the decision, it is the parent, who does not consider the cost.</P>
        <P>I was struck by Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s comments because she spoke with the authority of a parent, which is important.  She is one of a range of people who speak with that authority and who <Col N="1120"/>lobby us as politicians because they are unhappy with what is occurring.  That is a far greater authority than that of clinical experts, who disagree anyway, or a Minister with good intentions but who views the matter differently.  We should discuss this issue with the people and parents involved and let them have the treatment that is deserved.  I do not know how much time I have left.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a letter I received from a parent to put on the record the personal and human feelings involved.  The person is a parent of a five year old boy who suffers from autism and is aware of the lack of services provided in Ireland and how one&rsquo;s place of birth can decide how one can cope with the condition.  The debate on ABA is, according to this person, a no-brainer.  The person claims that, as is clear from the presentation attached to the letter, ABA makes a difference and more hours, rather than a cut-off of 12 hours as proposed by Dr. Fitzgerald, benefit children&rsquo;s social skills.  The Government&rsquo;s mix and match approach rather than pure ABA is of no benefit, a finding that is not only supported by a Norwegian study, an enlightened jurisdiction in this debate, but also by research done in UCLA.  However, according to this person, the Department of Education and Science and Dr. Fitzgerald, who seems to be the only academic the Department can wheel out to support its approach, cannot show on what evidence their statistics are based.  This is rhetoric, but it is a fair point of view.  Some nine out of ten children benefit from ABA when it is delivered 26-30 hours per week.  The person asks why the one in ten who will not benefit should dictate what the majority needs.</P>
        <P>There are ten pilot schools in Leinster, one in Connacht and one in Munster.  Prior to the Minister taking office, her predecessor wanted a centre in each county, but the Minister stopped this.  People in the Department may have issues with psychologists rather than teachers delivering education to children in ABA centres.  The so-called special training for teaching children with autism is an on-line course and some of the teachers the Minister uses as examples of the service she proposes need only an interest in teaching children with autism to be allowed to teach them.  This is, according to the person&rsquo;s letter, a Third World approach.</P>
        <P>We are returning to the issue touched on by Senator Norris and to which Senator Healy <Col N="1121"/>Eames gave more time, namely, equality.  There are different discussions going on because the Minister is talking about one thing while parents of children with autism are discussing quality and better training.  This is what is necessary.</P>

        <P>We all recognises the sacrifices parents of autistic children must make as it is a very complex condition that none of us fully understand.  I come from a teaching background and was in a school with many disadvantaged and disabled students.  Ten years ago there was no framework for special educational needs and when we wanted to consult parents and set up a structure we found there was a lack of assistants and resource teachers.  We have come a long way but we are not yet finished.</P>

	<P>We have come a long way as the Minister has fought for &euro;900 million for this area.  The Minister indicated that between special needs assistants, resource teachers and so on there is a combined staff of 19,000.  In 1998 only 3,000 people worked in this area.</P>
        <P>Early intervention and diagnosis is the key and this is where the Department of Health and Children comes in.  A mother will spot a child who is not developing normally by one and a half years of age and this is when diagnosis must be made.  Once that happens the case should go straight to the Department of Health and Children and this is where a gap occurs.</P>
        <P>The Minister has acknowledged that after early intervention home tuition is necessary; ten hours up to two and half to three years of age, increasing to 20 hours thereafter.  A 1:1 pupil-teacher ratio is necessary with teachers who understand the approach that must be used because each child will require a different approach.  Speaking as a teacher, I know one might use three different approaches within half an hour, depending on the child in question.</P>

        <P>The jury is out on this topic and there are no absolutes.  I visited schools and spoke to educational and clinical psychologists and each person I met gave me different answers.  There is no area of this subject on which one can give a definite statement.  I do not know enough about the matter and the Minister has accepted that she is using a trial and error approach but I congratulate her on setting up the framework as, under her watch, matters are progressing.  Previous Governments, with representatives from all sides of the House, failed in this area but now we are attempting to get it right.  Give the Minister a chance.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 because in it the Minister set up a structure involving an edu<Col N="1123"/>cation plan, consultation with parents and educational psychologists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>This structure is a step forward.  In my teaching role I tried to implement such a system; sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not.  At least there is now an appeals system.  I ask the Minister to push this matter as much as possible and I know it will be completed by 2010.  Pressure must be exerted in this area because we need the appeals system and parent consultation.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the system is being decentralised to allow local areas and communities become involved.  People have choices that include tuition at home, mainstream education and mainstream education with special classes.  This is a big step forward and I would love to still work in education and deal with this area because it could work very well.</P>
        <P>Training is now done in teacher training colleges but not every teacher will be good at this type of education just as not every teacher can teach maths.  I am a guidance counsellor and perhaps many of us, including myself, would not be good in such a role.  We must be careful in selecting teachers who have the concentration to deal with this subject.</P>
        <P>Applied behavioural analysis, ABA, is a very good approach and I have spoken to people that use it.  The Minister has not said she is against ABA but there are many types of intervention and it is important that we keep them in mind when dealing with given situations.  The jury is out and more research is needed; I could return to this subject in three years and reject everything I said today due to new ideas that have circulated.</P>

I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this issue, and that the Minister for Education and Science will hear my comments on the matter concerned, which is the need for the Government to promote the wearing of the Easter lily as a symbol of commemoration to all those who gave their lives in the pursuit of Irish freedom.  The Government has reinstated the national commemoration to remember all those who gave their lives in the GPO and other venues throughout Dublin and the country in the pursuit of Irish freedom.  I hope this is extended by promoting the Easter lily.</P>
        <P>I will outline to the House the symbolism of the Easter lily and its history so Members can be informed.  The Easter lily was designed in 1925 by Cumann na mBan.  Its purpose was to raise money for the republican prisoners&rsquo; dependents fund and to honour the sacrifices made by men and women in the 1916 rising.  One year later, the Easter lily commemoration committee was formed and existed until 1965.  One of its founder members was Sheila Humphries.  The original lily was hand-made by republicans who sold it at great risk throughout the country.  Over the years, many republicans have been arrested, attacked, jailed and reviled for keeping alive the memory of the men and women of the Easter rising.</P>
        <P>The lily is an emblem of unity between the various traditions within the nation and a symbol of life breathed into the nation by the heroism of the volunteers of 1916.  The symbol is associated with the rising in Dublin due to the seasonal decoration in churches during this period.  The use of the lily at funerals symbolises the restored innocence of the soul at death.  Today, republicans continue to honour the heroic sacrifice made in 1916 when the IRA, hopelessly outnumbered and ill-equipped, faced the might of the British Army and showed the world, in the words of Patrick Pearse, that Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  With regard to applied behaviour analysis, Richard Saffran of ABA Resources defines &ldquo;applied&rdquo; to mean practice rather than research or philosophy and &ldquo;behaviour analysis&rdquo; as &ldquo;learning theory&rdquo;, that is, understanding what leads to or does not lead to new skills.  ABA is just as much about maintaining and using skills as about learning.  It may seem odd to use the word &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo; when speaking about learning to walk, talk, play, and live as a complex social animal.  However, to a behaviourist all of these can be taught so long as intact brain functions exist to learn and practice the skills.  This is the essence of the recovery hypothesis, which is that for many children the excesses and deficits of autism result largely from a learning blockage, which can be overcome by intensive teaching.</P>
        <P>Typically developing children learn without our intervention.  The environment they are born into provides the right conditions to learn language, play, and social skills.  After a few years, however, this breaks down, and we no longer learn everything naturally.  For example, it takes a very structured environment for most of us to learn to read, write, and do arithmetic.  Children with autism learn far less from the environment.  Often, they are capable of learning but it takes an extremely structured environment where conditions are optimized for acquiring the same skills that typical children learn naturally.  ABA is all about the rules for establishing the environment to enable children to learn.</P>
        <P>Behaviour analysis dates back at least to Skinner, who performed animal experiments demonstrating the Pavlovian theory whereby Pavlov&rsquo;s dog responded in a certain way.  Conversely, any new behaviour an animal, you or I may try but <Col N="1126"/>which is never rewarded is likely to die out after a while.  As common sense would have it, a behaviour that results in something unpleasant is even less likely to be repeated.  These are the basics of behavioural learning theory.</P>
        <P>ABA uses these principles to establish an environment in which our children learn as much as they can as quickly as possible.  It is a science, not a philosophy.  Even the &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo; part is based on science, as evidence exists &mdash; I admit it is not conclusive &mdash; that the developmentally disordered brain learns how to learn best if the basic skills are taught in early childhood.</P>
        <P>Behavioural learning is not the only type of learning.  Most learning in schools is from an explanation or from a model, what people call natural learning.  Typically, developing children learn from their environment, which includes other people, at an astounding rate completely unassisted.  The point of ABA is to teach the prerequisites to make it possible for a child to learn naturally.  If our children could learn without assistance in the first place they would not have autism.</P>
        <P>The most common and distinguishing type of intervention based on applied behaviour analysis is discrete trial teaching.  It is what people most often think of when one says &ldquo;ABA&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Lovaas method&rdquo;.  The Lovaas model of applied behaviour analysis is a specific behavioural treatment method employed by the Lovaas Institute and other replication sites throughout the world.  This model utilizes procedures from applied behaviour analysis, as do all behavioural treatment programs.  These programs go by different names including ABA therapy, intensive early intervention behaviour therapy services and verbal behaviour.  The specific emphasis given to various procedures in applied behaviour analysis and the way in which skills are combined to create a comprehensive intervention may vary from one behavioural treatment program to another.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In her remarks at the outset of the debate, the Minister reminded us about the progress made in the past ten years on this issue and she is correct in this.  This point is often made by Ministers in these debates and when it is the wonder for me is not the improvement made in these ten years but the slow pace of improvement.  This is in light of the incredible prosperity we had during this period through the hard work of the people of Ireland and the increase of resources available to the Government for spending on vital educational and social needs.  We also have now a heightened understanding of autism which we did not have in the past.  The Minister mentioned this in her remarks.  It is an important scientific advance on which the Minister is able to rely.</P><Col N="1127"/>
        <P>Other speakers referred to personal examples and experiences.  I have had an involvement with this issue since childhood through a close member of my family.  My aunt, as a parent, faced this struggle alone during a period when autism was not understood and was a mystery.  In many cases no outlet existed other than psychiatric hospitals and my aunt fought a one-woman campaign to ensure her son was not confined to a psychiatric hospital.  We have come a great distance since then.</P>
        <P>I have no intention of personalising an attack on the Minister or anybody else any more than I am interested in self-congratulatory speeches from the Government.  Let us move on as this type of politics does not get us anywhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I am perplexed about this matter is that the Minister gives the impression of a major level of disagreement, argumentation, debate, and scratching of heads among the experts.  Where is the evidence of this?  Will the Minister publish this for us?  A leading member of the task force of 2001 stated the unbiased literature reviews and related research of the task force undoubtedly found that following the method of applied behaviour analysis was by far superior to other approaches.  ABA was also consistently advocated by other bodies which had researched the same issue in New York, California and Canada.  This was stated by a member of the Minister&rsquo;s task force.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I only have three or four minutes to speak and I ask the Minister to indulge me.  If the Minister believes as strongly as she appears to that ABA is one of a range of options and should not be given centre-stage, will she publish the convincing evidence she appears to have read?  When she makes her argument she does so second-hand.  She states all of this evidence exists.  Will the Minister send it to me and allow me as a Member of this House, a parent and a citizen to compare both sets of evidence?  Let me and the people of Ireland make up our minds.  Let those involved in the struggle, the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins and others, make up their minds as to whether what the Minister says is true.  Whereas I am not suggesting the Minister is misrepresenting the matters to the House, we as citizens and legislators have an entitlement to make up our own minds on the basis of what we read and not simply take it on the good faith of the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister made unfortunate statements which may be unwittingly divisive.  She claimed <Col N="1128"/>she is interested in the child-centred approach rather than a method-centred one.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is there a single person who does not favour a child-centred approach?  Is there a single person who believes this is anything other than an attempt to do what is best for children with autism?  For the Minister to make a statement like that in the cut and thrust of a debate is unnecessarily divisive.  Everyone is for a child-centred approach.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will have an opportunity to respond.  I have had to listen to Easter lilies and everything else for the past two hours.  I will take my last three speaking minutes.</P>
        <P>I received a letter from the parents of an eight-year old autistic boy in Rathfarnham, Dublin.  The father informed me that he could testify to the efficacy of the ABA methodology in reaching children such as his son.  This is the evidence from individual experience as well as expert evidence in which I am interested.</P>
        <P>The father also informed me that as a former research scientist, he could testify that ABA is the only remediation approach for which there is a peer-reviewed scientific basis for its effectiveness in helping such children.  If this man is wrong, will the Minister tell me how he is wrong?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">He continued in his letter that education in this country has been defined as the process that allows the individual to achieve their potential as a human being.  ABA methods result in a large proportion of autistic children being prepared for and being able to participate in the mainstream.  Those children who do not attain that level still benefit from undergoing this intensive teaching and learn better to attain some measure of control over their lives.  ABA allows these people to achieve their potentials since in many cases the alternative would be them being institutionalised as they approach adulthood.  He concluded it is therefore clear that even from something as coarse as a cost benefit analysis, it makes sense to make this investment in quality education of some of the weakest in our society.</P>
         <?oasys _cl11.7- ?><P>What people are after is the impressive example the Minister outlined of a perceptible change in a community&rsquo;s attitude towards a child.  That is what the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins and everyone else involved, not just the Minister, are about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>In her speech on Private Members&rsquo; business in the D&aacute;il on 12 February, the Minister acknowledged special <Col N="1129"/>needs education has undergone a transformation in the past ten years.  Credit must be given to the Minister and her predecessors for putting in place the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and providing extra resources and funding for special educational needs.</P>
        <P>Several key issues have been highlighted in the controversy that has blown up about appropriate education for children with autism and autism spectrum disorder.  There are other issues, however, that have not been addressed regarding the education of children with autism.</P>
        <P>The first issue concerns the continuum of services.  Services available to children with autism around the country are patchy, uncoordinated and deeply unsatisfactory as far as individual families and parents are concerned.  There is a necessity in the special educational needs area to have appropriate preschool, primary and post-primary education services that flow on seamlessly and are age appropriate and appropriate to the developmental needs of the child.</P>
        <P>Home tuition is available, with some struggle, for parents with children with autism.  Children under three years of age are entitled to ten hours per week of home tuition.  A child over three years is entitled to 20 hours home tuition.  The parents must organise this for themselves.  It may not always be desirable to have education occur within the family home.  A choice to parents for alternative preschool education is not available.</P>
        <P>Barnacoyle ABA preschool in County Wicklow is not funded or recognised by the Government.  It exists because of the diligent fund-raising efforts of its parents and committee.  It is a precarious basis on which to run a school.  The parents do not know from month to month or year to year whether the school can continue.</P>
        <P>When children from the school are considered to be ready to move on, there are no special primary education services for them in the county.  Their parents, if lucky, can send their children to the nearest appropriate school which is in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  They also may try to get a place in St. Catherine&rsquo;s special school in County Wicklow which, because it is a segregated environment, may not be an appropriate educational environment for children who have benefitted from preschool ABA input.  Often they may be ready for a special unit in a mainstream primary school but that is not available in the county.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, when it comes to post-primary education the continuum is far from satisfactory.  There are serious gaps in the services with much depending on geographical location.  Parents fortunate to live in an area with a specially designated ABA school can be reassured their child will receive an appropriate and specially tailored <Col N="1130"/>education.  For those who do not, they must do with whatever is available.</P>
        <P>All that families with children with autism are arguing for is an acceptable continuum of services for their children.  It should be the same no matter where one lives.  We must work towards this.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure services are put in place so these gaps between different counties and regions disappear.  Children with autism must be guaranteed the same continuum of educational services that able-bodied children are entitled to and their parents expect.</P>
        <P>There is a dearth of research findings in the ABA approach in an Irish context.  I hope the Minister will use the 12 pilot schools, for which funding has been provided for in the programme for Government, as centres of excellence.  Specific research into ABA must be carried out in these centres so that we can begin to accumulate a body of evidence-based research in an Irish context of the efficacy or otherwise of the ABA approach.</P>
        <P>I have examined international research into the ABA approach and I find it convincing.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P FLI="0">It is peer reviewed and meets best practice in terms of research methodology.  I agree with other speakers in that I have not seen research findings that support the mixed or eclectic approach.  I am open to looking at them but I have not been provided with any of these results.  I hope the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science will consider a presentation of the findings supporting the eclectic and ABA approaches in order that the members can make their own assessment of how convincing the research findings are.</P>
        <P>The most important thing in terms of research is the outcome experienced by the child as a result of a particular methodology.  Other speakers have mentioned the unnecessary focus on methodology as opposed to the child-centred approach.  The most important aspect of any methodology is that it produces the best possible outcome for the child.  Unfortunately, while these debates and arguments about methodology continue, children are going through schools and facilities in which we cannot be absolutely sure they are achieving the best possible outcome.  That is why it is important that we emphasise research.</P>
        <P>I ask that the message be communicated strongly to the Minister that this House considers it highly important that research, specifically in an Irish context in recognised ABA schools, is carried out almost immediately and that the focus is on outcomes.  I have no doubt, because they have been so convincing, that parents of children who are going through this process feel the outcomes for their children are best when the ABA approach is used.  If we carry out evidence-based <Col N="1131"/>research in schools I am sure the instincts of the parents will be borne out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I come to the debate as someone who is involved in education and who has a family history of involvement with people with special needs.  It is important that we highlight the fact that children with special educational needs have unique and individual requirements when it comes to education.  Successive high court cases have not only vindicated the constitutional right of even the most severely and profoundly disabled to an education but have shown incontrovertibly, through the evidence presented, the benefit of education and the ability of people to respond and develop skills arising from that education.</P>
        <P>I listened to the points made by Senator White and the Minister.  Despite the availability of research from leading academics, the Department of Education and Science has been reluctant to initiate progress, instead forcing parents to the courts and only then, grudgingly, putting in place the supports required, albeit on a piecemeal basis.  When the history of educational provision is written, the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children will be indicted as having failed to meet the needs not only of children with autism but also of their families.  This is very important.</P>
        <P>Following the Sinnott judgment in 2001, a task force on autism was commissioned which produced a report that ran to several hundred pages and contained numerous scientifically based conclusions and recommendations.  These recommendations were not based on a hunch or on what the members thought might work but on the best available international research and empirical findings.  One of the key recommendations was early diagnosis and intervention.  On these two points the system has clearly failed families.  In my own county of Cork, which is representative of the rest of the country, there is a two and a half year waiting list for an assessment and diagnosis of autism.  For a child of five or six, a two and a half year wait is the equivalent of half of his or her life.  The task force argued that the projected number of NEPS-employed psychologists with expertise on autism was grossly inadequate.  Since then, the Department has failed to increase the number of NEPS psychologists to the full projected number of 220, although it promised this would be achieved eight years ago.  Today there are approximately 150 NEPS psychologists, even <Col N="1132"/>though the school population has increased significantly in the past number of years.</P>
        <P>Families in this situation have told me that once the diagnosis is made, the next challenge is to find the appropriate services to try to remediate the condition.</P>

	<P>This week we heard about the case of a school in Dublin which has a facility for a special class for autistic children but lacks the necessary therapeutic staff to allow it to open.  The Minister is wrong to say it should open anyway and provide an education to the children.  This clearly indicates that the Minister &mdash; thus the Government &mdash; is approaching the issue with a very narrow idea of what constitutes an effective and meaningful education for persons with special needs or autism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to consider the way in which the Government has responded to the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in case and others.  We all agree that the available education should be child-centred.  I ask the Minister to publish the relevant documentation, as alluded to by Senator Alex White, in order that we can have a debate in an open and transparent manner.  Education for persons with special needs must be viewed in a holistic context of academic and educational development, as pointed out by Senator Healy Eames.  Education for many children with special needs is not about acquisition of the three Rs but the development of essential life skills, such as communication, self-care, and leisure and recreation skills, that enable them to participate in society in a meaningful way.  In a recent statement in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Dr. Honan, one of the authors of the report of the task force on autism, criticised the Minister&rsquo;s stance regarding ABA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our concept of education must change.  The traditional concept of education and traditional teaching methods might not be the best fit for some of these children.  As mentioned by Senator Healy Eames, it is necessary to think outside the box when it comes to different approaches to education for children with special needs.  Let us have a debate on the ABA method and on other methods such as TEACCH, PECS and Lovaas.  The most important point of all is to focus in on the benefits to children.  We must come up with a combination of approaches, because it is not a case of one size fits all.</P>
        <P>The concepts of choice and respect for choice are important from the point of view of parents, providers and Government.  The views of parents and professionals need to be listened to by the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, but they have not been so far.  We need to listen.  Why do we send people to the courts?  What have we got to fear in the &Oacute; <Col N="1133"/>Cuanach&aacute;in case?  We must listen, as political representatives, as parents, as educationalists.  We need a collaborative approach between parents, schools and the Department.  Let us have that.  We need to move away from going to the courts and putting people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Legislative advances have done little to inspire confidence among parents in the ability of the Department of Education and Science to meet the needs of children with autism or other special educational needs and their parents.  The Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the Disability Act have not received uniform support or endorsement from the disability sector.  Too much of the potential impact of these Acts has been watered down, as the provision of services is not seen as a right or an entitlement but rather a service predicated on the availability of resources.  Under the assessment of need process for 0 to 5 year olds introduced in June 2005, there is no link between the identification of need and the meeting of that need.  This flies in the face of recognising the importance of early and appropriately matched intervention.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke earlier about listening.  I ask that this debate be listened to.  We need to make significant progress in this area.  I hope we will see progress as a result of today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, to the Chamber.  I assure him of an especially warm welcome when he comes to Listowel next week to attend a very important educational function.</P>
        <P>As the concluding speaker on the Government side of the House, much of what I would like to have said has been said more than eloquently by previous speakers.  I compliment all the Senators who have contributed because we have had a good and meaningful debate during which everyone gave a good and honest opinion.  The debate here has been in marked contrast to the debate that has taken place elsewhere, both in the other House and the media.  Our Minister and the Department have been subjected to unfair and ill-informed criticism.  If one listened closely to the Minister in the House today, one would have discovered that she did not say that she knows all the answers.  Nobody has all the answers but she is addressing this question and trying to bring it forward in a way that will be beneficial ultimately to the child with learning difficulties.  That is what we all subscribe to.</P>
        <P>The statistics over the past ten years are staggering.  The fact that &euro;900 million has been dedi<Col N="1134"/>cated to special needs teaching this year, along with 19,000 staff members, is staggering as well.  The speakers on the Opposition side have been gracious enough to acknowledge this.  I take issue with Senator Alex White, however, who feels that the level and speed of progress has been somewhat tardy.  I was a teacher for 20 years in the 1970s and 1980s at both primary and secondary level.  I witnessed at first hand the significant improvements that have taken place.</P>
        <P>A member of my family had a daughter who was highly intelligent but had special learning difficulties.  There was no service in the education system at the time for my niece.  Her parents were forced to move and live at different times in London and the US to ensure she was given the education she needed and was entitled to.  Luckily, they had the resources to do this but many people in Ireland did not and the service, as Senator Alex White noted, was very inadequate.</P>
        <P>We have moved on from that to a stage where we are getting there.  As Senator Ormonde said, we have not arrived but we are getting closer all the time.  In my home town of Listowel, which is not large, more than a dozen special education teachers provide specialist services of one sort or another.  The Department and Minister had the vision to fund a special school, the Nano Nagle special national school, which is a significant teaching resource for Kerry and Limerick.  It is a state-of-the-art facility.  The improvements are there and must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>I will not go into the ins and outs of whether applied behavioural analysis is the answer at this hour.  Like everyone else, I have tried to read about and address it.  If one wishes to see all the various viewpoints, one need only look up a few webpages on the Internet.  For every view that ABA is the way forward, there are views that say &ldquo;yes but&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes maybe&rdquo;.  I know it is the first choice of parents to have their children integrated into the mainstream as much as possible.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the teachers of Ireland, particularly primary school teachers and members of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, for the outstanding service they have provided.  A statement this morning from John Carr, the general secretary of the INTO, refuted some criticisms levelled at the INTO position on autism.  I refer all Members to this statement because it is eminently sensible.  There is no substitute for a good teacher who is not able to do everything but who will not be beaten when it comes to doing what is best for a student.  Naturally, they need special skills, back-up and all the resources for which we are looking.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason parents in the main want to see their children integrated into the mainstream with their peers as much as possible.</P>
        <P>I regret that this court case took place.  Naturally, our hearts go out to the family concerned.  However, we must be reasonable about this.  That court case was not initiated by the Minister or Department.  The parents had a choice in this.  The Department had no option but to defend the case and would have failed in its duty to taxpayers if it had done anything else.  That the judgment made it quite clear that the Minister and Department had not failed in their duty has not been made in the House today and should be reiterated.</P>
        <P>The Minister restated in the House today that where ABA is the appropriate and necessary procedure or intervention, the child will get it.  That point resonates with me.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  As someone who has spent a considerable time in recent years talking to people in the north east, I am very aware of the prevalence and level of autism in society.  As many people know, we are in the middle of a baby boom so it is clear the incidence of autism will rise.  It is very important therefore that we find ways of putting facilities in place to allow children to be educated.</P>
        <P>There are many difficulties to be faced in respect of children with autism.  One is getting assessed in the first instance.  I spoke this morning to parents in Laytown who told me they had been told in a letter from the Department a few months ago that they must find National Educational Psychological Service people to carry out assessments.  There are issues in respect of getting a diagnosis in the first instance.</P>
        <P>With a diagnosis in place, it is often very difficult to access the services that are needed.  The problem is especially acute in terms of education and applied behavioural analysis schools.  ABA has been shown to be the most effective programme for dealing with autism.  We are lucky in the north east in that we have a school in Drogheda which caters for children from east <Col N="1136"/>Meath, Laytown, south Louth and beyond.  I look forward to going to its annual fund-raising ball this Saturday night and speaking to many of the parents involved in the school.</P>
        <P>Like other ABA schools, Drogheda has been a victim of its own success.  It has a significant waiting list, with more than 60 children waiting to get into the school because it is so renowned and the services it offers are so good.  Like other ABA schools in Ireland, the school faces issues in respect of funding and finding permanent sites for the school.  Its staff face issues in respect of getting their qualifications recognised.  All these problems could be dealt with very quickly by the Minister.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is meeting party colleagues in early March to discuss autism so I ask her to consider seriously the position in respect of ABA schools at that meeting.  In respect of the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in case, flexibility has been shown in the past in respect of legal costs.  Owing to the service the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins have performed in raising awareness of autism, the Minister seriously should consider waiving the fees.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hannigan for sharing his time with me.  Throughout this row, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science have said the issue is not funding but providing the most appropriate education for children.  That is blatantly untrue because this is a row about resources and whether it is the parents, the State or a combination of both who decide a child&rsquo;s education.  Who decides on a child&rsquo;s education?  Is it the parent, the State or a combination of both?  It is clear throughout this debate that the State &mdash; the Minister and the Taoiseach &mdash; decides on the education a child will receive.</P>
        <P>In my constituency of County Wexford there are excellent schools in Coolcots, Wexford town and Enniscorthy.  I spoke to one of the parents from the Coolcots school who told me that a professor from America, who visits the school every few months, has said that the school has one of the best records of mainstreaming children with autistic behaviour into mainstream schools.  That school should be used as a model for others to follow.  That is the type of service about which we should be talking in this debating chamber and one the Government should be providing.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is hiding behind civil servants again and blaming them for what is clearly a resource issue.  There is a shortage of special needs assistants.  The Minister must face up to that and stop talk<Col N="1137"/>ing in riddles to people outside this House.  There is a lack of resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>

	<P>There was no appeals process for this child and the only option left open to the parents was to go to court because the only place they were offered was in the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, which was 50 miles from the child&rsquo;s home.  That was the background to the court case.  The parents were being boxed in by the State, so to speak, in that they were given no other option but to travel 50 miles for the placement.

	<P>In politics the human issues are always the most difficult to deal with and to govern on.  It is easy in Opposition to oppose.  It becomes more difficult in Government to come up with appropriate decisions.  </P>
        <P>Recent Irish political history involving all Governments and political persuasions in the make-up of those Governments has seen a raft of measures on issues that were inappropriately handled, from the haemophiliacs in the early 1980s and the hepatitis C cases in the mid-1990s to the residential redress scheme for abuse in institutions and the situation relating to children with autism.  When a situation is made needlessly worse by a bureaucratic approach to what is essentially a human issue it is the political process itself that is failing.</P>

	<P>It ill behoves the Opposition to point fingers and name-call on an issue such as this.  It is difficult enough to deal with the issue without having a common approach on it.  I would go even further and say that what has been a departmental-led approach in all these issues to resort to the courts system to delay what were necessary social improvements in many of these areas has not been a good approach in terms of the way we should have been managing our country.  </P>
        <P>There is a job of work to be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the cost of judicial actions taken by Departments on behalf of the State in the past 20 years in regard to all these issues and the way those resources could have been better used to speed up advances in these areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Most of the public disquiet about the recent case arose because while the Government did not ask the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins to pay the State&rsquo;s legal costs as well, which a court decision would have allowed it to do, the fact that the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins&rsquo; side of those costs alone cost approximately &euro;2 million says something about the cost of judicial action in the first instance.</P><Col N="1140"/>
        <P>On the need for people to seek judicial address that has not been properly provided through legislation, prior to the coming into Government of my party, the last D&aacute;il and Seanad passed three pieces of legislation on disability &mdash; the Disability Bill, the Education of People with Special Educational Needs Bill and the Citizens Information Bill.  Taken together, that tranche of legislation was meant to address many of the ongoing issues.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned in the House on the Order of Business and in contributions to this debate that one element of that, the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, requires several of its provisions to come into being by the making of ministerial orders.  In terms of progressing this issue, that is something on which we should speak with one voice.  If the legislative will has been given already by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, there should be no further reason to delay the making of those provisions, and I would encourage the Minister to do so.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister and all our Cabinet colleagues &mdash; two of my party colleagues are now members of the Cabinet &mdash; to avoid in every circumstance, regardless of the advice being offered by civil servants in their Departments, the use of judicial action in terms of people seeking what should be natural rights that are not properly defined either in our Constitution or in our laws.  That may be unavoidable on occasions but too often in the past it appears to have been used as a weapon of first resort.</P>

While we are concentrating narrowly in terms of autism on special schooling at primary level, the debate must be held in its widest context.  What is the purpose of education?  Education exists for the State to provide for every citizen the opportunity to allow such citizens <Col N="1141"/>reach their potential and in too many respects our system, while there have been additional resources, is failing in that respect.</P>

	<P>I would like to think that the whole point of my contribution is to highlight that we have not been having this debate properly.  It has been conducted in the normal discourse of politics, namely, finger pointing and name calling.  It is not addressing the wider ramifications of the issue or the long-term needs.  I pointed out a series of measures by which other political parties and other governments of different compositions have addressed similar issues in an inadequate way.  It is the way our political system is structured that raises these problems, not the Government or the parties in Government at any given time.</P>

	<P>I propose to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty.  I am pleased to participate in this good debate but I regret it cannot be rolled over to next week.  We have had roll-overs of other debates on topics which were less deserving than this one.</P>
        <P>It is an emotive and politically charged issue but I reject any notion of making a political football of it.  Those involved in politics have a right and responsibility to raise issues of national concern.  This is an issue of personal concern for many of us.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke on the Government side and I too have family interests in this matter, with particular reference to autism, the subject on which I will focus my contribution.</P>
        <P>It annoys me greatly that every Government spokesperson I have heard, mostly outside the <Col N="1143"/>House, begins by stating that applied behavioural analysis is not a solution for everyone with autism or a one-size-fits-all solution.  Nobody in the Opposition has suggested that ABA fits everyone.  I ask the Government to address the real issue.  ABA is not a uniform approach and contains many different strands.  It is adapted to the individual needs of the child who has the learning difficulty.  We must get real on this subject.</P>
        <P>The cornerstone of the argument with the Government is early intervention, which cannot be stressed often enough.  The early years of these children will never be recovered if lost.  I get on well with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, but on this issue her performance has been shockingly bad.  She is dragging her feet.  I do not know the reason for it but she adopts an approach that she knows best and the rest of us do not.  Senator Ormonde referred to this when stating that the debate is being led by people who know less than the Minister.  I resent that and believe we are perfectly entitled to raise these views.</P>
        <P>Earlier speakers referred to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the fact it will be implemented.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to outline the timeframe.  It is estimated that &euro;400 million will be needed to implement the parts of the Act not yet in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I referred to the importance of early intervention.  Previous speakers have referred to the lack of facilities at second level education for those with autism.  This will be a significant problem in the future.  The major issue faced by many families, including my brother, his wife and their autistic three year old child, is the sheer lack of psychologists and the waiting times for assessments if they remain within the public system.  A private psychologist who carries out the assessment may state that ABA should be followed.  However, the Government will not provide enough resources for such places.  That is the central problem &mdash; providing resources to have these places available so that when the professional psychologist, not the Minister or even the parents, decides that ABA is the right approach, a place will be provided for the child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Phelan.  I commend the parents of children with special needs and their support organisations who have been making such determined efforts to ensure education rights for their children.  I refer in particular to parents of children with autism, who have been telling their stories and making the demand for the most appropriate methods of education to be available equally to each and every child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has admitted that education for children with autism and other special needs <Col N="1144"/>is an area of historical under-provision.  Improvements have been made in recent years but these cannot be stopped short now.  The next step is to extend support to those applied behavioural analysis schools that require it and to make this form of education available to all children with autism who need it.</P>
        <P>This is not a pro and anti-ABA argument.  This is about ensuring every child with autism, as of right, has access to the forms of education most appropriate to his or her individual needs.  It is about the ongoing failure of the State to meet these needs.  Not every child with autism requires ABA but very many do and it is proven to result in significant improvements in their lives and their potential.  One need only listen to their parents to see how important this is.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided funding for 12 ABA schools.  These schools were established by parents when there was little or no support from the State for the education of children with special needs.  Now, the Minister wants to close the door on the development of further ABA schools.  To justify this position the Minister and her Department are trying to play down the proven benefits of ABA.</P>
        <P>Why has the Minister been blocking the development of more ABA schools?  The need exists, the benefits of ABA have been proved and the trained teachers are in place.  The only logical explanation for the Minister&rsquo;s position is that she and her Department believe that providing ABA for all who need it will be far too costly.  However, in 2005, in reply to a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members&rsquo; motion on special needs education, the Minister stated: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance is obliged to have due regard to the State&rsquo;s duty to provide for an education appropriate to the needs of every child under the Constitution and the necessity to provide equity of treatment for all children.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government is not meeting that obligation.  As well as the refusal to fund new ABA facilities we have a continuing shortage of speech and language therapists.  Children are not getting the essential fair diagnosis of their special needs or the full range of special education and therapies that can make such a major difference in their lives.  As always, it is the children of more disadvantaged families who lose out as those lucky enough to be born into more prosperous homes have a better chance of accessing these services privately.  This is a scandal that should not be tolerated.</P>
        <P>It is shameful for this State to fight the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family all the way to the courts and now pursue them for the costs.  The same has happened, and is happening, to other families.  Does the Government think it is a better way to use the State resources than to provide education for those children who need it?</P><Col N="1145"/>
        <P>The Government must allocate the resources required to meet special needs and equal rights for all.  The deployment of teachers should be based on the right of the individual pupil to have his or her special education needs assessed and to the resources required to ensure each can reach his or her full potential.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister, her Department and her Government colleagues are listening carefully to evidence such as that provided during this debate and by others outside of this Chamber.  If they change their position and provide the funding for these schools, no one will accuse them of a climbdown or a U-turn.  It would be welcomed as a progressive development that can change the lives of thousands of children and their families for the better.  I urge the Minister to do what is right.</P>

        <P>I have been in touch with teachers and parents who deal with and care for children with autism, and I am confining my comments to the issue of autism and ABA.  They do not understand the attitude that has been taken by the bureaucracy to date.  No doubt the Minister is sincere in her efforts to provide for the needs of people but as so often before, the other imperatives in public life of fiscal issues and bureaucracy tend to frustrate even the best of intentions.</P>
        <P>I know of a case, for example, where a teacher realised that the necessary approach was not available and had to go and claim neglect under the Child Care Act 1991 to get the necessary special needs assistant in the school for a child with autism.</P>
        <P>The Government is not stating that ABA is bad.  It knows ABA is very much part of the sol<Col N="1146"/>ution.  The problem is that in talking about an eclectic approach, it seems to give the impression that a little ABA will be fine as long as it is available in the school.</P>
        <P>Let us be clear what is needed.  We certainly need fully qualified teachers within the system but whether in autism units of ordinary schools or special ABA units or schools, we need fully qualified ABA consultants available to the schools.  One needs a teacher who has done the necessary courses and has the qualifications in ABA who is working one on one with the children, and then backed-up by the necessary special needs assistants who can continue to work one on one.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Whereas that may be costly in the short term, proponents of ABA rightly point out that the savings will be made in the longer term.  As a result of providing ABA, the children will be able to proceed to what we might call more normal school, if one will pardon the expression.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;if we deny to children the necessary services which may be costly in the short term but which will more than pay for themselves in the long term.

Not only will we save on the costs in the long term, we will do right by this vulnerable section of society who deserve our care and attention.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, regrets she could not be present for the entire debate, but she is preparing for the Student Support Bill which is scheduled to be taken in the D&aacute;il this afternoon.  Senators will appreciate that it is an important Bill which is being welcomed across the board by students generally.</P>
        <P>I have listened to the debate for the past hour and to the discussion on this matter which has taken place outside the House.  I reiterate that the development of an educational system for children with special educational needs, including those with autism, has been a key priority for this Government.</P>
        <P>A key challenge over the past ten years has been to meet the needs of all children with autism.  There is now a nationwide network of autism-specific education places <i>in situ</i>.  This network has been the culmination of much work, <Col N="1147"/>including consideration of the available research, the task force report, advice from autism experts, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate on the provision of education for these children who have such individual needs.</P>
        <P>Listening to a number of reports over recent days, I wonder if the flexibility that is now built into the school-based system is fully understood.  The challenge facing any Minister for Education and Science is to put in place a framework of provision which can meet the needs of all prospective children who may present for enrolment.  For children with autism this spectrum is vast and includes children with significant social and communications difficulties, children who have learning disabilities and children who can be fully integrated alongside their typical peers.</P>
        <P>I am concerned the impression has been created of a one-size-fits-all approach, namely, that the Government wants all children with autism to enrol in mainstream schools and that this is the only option being made available.  This is not the case.  The purpose of education is to enable children to reach their full potential&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Very different children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has worked hard to put in place a continuum of educational provision for all children with autism.  This continuum has at its core a child-centred approach.  The education provided for each child must be highly structured and individualised to meet that child&rsquo;s needs.  Children with autism need to be taught how to learn which the rest of us take for granted.</P>
        <P>The network of educational provision needs to be flexible enough to cater for all children who present, not only ones who may benefit from a particular approach.  The system must also be robust enough to meet the needs of children who would benefit from being educated through one approach.</P>
        <P>The educational provision now in place includes mainstream classes for the many children with autism who can thrive in such settings.  These children may need additional support from <Col N="1148"/>a teacher or special needs assistant and if they do, the National Council for Special Education sanctions such posts.</P>
        <P>Some children with autism need a greater level of support.  These children have the option of enrolling in one of more than 275 special classes for children with autism where teachers can draw on a range of teaching methodologies and interventions.  This does not mean that all teachers use all the approaches with every child.  It means they must have more than one skill set that can be used, if necessary, to ensure each child reaches his or her potential.</P>
        <P>Children grow, develop and progress in school.  Their needs change over time.  As this happens, teachers need to be able to draw on the range of approaches to tailor the child&rsquo;s individual education plan to meet the child&rsquo;s changing needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other children with autism have complex needs and are better supported in special schools.  Special autism-specific classes have been established in special schools throughout the country to meet the needs of these children, as Senators will be aware.  The Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, sanctioned the opening of two such schools in Dublin and Limerick recently which will meet specifically the needs of children with autism.  In the event that further special schools are needed to meet demand, these will also be sanctioned.  I will be very pleased to see the centres in the pilot ABA scheme become special schools for children with autism and become part of the continuum of educational provision.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We have had a constructive debate on this issue.  I thank Senators for their contributions on this emotive subject.  Our educational policy is one of inclusion and of placing children in the least restrictive environment, commensurate with their abilities and needs.  Our educational policy must be focused on the needs of every child, rather than on the needs of any one approach.  Our intention is to continue to invest in and improve education for all children with special educational needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm go bhfuil mo chomhghleaca&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it, Pat the Cope &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir, anseo chun freagra a thabhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  I am delighted my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Health <Col N="1149"/>and Children, Pat the Cope Gallagher, is here to answer the question as he is well aware of the acute needs of people in Donegal.  I am delighted he is attached to the Department and that he can assist Donegal people with their concerns in the area of health, particularly the issue of cancer services in the north west.</P>
        <P>The issue I wish to raise today concerns BreastCheck, the free breast screening service that can find or detect early breast cancer.  The service invites women aged between 50 and 64 for a free breast X-ray every two years.  The appointment takes approximately 30 minutes.  It is not a painful experience for most women and the majority of them are found to be in perfect health.  BreastCheck is currently available in the north east, the east, the midlands and the south east of the country and the Government plans to roll the service out nationally.</P>
        <P>The reason I have raised the issue today is that I want to ascertain when BreastCheck will be rolled out into the north west, particularly to Donegal and Letterkenny General Hospital.  Currently, BreastCheck screening is available in Cork, Galway and Roscommon with plans to roll the service out this month in Blanchardstown in Dublin, in Cabinteely, Portlaoise, Finglas, Ballymun and Ballygall, with the service rolling out in Kildare, Foxrock, Swords and County Louth later this year.</P>
        <P>Breast screening is vital for women in the age group 50 to 64.  Many women in Donegal have to travel to Galway in order to obtain the service.  It is unacceptable that this will continue.  I hope the Department and the HSE roll out the availability of breast screening and the BreastCheck service to Letterkenny General Hospital as quickly as possible.  I would like the Minister of State to provide an update as to when this will happen and explain the associated staffing arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to address the issue and set out the current position on the roll out of the national breast screening programme. </P>
        <P>I confirm that BreastCheck screening commenced in the western region in May and the southern region in October.  In December, the Minister for Health and Children officially opened two new BreastCheck screening units which will provide free breast screening services to women in the western and southern regions of the country.  The new purpose built static unit for the western region is located alongside the campus of the University College Hospital Galway.  Screening commenced from the unit in early December and to date the service has been extended to women based in Counties Galway <Col N="1150"/>and Roscommon.  The western unit will also provide services to women in counties Donegal, Clare, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.  The total screening population in this area is in excess of 52,000 women.  Accordingly, the first round of screening will take between 21-27 months to complete.  The BreastCheck programme delivers screening to women in their local community through the use of static and mobile screening units.  The 4% of women who need follow-on treatment receive it at one of the four BreastCheck static units nationally, located in the western, southern and eastern regions.</P>
        <P>Women in County Donegal will be screened from a BreastCheck mobile digital screening unit.  Mobile units have been commissioned and will be deployed sequentially over the course of the screening round to bring the service to women in counties remote from the western screening unit, including Donegal.  Mobile units will remain in the county until all women known to the programme have been offered a mammogram.  This time period varies from county to county, based on the numbers of women to be screened and uptake levels.  The roll out to individual counties, including County Donegal will be dictated by BreastCheck&rsquo;s management and operational considerations.</P>
        <P>There is one mobile unit in the region currently.  Other units will be commissioned and deployed within six months.  There is no issue with regard to funding as far as the purchase of the units is concerned or ensuring a service is provided in the region.  When the other units are available screening throughout the whole region will be expedited, including Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some &euro;26.7 million capital funding was provided to BreastCheck for the construction of the two new clinical units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of &euro;15 million additional funding has been allocated to the national cancer screening service to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is under way.  Staffing already appointed includes clinical directors, consultant radiologists, consultant surgeons, consultant histopathologists, consultant anaesthetists, medical scientists, breast care nurses and radiographers.  Screening is currently available in 17 counties in the eastern, north eastern, midland and parts of the south eastern, western and southern regions.  Screening is offered free of charge to all women in the 50-64 age group.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck screened over 64,000 women in 2007, the highest number of women screened by the programme to date. The rate of overall acceptance of invitation to screening, at approximately 78% of eligible women, is in excess of the programme target of 70%.  The target for timely <Col N="1151"/>admission to hospital was exceeded for the first time since the programme began, with 94.4% of women diagnosed with breast cancer admitted for treatment within three weeks of diagnosis.  The OECD ranked BreastCheck fifth in the world for the percentage of women screened in its 2007 Health at a Glance survey, ahead of long-established screening programmes in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America, France and Australia.</P>
        <P>I confirm to the House that BreastCheck is committed to providing a screening service to all eligible women at the earliest possible date.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant efforts of staff at BreastCheck to deliver on the commitments to the west and the south.  The expansion involves existing professional and management staff at BreastCheck who have shown considerable leadership in supporting this roll-out.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, I have focused on the health promotion aspect of my brief.  We want to ensure where a women has been screened and diagnosed with breast cancer, she will begin treatment within three weeks.  As well as my national responsibilities, I am also a Donegal man, representing the Donegal South-West constituency.  Although Donegal is on the periphery of the western region, I will do my utmost to ensure that when further BreastCheck units are available, Donegal will be considered for an early roll-out.</P>

	<P>Curam f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.  My motion on the Adjournment of the House relates to the need for the Government to progress a plan to bring rail to County Donegal, connecting the town of Sligo and the city of Derry through Donegal.  This would see rail reintroduced to Donegal through the towns of Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Donegal town itself, Ballybofey, Stranorlar, Letterkenny, Lifford, servicing Inishowen and up into the city of Derry.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of the last century, there were 200 miles of rail network in Donegal, with four different operators.  Today, there is not one mile, yard, foot or inch of operational rail track in Donegal.  Anybody who knows Donegal, and the Minister of State certainly does, will know of its infrastructural deficits.  One has only to look at a map of the infrastructure in the Republic of Ireland to see this clearly.  A Sinn F&eacute;in delegation met Mr. Jacques Barrot, the Commissioner for Transport in Europe and showed him such a map.  We indicated where Donegal was, in the top left hand corner.  He asked about the area on the map that was blank, thinking it was a desert.  I <Col N="1152"/>explained that it was part of Ulster and he asked why there was no infrastructure in that region.  I told him it was due to a lack of investment by both the British and Irish Governments and the fact that the railway lines were closed down, due to lack of use, in the 1960s.  Since then, there have been no advances.</P>
        <P>The motion calls for the gap between Sligo and Derry to be closed, which will create an all-Ireland rail network or loop.  To have a proper all-Ireland loop, we must make sure that the rest of the network is working properly.  Last night there was much debate in this House on the issue of the Derry to Coleraine section of the railway network.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the commitment that has been given by the Minister for Regional Development in Northern Ireland, Mr. Conor Murphy, a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, to the development of that part of the route.  Questions were raised about his political will but I point out that in 2000, during the last Executive in Northern Ireland, when the Minister for Finance was Mr. Mark Durkan, a railway task force report was adopted, which confined investment to core railways.  The report recommended that no major investment be put into the remainder of the track, which meant there could not be any investment in the Ballymena to Derry section of the line. That policy was continued in 2004 and 2005 by the direct rule Minister.</P>
        <P>I am glad to say that after only a short few months in office, Mr. Conor Murphy has lifted the restriction and has allowed for the preparation of a business case, and funded same, to ensure there is a substantial upgrading of the line between Coleraine and Derry.  He has said clearly that this business case will allow his Department to apply for EU funding in support of those works.  He has also committed, as has the Assembly in the investment strategy, to re-laying the entire line, beginning in 2011.  This will provide a new line, as well as additional signalling and passing loops, at a cost of &euro;64 million.  That work will start in 2011, as it takes time to plan, specify and procure such work properly.  There also will be additional new trains on the line and the scheme will be finished in 2013.  Once completed, the journey time between Derry and Belfast will be reduced by half an hour and trains will be able to leave and arrive in Derry before 9 a.m.  This demonstrates that there is political will and commitment in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The plan for Derry and Coleraine is good news for the people of Inishowen, who are close to Derry.  It is also very good news for the people of the north-west generally, particularly those who live in Derry.  However, we must now turn our attention to the other large missing piece of the jigsaw, that is, Donegal.  If one looks at the Government&rsquo;s transport infrastructure plan, <Col N="1153"/>Transport 21, it is clear that Donegal and the north-west has been left out, in terms of public transport.   It is great to see headline figures of &euro;16 billion being invested in public transport infrastructure over a ten year period.  It is also great to hear that &euro;4.4 million will be invested every day in public transport but none of that money will be spent on new rail projects or public transport projects in Donegal.  At the launch of Transport 21, the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Harney referred to &ldquo;your money&rdquo;, that is, the taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  The taxpayers of Donegal will contribute in the region of &euro;555 million to the public transport infrastructure part of that plan but no plans are being put in place to bring public transport infrastructure to that county.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is well aware that Donegal has serious problems in terms of economic development.  It has high levels of unemployment, the highest levels of poverty in the State and one of the highest levels of early school leaving.  When the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen, launched Transport 21, he said that infrastructure is essential for economic development and I agree with him.  The problem is that the infrastructural development being planned by the Government, while badly needed in all areas of the country, is concentrated in areas other than the north-west.  It is no surprise that every county in every province in this country has a rail service, bar the counties of Ulster.</P>
        <P>I am asking for fair play for the north-west and for Donegal.  I do not expect a railway line to be developed overnight or even in two or three years.  However, I expect the Government to start planning, particularly in the context of climate change and our dependence on cars, to bring rail back to Donegal.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has been at the forefront of this campaign in Donegal, along with others from across the political divide, including members of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  We welcome that because infrastructure should not be a party-political issue.  Nonetheless, my party recognises that the Government holds the purse strings and devises infrastructural plans.</P>
        <P>A study was carried out by Donegal County Council into the infrastructural needs of the county.  That study recommended that Sligo and Derry be linked via a rail line.  It does not make sense that, once the western rail corridor is opened, people will be able to leave Sligo by train and travel right around Ireland but when they arrive in Derry, they will have to transfer to a bus or taxi to get back to Sligo.</P>
        <P>The development I am calling for makes economic sense and makes sense in terms of cross-Border co-operation and all-Ireland developments.  I am glad the Minister of State who is here today is from Donegal and I ask him to bring this issue to the attention of the Department and <Col N="1154"/>Minister for Transport, to ensure the matter is raised at Cabinet and to follow the leadership that is being provided by Mr. Conor Murphy in the Northern Ireland Executive, who is clearly committed to bringing rail to the north-west but he can do that only in his own jurisdiction.  However, he has stated clearly that he is willing to co-operate with the Minister for Transport to ensure the north-west has a properly developed public transport infrastructure.  That requires the Government in the Republic to demonstrate its commitment to the same by investing in a railway line from Sligo to Derry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Pearse Doherty for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is unavoidably absent.  He would have liked to be here because this issue is very much a part of his brief.  </P>
        <P>Transport 21, which is the medium-term investment framework for transport, does not provide for the development of a railway line between Sligo and Derry.  The resources for mainline rail investment under Transport 21 are focused on the complete transformation of the rolling stock, including most recently that operating on the Sligo to Dublin line, on infrastructural projects such as the western rail corridor and other upgrade projects in various parts of the country, together with resignalling projects and the interconnector and electrification projects in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 also provides through the railway safety programme for major ongoing investment to upgrade the rail network throughout the country.  It is also the case that the strategic rail review, which fed into Transport 21&rsquo;s mainline rail investment programme, did not identify a Sligo-Derry link as a feasible option.  The primary findings of the review are contained in its recommended investment strategy which lists the priority areas for rail development.  Rail services between Derry, Letterkenny, Donegal and Sligo are not included in the strategic rail strategy.</P>
        <P>As far as the Department and the Minister are aware, there is no plan on the part of the Northern authorities for such a project.  I have no reason to doubt Senator Doherty&rsquo;s comments on what Conor Murphy has committed to and we will pursue the matter through the Department of Transport.  The Ministers with this responsibility &mdash; Mr. Murphy and Deputy Dempsey &mdash; will meet again and I will bring to them the Senator&rsquo;s opinions regarding the contributions to which the Northern authorities have committed on their side of the Border.</P>
        <P>While rail links are important, we cannot consider transport infrastructure in isolation from road and air services.  In considering the case for a Derry-Sligo rail link, it is important to bear in <Col N="1155"/>mind the improvements made in transport links to the north west.  I stated this yesterday during the debate on Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s Adjournment matter to which Senator Doherty referred, namely, the Derry-Coleraine link.  In recent years, upgrades of roads such as the N2, the N14 and the N15 serving the north west have been completed and more are planned.  I referred to the investment under Transport 21 leading to further improvements in transport infrastructure serving the region, including the Atlantic corridor from Derry-Letterkenny down the east of the county to Donegal, to the west, the south and on to the south east.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty will be aware, and it is something of which we in Government and in public life should be proud, that the Government has agreed to make available &euro;580 million to provide for a major upgrade of roads, not between Dublin and Donegal-Letterkenny, but within Northern Ireland and serving the north-west gateway of Letterkenny and Derry.  This project is being advanced by the National Roads Authority and the Roads Service of Northern Ireland under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Progress is being made.</P>
        <P>I refer to the funds that have been provided by successive Governments in respect of the public service obligations to the Dublin-Donegal air link and the Dublin-Derry route, which is under the jurisdiction of the Northern Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Irish taxpayer makes a major contribution in this regard.  Senator Doherty will be aware of the advantages of the air link between Carrickfinn, Donegal&rsquo;s airport, and Dublin and it is an opportunity to remind many of us who use that link that there is a substantial subsidy.  We should not need to thank anyone for this because we are one of the few counties in the country without a rail link.  There must be positive discrimination.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to all of those involved in Carrickfinn Airport and the airline in particular for providing a twice daily service between Dublin and Donegal and a thrice weekly service between Donegal and Glasgow Prestwick Airport.  As Glasgow has such an ethnic link with Donegal, there is a great demand for the service.  We must remind ourselves that the Glasgow leg is not subsidised because it is outside the jurisdiction.  However, as Derry is on the island of Ireland, we can provide funding for the capital improvements to Derry Airport.</P>
        <P>It is no harm to sell ourselves.  If one drives from Dublin to Donegal, one will travel up the M1 and bypass Ardee, Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and the inner relief road in Monaghan.  The only town through which one will pass is Emyvale, from which one will travel to Aughnacloy.  With the &euro;580 million to be provided by the <Col N="1156"/>taxpayer, I hope it will not be too long before there is movement in respect of design, procurement and the actual work, which can take some time, all of which have been acknowledged by the Senator.  I had the privilege of opening the Ballyshannon-Bundoran bypass, which cost more than &euro;80 million.  The Government is committed to providing &euro;100 million for the Ballybofey-Stranorlar bypass.  While we may not have a rail link, substantial funds are being invested.</P>
        <P>It is right that we should have an improved infrastructure because everyone acknowledges that this is linked with economic progress and growth.  Donegal&rsquo;s rate of unemployment is higher than the national average.  This may be owing to its location but neither I nor Senator Doherty could or would change that because we believe Donegal is the centre of the world.</P>
        <P>Substantial funds are being made available and I am interested in learning from Senator Doherty of Conor Murphy&rsquo;s commitment.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to discuss it with the Northern Minister at the next available opportunity, possibly at the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State went off point.  I have travelled throughout the country many times.  There are airports and motorways in different regions.  While the Government&rsquo;s investment in the dual carriageway is welcome, only the Aughnacloy-Derry stretch will be a dual carriageway.  It is right that the fourth largest city on the island is connected to the largest, Dublin, because every other city is being connected.</P>
        <P>It is clear that Conor Murphy has made a commitment to the north west in respect of rail links, especially a rail service to Derry.  The missing piece of the jigsaw is in our jurisdiction because it is in the gift of the Government to provide a rail link from Sligo to Inishowen to the Foyle.  Both Ministers must work together to provide a link across the Foyle.  Does the Minister of State support the demand for a rail line between Sligo and Derry and will he ask his Cabinet colleagues to support such a demand?</P>

	<P>If the Senator wants to interrupt, I can sit down.  We have provided &euro;580 million to the Northern Ireland authorities to assist in the provision of roads in the North.  Senator Doherty should ascertain the facts because we are heavily subsidising a dual carriageway from Dublin to Derry-Letterkenny.  It is not the commitment solely of his colleague in the North.  We live in the real world and it is not my call or that of the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise once again on the Adjournment of Seanad &Eacute;ireann the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene and ensure there will be early progress in the development of a new national school at Rahan near Mallow in County Cork.  I first raised the matter of school development problems at Rahan national school during the summer of 1987 and it is extraordinary that almost 21 years later the same topic is before Seanad &Eacute;ireann for discussion.  This shows how slow progress has been and how disappointing the responses of various Governments through the years.</P>
        <P>Rahan is a very successful and popular national school in the rural hinterland of Mallow.  It has become a victim of its own success because from an accommodation perspective, the facilities are inadequate.  The school is dependent on prefabricated accommodation and there are insufficient leisure and sporting facilities, which makes life very difficult for teachers who must strain against the odds to provide the educational resources required.</P>
        <P>Through fund-raising in conjunction with the church authorities, the community has generated enough money to purchase a suitable site for a new national school and the Department is aware of this, as are local planning officials from the council.  The site is deemed suitable from a planning perspective but it is still a green field and there has been no progress on a new building.</P>
        <P>Matters came to a head some weeks ago when a rat infestation caused parents to withdraw <Col N="1158"/>pupils from the school for a few days.  The story made headlines in the national television and radio media.  Problems facing parents, teachers, pupils and the board of management have reached such a level that despair has set in.  Meetings have taken place locally and there is a strong demand for local politicians to respond and make our views firmly known to the Minister of State and his Government colleagues.  I believe a meeting took place in Tullamore between the departmental inspectorate and school management representatives.  We welcome all this but must now move beyond words into actions.</P>
        <P>The priority is a new school at the earliest possible date but I am realistic enough to accept it will not be built next week or next month.  Whenever building begins it will be some time before the school is completed but I would like to see a decision made soon to build the new school.  In the interim there are accommodation issues that need to be addressed urgently and I appeal to the Minister of State to assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is 21 years since this issue was first raised in Leinster House and while prefabs and emergency accommodation probably made up the subject matter at the time, a new school is now required at Rahan, Mallow, County Cork.  I ask the Minister of State to respond as favourably as he can and impress upon the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, the importance of resources to build the new school being provided in the very near future.  Can he ensure in the interim that the pupils at Rahan need not learn in rat-infested facilities and will have at least the basic standard of accommodation due to all pupils in this country in 2008?  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and his strongly making the case to the Minister that the community of Rahan has waited long enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I want to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the position regarding the provision of a new school at Rahan County Cork.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary schools and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  The Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  Approximately &euro;600 million will be spent <Col N="1159"/>this year on school buildings.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large-scale refurbishment projects over the next few years.</P>
        <P>Rahan national school is a co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 91 pupils at September 2007.  The school staff consists of a principal, three mainstream class teachers and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.</P>
        <P>The school has submitted an application to the Department for capital funding towards the provision of a new school and the long-term staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.  It has been agreed that appropriate accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staff of a principal and eight mainstream assistants, plus appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>Applications for large-scale capital funding are assessed and banded in accordance with published prioritisation criteria.  These criteria were agreed following consultation with the education partners and the progression of individual pro<Col N="1160"/>jects is considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>Following a recent meeting with officials from the Department, the school authorities of Rahan have applied for the replacement of the existing temporary accommodation.  This application has been approved by the Department.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and allowing me to respond on behalf of the Minister.  He raised some issues relating to the school and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister in the coming days with a view to progressing the project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State mentioned that applications for large-scale capital funding are assessed and banded in accordance with published prioritisation criteria.  Where does Rahan stand in that process?  Has this assessment taken place and where is Rahan national school on the list for the banding scheme?  This information could help solidify my response to the local community, removing it from the realm of the merely aspirational.  I understand the Minister of State may not be able to answer now but perhaps he could get a response when he meets the Minister.  Perhaps I could receive a letter on the matter from the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
