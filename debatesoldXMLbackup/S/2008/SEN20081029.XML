	<P>I have notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to present a progress report on the improvements, planned upgrade or plans for a new location, if any, for the limb fitting clinic in St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the funding he will make available to Dublin City Council for the regeneration of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Dublin 7; and if he will meet the residents to discuss a timeframe for the completion of this project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline his response to the serious threat to the future of recycling facilities due to the lack of international demand for quality recycled materials produced in Ireland with specific reference to the implications for the future viability of the modern materials recycling facility run by Waterford County Council at Dungarvan, County Waterford.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage (Resumed), which will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and will adjourn not later than 5.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; No. 23, motion 25 re the educational needs of students with disabilities, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader confirm that the House will have an opportunity to debate health issues with the Minister, Deputy Harney, next week, even though the Government was fairly and squarely handbagged by the elderly when it attempted to steal the medical <Col N="818" />cards from them?  This week we are seeing what can only be described as schoolyard bully tactics in the Government&rsquo;s handling of the education sector and the effect the cutbacks will have on our children.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to have a debate on the effects the educational cutbacks will have on school children.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister for Finance to return to the House.  There are major concerns over his first budget two weeks ago, which is falling apart day by day.  Great concerns have been raised in business circles as to whether it will solve the problems it was meant to solve.  It is creating more confusion regarding how the country is being run rather than solving issues.  I would like the Minister to come in here because the uncertainty surrounding the economy is causing major concerns for everybody involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition to a debate on health, we also need a debate with the Minister for Education and Science on education matters.  The Leader told the House last week that he would arrange a debate on education.  I appreciate that my colleagues in the Labour Party have tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion for discussion later which relates to education issues, but we would like a debate during Government time with the Minister for Education and Science.  That needs to take place.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether Members on the Government side have taken much notice of what the Minister has been saying.  I hope to outline later the false information and misinformation he has been giving out about the impact of his cuts.  It does not help anybody to be found out on these issues.  I do not know where we are going and the Leader should ask the Minister to come into the House to explain himself.  He has developed a new line in economics &mdash; Battonomics.  He is telling the world that the Celtic tiger grew out of the large classes of ten years ago, inferring that if we have overly large classes again, we might have a new Celtic tiger.  We might also secure global warming and much more with large classes the way he is going.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What he is doing is ludicrous.  He referred to partnership, which also needs to be examined.  He blew education out of the water, so to speak, without consulting anyone and then visited China where he said he would like to sit down and talk to people.  People tried to respond to that by outlining ways through which he might find the money only for him to say on a visit to UCC earlier this week that there would be no change.  Last night he stated on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that teachers must take their medicine and the Government will not make any changes.  What way is that to do business?  He has shut the door on talks and the only response to that is hard action.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear from the Green Party Members who have not heard the Minister say there will be not talks as they refer to an opportunity to do something.  If the Minister is honest about the cuts he requires and he is telling the truth about their impact, I could sit down and sort it with him in half an hour.  There would not be a difficulty doing so without the need for overly large classes and the other actions he is trying to take within the education sector.  However, he does not appear to want to do that.  I understand we will debate education issues later but I am trying to deal with the political aspect on the Order of Business.  I ask that the debate promised last week take place.</P>
        <P>The governing body of UCC took a decision yesterday on stem cell research.  I do not care whether Members criticise the university administrators but the harsh realty is we, as a Legislature, have funked making a decision on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="819" />
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not taken a decision, right or wrong, about it and we are the last ones who can start criticising those involved.  I admire the decision taken but I do not know enough about it to discuss the rights and wrongs involved.  The university was left in a vacuum with no guidance from the Legislature.  The governing body consulted its own experts and took a decision on the basis of their response.  That was the best we could have asked them to do until such time as we put legislation in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest the Government parties think the issues being debated throughout the country such as, last week, the medical card for those over 70 and, this week, class sizes can be neatly compartmentalised into weeks and can be dealt with individually week by week, they should be very clear that these issues will not go away.  I agree entirely with the comments of Senators Twomey and O&rsquo;Toole about the need for a debate on the medical cards question, which should happen as soon as possible.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is also correct that while the Labour Party has tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion for debate later on the disabilities question, there is a clear need for a debate on the wider question of the myriad education cuts the Government introduced in the budget.</P>
        <P>I echo Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s question regarding the Green Party.  Does the Deputy Leader agree with a statement made by a prominent Green Party politician yesterday that her party would appear to have &ldquo;no bottom line or any clearly defined point whereupon the party might morally say enough is enough&rdquo;?  Has the party a bottom line?  Is there any cut it is not prepared to justify or principle it is not prepared to jettison?  Is there anything it is not prepared to put up with in the context of this bottom line that we are asked to believe the party has?  The party leader responded to this by announcing we are facing into an economic abyss.  That is not good enough.  People voted for and transferred to that party on the basis of very solemn commitments given, including on the question of education, and they are entitled to an answer from its members at this stage unless they are happy to contribute to the increasing cynicism about politics and political parties at election time by saying one thing on the doorstep and doing something else entirely six weeks or six months later.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader revisit the banking crisis, another issue that has not gone away despite the preoccupations of the Government and the Houses in recent weeks?  The all-night session we spent discussing this matter three weeks ago was something of a circus, which I say advisedly because I have the greatest respect for the House.  It is difficult to understand why an all-night session and votes at dawn were necessary when the Minister only signed the order late last week, bringing into being the guarantee that he had announced with such fanfare three or four weeks previously.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on why the Government believes that it can deal with the fundamental crisis in the banking system?  As Senator Mary White and others stated, it is a practical rather than a theoretical issue.  It affects people who need money to ensure the survival of their businesses.  A debate is necessary on why the Government believes that it can solve the banking crisis without dealing with the gaping under-capitalisation issue.  Experts such as academics and journalists, including the internationally renowned journalist Mr. Will Hutton, who is in Dublin today, point out daily that the Government and small businesses will rue the day when the former made such a short-sighted and incomplete decision on the banks and failed to face up to the fundamental issue, namely, the need to revitalise and recapitalise banks.</P>
        <P>Professor Morgan Kelly of UCD referred to the guarantee scheme, on which much time was spent debating, as akin to Fannie Mae, the American mortgage company, immediately prior to nationalisation, that is, &ldquo;alive but economically useless&rdquo;.  He went on to describe the decision as &ldquo;the worst economic decision of any Irish Government in the last 30 years&rdquo;.  Given that this <Col N="820" />point was made by a serious economic commentator, we must debate the issue again and examine the crisis at the heart of the banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange an urgent debate on the HSE and, in particular, the roll-out of BreastCheck?  As Members know, I and others have often raised the matter of discrimination against people in the north west and the delay being perpetrated upon them by the national cancer screening service, NCSS.</P>
        <P>Last week, the chief executive of the NCSS, Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, addressed the Joint Committee on Health and Children and, in the context of the delivery of this vital service to the people of the north west, he stated: &ldquo;Our screening schedules are dictated by operational considerations alone and we will not be swayed in terms of sequencing.&rdquo;  How does the NCSS determine its sequencing and what does &ldquo;operational considerations&rdquo; mean?  He also stated that BreastCheck remains on schedule.  I recall attending a meeting three years ago with the Minister for Health and Children and the mayor of Sligo, among others, at which we were assured that by the end of 2006 BreastCheck would be rolled out in the north west, but that has not happened.  However, we are told that it is on schedule.</P>
        <P>I was insulted when Mr. O&rsquo;Brien stated: &ldquo;BreastCheck will not, therefore, compromise on this quality remit to satisfy any political, with a small &ldquo;p&ldquo;, or public demand for the introduction of the service.&rdquo;  That is offensive in the extreme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the same as in County Waterford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is testament to what has become the normal contempt with which the HSE and its instruments, individuals and subsidiaries hold the political establishment.  The situation must change and this House, if not the other House, must begin to take action to show that respect for the officers acting on behalf of the small &ldquo;p&rdquo; is required, as they represent the interests of the large &ldquo;p&rdquo;, the people, and the State.  Without that, we have nothing.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange, without delay, for the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House to address the disgrace that is the NCSS?  Discrimination against the people of the north west must stop now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Twomey.  As a means of addressing the current budgetary crisis, my party has proposed a one-year pay freeze from next September for public servants earning more than &euro;50,000.  Fine Gael recognises that difficult decisions must be made.  However, I have spoken to one school principal and received e-mail communications from others who have said they would prefer to take a pay freeze than to have pupils and teachers endure unsafe conditions arising from the education cuts in the budget.  The principal to whom I spoke, whose school has 650 pupils, is concerned that his staff will be under extreme stress as a result of the withdrawal of substitution and supervision cover, with the result that the school will, according to him, become inoperable.  For now, he is left to decide which three teaching posts to cut.  He will have no choice but to send pupils home after Christmas.</P>
        <P>Another teacher remarked to me that children need resources in education more than ever before in view of the integration of pupils with special needs, Travellers and non-nationals into the school system.  Everybody knows we will have to pay for the profligacy and stupidity of the Government during the Celtic tiger years.  The obvious way to raise money is to impose a pay freeze on the public sector.  Such is the good will of teachers contacting me that they are prepared to take the hit rather than have their children suffer and see the future of this country <Col N="821" />go down the drain.  In the two weeks since the budget, I have repeatedly asked the Leader to say when the Minister will come into the House to face these realities and answer our questions.  I look forward to being given a specific date today.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader allow a debate on the proposed 2% tax on betting?  I am not in the gambling league but representations have been made to me regarding the effect this tax will have on small businesses throughout the State, where jobs will be lost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Senator Leyden bet on an election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a better way.  A tax could be imposed, as is the case in Northern Ireland and Britain, which would apply to the gross turnover of companies.  Such a charge, even if it were set at 2% or 3%, would be preferable to imposing a charge on the placing of bets.  The placing of bets through electronic methods via the Internet is becoming more commonplace and such transactions are not subject to tax.  There will be no incentive to go to the local betting shop and pay a charge to place a bet if one can avoid doing so by going on-line or availing of the services of a company registered abroad.</P>
        <P>We on this side of the House must seek to be positive in identifying aspects of the budget where we can obtain the same financial return, if not more, but in a different way.   I have made a submission to the Minister on behalf of the Irish Bookmakers Association, which is a reputable organisation.  Some of its members are facing the closure of their offices.  I understand a former Minister from a party on the other side of the House is experiencing difficulties with his betting shops.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The larger companies, such as Paddy Power, are not concerned by this tax because they have the capacity to squeeze out the smaller operators.  I do not want to cause further concerns, leading to a protest in a week&rsquo;s time by the betting organisations.  I wish to prevent that.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to say well done to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, for ensuring there will be a double payment to social welfare recipients this Christmas.  We on this side of the House have shown exactly where we stand.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>During difficult times in the past, the social welfare bonus was only an additional 50%, before increasing to 75% and, in recent years, to a double payment.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Progressive Democrats Government has protected that provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to debate the implications of yesterday&rsquo;s remarkable decision by the governing body of University College <Col N="822" />Cork to approve a protocol allowing human embryonic cell stem research at the university.  I am sorry to say that my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, could not be more wrong in his analysis of the issue.  There is an urgent need for a debate on this issue.  The move by University College Cork, UCC, is astonishing for many reasons.  It has pre-empted legislation in what is a vitally sensitive area.  This publicly-funded body has pre-empted legislation and, possibly, a Supreme Court decision and has done so, it seems, without any public consultation.  So slight is its regard for the Legislature that a letter which I wrote to the president of UCC last Friday was not circulated, as I requested, to the members of the governing body in advance of a meeting.  While UCC was unable to confirm that this was the case, I have been informed by sources within the governing body that it is the case.  So opaque are the proceedings of the governing body, I was not able to get confirmation of this fact.</P>
        <P>There has been no public consultation on this issue, which has profound ethical implications.  This is occurring at a time when the potential of adult stem cell research, which is ethically uncontroversial, cannot be denied and when people like Dr. Colin McGuckin, an eminent scientist, are leaving Newcastle University in England for France because of the over-emphasis on embryo destructive research at that university.  We should be seeking to employ such people so that we can pursue scientifically promising and ethically uncontroversial research.  However, we have been pre-empted by the governing body of UCC.</P>
        <P>We must also consider how it has, perhaps, queered the pitch for the Lisbon treaty.  How can we reassure people that our social and ethical values are being protected by the Irish Government at European level when we allow this to happen at our backdoor?  I do not know how I can offer such reassurance to people in the light of the current legislative vacuum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator did not do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen did the opposite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  I want to give that reassurance but I cannot do so unless we address this legislative gap.  We cannot simply have legislation by university dons.  The Oireachtas, under the Constitution, has the right to make laws on behalf of the Irish people and we should exercise that right.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to raise two matters.  Moving away from the budget debate, I ask the Leader to invite to this House the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the current status of the restoration of the Cork-Swansea ferry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an old hobby horse of mine which I raised previously in the House.  I am glad to hear that the Minister met representatives from Cork and Kerry last week.  This matter is more regional than parochial and is urgent in so far as that, even though we are in the middle of winter, if the new vessel is not secured in the next two or three weeks the ferry service from Cork to Rosslare, which has been in operation for many years, will be lost.  That will have a devastating effect on the socio-economic life of the southern region, with an acute contraction of the tourism industry, which is critical to the area.  This is not the first time I have made this request.  The Minister for Transport should make a statement on the matter.  I am aware there are some restrictions owing to competition rules but the support <Col N="823" />of the Minister in question, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is critical to the ongoing discussions in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also previously requested a debate on the fishing industry.  While this was promised prior to the summer recess, I later agreed with the Leader to postpone it.  However, this matter now requires urgent attention.  We hear much about teachers, farmers and the elderly, but the fishing industry is in crisis.  It is critical that such debate takes place before the end of November, if possible.  The Minister and his officials will attend a meeting in Europe to seek extra quotas and fair play within the European structures for our fishermen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is nice to order monkfish or seabass when dining out in a restaurant, but people tend to forget from where the fish comes.  The fishing industry has been neglected for too long.  I urge the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.  If he wishes, I would be willing to let the tide ebb a little in respect of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill to give precedence to a debate on the fishing industry in the next two or three weeks.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>One aspect of the proposed education cuts that may be going under the radar but is very serious in terms of national reconciliation and the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in terms of where we want to go as a country is the removal of the block and ancillary grants from Protestant schools.  The issue is very serious in that many Protestant children are happy to be educated in co-education and community schools, which is fair enough, but it is the wish of a number of Protestant parents and their children that they are educated in schools with their own ethos, which is their right under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The Protestant schools used the block and ancillary grants to fund the education of Protestant children from the poorer income groups &mdash; in other words, the fees of these children were waived.  This happened in the Royal School in Cavan, which celebrated its 400th anniversary recently, and other schools throughout the country.  Such schools will not now be in a position to provide education for these poorer children, who wish to go to such schools and maintain their ethos.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider this issue and discuss it specifically with the Minister for Education and Science.  I know the Leader is a wise man and will commend to the Minister to rescind this measure.  It would be brave of him to do so and say that a mistake has been made and that the measure must be reconsidered.  We cannot deny children of a minority religious group their wish to be educated in their own schools, as it is their prerogative under the Constitution, ethically and morally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Reilly on his comments about Protestant schools.  He literally took the words out of my mouth and his point was well made.  There is much idle talk about fee-paying schools, but Protestant schools in regions where their populations are small carry many poor pupils.  They are in a special position, even leaving aside the special position they have in the Proclamation of the Republic.  The reference to cherishing the children of the nation equally is to nothing except our Protestant brethren North and South.  Northern Ireland will watch with great interest what we do in this regard.</P>
        <P>Indirectly, this raises a wider question.  I approached the Minister yesterday in Cork when he was surrounded by chanting students.  I asked him about Protestant schools and he assured me he would look hard at the issue.</P>
        <P>Independents should not take themselves too seriously, and while I have abstained until now and voted with the Government, there is a bottom line to my commitment to voting with the Government.  If there is no reform of the public sector in the report, I will vote as I please <Col N="824" />after that on the merits of the matter as I see it.  I have one term in the Seanad and I intend to make a mark with regard to reform of the public sector.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless the public sector, what I term the cushioned class, is reformed, there can be no peace.  It is wrong to pick on the Minister of State, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, or the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who are unfortunate to have to carry the burden of what should be a general taxation issue.  Children, pensioners and individual Ministers should not have to carry that burden.  That is the reason I will not vote against the Minister on a vote of confidence this time as it is not fair to the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  The Government is funking and getting the money from the only class which has it currently, the cushioned class of the public sector, the higher paid public sector.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend we found out many things from reports.  We found it is no longer true that the public sector is paid substantially less than the private sector.  There are no masses of low-paid public sector workers, as we were told, although there is a number of them.  People in permanent and pensionable employment will sail through a recession and allow their fellow workers and comrades in the private sector to squeeze, struggle and strain through the recession.  That is wrong.</P>
        <P>I strongly support Deputy Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on a pay freeze for principals, Deputy Richard Bruton&rsquo;s statement on reform of the public sector and the comments of Kevin Myers this morning that we are in a virtual wartime situation.  We need a national Government that will deal with these matters.  It is appalling that there is no one in the Government of the calibre of Deputies Richard Bruton and Brian Hayes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on the decision made by University College Cork, which has behaved extremely responsibly.  It did not pre-empt legislation in this area because such legislation does not exist, despite the efforts of my colleague, former Senator Mary Henry, who produced a Bill in this regard that was not adopted by the Government.  University College Cork did not pre-empt anything and has not pre-empted a Supreme Court decision.  Were a case to come before the Supreme Court, there is nothing to prevent it from making a decision.  Faced with a vacuum in the law, University College Cork did the honest, decent and courageous thing by implementing a regime whereby the free range that existed previously now is properly addressed and tabulated.  I have no problem with a debate although I will be on the other side to my good friend, Senator Mullen.  However, I applaud University College Cork.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White referred to a serious economic commentator and there may be such &mdash; I do not know.  However, the significant point is that no one, whether a serious economic commentator or otherwise, has managed to suggest a clear vision of the way out of this mess.  That is significant.  I agree with what I understand to have been Senator Harris&rsquo;s intention in <Col N="825" />stating the situation now is so dangerous that it is time to consider a national Government, using the talents of the various parties, in order that everyone will pull together if, as Ministers have asserted, the position is so serious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the absence of such leadership or analysis of the financial situation, one is left dealing with the queries of individual people.  I conducted a radio interview the other day with an economic commentator and while I do not know how serious he was, he came up with a serious question.  If a deposit taker, that is, the bank that has accepted the money, goes into liquidation, how long will it take to recover individuals&rsquo; funds and what level of administration will be involved?  He provided the specific example of one of his clients who is considering the building of a new family home in 2009.  Were such a person to put &euro;100,000 into one of the wobbly banks, as it were, will he be able to get it back out?  What delays will there be?  These are real and immediate problems.  I second Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment and apologise for not so doing earlier.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the Middle East.  I have asked for such a debate a number of times.  Two days ago, the Americans invaded Syria.  They crossed the border with a fleet of helicopters, landed in broad daylight and machine-gunned a family home, resulting in more than half a dozen deaths, a number of which were of children.  This took place without discussion.  How long will Bush be allowed to commit murder in such a way?  The voice of protest must be raised because that man is in the final, dying days of his disgraceful presidency and I hope he does not do something catastrophic as a diversionary tactic.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am getting the same vibes as Senator Healy Eames, which is that a small minority of teachers have stated they certainly should forgo the scheduled increases.  I have told them this should not apply simply to teachers but throughout the public service.  I agree with Fine Gael in respect of a pay pause for two years in the public service.  However, this will not be sufficient.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole observed the benchmarking process was akin to taking money from an ATM machine.  He could have added, but did not, that the taxpayers&rsquo; PIN number was being used.  This money must be given back to the taxpayer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The public pay bill should be reduced from its current value of &euro;19 billion to approximately &euro;15 billion, thus saving &euro;4 billion, and another &euro;4 billion should be taken from the rest of current expenditure by cutting the waste which can be seen by all in every nook and cranny.  Such waste occurs in every big organisation and I do not suggest this pertains solely to the public sector as it also applies in major organisations in the private sector.  However, the latter are driven by the bottom line and are taking the pain at present.  Unless such measures are applied in an even-handed fashion across the entire public sector, it will be very serious.</P>
        <P>It does not surprise me that people in the public sector object to my argument but we have to face up to the challenge.  If we fail to address these problems within the next two years, we may be forced to join the three countries which are currently under the protection of the IMF.  A condition of IMF support will be draconian cutbacks in public expenditure.  We have an opportunity to do this ourselves but if we fail to meet the challenge, we will suffer down the line.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Mullen&rsquo;s call for a debate on embryonic stem cell research.  I, too, was appalled at what happened in UCC.  I acknowledge what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said regarding our failure to bring legislation through these Houses.  I am not persuaded by the spokesman for UCC who argued that it is an acceptable procedure because the embryo is destroyed prior to the removal of the stem cell strips.  I see that as analogous to somebody who is caught with child pornography denying his or her instrumentality in the abuse of the children concerned because he or she came into the possession of the pornography subsequently.  It does not stand up to argument.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it the height of political hypocrisy that Senators opposite can wring their hands, make speeches and disavow the policies pursued by Governments over the past 11 years despite having supported them at every turn.  We have seen examples over the past year of Members protesting on the streets and voting otherwise in the House.  This hypocrisy should be exposed.</P>
        <P>Last week a view was expressed in the House that Fianna F&aacute;il is the natural party of Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions should be addressed to the Leader.</P>

<Col N="827" />
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not yet introduced my question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would appreciate it if the Senator put a question to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is being formulated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>A poll published in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> suggested that support for Fianna F&aacute;il stood at 26%, whereas Fine Gael was at 33%.  I am aware this is only a poll but it dispels the myth that the political structures of this country obey a natural order.  Many people feel disenfranchised because Fianna F&aacute;il has led successive Governments for the past 11 years.  Many organisations, including sections of the media, expect Fianna F&aacute;il to remain in power and therefore accommodate that party.</P>
        <P>In respect of the protests against education cuts which are being held outside these Houses today, similar protests were held before the previous general election, yet the leader of INTO &mdash; one of our principal educational organisations &mdash; welcomed new commitments from the then Minister for Education and Science in respect of class sizes and increased funding for schools even though the Government had failed to meet the commitments it made over the preceding five years.  If that is not sucking up to teacher, I do not know what it is.</P>
        <P>If Governments do not honour their commitments, they should be thrown out of power.  That is the only way we can ensure a healthy democracy.  We cannot have an accommodation of a Government that has failed to meet its commitments in a time of plenty and yet takes on board new commitments.</P>

	<P>That is what I want to hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is whether he would accept, in light of last weekend&rsquo;s polls, that Fianna F&aacute;il is not the natural party of Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Leader will arrange an urgent debate on embryonic stem cell research.  The decision by the governing body of UCC is not acceptable.  It was pre-emptive and, more than that, it was undemocratic.  There are 40 members on the body and only 16 voted in favour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Nine members abstained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>That means that 24 did not vote in favour of the decision.  That suggests that 24 people are well aware of the widely and deeply held ethical views on this issue, not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  We remember the European debates on this when many countries put their heads above the parapet and were not prepared to provide finance to this type of research.</P>
        <P>UCC has a very proud record but it did no credit to the record by what it did in this case.  It is particularly important that it takes a step back and parks this issue for the moment.  UCC is well aware that it is not acceptable in the present climate.  There are also legal issues involved.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as well as the Minister for Health and Children, should be involved in this debate.  I hope the Leader will take on board the strong views that exist.  The last time we debated this the majority of people on both sides of this House were opposed to stem cell research.  Others may have an open mind on it, but it is totally wrong for UCC to act in this manner.  I hope the message goes out from this House that UCC <Col N="828" />should take a step back and not go ahead with this decision, which was undemocratic in the first instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those calling for a debate, as sought by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, on stem cell research.  Those of us who do not know enough about this topic would welcome this debate.  Senator Mullen referred to profound ethical questions, which is exactly what we should be debating in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a debate that would be very welcome because we would all learn a great deal from it.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alex White on the economy and banking.  We have had debates on these matters in the past few weeks but we should have regular debates on that situation.  There is a danger we will talk ourselves into a much deeper recession than we might otherwise have.  We can do something about it, there are questions we should be asking and we should be debating them in the House now.</P>
        <P>We made decisions on a number of areas in the good years.  We made decisions on benchmarking, public sector pay and public sector pensions.  We also made decisions on having the highest minimum wage in Europe.  Some jobs do not exist at certain rates of pay.  If we are to ensure that the actions that were good in the good years are not necessarily the correct thing to do in the future, let us have that debate.  We should have that debate on a regular basis in this House during this period.  This is a time not for optimism but for realism tinged with optimism rather than the pessimism that we hear too often in these Houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share in the calls for a debate on the decision by UCC on embryonic stem cell research.  Given that the best possible result would be that the Minister would be present, the Leader might give an undertaking that at the earliest possible date, when the Minister is present, the debate will go ahead.</P>
        <P>It was very disappointing to see UCC take the opportunity to promote embryonic stem cell research when all the evidence indicates that it is an attack on the most vulnerable, the embryo, and it is the most unsuccessful medical practice.  UCC wishes to join the long list of failures of other universities in the mad frenzy to do what the current scientific thinking and teaching is, which has produced nothing.  The only success has been through adult stem cells where a natural bind has been found with existing stem cells.  Embryonic stem cells are too pluripotent and they are not able to stop the division and sub-division of those cells and where they do so, it causes cancerous cells.  There have been no successes anywhere in the world.</P>
        <P>I am interested to note how economic commentators can comment on the Irish situation, especially because we have handled this current crisis well.  I am thinking of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, where Alliance &amp; Leicester, Halifax, HBOS, Lloyds and many others have been either merged or acquired.  Northern Rock was taken over but not one Irish bank has been taken over or has failed.  In other words, the decisions we have made have helped to ensure the stability of the Irish banks, and they will continue to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the calls for a debate embryonic stem cell research.  I was disappointed to discover that the board of governors of UCC took a vote on this issue yesterday.  It is a very sensitive issue and I am concerned the board of governors has taken action in what is essentially a legal vacuum.  It has gone on a solo run on an issue which is very sensitive and which could be very controversial for this country.</P>
<Col N="829" />
        <P>I support the calls for a debate on this issue.  Will the Leader facilitate it at the earliest possible opportunity?  As parliamentarians, we must face up to this issue.  We need proper legislation governing this area.  We cannot have universities going off independently and on solo runs in this very sensitive area.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about a sector which has been spoken about very little since the budget, namely, agriculture.  That sector is suffering serious cuts across the board.  However, one of the main casualties of the budget are the young farmers who are about to enter the sector and who will keep agriculture alive.  The slashing of the farm installation grant and the early retirement scheme in the budget will have wide implications in rural Ireland.  I am sure Members on all sides would agree with, and be concerned about, that.  There are no incentives for young farmers to go back to the land.  Farmers who had worked on constructions sites are now leaving those sites owing to a lack of work, are looking to go back to the land and need support.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue as soon as possible?</P>
        <P>Some Members have spoken about benchmarking and public sector reform.  I issued a report only yesterday on the salaries and bonus schemes of the managers and the directors of services of local authorities.  Salaries range from &euro;100,000 to &euro;200,000 per annum plus bonuses and expenses.  I have no problem with somebody being well paid but with the 7% cut in the local government fund, frontline services will be the first to take a hit.  I support the call by Senator Harris and others for a debate on public sector reform and salaries.  The issue must be addressed now before it gets completely out of control and our economy goes down the tubes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad a sense of realism has crept into the debate.  We are in a very poor financial state and must look at all the options.  Senator Quinn is right that all the options must be examined.  The health, education and other budgets are out of control.</P>

	<P>I never interrupt anyone in this House and expect the same courtesy when I speak.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Harris in that we must examine the public sector, including the health service and any area which has a major budget.  If we do not do so, we will not be able to support the social welfare and education services.  It was grand when we had the Celtic tiger which was purring away and producing money but we must now live in the real world.  Nobody will bail us out.  If we are serious, we will adjust all our budgets, in every service we are delivering.  We cannot afford it.  We are borrowing approximately &euro;6 billion and unless we come to grips, that cannot be sustained.  I call for a debate on the economy at which the Minister must be present.  I am glad the Opposition is beginning to realise that we have serious problems and we will have to sort them out together.</P>

	<P>I welcome the distinguished members of the Ugandan judiciary who are guests of my colleague, Professor William Binchy from Trinity College Law School.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I would welcome a debate on embryonic stem cell research, but I would like it to be conducted from a position of education and in an informed manner, not in a spirit of ignorance which, unfortunately, we have heard informing the debate today.  I have heard suggestions that UCC has taken some pre-emptive step in allowing stem cell research, but the reality is that until now any researcher at UCC could import embryonic stem cells.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>What has happened is that in the absence of legislation, UCC has had to move and it has introduced a more restrictive regime and has done so in a responsible and measured fashion.  I am not an expert on medical research, nor are the other speakers here, but I am very much persuaded by the fact that the academics on the board of UCC, the persons engaged in the research on the medical side, are supporting the policy.  People from an ideological position, particularly the religious side, such as the Archbishop of Cashel and Emily, opposed it.  </P>
        <P>Today, there is a more pressing issue.  I support calls for a debate not on stem cell research but on education cuts.  There will be people outside these Houses tonight, parents and teachers alike, who are extremely angered and distressed by the proposed cutbacks in education, which will have a severe impact on our children in primary education.  We should have a debate not only on the impact of the cutbacks, but also on the role of the Government&rsquo;s junior partner in this, because the Green Party appear to lack backbone on education cutbacks.  As one of their own councillors has said, there no longer seems to be a bottom line.  They will tolerate any cutback that has a draconian effect on children.</P>
        <P>We have heard of Nero fiddling while Rome burned, and it seems the Green Party will sit idly in Government while class sizes increase, children with special needs and language needs have their services cut.  Children in general will suffer badly as a result of the cutbacks and, therefore, we urgently need this debate.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me this opportunity to speak.  I support those colleagues who requested the Leader to amend the Order of Business to accommodate a debate on embryonic stem cell research and those who have requested a further debate on education.  I hope he will be able to take on board those two requests to amend the business of the House.</P>
        <P>I support other colleagues who raised the issue of public sector reform and commend Senator Harris in this respect.  At least he has shown, to paraphrase that Green Party councillor who <Col N="831" />spoke yesterday, he has a bottom line in terms of support for the Government.  It is a  pity the Green Party does not appear to have the same.  I was somewhat surprised by the appalling conversion of a number of Members on the Government benches in regard to the issue of benchmarking and that their support for its implementation in recent years seems to have evaporated.  I join them in requesting a debate on public sector reform.</P>
        <P>I would welcome the Leader&rsquo;s comment on a report, commissioned by Senator Coffey, on the terms and conditions of employment, namely the salaries of county and city managers and leading local authority officials across the country.  Perhaps we could have a debate on this matter in the near future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader spell out when the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will come to the House for a discussion on the savage cutbacks proposed in the agriculture budget, which was announced as part of the budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan?</P>

We have heard countless Ministers over the years lament the fact that there are not more young people involved in agriculture.  Yet the Government has abolished the grants for new farm entrants and the early farm retirement scheme.  I hope there will be a conversion by the Government in this regard, as it seems to be considering numerous other reforms in regard to the Budget Statement announced two weeks ago.</P>

	<P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Healy Eames and Walsh called for a debate on the issue of health.  I informed the House last week that such a debate will take place next week.  I will inform the House tomorrow morning of the day and times for that debate.  </P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Mullen, Bacik and many other Senators expressed concern regarding the education portfolio and various changes announced in the budget.  I must put the facts in this respect on the record.  An additional allocation of 3.2%, or an increase of &euro;302 million, for the Department of Education and Science was announced in the budget.  This reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritising investment in the sector in these difficult economic times.  Furthermore, there are now more than 30,000 primary teachers in schools throughout the country.  In the primary sector alone there are some 6,500 more teachers on the Department&rsquo;s payroll than there were in 2002.  Also, a further &euro;586 million will be spent on the school building programme this year, which will result in the provision of an additional 1,200 new school places.  The overall capital allocation of &euro;889 million for 2009 represents an increase of &euro;80 million on the allocation for 2008.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Reilly, Harris and other Senators, including Senator Wilson to whom I spoke prior to the Order of Business, brought a related matter to my attention, namely, that of the funding for Church of Ireland schools.  As one who was born within 100 yards of a Church of Ireland school in north Westmeath, I support that request and will discuss the matter with the Minister following the Order of Business.  The Senators who brought this matter to my attention might bring it to the attention of the Minister during the Private Members&rsquo; debate from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Mullen, O&rsquo;Reilly, Harris, Norris, Walsh, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Quinn, Hanafin, Coffey, Bacik and John Paul Phelan expressed serious views and concerns regarding stem cell research and the decision taken in University College Cork yesterday.  I have no difficulty in arranging for a debate on that matter to take place in the House.  I will endeavour that such a debate will take place at earliest possible time and will discuss the arrangements with the leaders of the groups following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Quinn and Hanafin called for a debate on the banking sector.  I have no difficulty in accommodating such a debate.  I said on the Order of Business two weeks ago that I intend to have a debate on the economy, finance and banking at least once a month for the next two or three months in an effort to assist the House.</P>
        <P>I must take on board the points made by Senator Quinn, who has employed hundreds if not thousands of people.  We must be level headed in regard to the challenge we face.  Our country is ideally positioned and far better positioned than many others in regard to the challenges facing us.  I welcome the announcement that interest rates will fall further.  They have fallen by 0.5%  and hopefully they will decrease substantially more in the next two or three months.  That will present an opportunity for the private sector.  I have said in this House that the private sector brought us the Celtic tiger part one and part two.  It will play its part, provided there is a level playing field, to bring us the Celtic tiger part three in three or four years&rsquo; time.</P>

        <P>Senator MacSharry brought to my attention an urgent matter concerning the roll-out of BreastCheck in the north west region and read a statement to the House pertaining to an employee of the HSE.  I will bring this urgent matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention immediately following the Order of Business.  I will inform the House at a later date of her response.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on the 2% betting tax.  That matter can be discussed in the finance debate which I hope to have in the House in the next few weeks.  I join him in welcoming the extra week&rsquo;s Christmas payment for 1.6 million social welfare recipients, which will cost &euro;200 million.</P>

        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for an urgent debate on the Cork to Swansea ferry service.  I have given my commitment on the matter and I hope it can take place in the next two weeks.  He also sought an urgent debate on the fishing industry, which needs to take place by the third week in November.  I will endeavour to have this take place also.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris, Coffey, Buttimer and others expressed their serious concern and, in the case of Senator Harris, his strong views about the reform of the public sector.  This is a serious challenge facing the Government and the nation.  The public sector has played a major part in placing our economy where it is today and assisting everyone in Ireland.  As Senator Quinn pointed out in his contribution, there is a serious challenge with many issues coming to the fore.  Changing circumstances and trends need to be addressed.  With that in mind I intend to have an all-day debate on the economy and all matters pertaining to finance issues, including banking and the public sector.  I will endeavour to have that take place in the next two weeks.</P>
<Col N="834" />
        <P>Senator Norris called for an urgent debate on the Middle East.  I have agreed to have this take place and I hope it will happen in the next few weeks.</P>

	<P>We had a reasonable discussion on this amendment.  It instructs port companies to furnish a statement annually regarding the current or expected number of employees.  The amendment will change the requirement from six months to four months after the end of the financial year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State explained the matter, but we should refresh our memories.  Will the Minister of State outline what information is required on the employees expected to be working at the end of an accounting year?  The second paragraph states: &ldquo;more than 30 of its current full time employees are likely to continue to be so employed full time under contracts of service during the accounting year following that to which the accounts relate&rdquo;.  This provision seems to apply to the large port companies.  Business fluctuates from time to time, as shown in Waterford, for example, where Bell Line collapsed some years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="836" />
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the principle of what the Minister of State is trying to achieve, but will he explain the position concerning the average number of employees?  It is a time of employment uncertainty.  There is substantial business occurring at Dublin Port, Cork Port and other large ports, which I hope will remain the case, but a number of ports are marginal.  The amendment is a big ask, so to speak, although I have no difficulty with the requirement to make a statement within a certain period.</P>
        <P>I presume that the contracts referred to in the amendment, which states &ldquo;of the average number of employees that are expected to be employed during the accounting year under contracts of service following that to which the accounts relate&rdquo;, are contracts of service directly linked to the port authority concerned.  The second proposed paragraph states &ldquo;that more than 30 of its current full time employees are likely to continue to be so employed full time under contracts of service during the accounting year following that to which the accounts relate&rdquo;.  Irrespective of whether the port is at Waterford, New Ross or so on, will the Minister of State clarify what will be required in a case involving fewer than 30 full-time employees?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At Kinsale in Cork, stevedores are employed from time to time as grain or timber boats come in.  They might work day and night for three days but, due to bad weather or market fluctuations, there might be a sos in which nothing would occur for three or four weeks.  I accept that Kinsale is not a commercial port in the same respect, but my concern relates to the situation in which fewer than 30 individuals are employed full-time in any given year.  Is the statement a statement of intent?  Is it suggested that port companies must guarantee the situation in the chairperson&rsquo;s report?  I do not have a problem with the provision, but is it for the chairperson to declare whether his or her company will have a good year with more than 30 full-time employees or whether there will be fewer than 30 such workers because the outlook is poor owing to the shaky economy and problems at global, national and local level?  What would be the situation were only 18 people working full-time at the port company at the end of the year?  Will the Minister of State enlighten me?</P>
        <P>I do not have an issue with the Government amendment but I am puzzled by the inclusion of specific numbers.  What would be the situation were the commercial enterprise of a port to contract in such a way as to lead to a loss of employment?  It can occur.  For many years, my brother-in-law worked at Bell Line in Waterford in such a situation.  All of a sudden, a reputable company left the port with the loss of 50 or 60 jobs.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position in this scenario?  I apologise if I spoke before my good colleague, Senator Cummins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s comments on board.  I also seek clarification on the issue of casual labour at Fenit.  Similar casual labour occurs in most commercial ports in that people can work on a weekly or monthly basis to deal with, for example, timber and other bulk products.  Will such people be classified as workers of the port authority or as various employees of the various stevedores operating in the ports?  While it is temporary employment, they are constantly being called in if and when required.  Can casual employees be reckoned as port employees, especially in terms of voting?  While voting relates to the number of employees mentioned in annual reports and so on, how will casual labourers be classified &mdash; as port employees or stevedore employees &mdash; and will they have a vote?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank Members for their comments, they are reading something into the provision that is not there.  The amendment has been proposed so that the number of full-time employees working at or expected to work at the port can be known for the purpose of worker director elections.  If the amendments are passed, a worker director must be elected to the board if there are more than 30 workers.  If there are fewer than 30 workers, the worker <Col N="837" />director will be nominated or recommended to the Minister for appointment.  The amendments are being made so that there will be no last-minute arguments whether there are 29 or 31 workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will casual workers be included?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  We are discussing full-time workers directly employed by the port, not subcontracted employees.  The amendments set out the different methods to elect or nominate the worker director, namely, an election if there are more than 30 workers or a nomination or an appointment if there are fewer than 30 workers.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, line 49, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>).</P>
        <P FLI="0">We addressed this issue under section 8.  At the risk of repeating myself, this section deals with local authority members.  Reducing from three to one the number of local authority members on the boards of port authorities, with the consequent loss of their local and business knowledge, is a retrograde step for all concerned.  The Minister has stated that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; appoint a local authority member to the boards.  If he had said he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do so, we could at least be certain of there being one local authority member.  As it stands, however, all we have is a statement from the Minister that he may appoint one.  This is unacceptable.  I have referred to my experience of being a member of one of these boards and, prior to the establishment of the commercial port companies, a harbour commissioner.  The knowledge imparted by local authority members to the former harbour commissioners and to the boards of port companies is second to none.</P>
        <P>It seems, however, members of local authorities, even where their relevant knowledge and business experience make them ideal candidates, may be debarred from membership of the boards.  Why debar those in whom people have placed their trust to represent them?  We have had reports from nameless officials claiming that local authority members should be cut from these boards.  What is the reason for this?  Is it that local authority members ask the awkward questions?  Is it that they always attend meetings of the board?  I see no reason for the proposed exclusion other than a vindictiveness towards those who are elected by their peers to local government.  This is a feature not only of this Bill but of several others in recent years.  What is the agenda?  I have seen areas where the accommodation of vested interests has been to the detriment of the proper running of port authorities.  I see no reason, however, for the exclusion of local authority members elected by the public.</P>
        <P>I referred last week to Waterford Port, where there are three local government representatives, comprising one from the city council, one from Waterford County Council and one from Kilkenny County Council, where the majority of the port is now situated.  Which of these representatives will be retained if there is to be only one local government member?  The Minister referred to the possibility of some type of rotational system, but there is no legislation to facilitate that.  Until such time as the relevant measures are included in this Bill, I and my party cannot support the exclusion of local authority members.</P>
<Col N="838" />
        <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to retain local authority membership of the boards of port companies.  Those members have acted in the best interests of the public and the ports since the port companies came into being.  They should be allowed to continue that excellent representation.  Irrespective of what reports are produced by whatever so-called experts, I disagree totally that local authority membership should be reduced.</P>

	<P>We debated at length last week the merits and demerits of this proposal.  I will not reiterate them now other than to urge the Minister to consider our perspective.  We are arguing for the retention of local authority membership on the boards of port companies.  They have been elected to their positions, they provide a vital connection to local democracy and they bring a certain expertise.  I am mindful of the time we have already spent debating this issue.  I intend to seek a vote on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>We covered much of the ground on this issue on the last occasion.  I agree that local authority members have served port companies in good stead over the years.  The make-up of most harbour boards comprises a cross-section of community involvement.  For example, of the 11 members of the board of Bantry Port, two are from the county council, usually from the local electoral area containing the port, and two are from the town council, thus providing an extra layer of local democracy.  The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland would usually select two members, as would the Irish Ports Association.  The Minister selects three appointees to the board in respect of which there sometimes have been accusations of cronyism and so on.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s appointees had to include a trade union member, who would be unlikely to be a member of my party.  Therefore, the make-up of the boards was tightly constrained.  I was pleased at one point in my political career to be appointed to the board of Bantry Harbour.  I regretted having to resign in 2004, with the ending of the dual mandate, because I enjoyed my time on the board.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister outline the financial savings to be made from the proposals set out in the Bill?  The large commercial port companies have their own arrangement and are normally separate legal entities with a degree of independence.  I made the point already and do not wish to do so <i>ad infinitum</i> that the proposal that Cork Harbour should take over Bantry Port represents a shotgun wedding which may not work out.  We could end up with an undemocratic situation where Bantry Port would at most have one representative, even though it is located 60 or 70 miles from Cork.  In the case of Rosslare and New Ross, for example, Drogheda and Dublin or even Waterford and Dublin, the distance would be much less than in the case of Cork and Bantry.  I fail to see the logic of this proposal.  When I entered politics in 1985 we had local health committees and a Southern Health Board.  The Health Service Executive now wants to revert to having local regionalised offices in places like the Cork-Kerry region.  It has learned from its mistakes and will in this regard be making a U-turn on policy grounds.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Bill provides that the Minister will have the power to consult recognised trade unions and so on.  However, I have grave concerns in regard to this issue, which has been debated at length.  I believe little saving will be gained from this proposal.  Historically, local public representatives have had their finger on the pulse, be that in respect of Shannon-Foynes, Fenit, Bantry or Dingle.  We are being denuded of local democracy and I am not sure this is good.  We should remember the reason some of the harbour boards were set up.  I am speaking in this regard of the role of public representatives and others on these boards.</P>
        <P>Many people do not know the reason Bantry harbour board was set up.  In the 1970s, there were three or four major oil spillages, some of which were the worst in the world, with enormous ecological and environmental impacts.  One can imagine the severity of world focus if <Col N="839" />this happened in 2008.  Following these events the then Minister, former Deputy Peter Barry, established the Bantry Harbour Board to take control of the situation.  I referred earlier to the various bodies represented on that board.  Even though the board had been established, it took the catalyst of the Costello report, arising from the Whiddy Island disaster, on which I will speak at some length later, to give it teeth.  This did not happen until the early or mid-1990s and the matter had been left languishing for some time.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">The cost of local authority members on these boards is minuscule.  The experience, wisdom and local knowledge lost as a result of this proposal will be immense.  I will give an example, which may be parochial to my colleague opposite, Senator Paddy Burke.  A port authority or harbour board comprising local and town councillors, trade union representatives and chambers of commerce, be it from Westport or wherever is the most local region, might have prevented the shenanigans and drawn-out, difficult scenes in north Mayo in regard to Shell to Sea &mdash; I do not wish to take sides in the matter.  I strongly believe that local and trade union representation is important.  Perhaps we are seeing in this Bill a new policy direction in respect of local authority members.  They are being told, &ldquo;Lie down, Fido, stay under the table and do not bark.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We represent councillors and local authority members and our voices should be heard.  I am in the difficult situation of being a Member on the Government side.  However, I want to be heard and to put on record my disillusionment, disappointment and dismay at the approach being taken in this area.  I believe we are being power foolish and penny wise.  Historically, local authority members have served us well and that has not been acknowledged in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister of State will acknowledge the tremendous work done by many town, county and city councillors down through the years.  They have made an enormous contribution to port companies and marine life in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment moved by Senator Cummins and supported by Senator McCarthy and I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to accept it.  Senator Cummins outlined the amendment in detail and made a great case for the retention of councillors on boards.  I have been a public representative for many years and I have noted during that time something that all politicians, be they local or national public representatives, have in common, namely, their vested interest in the greater good.  This cannot be said of all segments of society.  Unions have vested interests but their vested interests are in respect of their employees, particular groups and so on.  By and large, the vested interest of local and national politicians is in the greater good.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Bill contains a proposal which seeks to reduce the number of representatives that may be appointed to boards.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan mentioned that when he first entered politics we had local health committees.  I served as a member of a local health committee, the remit of which was countrywide and membership of which was made up of dentists, doctors and local politicians.  The CEO for the health board region was accountable to the local health committee and was required to attend a meeting of the committee each month.  He was also accountable to the board of the regional health board.  These meetings were open and transparent and public representatives made an enormous contribution to them.  They have made an enormous contribution to all the boards of which they have been members.</P>
        <P>Whether we like it, public representatives must go before the public every five years.  They are vetted by the public and are not re-elected if people believe they are not doing a good job.  This Bill seeks to remove accountability from the process.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board the comments made by various Senators and to accept the amendment put forward by Senator Cummins.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was touched on previously.  A couple of expert reports produced during the past seven or eight years have recommended that local authority members <Col N="840" />do not serve on the boards of commercial port companies.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan spoke about harbour commissioners rather than commercial ports.  It is true that the boards of both were in the past made up of a broad spectrum of groups and various interests.  However, life has moved on and that is no longer the case in respect of the ten commercial ports. </P>
        <P>Commercial State port companies have changed since the introduction of the Harbours Act 1996, as has the industry which has opened up.  Major organisational and cultural changes have taken place.  The position taken in the Department of Transport is that, for good or bad, port companies are now the only commercial State companies that have councillors on their boards.  I am not attacking councillors.  If Senator O&rsquo;Donovan wants me to say that councillors do much committed work around the country, I will not disagree with that as a public representative.  I was a councillor for many years and councillors do great work.  They are telling all of us they are busier than ever and that may or may not be true.  I do not want to get into the argument of how councillors were taken off health boards as I am not necessarily saying that was the right decision.  These are two different issues.  Councillors on health boards did much good work and, for example, they asked questions and got answers for simple matters rather than getting strategy statements all the time.</P>
        <P>The fundamental difference between this and the HSE or anywhere else is we are talking about commercial State companies.  The remit and purpose has changed and we are bringing the numbers of board members down from 12 to eight in order to have tighter and more focused groups dealing with the job at hand of managing and running a State commercial organisation.  That is where the change has come about.</P>
        <P>There has been an evolution of the old harbour commissioners and they are now commercial State companies.  That is the reason the change has been made.  In the Department of Transport we would equate them to airport authorities and there are no councillors on Dublin Airport Authority, Shannon Airport Authority or in Cork.  We are bringing the port companies into line with what is happening elsewhere in other commercial State companies.  This is the yardstick and target and it is what we are trying to do.  It is on such a basis we recommend this change.</P>
        <P>It is the intention that one of the statutory appointees will be a councillor.</P>

We do not believe councillors should be involved with the ports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one point for clarification.  The Minister of State indicated the Minister made a political commitment in this respect.  Is it possible for this commitment to be included in the Bill on Report Stage?  If the Minister has indicated it is his intention to <Col N="841" />appoint a local authority member, it should at least have some specific mention in the Bill rather than being a political commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We know what political commitments are.  If it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to have a councillor involved in this way, the provision should be in the Bill and the Minister should introduce it on Report Stage.  I will not labour the point further but I hope to see this political commitment included in the Bill through a Government amendment on Report Stage.  Otherwise, we will treat the political commitment the same way as many others which have gone down the swanny over the past 18 months, especially since the budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The public is not very confident of political commitments and neither am I.  I would accept the bona fides of the Minister in this regard if he included an appropriate Government amendment on Report Stage to allay the fears of all of us who spoke in favour of local authority membership on the boards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the intention to include such a provision in the Bill.  I will see what guarantee can be made or how we can firm up what we are saying to help the Senator believe our commitment.  I can reflect on the Senator&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</P>
        <P>Somebody mentioned this would not save money but it is not being done to do so.  The money saved would neither be here nor there.  It is being done for the reasons previously outlined and is nothing to do with saving money as the money saved, if any, would not be relevant or significant.  It is being done to have a smaller and more focused board which is entirely concentrated on the job at hand, running the commercial organisation.</P>

	<P>Consultation is central to several of the amendments I have tabled.  As I noted earlier, I was a member of the Bantry harbour board for several years.  Consultation is critical at all stages.  Since I last spoke on this Bill, I held a refresher meeting with members of the board.  Notwithstanding the grievances I have raised in the House, they wanted to express their gratitude to the staff of the Department of Transport for their ongoing co-operation on a variety of issues.  I say this because, even though I am a former member, I represent a wider arena than the Bantry harbour board, which enjoys a good working relationship with certain personnel who shall remain nameless.</P>
        <P>The bone on which I wish to chew pertains to the lack of consultation regarding some of the provisions contained in section 18.  Commitments were made by two, if not three, senior Ministers and a number of junior Ministers, most of whom were members of my party, to consult the Bantry harbour board before proceeding with the proposed amalgamation with the Port of Cork.  In effect, however, no consultations took place.  The board was asked to proceed with due diligence and it co-operated with the Port of Cork and the Department.  This process is close to completion, although several issues have arisen.</P>
      
        <P>I wish to speak about the history of Bantry.  In my younger days, Bantry was primarily a fishing port.  Census figures from the turn of the 20th century indicate that more than 2,000 people were employed in the fishing industry.  That changed when, in bad weather, 30 or 40 big Spanish fishing trawlers would come in to seek shelter.  This transferred to Castletownbere, which is now a sea fishing port and protected from the situation referred to here.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I refer to the lack of consultation from the point when Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners was set up.  The catalyst for setting up the board was the three major oil spills, one of which was especially devastating and which took place on 22 October 1974.  I started work as a student the following day, on 23 October, on the clean-up operation.  Hundreds of people helped to clean it up.  It was a major operation.  There were lawsuits and other problems with it.  Politically, if it were to happen now, with the advent of Sky, CNN, international focus and e-mail, it would be a worldwide phenomenon.  There was potential for major damage, contributing to environmental and ecological problems.  Mistakes were made and thousands of tonnes of crude oil were let flow into the bay.</P>
        <P>The coalition in power between 1973 and 1977 was forced into action.  The then Minister, Peter Barry, visited a few times and realised that something had to be done.  Regulation and rules pertaining to Bantry were not appropriate.  At the time, the international company, Gulf Oil, was a law unto itself.  It was a major international conglomerate and basically did what it pleased.  Nobody other than Cork Port had any interest.  The matter crossed several Departments because there were fishing issues.  The damage these oil spills caused acted as a catalyst to set up the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.</P>
        <P>I refer to consultation, which was necessary at the time and took place with Cork County Council.  The council initially set up a harbour board that was toothless.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am still talking about consultation, an issue critical to section 18.  The section refers to the transfer of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and Tralee and <Col N="844" />Fenit Pier Harbour Commissioners, etc. which is my major difficulty.  There is a harbour in Bantry that it is proposed will be transferred and amalgamated with Cork Port.  Amendment No. 7 refers to consultation, which is the critical axe to grind on this issue.  If consultation were to take place, certain issues might be ironed out.  There is great concern locally that this legislation will be enacted without prior consultation, although such consultation has been promised several times.  All politics is local.</P>
        <P>I have no axe to grind with the Port of Cork Company with which I had discussions recently on the Cork-Swansea ferry issue.  Its representatives were very forthcoming and there is a good working relationship between Cork Port and Bantry regarding Whiddy Island and other issues.  While this may be acknowledged, the cordial relationship does not mean that one port must succumb under legislation to a takeover by another port.  It is a matter of consultation.  I do not want to labour the issue too long but I ask the Minister of State if there was consultation with Tralee and Fenit Pier Harbour Commissioners regarding amalgamation with Shannon Foynes Port Company.  Was it premature?  We have been talking about how Bantry Bay harbour might evolve and develop for many years.  Consultation is critical.</P>
        <P>The amendment was tabled by Senator Donohoe.  Hitherto, there has been a lack of consultation.  We see the demise of the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and the elected representatives who were on the board.  This is wrong.  There may have been a possibility of <i>quid pro quo</i> if the matter had been approached correctly.  When referring to consultation or the lack of it, I am considering a valuable asset in the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners and the port and the transfer of its autonomy to the Port of Cork Company.</P>
        <P>Seven or eight reports over the years touched on the Bantry situation, among others, and the thinking process and policy that was prevalent until 1994 rightfully suggested that this should take place, with or without consultation.  Bantry Bay harbour board was a lame duck, with no powers, no way of raising revenue and no teeth.  It was little more than a talking shop.  Over time, spurred on by certain recommendations of the Costello report arising from the Whiddy disaster, which involved consultation between the Department with responsibility for fisheries and various ports, great powers were given to Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  Because of its capacity, which is limited in international or international terms, Bantry has emerged as a leading light as a small port.  In the past 12 years, bar one, it has made a financial profit and carried out important functions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Whiddy Island.</P>
        <P>I cannot but expand somewhat on the issue of consultation.  Some think of Bantry as Whiddy Island but there are diverse activities in the Bantry Bay and port area.  There is a limited amount of marine tourism, the well-known Whiddy Island terminal, Whiddy islanders, inshore fishermen and aquaculture people.  Has there been consultation with all these people?  People may ask why there should be but what bugs me is that Bantry has been designated as a tourist hub in the past year.  This has significance because F&aacute;ilte Ireland, through the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, has decided that Bantry has significant tourism related activity within the harbour.  One hopes much money will be spent in the general area.  Major problems exist with the port.  Some are basic, such as the extension of the pier and dredging.  The Chair may think I am wandering but I am touching on the provisions of section 18.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with the provisions in section 18.  There has been no consultation with many of those involved.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether there has been consultation on this section, or on the Bill, with Cork County Council which owns the pier in Bantry?  The harbour board owns the railway pier which it purchased at market value from Bantry Town Council.  Have the harbour board and Bantry Town Council been consulted or do they need to be consulted?  Perhaps I am missing the point.  While the harbour board has an excellent working relationship with Cork County Council and the Department, it complained vigorously <Col N="845" />that there was no proper consultation on the aspects of the Bill that affect its port.  It is very exercised about that issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One might ask why consult Bantry Town Council.  There was a railway to Bantry until 1963 &mdash; I have vivid memories of seeing it as a child.  The railway pier was eventually handed over by CIE to the town council in good faith.  For many years the railway pier was not used, although it was very much used in the days when the railway went to Bantry.  Eventually Bantry Harbour Board decided to purchase the railway pier for what was then termed &ldquo;the market value&rdquo;.  It also purchased foreshore rights and so on.  That is an asset we now have.  I presume the board got the Department&rsquo;s support and <i>imprimatur</i> in doing that.  It is important from a development point of view that the town council does not own one pier while Cork County Council owns another one.  The Earl of Bantry owned the foreshore rights.  Were these bodies consulted?  It is unusual that Cork County Council owns the main pier and has responsibility for its upkeep and so on.</P>
        <P>Was the Central Fisheries Board consulted?  It has traditional rights in Bantry Harbour.  A case was taken by somebody to stop some development because, in the past, he had rights to mend nets in certain sections of the inner harbour.</P>
        <P>Was there consultation with the people living on Whiddy Island?  I know it is a small island with not too many inhabitants.  The Minister of State might enlighten me as to whether there is a need for consultation.  The Costello report was critical.  It was an excellent report arising from an unfortunate tragedy and it cost the taxpayer &euro;500,000.  Another report, which is due, will probably cost the taxpayer, directly or indirectly, over &euro;1 billion.  Some 50 lives were lost in the Whiddy Island tragedy.</P>
        <P>I am concerned for the people living on Whiddy Island.  Not too long ago an elderly woman fell on the island and broke her leg.  Usually when that happens, one calls an ambulance, which drives up to one&rsquo;s door, and one is taken away.  However, there is no access for an ambulance on Whiddy Island.  Eventually, the woman was put on a stretcher and put on a boat.  It was low tide when they got to Bantry and she had to be carried across five boats, which was degrading.  That happened five or seven years ago and I was appalled.</P>
        <P>If there was another disaster on Whiddy Island, how would we get on?  For a number of years the airstrip in Bantry has been used to transport vehicles to and from the island.  It is not the most ideal scenario but it works.  In an emergency, there is no barge on stand-by to take a fire tenderer, an ambulance or a doctor to the island.</P>
        <P>One cannot lose sight of the fact that islanders have rights.  Perhaps in this instance one might say they should not be consulted, that Bantry Harbour Board was set up under a certain Act and that we, as legislators, should ignore everyone and do what is right, convenient and so on, but I have a different view.  The local authority also bought houses on the island.</P>
        <P>Bantry Harbour Board recently completed a landing facility on Whiddy Island with the help and support of the Department, which I went to see.  The board also owns some property on the island, and not before time.  A slipway was constructed at a cost of less than &euro;1 million, although I am open to correction.  This is a wonderful development.  I believe the Minister of State visited recently to inspect and open it.  This is all about consultation.</P>
        <P>On the shore side, adjacent to the Abbey cemetery on Whiddy Island, a link is proposed.  There is no point having a lovely slipway on the island if when one reaches the shore, one cannot get off.  This roll on-roll off possibility is fantastic and I hope it can proceed.  Planning has been received and foreshore rights have been obtained.  These are positive developments where consultation is important.</P>
<Col N="846" />
        <P>If this Bill is passed, people will say it might not be implemented for four or five years but I hope it is implemented in my lifetime.  In regard to section 18 coming into play &mdash; Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s amendment No. 7 refers to it &mdash; I have grave reservations that the appropriate consultation has not taken place.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the size of Bantry Bay.  There is a multi-million euro aquaculture industry in Bantry Bay.  Many hectares of water are licensed for the purpose of mussel line development and there are salmon cages out by Eyries and more closer to Bere Island, which are within the Bantry Bay remit, if my geography is correct.  Has the aquaculture industry been consulted?  I raised this with some people involved in aquaculture who told me they have serious concerns</P>
        <P>I refer to the handing over of Bantry Bay and Bantry Harbour as proposed in this Bill.  I say to the Minister of State, with the greatest respect, that it is not only about the Whiddy Island situation.  There is Whiddy Island and Whitegate, and perhaps it would make much sense for them to form a team and that the commercial aspects would be monitored by Cork port.</P>
        <P>There are many ancillary operations around the bay.  On Whiddy Island, licences have been granted for the development and growth of scallop farming.  In the inner harbour in Bantry, people dig for welks.  People have traditional rights and would have us in the High Court in the morning if we interfered with those rights in any way.  I am not saying we will interfere with their rights, but have they been consulted?  When in season, people dig a bucket of clams or periwinkles and make a few bob.</P>
        <P>The Cork Harbour and Port Authority is a huge commercial set-up and Bantry is a hybrid of different developments in aquaculture and tourism.  The development of Bantry Bay as a purely commercial port will never stand.  I have always argued that one must allow for Whiddy Island and commercial activity, which has survived together despite some difficulties.  Aquaculture and inshore fishing have survived.  Many people still fish extensively for shrimp in the inner harbour and around Whiddy Island.  They also fish for lobster.  Despite the ban on drift net fishing, draft net fishing is still intact for the estuary of the River Wad.</P>
        <P>As a representative of this area I am concerned that we are proceeding with this legislation.  I have tabled amendments on transferring Bantry, and I return to the whole area of consultation.  I have the utmost respect for the Minister of State but I urge him to park the Bill after today and, as a gesture of goodwill, the Minister of State or the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, should meet the relevant port authority and perhaps a county manager for west Cork or the town council to consult on this issue as we are dealing with consultation under section 7.</P>
        <P>This is a political, not a departmental, matter.  On Bantry Harbour Board there are two or three county councillors and two town councillors, a trade union representative and representatives of the port association as well as three nominees of the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor.  I presume the board members were governed by the 1946 Act.  Without affecting the thrust of the Bill, would there be merit in such consultation taking place?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was at three or four meetings, in Dublin and Bantry, where Ministers and Ministers of State gave clear commitments.  The issue of publishing or tabling legislation suggesting Bantry Bay Harbour would be taken over by Cork was raised.  That political commitment has not been honoured.  I know members of the Cork Port company who have expressed the view that they are surprised &mdash; I will not name them &mdash; at the shotgun approach taken here.  The approach seems to be shoot first and ask questions afterwards.  That is not good enough.  We need to sit back from the brink on this and deal with some of the issues concerning Bantry.</P>
<Col N="847" />
        <P>It all comes down to consultation, or the lack of it.  As far as I am aware, the chief executive of Cork Port and the chairman of Bantry Port have not had meaningful negotiations on this issue.  That is similar to the Government, when the discussions on Northern Ireland were taking place, saying it would make a declaration and promulgate that Northern Ireland, as a unit, would be gone and a new free state or republic would be declared.  If that happened there would be outright war.  Sensitive negotiations took place.  We have not gone beyond the point of redemption.</P>
        <P>Bantry Bay is the second finest bay in the world.  It has huge potential and we should not denude the people in the greater Bantry area who use the port for leisure, pleasure, fishing, tourism in Garnish Island, yachting and other marine activities.  There has been a lack of consultation.  I am speaking <i>ad nauseam</i> on this section of the Bill, but I feel strongly about it.  Senator Donohoe also mentioned this point.</P>
        <P>I do not know what is right or wrong with consultation.  This issue has been before the people in Bantry and the harbour board for many years.  It has also been before the council.  I spent many lengthy nights discussing participation by local authority members.  One meeting, debating the future of Bantry, ran from 6.30 p.m. until 1.30 a.m.  The possibility of Cork Port taking us over was discussed and we voted 11-0 that that should not take place.  Some of those members have now left.</P>
        <P>There was a proposal that Cork County Council should take us over and I held the minority view that that should be the case.  The vote was 9-2.  I understood the debate.  I have my reasons, one of which is that the then county manager gave a commitment that if Cork County Council took us over it would spend &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million on the harbour development.  That should not be sneered at.  We seem to have walked away from that.</P>
        <P>Another issue is that of corporatisation.  We want, like other larger ports, such as Cork, Foynes, Dundalk and New Ross, to set up a company and stand on our own two feet.  There was strong consultation on this and I was to the fore, particularly with the Department and the then Minister in the lead-up to the 2002 general election.  We came within 48 hours of Bantry Port being corporatised, and were it not for a technical problem in Bantry that would have been done.  The principle was agreed, but we seem to have rolled back from that.</P>
        <P>Corporatisation has its own problems.  If one becomes a corporate entity, one must stand on one&rsquo;s own two feet and not go to the Department or the Minister with the begging bowl.  One cannot lightly brush aside the democratic view of elected or appointed people on boards.  I am very worried that the consultation process has been less than transparent and adequate as far as Bantry is concerned.  Perhaps that has been politically driven, but if something is not broken, why go to the trouble of fixing it?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes that, in addition to severe cuts in allowances for young persons with disabilities, the recent Budget Statement contains a significant number of measures affecting children with disabilities;</P>
        <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann further notes that children with disabilities are more prone to hospital visits and therefore are likely to be disproportionately affected by the increase in accident and emergency charges, the increase in hospital bed fees and increases in medical insurance costs;</P>
<Col N="848" />
        <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann believes that it is essential that children with disabilities have access to mainstream education for as long as possible and that in this regard, class size is an essential ingredient of success for both the teacher and student.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann further believes that the increase in permitted class size from 27 to 28 per teacher will adversely affect every child&rsquo;s education, but most especially those with disabilities;</P>
        <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann deplores the deferring of implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act, together with the 1% cut in funding for voluntary disability bodies which comes on top of an already implemented 1% cut to the same organisations by the Health Service Executive; and accordingly Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to reverse these unacceptable cuts forthwith.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to the House and thank him for coming to listen to the important contribution our party will make to the debate on this motion.</P>
        <P>There is a realisation throughout Ireland about what exactly the budget announced recently will mean.  Its true effects will not be felt until January and will continue to be felt for quite some time thereafter.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s motion is not about refusing to face up to economic reality; it is about the Government&rsquo;s failure to face the truth about our economy.  When there were countless revenue streams that could have been tapped to address the growing budget deficit, the Government instead decided to increase household costs and to slash services.  While the external causes of inflation are easing, the budget has caused hyperinflation in the cost of rearing children.  There will be increases in health care charges and decreases in allowances and eligibility.  Parents are being asked to pay more for less, especially for their children&rsquo;s education.  The budget silences one piece of Government rhetoric for the rest of its term &mdash; however long that will be, none of us knows.  No longer will we hear about going forward because the budget is about going back.</P>
        <P>Despite the Government&rsquo;s claim to be fostering a knowledge economy, it has spared no-one when it comes to education.  Third level students who were to be the immediate drivers of our economic growth have been targeted through increased costs.  Second level pupils, who are due to enter the workforce throughout the next decade, now face bigger classes with fewer resources and the high possibility of being sent home because of loss of substitute teachers.  Perhaps the worst affected of all are primary and preschool children.  The Government has obviously decided the smaller the person the bigger the target.  Those with special needs are the biggest target of all.</P>
        <P>One of the many thousands of four year olds to be victimised by this malicious budget is the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act.  This Act of 2004 was to give every child with special needs a statutory entitlement to an individual education plan, but the Minster for Education and Science has now decided to scrap it.  How will autistic children get the tailored education plan that will help them participate fully in society in the years to come?  The Minister for Education and Science will tell us that he will implement the Act sometime, but when it comes to rights for the disadvantaged, the track record of this Government is that it will never be implemented.</P>
        <P>I want to pose a question to the Government parties on behalf of those who will be hit hardest by their lack of foresight and fortitude.  What have they done to deserve this?  Parents, especially those with special needs children, are asking that and other questions.  For instance, how will children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome get the attention they need at school when class sizes are to increase and their hours with special needs assistants are to be cut?  Why are these <Col N="849" />children being targeted when what they need most is a teacher&rsquo;s patience?  That finding is research-based.  How can teachers give that extra help with the added pressures they are soon to face, bearing in mind that they are already under pressure?  What about the requirements of preschool children with special needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds?  I know many of those, as I am sure does everybody else.  What are they to do now that the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education has been abolished?  That centre did great work, especially in my constituency and it is well recognised that the developing models for helping children with special educational needs were excellent.  What did these tots do to deserve having their chance of a fulfilling life being put at risk?  Parents are asking what they have done to deserve this.</P>
        <P>My inbox is full, as I am sure are those of other Members, of angry e-mails from parents explaining the effects of these cuts at the coalface.  One in particular I received is from an adult who had unrecognised learning difficulties in childhood.  Tellingly, she wrote that her problems started in infancy.  I received another e-mail from a parent who moved her dyslexic son to a school that provided special reading classes and his reading improved greatly after a year at that school.  She is now seriously concerned that his achievements will fall back.  It looks like his chance may have been stolen from him, which is a great pity.</P>
        <P>Is it any wonder the Government abolished the educational disadvantage committee that advised it to reduce class sizes?  The Government has admitted in the budget that it is not being fair to children because it has abolished the giving children an even break programme.  The budget has filleted the programme for Government published only a year ago.  It promised 350 extra language support teachers and instead schools will lose some of those teachers.  Immigrants who have contributed to our economy through their taxes and all that goes with it will have to watch on in despair as their children struggle in oversized classes to even understand, much less keep up.</P>
        <P>I received correspondence from a teacher advising me her school will lose three English support teachers, leaving just two to cater for the needs of almost 100 children for whom English is not their first language.  What have the parents of those 100 children done to deserve this?  These parents are not the ones who did not know how to do their job and therefore appointed giant unaccountable bureaucracies to do it for them.  They do not have the luxury of passing on responsibility, but soon they will have the expense.  These mothers, fathers and guardians, who built their lives around their children, are paying for the irresponsibility of those who built their lives around their bank balance.</P>
        <P>That is what the budget is really about &mdash; defending the privileged at the expense of the vulnerable.  The Government criticises those who want these cuts reversed.  It believes our economic interest is served by creating disadvantage and worsening our educational system.  Labour disagrees.  We say that investment in a good and inclusive education system is a down payment on our future economic success.  While the Green Party used to agree with us, it no longer does or at least its leadership does not.  These cuts will create higher drop-out rates, increase disadvantage and damage our competitiveness.  However, this coalition thinks the same short-term thinking that got us into this mess will get us out of it.  When it comes to the economy, it is the Government that needs an education.</P>
        <P>I have just read with interest the Government amendment.  I note the Government is congratulating itself and commends the significant increase in the number of therapy professionals employed by the HSE in recent years in areas such as speech, language and occupational therapies, physiotherapy, and psychology who deliver services to those in need.  In the boom times I had the most horrendous job to get a special needs assistant for a child with juvenile diabetes.  He was an insulin-dependent diabetic requiring very careful monitoring of his blood-<Col N="850" />sugar levels three times a day.  As he did not have a special needs educational assistant his mother needed to attend the school to administer his insulin after testing his blood-sugar level.  That mother subsequently became pregnant and because of her obstetric history her delivery was required to be by caesarean section, which invalidated her to be covered by insurance subsequent to the delivery and therefore she could not drive.  It went down to the wire of the week in which she was due to deliver before we finally achieved it.  That was in the good times.  I cannot understand the Government commending itself on the significant increase in the number of therapy professionals.  I have requested parliamentary questions to be tabled regarding other cases, the nature of which might identify people.  Therefore I must acknowledge that people have a right to privacy.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is a caring man from my experience of him as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I know he has compassion.  The cutbacks will hurt people greatly.  When this debate is over the parents of children with disabilities, who will be further disadvantaged and shoehorned because of the cuts that are coming down the line, will still go home and need to deal with their disabled children.  They will still need to put those children to bed and get them up at night to be taken to the toilet or given assistance in all the things we as able-bodied people take for granted.  These people cannot speak for themselves.  We need to reconsider what we are doing and I call for support for the Labour Party motion this evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I hope he does not have as difficult a week this week as he has had in the past two weeks.  However, from the telephone calls I have been receiving I somehow doubt it.  This is a very important motion and the Labour Party is proud to bring it before the House.  I am very proud to second it.  The motion is about protecting the most vulnerable in society, our children and particularly those children who, unfortunately, have various forms of disabilities.</P>
        <P>The budget was a sign of things to come.  While the families of these children are facing into a very difficult Christmas, with the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Government and the manner in which it is targeting vulnerable people, my concern is that things will get worse.  I can only laugh at the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.  I can only laugh at its commitments and the way it is back-slapping itself over what it has given in recent years.  However, I will return to that point.</P>
        <P>I will go through the various elements of the budget later.  I must ask why the Government picked on the most vulnerable.  Why did it not consider other forms of revenue that could have been generated through, for example, mortgage interest relief?  It should have considered the multiple tax breaks, private hospitals and various other possible sources of revenue that surely would have been more appropriate than the areas we will itemise today.  Households are being left to pay more for fewer services with the distinct likelihood in many families that less income will be coming in in the first place.  I do not believe Fianna F&aacute;il understands this.  If it did, this shambles of a budget with its 30 cuts would not have been introduced.  Given the manner in which it has done that, it is clear it has fallen completely out of touch with real people&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P>These families will need to pay more for education.  I have spoken to teachers, members of boards of management and parents who cannot understand the Government&rsquo;s decisions in this area.  It is beyond belief that the Government has targeted these children.  In its election manifesto it promised to reduce class sizes from 30:1 in 2002 to 24:1 in 2007.  It has now increased class sizes to 28:1.  I am sure we will see how people feel about that matter later tonight.  We now have the highest class sizes in the EU, which shows the Government is willing to make <Col N="851" />children and their teachers suffer for its complete mismanagement of the economy in recent years.</P>
        <P>Teachers are very upset about this development, which I fully understand.  Teaching is a vocation.  These teachers are dedicated to their children.  They have relationships with them and build trust with them.  In particular those looking after children with special needs do not just feel they are losing their jobs, but through no fault of their own they are letting down those children.  It is not their fault.  It is the Government&rsquo;s fault.  It is certainly not the fault of the teachers who are very dedicated to their jobs.  We in the Labour Party totally abhor these cuts and as Senators will find out tonight we intend to fight them to the end.  The increase in school transport costs was a cynical ploy that slipped in under the radar.  However, as it will affect families with multiple children the cost is coming increasingly to attention.</P>
        <P>Children are also affected by the increases in health care costs at all levels.  Obviously children use health care to a greater degree than other members of society.  Families will experience cuts in tax relief for medical expenses.  Children go to hospital disproportionately to others.  There are increases in accident and emergency unit charges, long-stay charges, hospital bed fees, medical insurance costs etc.  There is one caveat on which I would like some analysis by the Minister of State.  How will the increase in accident and emergency unit charges affect the co-operative medical practices we encourage people to attend rather than clog up accident and emergency departments?  Has evidence been provided to the Government that the charges applied by these co-operatives could increase in parallel with the increase in accident and emergency department charges?  I worry about this.  These families are also being targeted through the social welfare system with child benefit being scrapped for children aged over 18 and the early child care supplement scrapped when children reach 5.5 years.</P>
        <P>The Government has targeted children with disabilities.  Members of my family and I have worked with children with disabilities for a long time and I am passionate about this issue because I abhor what the Government has done.  Children with disabilities should have access to mainstream education for as long as possible and it should be a fundamental right.  They should be kept within the education system for as long as possible in order that they are included as much as possible in society.  Why are they being targeted by reducing the budget for resource teaching?  It is beyond my comprehension.</P>
        <P>The increase in class sizes will disproportionately affect children with disabilities.  I have been approached by schools in my area over the past few weeks.  They are begging parents to keep their children in the schools in order that they can retain resource teachers who contribute so much.  It is scary that in 2008 we have reached this point.  Children with disabilities need more, not less, empowerment and they need to be given an opportunity in life.  I deplore the deferral of the EPSEN Act.  Children need the plans provided for under it at all costs.  Every child requires a customised education plan and the failure to implement this provision must be reversed.  While the Minister for Education and Science has not stated he will defer the Act, the reality is he has not indicated a date for its implementation.  He might come back to the House on that.  The Government needs to state it will honour the implementation of the Act.  Children with disabilities will not acquire the customised education plans nor will they be allowed to participate fully in society unless the Government changes its mind.</P>
        <P>I also deplore the 1% reduction in funding for voluntary disability bodies.  In addition to inflation and the 1% reduction in HSE funding, this will have a drastic impact on them.  Furthermore, I deplore the abolition of the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education.  Will the Minister of State outline in detail how the centre&rsquo;s work will be subsumed, which body will take over and how efficient it will be?</P>
<Col N="852" />
        <P>Most of all, I deplore the changes the Government proposes regarding the allowances for children with disabilities aged between 16 and 18.  This was sneaked in in the budget and it is only receiving the exposure it deserves now.  I recently attended a meeting of North Tipperary Community and Voluntary Association, CAVA, an excellent organisation in my constituency, which also has a disability forum.  I outlined the changes proposed in the budget and this change hit home the most.  Children aged between 16 and 18 whose disabilities restrict them from working are currently paid a weekly allowance of &euro;197, which was increased in the budget to &euro;204 per week for those over 18.  However, the budget raised the age for receipt of the allowance from 16 to 18.  In the meantime, the age limit for the domiciliary care allowance, worth &euro;299 a month, which is paid to families of children with disabilities has been raised to 18.  This masks the reality of a significant negative change in the income of these families annually of almost &euro;7,000.  How is a family meant to survive?  Families used this money to bypass the two-year waiting lists for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and so on and that is why the amendment to the motion is laughable.  There is a two-year waiting list in north Tipperary and half the speech and language posts are vacant.  It is laughable that the Government could table this amendment.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to second the motion and I ask all Members to support it to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society, in particular, children with disabilities.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />commends the significant increase in the number of therapy professionals employed by the HSE in recent years in areas such as Speech and Language and Occupational Therapies, Physiotherapy and Psychology, who deliver services to those most in need;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the commencement of the Disability Act 2005 for children under 5, and the introduction for these children of the right to an independent assessment of the health and educational needs arising from their disability, in recognition of the fact that intervention early in life can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to children with disabilities in Budget 2009, through the provision of an additional &euro;20 million for the further enhancement of health and educational services;</P>
<Col N="853" />
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />commends the announcement that the Government will deliver additional therapy professionals targeted at children of school-going age in 2009, totalling some 125 posts in all service areas including Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Social Work for new and existing multidisciplinary teams;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />recognises, in the context of the current difficult scenario for the public finances, that it is imperative to target provision in the most efficient and effective manner possible to ensure that available resources have optimal impact on the services and supports that are available to those who need them;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />acknowledges major improvements that have been made in special education in recent years, underpinned by a doubling of investment since 2004 to &euro;900 million this year and the provision of approximately 19,000 Teachers and Special Needs Assistants to work solely with children with special needs;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />appreciates that in any area of historic under-provision it takes time to bring services up to the optimum level and supports the Government&rsquo;s determination, in a difficult budgetary environment, to prioritise investment for children with special educational needs by:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am delighted to contribute to the debate on this issue, which concerns us all.  We are public representatives with an obligation to listen to the views of the public and to represent them.  Education of people with disabilities is an issue close to all our hearts.  I will outline the work done in recent years, which cannot go unnoticed.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, who has responsibility for the office for disability and mental health and who exercises additional responsibilities in the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I acknowledge the work he has done since he took up office.  He has been to the fore in addressing the needs of persons with disabilities at Government level.  The new office for disability and mental health brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services, which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues.  The office aims to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of <Col N="854" />people with disabilities and mental health issues, by working to develop person-centred services, focusing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and involving them in their own care.  Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health but much remains to be done.  In particular, there is a need to improve co-ordination and communication across different Departments and agencies in the delivery of services to this client group.  This will be the main focus of the Minister of State, which he has articulated well recently.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy, launched in September 2004, supports and reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities.  The strategy contains a suite of elements, principally the Disability Act 2005, the EPSEN Act 2004&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The strategy also provides for sectoral plans prepared by six Departments during 2006, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and a multiannual disability support investment programme worth &euro;900 million between 2006 and 2009.</P>
        <P>The Disability Act 2005 is one of the central elements of the national disability strategy, which sets out a range of statutory entitlements designed to underscore disabled people&rsquo;s engagement with everyday life.  The emphasis is on mainstreaming as much as is practicable.  Part 2 of the legislation makes provision for the introduction of specific obligations on the health services.  Primary among these are a statutory entitlement to an independent assessment of health and education needs under section 8, a statement of services under section 11, an independent redress and complaints mechanism under section 14 if required and the opportunity to make an appeal to the independent disability appeals officer under section 18.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In case Senator O&rsquo;Toole believes that I have forgotten, I will discuss budget 2009.  The Government reiterated its commitment to people with disabilities by allocating an additional &euro;20 million in the recent budget for health and education services for children with special educational needs.  I acknowledge the input of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, in this respect.  Some &euro;10 million of the allocation will be given to the HSE and &euro;10 million to the Department of Education and Science to enable the services provided for children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.  The &euro;10 million allocated to the HSE will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services, targeted at children of school-going age.</P>
        <P>An additional 90 posts will be provided in the disability services area to include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children&rsquo;s disability services.  There will be 35 additional posts for child and adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers for new and existing multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
<Col N="855" />
        <P>Education is central to every child&rsquo;s opportunities in life and beyond.  While some may not acknowledge it, an additional allocation in the education budget will bring the overall funding to &euro;9.6 billion, an increase of more than 300% since 1997.  This represents an additional &euro;302 million on 2008 figures, a 3.2% increase.  When the Higher Education Authority visited the Houses last week, it acknowledged and welcomed the substantial investment of &euro;581 million in the school capital programme.  We are all fighting for those in our constituencies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and apologise, but I wish to make one point.  Resource teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to meet the needs of children with special educational needs at primary and post-primary levels.  Children will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs and it is important to point out that there are no changes to current policy in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House.  He is the fall guy for the Government, having been rolled out to deal with the medical cards and now he appears here.  For the past two weeks, I have requested that the Minister for Education and Science address this issue in the House.  It is appalling that he has taken time from pupil-teacher contacts by increasing class sizes.</P>
        <P>I am proud of the Labour Party for tabling this Private Members&rsquo; motion and I will gladly support it.  I will focus on the lack of appropriate classroom therapists to support children&rsquo;s education needs, the failure to implement the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the effect of class size increases.  I will do my best in the time allotted to me.</P>
        <P>Having listened to the Senator across the floor, he is out of touch with reality in the classroom.  He is able to commend the Government on everything it claims it is doing, but the reality is different.  The Green Party must be decried for its hypocrisy.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science alongside Deputy Gogarty.  Prior to the last general election, I read the Green Party&rsquo;s manifesto, which referred to reducing class sizes.  We will see how the Green Party Members vote in this House and the Lower House and whether they will put their money where their mouths are.</P>
        <P>There are major failings and collapses in the education of children with special educational needs due to the unavailability of speech therapists, occupational therapists and psychologists to work with teachers and children in schools.  Therapists are supposed to be supplied by the local HSE children&rsquo;s team.  Before I give Fianna F&aacute;il my practical examples, I welcome the teachers from Galway city in the Gallery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>To meet the occupational therapy needs of children at Claddagh national school, it must privately hire and fundraise for a therapist at the rate of &euro;625 per day.  Given that autistic children have severe communication and behavioural needs, the situation is criminal.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is shouting from the back row for this crucial reason.  Both he and I know that until the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is implemented, children&rsquo;s needs will not be met by law.  I would not be surprised were their parents and teachers to bring lawsuits against the Government and the State, which includes the Cathaoirleach, me and every taxpayer.</P>
<Col N="857" />
        <P>We are facing a significant problem.  The Minister of State, who I know from his time on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, has a heart.  The problem lies with the fact that the HSE is the provider of therapy services for schools.  The services should be provided through the Department of Education and Science in the school setting.  This decision must be made and resources should follow the child by right.  Where a child has speech therapy services, for example, critical school time is lost in transporting him or her back and forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have experienced this problem.  My child is undergoing speech therapy.  Since she must travel 12 miles, she loses half of a school day going there and coming back.  We are delighted to have the therapy because without it, she would not learn.  Her speech issue blocks learning.  She is on par as a result of receiving the service, but she is one of the lucky ones.  Many children, perhaps with autism, do not have speech therapy services.  Those services should be provided in a school setting.</P>
        <P>The non-implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is a failure.  In the past week, a Galway city school told me that it received a letter stating that its pupils with special educational needs will have their needs met on a non-statutory basis.  That is a joke.  It means that there will be no service because the SENO, which has become known as the &ldquo;Say No&rdquo;, can say that resources do not allow for it.  The Government is leaving the taxpayer and the State open to lawsuits.</P>
        <P>The management bodies contacted me to tell me that the announcement of the Act&rsquo;s deferral indicates the Government&rsquo;s disregard towards special education.  The importance of the integration of the legislation with that of the Disability Act appears to have been ignored.  Schools will be left without the protection of this legislation when children present with needs defined under the Disability Act.  It is regrettable that the first response of the Government in a financial crisis is to deny the rights of yet another vulnerable group.</P>
        <P>I am pleased Senator Boyle is in the Chamber because his vote will be critical on this issue.  We will soon see whether the Green Party will adhere to its commitment to a reduction in class sizes.  I agree with the Labour Party motion that class size is an essential ingredient for both teachers and students.  Moves to increase class sizes by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats are intensely damaging to all our children and to our nation&rsquo;s future.  They are particularly damaging to children with disabilities.  While there is some provision for dedicated classes, the majority of children with disabilities spend most of their time in mainstream classes with inadequate add-on learning support and resource classes.</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, speaking on &ldquo;Drivetime&rdquo; yesterday about the gains made in education in the past ten years.  His figures are highly suspect because he did not acknowledge growth in population and the decline in education investment as a percentage of gross domestic product.  However, even taking the Minister on good faith, the gains made in the past ten years do not help today&rsquo;s children.  Each child&rsquo;s education is and must be a personal experience for him or her, leading to his or her personal and educational growth, not one based on how others did in previous years.  The record of the past two Government terms is nothing to write home about.  Some 18% to 20% of children drop out before the leaving certificate, indicating significant underachievement at second level.  In 2000, 10% of children left primary school unable to read.  In 2008, 5,000 students failed ordinary level maths in the leaving certificate.  Our levels of proficiency in maths and science are below average on the PISA scales.  Increasing the pupil-teacher ratio from 27 to 28 is merely the thin end of the wedge.</P>
<Col N="858" />
        <P>One of the most awful cutbacks in this budget is the cap on the number of English language support teachers at two per school.  Representatives of Mervue national school, in which 183 foreign national children are enrolled, are in the Gallery today.  Also in the Gallery are representatives of Claddagh national school which has 125 foreign national students.  When it comes to the standardised test results next spring, foreign national children will come in at the bottom of the ladder, pushing native Irish children out of learning support.  This will amount to an incitement to hatred.  With resources being denied to children with special education needs, foreign nationals will be blamed.</P>

	<P>The role of an Opposition in a democracy is essential.  It holds the Government to account and challenges the efficacies of how policies are made and implemented.  When successful, it can show that such policies are rushed or even plain wrong.  When it is truly successful, it can show that those who are making those policies are incompetent and offer an alternative to voters in terms of how another Government may be put in place.  There has been enough evidence in recent weeks to suggest an underperformance in some areas, thus affording the Opposition an opportunity to do its job effectively.</P>

<Col N="859" />
        <P>I do not want to go back too far into history, but I am conscious that when the Opposition presents arguments in this way, it completely revises history.  One of my first experiences as an elected public representative, when I was a city councillor, was my encounter with a woman whose situation was not helped by the policies of the then Government, nor has it been helped since.  The woman&rsquo;s name was Marie O&rsquo;Donoghue.  Her son, Paul, was the mover of a seminal court case relating to the educational rights of people with disabilities in this State.  It went to the highest court in the land and was opposed every inch of the way by a Labour Party Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The experience of people with disabilities and special educational needs is something that shames all of us in the political system.  It is an area in which we continually make mistakes.  I am aware of the irony that given the budgetary context and the decisions that are made, I, as a Government Member, cannot change the situation that Marie O&rsquo;Donoghue and her son now feel themselves to be in.  This case was so seminal that it led to the subsequent Sinnott case which was taken to the Supreme Court in 2001.</P>

It is an issue beyond naked party political point-scoring.  In moving this motion, I would have expected from the Opposition not merely criticism of the Government but also some type of critique which set forth how this can be done differently and better.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected the Opposition parties to outline how they addressed these issues when they were in government and how they propose to deal with them in future if they return to government.  I heard no acknowledgement of responsibility for previous actions.  I heard no vision for future Government participation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On that level, motions of this type are entirely bogus because they do nothing to assist the people who are affected by Government decisions, as they have been and are now, or to show how we should aim to change them.  If there is sincerity in what is being sought in this Private Members&rsquo; motion, we should hear much more about why we have arrived at this stage and the decisions that need to be made in the budgetary context, in a situation where we as a country are spending &euro;37 million of borrowed money every day.  What choices would the Opposition parties make if they were in government?  Would they reduce the amount of money being spent by curbing public expenditure in various ways?  Would they raise taxation in various ways?  A refusal to answer these questions is to play politics with the daily lives of the people they claim to represent in this motion.  This is dishonest politics.  It is unreasonable politics.  It is politics without a heart or soul or any sense of real leadership.  If we are to move forward democratically in these economically challenging times, we need a better sense of politics.</P>

	<P>I will not mind being interrupted if I mislead the House at any stage.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  It is regrettable that he is being put into the bearna bhaoil.  We have heard much that is incorrect. N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag cur i gcoinne an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill.  Caithfidh m&eacute; sc&eacute;al amh&aacute;in a insint.  Nach m&oacute;r bliain &oacute; shin, bh&iacute; orm f&eacute;in agus an iar-Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Gallagher, dul go dt&iacute; an NCSE agus an Aire ag <Col N="860" />iarraidh go gcuirf&iacute; EPSEN ar f&aacute;il do c&uacute;pla leanbh i gceartl&aacute;r d&aacute;ilcheantar an Seanad&oacute;ra.  The Minister of State can check out that story.  I will tell him just how cynical is the information he has given to the House.  I do not blame him for this situation as he was only providing us the information given to him.  Prior to the Minister of State taking up his new portfolio, he and I discussed special educational needs on many occasions down through the years.  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about an appeals process that was put in place.  I will give just one example of how cynical this is as I do not have much time available.  The Education for People with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act requires that children be first assessed by an education psychologist.  The system of assessment must follow a process, a <i>pro forma</i> and deal with items Nos, 1 to 10.  The committee must be established to determine this system.  This is the first stop and it has not yet been done.  The system is put in place and an assessment is arranged with an education psychologist.  The appeals process mentioned by the Minister of State is an appeal in respect of the psychologist&rsquo;s report, which report cannot be written.  This is how cynical the previous Minister was in regard to this measure.  I have spoken about this matter time and again in this House.  However, I do not expect people to remember that.  I could say a great deal on this matter, which is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>Despite what the previous speaker said &mdash; I do not consider myself as the Opposition; I am an Independent &mdash; I visited schools in Navan, Monaghan, Cork, Clonmel and other places to explain to teachers all that is good about the EPSEN Act.  I believed, and still believe, it is a superb proposal.  It is the Act I would write myself if I got the chance.  However, as Senator Prendergast said, the Act remains on a shelf and its implementation is being further deferred, which is disgraceful.  I do not have time to speak further on that issue.</P>
        <P>In terms of what is going on and in response to Senator Dan Boyle&rsquo;s question in regard to what the Opposition would do &mdash; the Minister of State can quote me on this to Government &mdash;  I could sit down on my own, or with John Carr beside me, with the Minister for Education and Science and his officials and in half an hour give them all the cuts they want within the education budget as it stands in a budget-neutral way that would not affect class size, substitution cover or the high profile issues that will destroy schools i gceartl&aacute;r d&aacute;ilcheantar an Seanad&oacute;ra.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht inn&eacute; le ionada&iacute; as eagras na scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Seanad&oacute;ir dul ag caint leo.<b>  </b>They are appalled at how this proposal will affect small gaeltacht schools.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, having devastated the primary education system with a budget on which there was no consultation and having then left for China, stated we will approach this issue in partnership.  Despite what Senator Boyle said, the education partners and Fine Gael &mdash; though I did not agree with its proposals &mdash; came up with various proposals and when they requested a meeting with the Minister to discuss them he said he could not meet with them until the end of the week following the debate on the matter in the D&aacute;il.  Yesterday, he spoke about the matter in NUI Cork and on radio.  He stated on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night that there will be no change, that he is sticking with what was decided and that the Government will not reverse the proposals.  N&iacute; bheidh aon ch&uacute;l&uacute; &oacute;n m&eacute;id at&aacute; molta agam ag an bpointe seo.  The Minister will discuss the issue but will not make any change.  What type of consultation is that?  What confidence does this inspire in the schools around the country that are being devastated?</P>
        <P>I will give another example.  I hope my colleagues on the opposite side will listen to me and, if I say one thing that is wrong, interrupt me immediately as I would not want to mislead the House.  The statement that there will be 200 fewer teachers next year is a fallacy and misleading information.  There are a number of teachers in the current system.  The plan is to have 200 fewer in the system next year.  The increase in natural population enrolling in schools next year <Col N="861" />will require 800 extra teachers.  The difference between the number of teachers that would be in the system after next September as opposed to what will be in the system if the Government forces through these cuts is 1,000.  If I am wrong, I will sit down immediately.  I look forward to being corrected by any Member on the opposite side.  This is the kind of misleading information we are being given.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle left the House because he knows my views on these issues.  I am too long at this game.  The Minister of State should remember that education is my constituency.  I am in this for the long haul and I will not put on the record comments over which I cannot stand.  What I say is absolutely correct.  It is not good to hear the Minister for Education and Science say teachers must take the medicine; of course, they will.  The really difficult thing to accept is that there is nothing in this for teachers.  This is not about salaries, posts or promotion, it is about their children, pupils, schools and their communities.</P>
        <P>It is my responsibility to haunt every Member of the Government parties about the manner in which they are wrecking, undermining and destroying primary education by way of these measures.  It is our responsibility to tell this story in our clinics, in the other House and in county councils throughout the country.  This will not go away.  What is happening outside the House tonight is not similar to what happened last week. The protest outside the House tonight is only the beginning of a long campaign which will continue.  We have been through this many times.  I will stand with the teachers, schools and boards of management.</P>
        <P>A message needs to go back to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, following his statement last night that this is a teachers&rsquo; issue.  I wish he had been in Buswells Hotel yesterday to see the full line up of all interests in primary education including gaelscoileanna, multi-denominational education, Church of Ireland management, Catholic school management, the INTO and various other groups.  Bh&iacute; na heagrasa&iacute; Gaeltachta, gaelscola&iacute;ochta agus p&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta ann.  Bh&iacute; siad go l&eacute;ir ann.  They all had the same message for Government: &ldquo;You cannot do this to primary education.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>This is not about increasing class sizes by one pupil.  Schools must retain their numbers for a full year before they are entitled to extra teachers.  In other words, a school with three or four teachers may well have to have classes increased by nine or ten pupils in order to get an extra teacher the following September.  What is happening is crazy.  I am only touching on issues.  In terms of partnership and commitment, this measure is taking us backwards and I will tell the Minister of State why.  He can give us a history lesson &mdash; I have no doubt he has a prepared script &mdash; on all that has happened since 1977.  The reality is that returning us to the situation which prevailed in 2007 is not like going back one year.  That might be the case in other European countries but it is returning us to the dark ages because we have been so far behind.</P>
        <P>These are not my figures, my comparison or my views.  This is what is written in <i>Education at a Glance</i> , the yearly statistics from the European Union in respect of the percentage of GNP we put into education.  This is the only figure that counts in terms of comparing like with like.  We were way behind and are going backwards again.</P>

It cannot go anywhere without it.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, told us that out of large classes came the Celtic tiger, implying that with further large classes we might again see the Celtic tiger.  We might even sort out global warming and many other issues as a result of large classes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole will no doubt take up his placard and head out the door.</P>
        <P>Many of the principals with whom I have met spoke of intransigence.  They speak of unions and teachers who get paid a weekly allowance for substitution, whether they do it or not, which is pensionable.  As the issue has arisen it has become of great interest to me and, no doubt, to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I have been told by principals throughout the country that some unions have instructed their members, who are being requested to do substitution, not to carry out the work.  This is despite their being paid by the taxpayer to do it.  The instructions to principals are that a substitute force should be sought before teachers do the substitution.</P>
        <P>The motion from the Labour Party is wide-ranging in the education field and Senator O&rsquo;Toole seems to have deviated slightly because it specifically mentions special needs.  The education of people with special needs is most affected.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned his special interests but my nominating group is not nearly as powerful as that of Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  It is the Irish Deaf Society, which has a great knowledge of disability and disadvantage with regard to our education system.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will take this up with the principals because the capitation grant is not being utilised when deaf parents or children come to them seeking an interpreter, which is deeply disturbing.  The Irish Deaf Society is taking the lead in trying to establish a so-called call centre &mdash; an ironic pun when it comes to the deaf community &mdash; on this.  For example, in England, if one appears before a body such as a local council, education board or principal of a school, there is a translator available on-line so that no matter what part of England a person is in, communication can be facilitated between the body and a member of the deaf community.</P>
        <P>There are 5,000 people in Ireland, along with 50,000 family members, who use Irish sign language.  As a Government spokesperson on the issue, I know some deeply upsetting facts on this.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has yet to be ratified by Ireland, which seems senseless when one considers that 10% of the world&rsquo;s population live with a disability, accounting for 20% of the poorest people in the world.  As the <Col N="863" />disability rate among the lower-educated in the OECD shows, it is those with disabilities who have the least amount of education.</P>
        <P>One section of the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion states &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann believes that it is essential that children with disabilities have access to mainstream education for as long as possible&rdquo;, and I agree with it.  The ratification of UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is, putting it mildly, slowly coming about and it will, no doubt, give numerous rights to people like those of the Irish deaf community.  It is difficult to believe and embarrassing for this country that countries such as Bangladesh, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines have preceded us in ratifying this convention.  Even countries with questionable human rights records such as China and Saudi Arabia have managed to ratify the convention.</P>
        <P>The European Union passed two resolutions, one in 1988 and another in 1998, indicating Irish sign language should be recognised and the UK, Denmark, Finland, Portugal and Sweden have done this.  If we recognised Irish sign language, it would be incumbent on us to facilitate those people who use it in communication with Government.  There is British and Irish sign language and, absurdly, Irish sign language has been recognised at least in one part of this island.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish sign language has received official status in Northern Ireland.  Amazingly, in the Twenty-six Counties, Irish sign language has still to be ratified as an official language.</P>
        <P>In its manifesto prior to the previous general election, the Green Party stated it would push for Irish sign language to become an official language, therefore allowing people to communicate with Government and those in education.  This would help those who have the most to lose and the biggest mountain to climb, and who are less likely to have access to the education system we know because of disability.  Without the official recognition of Irish sign language, those people will not have access to mainstream education.  I, with my Green Party colleagues, hope to ensure Irish sign language gets official language recognition, as it should under the Good Friday Agreement.  This promise has been implemented in the North but has not in this jurisdiction as of yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  We were told this budget would contain tough measures but would protect the most vulnerable in society.  What section of society is more vulnerable than people, especially children, with disabilities and their families who are struggling within an already inadequate system of education to get the education they deserve?  The result of this budget is to make that struggle more difficult.  Is this the protection of the most vulnerable in our society?  This is just so unfair and callous that it defies belief.</P>
        <P>Several measures contained in the budget severely affect people with disability.  This group is more prone to hospital visits and will be affected by increased accident and emergency department, hospital bed and medical insurance costs.  Access to mainstream education for as long as possible is essential for best outcomes in education for children with disabilities.  The class size changes are a major setback in this regard as the opportunity for the one-to-one attention required and deserved will be severely reduced.  In addition, equipment and resource grants for resource teachers are being abolished and the inadequate provision for special needs assistants continues.  Is this the protection of the most vulnerable in our society?</P>
        <P>The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, a progressive piece of legislation, is to be deferred further, which is a major disappointment.  There is a 1% cut for voluntary disability bodies on top of the 1% cut imposed by the Health Service Executive on those bodies.  With inflation running at 4.5%, how are these voluntary bodies supposed to <Col N="864" />continue with existing levels of service, never mind cope with the increased demand for such services?</P>
        <P>The ending of the payment of disability allowance to 16 and 17 year olds in favour of the domiciliary care allowance is a further attack on some of the most vulnerable in our society.  This will amount to about a &euro;7,000 per year hit on these young people and their struggling parents.</P>
        <P>A delegation from the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies met the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, yesterday to discuss proposed adjustments in the qualifying age for disability allowance payments to young people with a disability.  They told the Minister that the federation is opposed to the budget proposals to reduce overall payments to young people with a disability and requested her not to implement them.  They emphasised the future impact of the reductions on many of the young people involved, and the implications for their families.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, in a reply to my party colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, had stated that it was in response to a submission from the federation that she was implementing the change.</P>
        <P>The federation made 29 recommendations, including an increase in the domiciliary care allowance, but only one was taken up.  According to media reports last week, Brian O&rsquo;Donnell, chief executive of the federation, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This was nothing less than a cynical opportunity to save money in the context of a budgetary situation. We never envisaged they would do something as cynical as this.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Brian O&rsquo;Donnell, along with the rest of the country, now knows what this Government is capable of.  These cuts must be reversed because they are unacceptable in a civilized society.  Where has our society got to that any Government could introduce such measures?  How can a Government even contemplate such measures, let alone implement them?  How can a Government that claims to protect the weakest and most vulnerable in our society make such political choices?  Members should note that these are political choices and the Government has consciously decided to do this.  While we are moving into more difficult economic times, much of which, unfortunately, is of our own doing, our elderly and children, in particular our children with disabilities and learning challenges, should not be targeted in this abominable manner.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset, the people of Ireland were told this budget would contain tough measures but that it would protect the most vulnerable in our society.  The opposite is the case with regard to people with disabilities and I support this motion.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to come before the Seanad.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, who was not available to attend the House this evening.  I have taken note of most of the issues raised and will try to respond in my contribution to the concerns expressed by Members regarding the non-implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, issues pertaining to class sizes and questions regarding the overall budget strategy.</P>
        <P>I take into account the genuine concerns raised by Members this evening.  I note the nature of the motion, the process in which we are involved and that we are in an adversarial setting.  The Opposition tables a motion and criticises the possible lack of interest of the Government, after which it is my duty to come before the House and respond to the criticism by using the figures and whatever else.  While much time is wasted in this process, I acknowledge it is important for the Opposition to raise and criticise Government policy.  By the same token, <Col N="865" />Members will accept that I must attend the House to refute at least some of the arguments put before me.</P>
        <P>At the outset, it is worth noting that altogether 19,000 staff are employed in schools to deal specifically with children with special needs.  Although I must go into considerable detail regarding the level of supports for children with special needs, I will preface my remarks by recognising that everyone wishes to see far better levels of service.  My contention is that were it not for the great budgetary constraints placed upon it, the Government also would like to do this.  Senator Boyle referred to this point a few minutes ago when he explained what the Government is spending on a daily basis.  I make these points to explain that politicians, by their nature, are not in the business of introducing unpopular policies.  Consequently, when they do, there must be a serious and solid reason for so doing.</P>
        <P>I wish to take the opportunity to reaffirm, as I have done with those representatives of the disability sector who I have met in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health, to groups and the wider public that the national disability strategy still is in place.  The Government will do what it possibly can to give people with disabilities the services and supports they need.  I also will take the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this regard in the recent budget.  It also is important to confirm that persons with disabilities are and will remain a priority for the Government.  I will explain this in the course of my contribution.</P>
        <P>It also is important to emphasise that the creation of the office for disability, mental health and equality is an attempt to ensure that people with disabilities are recognised at Government level.  It is an attempt to ensure there is cross-sectoral support for people with disabilities and I am greatly pleased to be backed up by people of the stature of Bairbre Nic Aonghusa, who heads up that office, and her most competent staff.  I will not go into the background detail except to state the office exists, Members are aware of its functions, it is cross-sectoral and its purpose is to ensure services are provided and there is no delay in waiting for responses from different Departments.</P>
        <P>It also is fair to note the Government has prioritised investments in services for people with disabilities in recent years.  I make this point in response to the criticism the Government is walking away from the area of disabilities.  Overall, approximately &euro;2.6 billion is spent annually by the health service on disability programmes such as the residential, day care, respite, assessment and rehabilitation services, as well as on mental health programmes, domiciliary care and respite care grants and other allowances.  It is important to make the point that funding and expenditure in respect of disability issues also is available from the mainstream health services.  While the need to enhance further capacity is a continuing challenge, it is important to acknowledge the highly significant existing level of expenditure on health services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to spend a great deal of time going through my prepared script to state what has been provided because Members are more concerned with what will be provided, except to state that &euro;500 million has been allocated since 2006 under the multi-annual investment programme.  Members all will agree this is a key component of the national disability strategy.  Of this funding, &euro;425 million was for disability services and &euro;125 million for mental health services.  The multi-annual programme will, by the end of 2008, provide for 980 new residential places, 313 new respite places and 2,505 new day places.</P>
        <P>As for dealing with people with intellectual disabilities, which is of specific importance to my area of responsibility, 300 additional new places have been provided since 2006, as well as 950,000 additional hours.  I make this point only in response to the criticism that the Govern<Col N="866" />ment has ignored the disability area.  While I accept that much more must be done, I will put on the record what has been done.</P>
        <P>An area I have come to recognise as being highly important is the need to target the transfer of persons with intellectual disability and autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.  One is not obliged simply to rely on the funding that has been provided in this year&rsquo;s budget.  It also is important to recognise that the commitment set out in A Vision for Change clearly underlines the great priority placed on securing appropriate places for people with intellectual disability.</P>
        <P>The HSE also is working to improve access to multidisciplinary services, including therapy services, across all disciplines nationwide.  It also is worth noting that since the establishment of the executive, the number of speech and language therapists has increased by 235 to 733, which constitutes an increase of 47% in that period.  I will respond to the criticism that the Government is ignoring the need for occupational therapists.  I also take the points made by Senator Phil Prendergast.  While great need obviously exists in some locations, the waiting lists appear to be manageable in other geographical areas.  The Department should examine the issue of how waiting periods can obtain in some parts of the country, while demand can be easily managed in other parts.  I do not wish to bore Members with the figures but the number of occupational therapists has increased by 326 to 1,031, which constitutes an increase of 46%.  Moreover, the number of physiotherapists has increased by 302 to 1,434, which constitutes an increase of 27%.  In 2006 and 2007 alone, more than 2,245 additional health and social care professionals, including therapy posts, have been filled to provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to apologise again in respect of the fiasco last year, when &euro;50 million was provided specifically under the multi-annual investment programme for people with intellectual disabilities.  Members will recall the delays involved.  The delay was responded to publicly by the HSE and arose from its attempt to check on the efficiency of services.  The response last year was not adequate and I assure the House this will not happen again and the funding secured for mental health and the disabilities area will be ring-fenced.  I can promise that similar delays will not occur in this area.  Of the &euro;50 million, &euro;33 million has been drawn down.  To explain, by the time the funding had been cleared, the short gap available in which to recruit people was inadequate.  I acknowledge this is my area of responsibility and this delay should not have happened.  I again make a commitment to the House that it will not recur.  As for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, 80 additional places have been allocated.  I acknowledge the need for more, however.</P>
        <P>Senators will note that I did not go overboard in terms of issuing a press release on my Department&rsquo;s success in securing an additional &euro;20 million for children with special educational needs.  I recognise that we have all agreed to do everything we can to secure extra services and I am pleased that funding was provided.  Of this allocation, &euro;10 million will be provided to the Health Service Executive and &euro;10 million to the Department of Education and Science to enable services for children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened.  The additional &euro;10 million allocated to the HSE will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in disability and mental health services targeted at children of school-going age.  An additional 90 posts will be created in the disability services area, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children&rsquo;s disability services.  An additional 35 posts will be created for child and adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers.</P>
<Col N="867" />
        <P>I acknowledge the concerns expressed by Senators in regard to the postponement of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 on foot of the financial constraints placed upon us.  The &euro;20 million provided in the budget represents an attempt to establish the necessary services, however.  I accept Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s advice in respect of the lack of legal safeguards but we are trying to prepare the ground in order that therapists will be at least in place when the economy improves.  Rather than brag about this funding, I recognise the need for the services.</P>
        <P>Almost &euro;1 billion is provided each year to non-statutory providers of disability services.  Several Senators have raised this issue.  Our intention is not to reduce the services provided by non-statutory groups; rather we are trying to streamline them.  Streamlining is often regarded as a means of taking back funding but that is not our intention.  I have met with a number of these service providers to assure them I am not attempting to withdraw their resources.  There are more than 600 different voluntary groups and it is impossible to deal that level of variety.  I am in the process of appointing somebody to chair a review of services.  That person will be independent of politics and acceptable to the disability and mental health sectors.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has made clear her intention of providing support to groups while the review process is ongoing.  In the event that the services of a particular group overlap and are thus no longer required, she will make available the financial resources required by the group to make its case.  We will not awake some morning to discover that 300 groups have been removed form the sector.  People will have the opportunity to make their input and, more importantly, the process will take six to nine months and will not be rushed.</P>
        <P>In line with the efficiency measures being introduced elsewhere in the health system, an efficiency reduction of 1% will be applied to the allocations of non-statutory disability agencies for 2009.  It is envisaged that the efficiencies will be achieved in non-frontline areas such as advertising, travel and subsistence, public relations and management and administrative payroll costs.</P>
        <P>Widespread concerns have been expressed regarding the announcement in the budget of a change from 16 to 18 years in respect of the domiciliary care allowance and the subsequent payment of disability allowance.  This is not a cute attempt to make savings.  One hour is not sufficient time to explain all the details of a budget.  Measures should be rolled out long before the Budget Statement, although I do not suggest they should be presented as <i>faits accomplis</i>.  While Ministers are properly concerned lest a budgetary provision allowed somebody to make a quick buck, I have proposed to the Taoiseach that we should begin to consider the implications of changes long in advance of the Budget Statement so that people can tease out their implications.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the changes to the domiciliary care allowance, a number of families and organisations representing people with disabilities have expressed reservations.  I will not rehearse the background to the proposal, except to note that my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, has engaged in extensive consultations with groups representing people with disabilities and service providers in the disability sector in order to hear their concerns at first hand.  These discussions confirmed the view that the existing age limit for receipt of disability allowance is too low and should be raised to 18.  They also highlighted a number of other concerns, including the potential loss of income at short notice for families of young people with disabilities.  I understand the Minister is reflecting on these issues in advance of the publication of the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
        <P>Accident and emergency charges will increase from &euro;66 to &euro;100 for non-medical card holders who attend accident and emergency departments without letters from their GPs.  Senators will be aware how busy accident and emergency units can become.  Although accident and emer<Col N="868" />gency services are designed to provide health care in emergency situations, a significant number of attendances involve the treatment of relatively minor conditions.  The increased charge is an attempt to incentivise people to avail of medical care in the community or through their GPs in the first instance.  This will enable accident and emergency departments to increasingly concentrate on the management and care of more serious conditions.  There will also be an increase of &euro;9 in the public hospital statutory in-patient bed charge, bringing it to &euro;75 per night for a maximum of ten nights per year.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In response to the concerns expressed by Senators regarding the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act, it is important to note that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  The budget for resource teachers has not been reduced and funding for special needs assistants will be sustained.  Several Senators took the view that cuts were being applied in a timid manner or were improperly explained.  Transport will continue to be provided and assistive technology will be sanctioned where appropriate.  The increase of &euro;302 million in the education budget for 2009 is a real achievement in the current economic climate.  Education is one of only three Departments to have increased funding in 2009.  This has involved a number of tough and difficult decisions.  Some 80% of the education funding will go to salaries and frontline staff.</P>
      
        <P>I hope I have responded to most of the issues raised.  This is not an attempt to move after the most vulnerable but to spread scarce resources across the area of education and special needs.  If there are further queries I will try to respond later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well.  I thank him for the frankness of his comments and for cutting through the script to speak frankly.</P>
        <P>The proposal to remove the disability allowance from young people of 16 to 18 years and replace it with the domiciliary care allowance is a retrograde step and is bad news for families with someone with a disability.  Those families stand to lose &euro;6,000 per annum or &euro;12,000 over two years.  It is proposed that they seek the domiciliary care allowance, which would allow them &euro;300 per month.  The Minister of State indicated this may be revisited.  I hope that is the case and I would welcome that.  Anything else is highly discriminatory and should not have been included in the budget.</P>
        <P>I have consistently made the point in the Seanad, on the Order of Business and on other occasions, that we should never seek to rectify the grave fiscal errors of the past 11 years on the backs of the weak and vulnerable, such as disabled people.  I received a briefing from an association called Special Needs Active Parents, SNAP, set up in 2004, which is active in the north-eastern area of the country, including Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.  The briefing refers to the shortage in that area of therapy.</P>
        <P>I would be pleased if the Minister of State would investigate the veracity of this example, which I believe will stand up.  In St. Brigid&rsquo;s special school in Ard Easmuinn, Dundalk, no speech therapy has been available since June 2005.  A seven year old boy with special needs has not received speech therapy in that time.  There is a shortage of speech therapists, psychologists and occupational therapists.  Children who have turned six years of age and are due to be transferred from the early intervention team to the children&rsquo;s team have been placed on waiting lists due to the lack of therapists available.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE need to set up a long-term strategy to train and retain the required number of therapists.  According to a spokesperson for the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 3 March 2007, the first batch of speech therapists from three new university courses were due to graduate this summer.  The association estimates that <Col N="869" />half of them will emigrate as there are no jobs available.  That is at variance with the figures presented by the Minister of State of the availability of speech therapy.  I welcome one suggestion by the Minister of State where he&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need to examine the distribution of services because there is evidence to suggest a glaring absence of professional services in many areas.  That speech therapists and other professional people in this area are emigrating is a horrendous indictment of the way services are organised.</P>
        <P>I am aware of a physiotherapist who is on a panel for a job in this region.  The person has been on the waiting list for 18 months, yet the expertise will go abroad.  This is bizarre and must be examined.</P>
        <P>The idea of increasing hospital charges for people with special needs is horrendous.  The charge increased from &euro;66 to &euro;100.  I commend the Labour Party on this excellent motion, which I am proud to support.  The overall proposition is that 28:1 class ratios will greatly discriminate against those with special needs.  The discrimination is heightened by the fact that we have multi-ethnic, multi-lingual classes with people from a variety of backgrounds.  The ratio of 28:1 will not apply everywhere &mdash; there will be bizarre cases with classes in the 30s.  It will be impossible to have special needs people in these classes.  There must be a reversal of class size numbers.  The proposition of 28:1 will leave 1,000 teachers out of the system next year when one takes the demographic aspect into consideration.</P>
        <P>The motion is worthy of support.  I call on Government speakers, of whom Senator Corrigan is next, to do the right thing, withdraw the amendment and support the motion, which stands on its merits.  We should put young people with special needs at the top of the pyramid in terms of estimation and distribution of resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and particularly his commitment that the money allocated to disabilities and mental health will be spent in that area.  For far too long, these areas have been seen as easy targets when the HSE sought to offset over-spending in other areas.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State and am delighted that we will no longer experience the situation that occurred earlier this year.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have demonstrated concrete commitment to people with disabilities.  This has been manifest in many ways, including the introduction of multi-annual funding, the national disability strategy that was recently incorporated into the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health.  Increased funding since Fianna F&aacute;il came to government has meant more opportunities for day programmes, residential and living options, greater supports in education and an increased number of special needs assistants and therapists.  For example, in regard to <Col N="870" />special needs assistants, the number working in our schools has increased from 300 in 1997 to more than 10,000 today.</P>
        <P>The issues confronting people with disabilities cannot be rectified with funding alone but require a combination of funding, policy, legislation and attitude change.  The establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health offers us an enormous opportunity to co-ordinate these requirements.  This office brings together responsibility for a range of policy areas which will improve co-ordination between service providers and the various Departments.  These directly impact on the daily lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues.  As the Minister of State outlined, the office will aim to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues.  It will do this by working to develop person-centred services and, I hope, person-led services focusing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and, crucially, involving them in their own care.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to repeat the many points made by colleagues but rather to focus on two aspects, namely, an increase in the number of therapists and the role of the National Educational Psychological Service and school leavers with mild intellectual disability.  As a psychologist specialising in the area of disability and mental health, I particularly welcome the commitment in this budget to allocating an additional &euro;20 million to this area.  This will result in a range of additional therapist posts from speech and language therapists to occupational therapists to physiotherapists to psychologists.  This funding will be allocated between the HSE and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>In seeking to provide increased funding for therapists and having ensured that funding, a number of issues must be addressed, namely, their training, recruitment and employment.  Undoubtedly, in recent years, the Government, through increasing the number of training places for therapists, has laid the foundation for them to be recruited.  It is essential, however, if we are to seek to recruit therapists into the area of disability, that their training incorporates a knowledge of disability and, where appropriate, placements in disability services.</P>
        <P>Recruitment and employment in the area of disability is an ongoing challenge.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to a physiotherapist of whom he is aware who is on a panel but anecdotal information and my experience suggests that while we saw an increase in therapist positions, we did not necessarily see the same increase in the number of applications for vacancies within disability services.  This arises as an issue for a number of reasons.  Since there is not as much exposure to, and training in, the area of disability during training, there is perhaps not the same awareness of working within the area of disability and of the enormous job satisfaction that can be found through working with people with disabilities.  It is essential that this is addressed and that we examine the reasons for the difficulties in recruiting therapists to work within the area of disability.</P>
        <P>I refer to one of the impediments we should seek to address and in which the Minister of State&rsquo;s office could play a role.  Anecdotally, we hear from therapists that they would like a case mix, that they do not want to work solely in the area of disability and would appreciate the opportunity to work a couple of days in disability and a couple of days in community services.  If we want better co-ordination of services and if we want to fill the vacancies, we should be able to adopt a much more flexible structure. It is important we demonstrate a commitment to continuous professional development.  That is important not only to attract and retain professionals but also to ensure the people in receipt of their services will receive excellent and continuously developing services.</P>
<Col N="871" />
        <P>I refer to the role of psychologists in schools and the National Educational Psychological Service.  It is important that psychologists are not limited to assessments.  They have much more to offer.  It is very important in the school setting that we utilise their skills in training workshops for teachers, assistants and parents and give them the opportunity to work with groups of pupils.  In that way, we will maximise their impact.</P>
        <P>I am particularly concerned about school leavers with mild intellectual disability.  They do not have the same opportunities afforded to pupils without a disability who will often go on to some form of third level education.  A child with moderate or profound intellectual disability tends to be linked into an overall service.  However, children with mild intellectual disability attending special schools or special classes often fall through the cracks as they come to the end of the school cycle because there is no automatic link.</P>
        <P>I welcome the mental capacity Bill which I understand will be before us by the end of the year.  There is an important role to play in preventing disability.  Will the Minister of State keep in mind running an awareness campaign around vaccinations and the MMR?  I welcome the fact that in these very challenging economic times, we were able to find additional moneys for services for people with disabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State who is from my part of the world.  I know him to be a decent and courageous man.  I was in the church in Westland Row when he stood up.  His name, John Moloney, did not mean anything but when people heard the words &ldquo;Fianna F&aacute;il&rdquo;, a palpable wave of anger travelled down the church.  I have never experienced anything like it.  The reason for that was not personal culpability but because the Government did not listen.  Unfortunately, people will not now listen to it.</P>
        <P>Nobody is denying we are in a very serious financial situation.  That is a given.  This side of the House was challenged by Senator Boyle who is an exceptionally decent man.  He asked what changes we would make and what would we do.  I would not have started with the sick, the disabled and the elderly.  They should not be the first targets but the very last ones.  This will have a real impact on the disabled, in particular.</P>
        <P>I am an Independent Senator and vote on the merits of a case.  The Labour Party motion was clear, precise and factual but the Government&rsquo;s amendment was the usual self-congratulatory waffle.  If one was to accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution together with the amendment, one would be persuaded that the Government was doing disabled people a favour and that they were better off.  It is a kind of mad mathematical conjuring trick.</P>
        <P>A piece of advice I would give is to take up Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s offer.  He made a fantastic and passionate contribution.  He knew what he was talking about and I know the Minister of State discusses issues with him.  He said he could produce budget neutral cuts which would have the same effect.  The Minister of State should discuss this with him.  If he wants to know what to do, that is one bloody good idea.</P>
        <P>The number of people involved is enormous &mdash; some 393,785.  It is almost 10% of the population.  We have done a good job in improving their situation but it is awful to give people a gift and then snatch it away.  The disappointment is reduplicated by that.  I attended a briefing a fortnight ago by the Disability Federation of Ireland.  It was already complaining and asked that the Minister give back the stolen &euro;85 million, that is, the money diverted by the HSE.  The Minister of State addressed part of this issue courageously.</P>
        <P>A total of &euro;10 million has been provided in additional funding but there is a 1% cut across the board.  Again, it is a case of taking and giving at the same time.  There is a 2.1% increase in the application.  A sizable proportion of that should go towards stabilising the position for the disabled.  We need to reinstate the diverted funds I mentioned and put in place proper <Col N="872" />mechanisms.  I will mention a couple of figures to make it clear that what I raise is factual.  The Central Statistics Office states that the weekly allowance for disability for 2008 was &euro;197.80.  I will supply the Minister of State with the figures directly.  There is no doubt there is a significant decrease.  Taking into account all the creative mathematics there will be a loss of &euro;13,000 to &euro;14,000 over a two year period.</P>
        <P>I want to put a human face on this.  The chairman of the Donegal Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Association illustrated that as a result of the budget the qualifying age for disability allowance was being raised from 16 to 18, and he would loose &euro;13,000 over two years.  It is cynical to argue that it is to encourage them to go out and get a job.  Some of these people are profoundly disabled.  It is an appalling comment and should be withdrawn.  Another man, whose daughter had Down&rsquo;s Syndrome, stated that when she passed away last year at the age of 26, he was refused a bereavement grant on the grounds that she had no record of employment, and therefore had no entitlements.  If people are profoundly disabled and cannot take up employment, they will be punished twice.</P>
        <P>We think these people can be exported out into a world where competition reigns, capitalism is supreme and nobody gives a tuppenny damn.  Margaret Thatcher came right in the end.  We have an economy and not a society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.  I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion on the impact of these severe cutbacks on children with disabilities.  I echo the views of Senator Norris that these cuts will hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped, but the focus tonight is on their impact on children.  </P>
        <P>I have come from a demonstration outside this House, which other Members also attended, at which thousands of angry parents, teachers and children were present.  It was called by the INTO, the ASTI and other unions.  It was clear to anyone who was out there in the pouring rain that there was palpable anger at the serious impact these proposed cutbacks would have on all children, and in particular on vulnerable children.  The focus of tonight&rsquo;s motion is very important.</P>
        <P>Buried in the Minister&rsquo;s self-congratulatory speech was the acknowledgement that the implementation of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the Disability Act 2005 will be deferred beyond 2010.  The acknowledgement that class sizes will be increased was also buried in the speech, which will have a severe impact on the education of all children at primary level, particularly those with special needs or disabilities.</P>
        <P>We will also see severe cutbacks impacting on children who require language support, of whom there are many in the education system, and on Traveller children as special supports for them have been cut.  Children will suffer, parents and teachers will struggle to cope, and class sizes will rocket beyond the OECD average.  They are already high enough.  There was a commitment in the Government&rsquo;s programme to reduce them.  There was a particular commitment by the Green Party to reduce class sizes, and instead we will see them increase, with a consequent impact on children and parents.</P>
        <P>There is a need to focus on the role of the junior coalition partner, the Green Party.  It came into office with a commitment to making education a key political priority.  There is a question as to how the Minister of State&rsquo;s party, and the Green Party, can sit by while class sizes increase, there is a severe impact on the most vulnerable children in our society, and parents and teachers are outside the doors of Leinster House seeking for their voices to be heard.  I ask the Minister of State to consider reversing these cutbacks.  The money should come from other sources.  There are other resources available, and other suggestions have been made.  A tax on the super-rich is an idea that should be taken on board.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The gatherings outside Leinster House remind me of the monster gatherings of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, when he called a quarter of a million people to the Hill of Tara.  When the Minister of State spoke in Westland Row, it was not personal.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission Annual Report for 2007 has just been published.  It highlighted child and adolescent mental health services as an area requiring special attention.  The Council of Europe report by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Hammarberg, on his visit to Ireland in November 2007 stated, &ldquo;Placing children who are in need of psychiatric treatment in adult facilities is in breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child&rdquo;.  In 2007 193 children aged between 13 and 17 were admitted to adult psychiatric services.  The majority were aged 17.</P>
        <P>In regard to my policy document, What We Can Do About Suicide In The New Ireland, Mr. Hammarberg&rsquo;s report states, &ldquo;There appears to be significant gaps in community based care and access to services for those at risk of self-harm, including children&rdquo;.   The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance has raised concerns about child and adolescent psychiatric service being underdeveloped and under-funded.  As a result, children and adolescents continue to be treated through adult services and have to endure long waiting periods, sometimes three to five years, for assessment.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Chaplain&rsquo;s annual report 2006-2007 refers to 3,000 children on waiting lists for assessment, and 300 children treated each year in adult psychiatric services.  It is frightening to think of little children, some of whom are suicidal,  who need psychiatric help and cannot get it.  It is cruel.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, has called on the Government to implement its mental health policy, A Vision for Change, with a particular focus on children.  This would entail the extension of current social services provided to children and families at risk to a seven day, 24 hour service.  I have raised this issue on other occasions.  There are 113,000 people working in the HSE, which has an annual budget of &euro;14.5 billion.  I fail to understand how they cannot provide a 24 hour service; it is beyond me.</P>
        <P>Children up to 18 years comprise a quarter of the population of Ireland.  The majority of children do not develop mental health problems, but at any point approximately 2% of children require specialist mental health expertise.  I recommended a businesslike approach by the different regional directors of the HSE to put in place a strategy in their own areas to reduce the list of children who need psychiatric services, and to show how they could reduce the list to zero.</P>
        <P>I also recommend that<b> </b>the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, takes responsibility for ensuring the different arms of the State deliver on providing acceptable out-patient and in-patient psychiatric services for children and adolescents.  He monitors the implementation of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy.  If I had anything to do with that, I would have the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews take responsibility at the Cabinet for reducing the lists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>At the end of this debate and at the end of the school day and school year, parents will have to cope with the worsening financial situation, bad news, more bad news and worse news.  Despite that, there is a great deal of self-congratulatory claptrap.  In saying that, I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State or to his office.  I have the highest regard for him as the former chairman of the Committee on Health and Children and he is trying to do his job.  However, there must be a disconnection when I hear what people say to me on the doorstep or in the kitchen when I visit these people who cannot come to my clinic because they have a disabled child, a child with an educational deficit or some other concern with which they have to deal.  When I go to their houses, a wheelchair may have to be pushed out of the way and those people cope because they simply have to.  The budget has made things considerably worse for them.</P>
        <P>People now have time to digest what is in the small print of the budget and we are all still digesting that.  I am dependent on other people because, as a midwife, I am not an expert on education, but I am a mother and I know what my children needed.  When additional resources were needed in my children&rsquo;s school, we were in a position to get them.  That was in the lucky decade when everything was fantastic.</P>
        <P>We have to face reality and we are not in denial about that.  Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole mentioned that he could issue the Minister with a cost effective and cost neutral means of obtaining the funding required without it impacting on the disadvantaged, the disabled, the needy and the tormented.  The parents and siblings of disabled people will now have to find additional resources and suffer additional torment because they will have to get somebody or something to fill the abyss.</P>
        <P>With respect to Senator Mary White, I am also a member of the sub-committee on suicide.  I have heard the word &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; mentioned many times and so inappropriately because people are that desperate.  What does one say to a parent of a child who says her son is expressing a wish that he were dead?  As a mother and a nurse there are not words that can capture what that means?</P>
        <P>It is frightening the way people are reacting to different aspects of the budget.  The approach to it can be fragmented.  Having heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech, it is wonderful that such facilities are in place, but the people who have made representations to me are not able to avail of them.  If one is not a certain age or, as stated in the advertisement, one needs seven wise virgins and the blood of a unicorn&rsquo;s horn or whatever, one cannot qualify for something.  That is frustrating when one is talking to people who have an identified need.  I have not met the breed of people who have sought something to which they were not entitled and who have tried to pull a fast one, and I am long enough in politics not to be taken for a fool.</P>
        <P>We need to look back.  The failure to implement the EPSEN Act has had huge ramifications for people.  The effect of the increase in class sizes was already identified.  The issue has become a clich&eacute; and people are fatigued about it because there is such an overuse of the terminology.  If my child were in a school and his abilities were not what they should be, I would regard it as the role of the teacher to ensure his needs were met, and that is not to demean the role of the teacher.</P>
        <P>I ask that this motion be supported.  I thank the Minister of State for listening and I thank the Senators, including Senator Mary White, for their support.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise the condition of the limb fitting clinic at St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital, Cork.  I would like to paint a picture of 21st century Cork and Ireland in which a clinic for amputees is housed in a 29 year old prefabricated building where a wall panel is missing beside the wheelchair ramp; roof timbers are rotting leaving an exposed water tank; fascia boards in the front elevation of the building are rotting; windows cannot be opened because of gaps; blinds cannot be pulled down; the Xpelair is missing, with a bucket holding it in; and a suitable pedestrian access and dishing along the footpath approaching the building is lacking at a time when we boast about the fact that we are a modern progressive society.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I acknowledge the excellent work of the staff and volunteers in the clinic and, in particular, Bob Burns.  He is a dedicated volunteer of no political hue, who has given of his time to make life better for those who attend the clinic.  I visited the clinic and it is unacceptable that it is housed in a prefab.  Every Tuesday, people of all ages from naught to 82 years and from all parts of Cork and Munster attend the clinic.  The signage approaching it is insufficient, as is the pedestrian access.  A canopy is required at the entrance.  If one walked from one&rsquo;s car to the building&rsquo;s entrance in the middle of winter or, with our weather, summer, one would be wet and cold before entering it.  The access issue must be addressed.  Conditions are diabolical.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Should any society tolerate the lack of joined-up thinking by the Health Service Executive and the service providers?  I compliment the staff working in the clinic, but the conditions of the building beggar belief.  It is falling down, the timber is rotten, glass is falling out of windows and the breeze comes in the main door and elsewhere.  I hope that the Minister of State will announce plans for a new building on the current location or at the Cork orthopaedic hospital.  We have been covering up the lack of funding at the clinic, which is meant to serve those who have lost a limb and are readjusting to life as well as possible.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, it behoves us to act as advocates on behalf of the people attending the clinic and the volunteers and staff working there.  I invite the Minister for Health and Children to visit the clinic, if she has not done so already.  Its state of disrepair is extraordinary.  I am ashamed of the way in which the prefab has been allowed to become so dilapidated.  Were it not for people like Mr. Burns, who has become an advocate and a mover in this regard, no <Col N="878" />repairs, maintenance or painting would have taken place.  However, that is only papering over the cracks.</P>
        <P>I have painted the picture.  We must take care of the people in question.  It is not good enough to state that plans are afoot or to use hyperbole suggestive of an outcome.  The people from the eight counties attending the clinic deserve to be treated fairly and respectfully.  I hope that the Minister of State will detail a positive outcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for placing this matter on the Adjournment, which I will take on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that the limb-fitting service in St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital falls under the remit of the acute hospital service, specifically the orthopaedic services provided by St. Mary&rsquo;s Orthopaedic Hospital, part of the Cork University Hospital group.  The limb-fitting clinic is held every second Tuesday at St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital and approximately 22 to 25 clients attend each session.  The clinic is run in a single storey building of modular lightweight timber construction, covering approximately 300 sq. m in area.  The building was constructed approximately 30 years ago.  Other services provided from the same building include a weekly footwear-fitting clinic and a community welfare clinic.</P>
        <P>The building can be accessed either by steps or a wheelchair ramp.  There are dedicated car parking spaces specifically for the building that are kept free for access, particularly during clinic times.  There is also a dedicated set-down space for wheelchair users.  Within the past year, new directional signs have been made to indicate the access and parking facilities more clearly for persons attending the limb-fitting clinic.</P>
        <P>The interior of the building was redecorated two years ago and the roof covering has also been renewed in recent years.  However, the HSE advises that the building has reached the end of its useful life and, given its age, work carried out on it in recent times has been for maintenance rather than improvement purposes.  In light of these circumstances, the HSE advises that it has no plans to carry out further improvement work on the building.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing reconfiguration of services within the southern hospitals group, the HSE has informed the Minister for Health and Children that it is examining the possibility of an alternative service delivery model in conjunction with the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  These discussions will involve the relocation of the limb-fitting clinic to an alternative site in Cork city.  It is anticipated that these discussions will be concluded at the end of November.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children and the HSE are committed to ensuring the best possible level of service for patients in the Cork area who require limb-fitting services.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s comments to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  While I welcome the fact that a report will be made at the end of November, will the Minister of State convey to the Minister that, rather than having more committees and reports, we need action and a new building, given his statement to the effect that no more money is available to refurbish the building?  I hope that we will have a new service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House, particularly in light of the fact that this matter is his ministerial responsibility.  Earlier this year, many people took the news that the <Col N="879" />public private partnership projects for, among other areas, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street had collapsed as an omen that the environment in which Ireland had been operating and prospering was beginning to change.  For a long time we were able to rely on a booming construction industry, not only to deliver the tax revenues necessary to fund public services, but to deliver specific social and affordable housing projects.  The model of using private industry to meet social needs was often used well and effectively in recent years, but the challenge we now face is our reliance on the industry to meet particular housing needs when the industry is no longer capable of delivering them.</P>
        <P>The news has caused considerable misery and fear among the communities dependent on the housing projects.  The two projects to which I refer are, unfortunately, two fine examples of the concern that arises when public private partnership projects collapse.  The Minister of State and the Department are familiar with the cases to which I refer.  Given that he has visited some of the sites and, from a previous life, is familiar with them, I will not outline the background to the projects.  Rather, I will provide an update on the current situation.</P>
        <P>There is widespread concern that the private industries upon which we have been relying will not be able to deliver the regeneration and social housing projects necessary in Dominick Street and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.  Alongside this fear is an even greater concern that Dublin City Council, given the funding it is receiving and the many other services that it must provide, might not be in a position to provide the projects and to ensure their completion within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
        <P>I attended a public meeting on one of these projects at which a resident made the point that many of the promises regarding services and improvements were made in 1999.  Nine years later the model for the delivery of the services has collapsed.  Dublin City Council is doing much work in this regard because it is the council&rsquo;s responsibility to provide leadership to local communities.  However, given the scale of these housing projects, it is difficult to see how they can proceed without direct support from the Government.</P>
        <P>I understand the capital programme for social housing for next year, as announced in the budget, is &euro;1.4 billion.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on the status of both these projects and indicate whether the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is willing to come to the aid of these communities, if necessary, to ensure the funding is in place to secure the provision of decent housing as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  Following the announcement by Dublin City Council that the particular public private partnership project envisaged for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens would not proceed, my Department has engaged closely with the council to identify the next steps for residents and for the project itself.  As part of this process, I have met representatives of the O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens community and heard their concerns at first hand.</P>
        <P>The council is committed to working with its tenants at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens to explore options for the regeneration.  However, given the economic challenges we now face and the particular difficulties being experienced by the construction sector, progress may not be made quickly enough to meet the reasonable housing requirements of the complex&rsquo;s remaining residents.  I continue to emphasise to the council the need to acquire suitable alternative accommodation in the area for those tenants who are anxious to move.  I am assured by the council that households in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens are being prioritised for transfer under the normal allocations procedures.  To support the council in its efforts to make further progress on this, I am taking into account in future funding allocations the rehousing implications arising from regeneration projects such as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.</P>
        <P>To date, 110 of the original 280 households at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens have moved out of the estate, with more than 30 moving in the past three months.  I understand this approach may <Col N="880" />present a difficult choice for the community.  However, in the current climate, it offers the best and most immediate option for providing better and safer accommodation.  Every household that chooses to move from O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens will be given the opportunity to return to the estate once the regeneration has taken place.</P>
        <P>From a policy perspective, the impact of the changed economic climate and residential housing sector, which were cited as factors influencing the developers&rsquo; decision, are being carefully considered by my Department.  While public investment will continue to be used in delivering the regeneration at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, the path to securing the private investment needed to build a sustainable, mixed-tenure community is not yet clear.  What is certain, however, is that I will not allow a return to sprawling, mono-tenure social housing estates, the make-up of which contributes in no small part to the economic and social deprivation we see in areas such as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.</P>
        <P>Building sustainable communities is at the heart of our housing policy approach.  These are communities of mixed-income households supported by a business and social infrastructure that provides a wide range of services, including training and employment opportunities, within a well-designed physical environment.  It is not possible for the public sector alone to deliver this vision.  If we are to work towards building sustainable communities, we will continue to need the involvement of private enterprise in whatever form that takes.  The current form of public private partnership is just one option my Department and Dublin City Council are examining.</P>
        <P>The council also has established a dedicated task force to identify the next steps for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, both in terms of options available immediately and a longer-term strategy for delivering on the regeneration.  In the short term, consideration is being given to strategic demolition and site clearance to address some of the issues of anti-social behaviour and to facilitate the eventual construction works.</P>
        <P>My Department remains committed to the regeneration at O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens.  In the short term, every effort is being made to move households with an expressed desire to move into better accommodation in the surrounding area.  The longer-term strategy is more challenging given the current economic climate.  However, our response to this challenge must not mean a return to the days of deprived local authority estates.  It is incumbent on us to explore all options to ensure we achieve our objective of building sustainable communities with the necessary income and tenure mix and with a focus on underpinning social and economic opportunities for all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I appreciate his involvement in this issue within the Department.  The community under discussion was abandoned in the past and we must ensure that does not happen again.  As the city council puts together its plans, I hope to raise the matter again with the Minister to ensure this community is looked after.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran.  However, I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not present to respond to this issue, although I understand he is probably on other business.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of the continued viability of waste recycling facilities with particular reference to the facility operated by Waterford County Council in Dungarvan.  This facility has been in existence for almost five years and processes more than 13,000 tonnes of recyclable material per annum.  The sold material produces an annual income of &euro;550,000 which is reinvested in waste recycling services in Waterford.  The facility processes recycled waste not only from the <Col N="881" />Waterford city and county council areas but also from the south Tipperary and Wexford local authority areas as well as other private waste streams.</P>
        <P>I understand the destination markets for the high-quality product from this facility have dried up and that the brokers who were dealing with the local authority in identifying markets are no longer coming up with the goods.  Produce was formerly sent to countries such as Indonesia and China.  I am interested to discover the reasons these markets have folded.  This problem is arising for private as well as public facilities and could put national recycling initiatives in jeopardy.</P>
        <P>The Dungarvan facility cost more than &euro;5 million to build and involved major investment by the local authority.  Waterford County Council has received national awards for its initiative in establishing and operating this facility.  The viability of the facility is now in doubt, which will have a knock-on effect on recycling services in all the local authority areas to which I referred.  The income must be available to ensure recycling and collection routes remain viable.  In the short term, because the destination markets no longer exist, much of this material must be stored by Waterford County Council, representing an added burden and overhead which will put the facility itself and the recycling routes in jeopardy.</P>
        <P>I am interested to hear the views of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on this issue and what he and his Department will do to assist local authorities in this regard.  What is a regional issue could quickly become a national issue which may undo all the good work carried out by local authorities to develop recycling services and facilities.  As a member of the Green Party, I am sure this is at the heart of the Minister&rsquo;s policy and interests.  I hope he can ease the concerns in Waterford and nationally that recycling services will receive the resources and support they require to remain viable.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Coffey for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  Representatives from the waste industry met my Department on Friday, 24 October 2008 to discuss industry concerns regarding the sudden drop in international demand for recycled materials.  Their principal issue of concern was the need to increase rapidly the storage capacity of existing permitted and licensed facilities.  My Department had also been in contact with Repak and the Environmental Protection Agency in advance of last Friday&rsquo;s meeting in regard to this issue.  Consequently, a number of options were put forward to industry at the meeting on Friday.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, is aware of the difficulties raised by Waterford County Council as he has only this morning received a letter from the Waterford County Manager outlining the current position regarding the Materials Recycling Facility, MRF, in Dungarvan.  A letter of reply will issue directly to the Waterford County Manager as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>The options currently being proposed are as follows: licensees can ask the EPA to amend their current licence to allow them to stockpile if they have a suitable location on an existing licensed waste facility; waste operators can find a warehouse where they can store dry recyclables &mdash; a certificate of registration, available from local authorities allows for 1,000 tonnes of material to be stored; waste operators can find a warehouse where they can store dry recyclables but a waste permit from the local authorities allows storage of up to 50,000 tonnes; waste operators can find a warehouse where they can store dry recyclables but a licence from the EPA will allow waste operators to store any amount they want; co-incineration abroad would allow the material to be classified as recovery; a facility in Ireland with an existing Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licence could seek an amendment of their licence to deal with this material.</P>
        <P>These options were also communicated by the EPA to the representatives from the waste industry last Friday.  A circular letter has also issued to each local authority from my Department outlining the issues and the possible options and stressing the need for local authorities <Col N="882" />to give priority to any applications received.  The Minister understands that the waste industry representatives were satisfied that the gravity of the situation was appreciated by the Department, the EPA and the local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste &mdash; Delivering Change,<i> </i>identified a lack of sustainable and economically attractive markets and outlets for recyclable materials as one of the main barriers to an improved and sustainable national recycling performance.  The significant cost and effort associated with the segregation, collection, sorting, pre-treatment and reprocessing of recyclable materials demands that markets be developed to realise the full resource value of all recyclable materials that are reclaimed.  To address these issues the Minister is providing funding to implement the recommendations set out in the Market Development Programme for Waste Resources 2007.  The market development programme is primarily focussed on promoting sustainable demand for recovered materials, supporting the achievement of economies of scale in the production of products made from recycled materials and in identifying the need for additional recycling infrastructure to reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on overseas markets as well as identifying new applications and markets for recyclable material and secondary recycled products.</P>
        <P>The &euro;13 million multi-annual programme is based on a combination of research and development, commercial trials, development of technical standards and the production of various marketing and education and awareness materials.  My Department has responded swiftly to the issues raised and will continue to work closely with all the relevant stakeholders to deal with the changing situation.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  There is confirmation tonight that waste management in this country is a serious matter.  I am glad the Minister and his Department are giving the matter the attention it deserves.  We do not want a national waste management crisis at this time.  </P>
        <P>I do not think that stockpiling of the waste produced by facilities such as the one in Dungarvan is a sustainable answer or solution in the short term.  It is questionable whether incineration in other lands will be, as stated by the Minister, marked as recovery.  This flies in the face of the theory and principle of recycling and re-use.  The facility concerned is producing high quality recycled paper and plastics.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>It is essential that the Minister and his Department give this matter their full attention until a proper and adequate solution is found.</P>
