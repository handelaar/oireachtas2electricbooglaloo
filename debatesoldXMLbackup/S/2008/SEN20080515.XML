	<P Just="Left">Last night the House had an extensive debate on the economy.  Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach to come to the House to explain a matter?  Since the Health Service Executive was established four years ago, the number of senior managers has doubled, if not tripled.  This morning we have learned that the HSE wishes to get rid of 200 of those senior managers.  That is not the way to reform a health service.  Getting rid of a large number of recently appointed managers will impose a huge cost on taxpayers.</P>
        <P>I would also like the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain a matter which I raised last night.  The Government claims it wants to establish centres of excellence in order to benefit patient care.  It is also Government policy, pushed very strongly by the Minister herself, to set up small private hospitals in every village.  These hospitals provide exactly the service which the Government tells us would be dangerous for patients if provided in a public hospital.  This is contradictory, hypocritical and a misleading of the people.  Is the public service fit to provide this service or are private hospitals simply a means of cost cutting?  This policy discriminates against patients who do not have access to private health care.  I would like the Minister to explain this matter.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to comment on the Government&rsquo;s counter motion to Fine Gael&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion last night?  The counter motion acknowledged that house building output had reached unsustainable levels.  At what stage in the past 12 months was it no longer unpatriotic to acknowledge that house building output had reached unsustainable levels?  It is less than a year since the last general election.  For at least 12 months before that we were being told it was unpatriotic to talk down the construction industry or comment on its unsustainability at the time.  The people were misled for electoral purposes.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to explain when the Government changed its views on the unsustainability of the housing market?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent days the Taoiseach raised issues regarding the delivery of public service.  These comments have been interpreted in the newspapers as anti-public service or anti-public service unions.  I do not see them in that way.  The issues raised by the Taoiseach are genuine.  How we deal with them is the question.  No one in the leadership of the trade <Col N="770"/>union movement would have a difficulty with the Taoiseach raising issues.  However, it is timely to look at the matter in the context of what happened today.  I ask Members, particularly on the Government side, to concentrate on this issue.  A couple of thousand people in the health service are wondering about their jobs this morning.  They will worry all day and go home tonight and meet another couple of thousand spouses or partners, all of whom will look at their mortgage arrangements and their futures.  By the time the issue reaches the public domain it will have built up a head of steam.  It will then eventually, belatedly and laterally come to the trade union movement.  Trade union leaders will have to explain this to upset union members who do not know the next step.  This is a classic example of how change should not be managed.  It could be put into a textbook of what not to do.</P>
        <P>What I am now saying will be forgotten and the next time the House will discuss this matter will be in six months time when the problem re-emerges at another level.  The problem created today is that people will take up positions before the matter is explained to them.  One will be on the back-foot trying to deal with it and the changes will never be managed.  I would appreciate if Members on the other side of the House would raise this matter with their parliamentary parties, asking how we get ourselves into these situations.  I want a debate on the public service, the service we need from it and the changes and modernisation processes it requires.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Four weeks from today we will be voting on the Lisbon reform treaty.  I am glad the level of engagement on it from other Members has increased.  The Labour Party launched its campaign last weekend and I canvassed in Kentstown, County Meath.  People were happy to engage on the issues but some confusion exists on taxation, for example.  It will not be affected by the treaty as an article in this week&rsquo;s <i>The Economist </i>magazine makes clear.</P>
        <P>There is also a desire among people to give the Government a bloody nose for its mismanagement of the economy.  We must respond that the only people who lose from a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote are the Irish people.  I am asking people to hold their anger back until next year&rsquo;s local elections when they can then give the Government a bloody nose.  I will be canvassing for the treaty later today.  I hope Members on the Government benches will do their bit too.</P>
        <P>There is growing concern about the impact of fuel price increases.  Due to the downturn in the economy, people are finding it more difficult to pay their fuel bills, particularly those on low incomes, the elderly and lone parents.  Action needs to be taken on this.  My party has drafted a fuel poverty Bill and will hold a consultation later today in Buswells Hotel.  I encourage Members of the Government side to come along.  The VAT returns on fuel bills have risen significantly in the past several years.  Is it possible to reduce it?  The utility companies also need to address this matter.  Last year Bord G&aacute;is made a profit of &euro;160 million but now is seeking a 20% increase in its bills for next year.  Does it not know how much money it has in its accounts?  I am beginning to wonder if a Fianna F&aacute;il cumann treasurer is in charge of the company.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>They would know how much money there is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call for a debate on fuel poverty.  The Government&rsquo;s mechanism for tackling it is through the fuel allowance payments.  Commitments should be given to not only increase the amount of the fuel allowance payment but also to extend its duration.  A small effort was made in this year&rsquo;s budget and will continue in the lifetime of the Government.  This is the best mechanism for dealing with the increases in energy costs.</P>
        <P>The price of a barrel of oil now stands at &euro;126.  Whatever the Opposition may think about the Government&rsquo;s management of the economy, this is one increase for which the Government cannot be accused.  There must be a policy of energy efficiency, better energy management and <Col N="771"/>better insulation of housing.  Those on low incomes deserve a debate on their real needs from this House rather than the scoring of political points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the 2002 general election, the Government made certain decisions regarding the management of the built and natural environment heritage.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was given responsibility for policy on heritage matters whereas the operational role and management of built heritage was given to the Office of Public Works.  In fact it always had been with the OPW as it had the acknowledged expertise and competencies in this regard.  Some confusion has arisen in some areas, however.  Ross Castle and Muckross Abbey are managed by the OPW while Muckross House, Killarney House and Glenveagh Castle are managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I understand there will be a clarification of ministerial responsibilities in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will come to that in one second.</P>
        <P>There seem to be different stories in this morning&rsquo;s newspapers regarding the intended roles of the Minister of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  It might be time for the Government to tidy up the anomalies in the management of the built heritage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Adjournment recently, I raised the issue of the lack of enforceable legislation for dangerous dogs.  I have been made aware of various cases of loose dogs on other&rsquo;s private property.  On Highland Radio yesterday, I commented on a case where a child was badly bitten by a dog on another&rsquo;s property but it did not fall under a dangerous dog category.  The answers I am receiving do not indicate whether there is a gap in legislation.  The Garda and the dog wardens in County Donegal claim they do not have legislation to deal with certain cases of dangerous dogs.  Can the Garda and dog wardens have the existing legislation clarified?  Publication of the animal welfare Bill is 18 months away but I do not want a case of a child being badly injured by a dog before then.</P>
        <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur as B&eacute;arla.  Yesterday the Seanad was interested in devoting three days to debating the Irish language and culture.  Will the Leader consider moving the Seanad for a week to the Donegal Gaeltacht to experience immersion in Irish?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can address that to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the manner in which the proposed changes in the HSE have been handled.  It has been done in a clumsy and unfeeling fashion.  There is a human context to the proposed changes with people facing mortgage repayments and so forth and it must be managed sensitively.  On the other hand, it is appropriate that we examine whether there is excess fat at managerial level that can be cut out.</P>
        <P>Before Christmas I was informed of a case where a woman lobbied for a form of treatment for her child and others who suffer from a particular syndrome.  It was agreed upon and two <Col N="772"/>managers were appointed.  However, the recruitment embargo in public health then came up, leaving two managers being paid, no medical personnel employed and no delivery of service.  It is insane.  If this is widespread in the HSE, I would be glad if some surgery were performed.</P>
        <P>A Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in several weeks will discuss economic partnership agreements.  These operate very significantly to the disadvantage of Third World countries, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  These countries have been bullied and browbeaten.  Mr. Mandelson in particular has been accused very widely of bullying these people.  The Foreign Minister of the Cook Islands accused him of throwing tantrums to force them into a position of accepting a situation that was inimical to the well-being and financial prospects of his country.  The Minister for Trade in Samoa said they suffered the indignity of the rudeness of Commissioner Mandelson to all the Pacific island ministers who were present.</P>
        <P>They are trying to force the reduction or abolition of tariffs on a scale that is far beyond what is required by the World Trade Organisation.  It is sheer economic selfishness and neoliberal economics, and is one of the reasons I have spoken out against the intensification of this policy under the Lisbon treaty.  We already have it.  If the Government wants to prove to the Irish people that we have a humane streak and we will stand out, as we did in the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Very clearly, I have something to ask.  For example, the west African ministers said they deplored the pressure exerted by the European Commission and the African Union said that the process leading to the conclusion of interim economic partnership agreements did not build on what was negotiated earlier and was a result of pressure being exerted.</P>
        <P>I want to make three points.  First, the Government should clearly and specifically ask for independent evaluations and impact assessments of what has been agreed already because this will impact on education, health, social welfare and infrastructure in these countries.  Second, there should be renegotiation of any aspect that is found unsatisfactory and a reduction to the minimum necessary to comply with the WTO.  Third, flexibility should be granted to these developing countries.  We have already colonised them.  The European countries colonised these areas in the 19th century and raped them of their natural resources.  Now, we are continuing this process and using the European Union to drive them further back into economic slavery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter that the Leader might refer to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Since my appointment to the Seanad, I have noticed that the Leader is inundated with a large number of requests daily.  Indeed, I have also tabled numerous issues for him.  I wonder what level of support and structures are in place to come back to the Members of the House with regard to their requests.</P>
        <P>This issue was brought to my attention recently.  I asked the Leader on 24 April about the suggestion that smear testing in our public laboratories was to be outsourced and that the public hospital laboratories had been turned down for reporting on smear tests under the national cancer screening programme.  I indicated that this information should set alarm bells ringing and that the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland had serious reservations about the outsourcing of smear tests, which would have many negative consequences for patients and future pathology training.  I asked whether the Leader would clarify the position and, while I have no doubt he has endeavoured to do so, I have not received any clarity since 24 April.</P>
        <P>I understand from today&rsquo;s newspaper that a US company, Quest, has been awarded the contract for testing cervical smears, although the same company is alleged to be at the centre of a fraud probe in the US in connection with billing of unnecessary tests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the issue on 24 April but I have not received a response.  I have raised other issues and I know many other Members have raised issues.  It is a matter for the CPP that supports and structures should be in place so that when a Member raises an issue, there must be some measure of communication with the Member, perhaps not directly from the Leader as we cannot put everything on his desk, but from the relevant authority with which the issue is being raised and within an appropriate number of days, as agreed by all Members.  In this case, the relevant authority would be the Department of Health and Children.  I put this to the Leader and he might take the opportunity to respond.</P>
        <P>There is a second issue I have raised on a number of occasions, including yesterday.  I asked that an all-party motion be agreed, with or without debate in the House, on the humanitarian issues that pertain in both Burma and China.  I expressed my concern that the aid agencies and diplomats working there to assist people who are being struck &mdash; I gave a figure of 1.8 million people homeless for Burma&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many other Senators are offering to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I would ask that the leaders do something to progress an all-party motion.  The picture in today&rsquo;s newspaper of one innocent child tells the story in its own way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On a point of order, Members should wait for the Leader&rsquo;s reply.  The Leader in the past two days has told the House there is a debate and an all-party motion on Burma next Tuesday.  It happens all the time that Members raise issues on the Order of Business, do not wait for the reply and then raise them again two days later.  It is just&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order.  I call Senator Alan Kelly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recent past, we have listened to various Members of both Houses raise the issue of public sector reform.  It has been raised again in the House today, as it has been on most days recently.  I agree that the House should have a debate on public sector reform although I am not sure I would go along with some of the views of other Members.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the issue of how the Government is going about managing change from a public sector perspective and its mismanagement of the area.  However, I disagree with his acceptance of the views the Taoiseach has expressed in recent days.</P>
        <P>Public sector reform is the buzz phrase being used lately.  We need to define what we are talking about because we can be talking about many different issues.  I am not sure whether there is a consensus on the focus of the reform that is needed.  I found it extraordinary that the Taoiseach was able to stand up yesterday and blame everyone bar his Government for the fact thousands of people are waiting for speech and language therapy.  Half the posts in my area of north Tipperary are not filled and have not been for a number of years.  After 11 years in Government, it is extraordinary and ridiculous that he can blame everyone but his Government.</P>
        <P>In considering public sector reform, we cannot allow employers to target the administrative and clerical grades alone.  A discourse seems to be emanating from many employers in a certain tone, which is not acceptable.  We must look at the management, the quangos, the boards and the level of their performance.  There are a number of questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Kelly supporting the call for a debate?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="774"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already said I am asking for a debate.  I will conclude.  As well as looking at this from the bottom up, we need to look at it from the top down.  We also need to consider the level of management and its performance.  I do not believe the performance level in many areas is up to scratch and it therefore needs to be examined.  To give an example, I have raised on a number of occasions the fact there are a number of tourism agencies in this city.  One of these, the national tourism development authority, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, vacated a building 16 months ago but is still paying rent for it.  Is this acceptable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>As one who worked for the public service for many years, I support the remarks of Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole.  I do not believe anyone with even a scintilla of fair-mindedness would accept that what is happening today and has been happening for some time is the right way to do business.  At the end of the day, we are talking about public service.  The operative word is &ldquo;service&rdquo;, which is or is not being provided.</P>
      
        <P>It would behove the media to support this.  They have been calling for reform <i>ad nauseam</i> but when there is a proposal to do it, everything is wrong.  For example, statistics on the National Treatment Purchase Fund show there is a gap as wide as the Grand Canyon between the number of cases taken by consultants referring patients through the fund and the number of other cases.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am.  There is a lot to be considered, including better local government. Anyone who is a member of a local authority will know very well that the number of people doing certain jobs has been reduced greatly. In some cases there were twice as many doing these jobs some years ago. This must be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader again to invite the Minister responsible for fisheries to the House to have a debate in the presence of Senator Carty, our spokesperson on fisheries.  There is chaos on our rivers and lakes.  Not only are stocks being depleted, they are being eliminated.  In one case in Westmeath, an individual came upon the people responsible and was threatened.  They tried to throw him into the water.  That is a very serious matter.  Those responsible are not locals; they are non-nationals.</P>

	<P>In this week&rsquo;s <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>, a poll shows that 78% of farmers are concerned about the WTO talks.  This is largely due to the Government playing games with the issue.  It has not clarified its position on the veto.  As discussed in the House, the veto does not apply in the case of international agreements on agriculture <i>per se</i>.  The WTO talks pertain to a mixed agreement on goods and services in respect of which the Government does have a veto.  Is this the Government&rsquo;s understanding of the matter and is it prepared to exercise the veto?  Until the Government makes a clear statement on this issue, farmers will remain concerned and will make a link, however false, with the Lisbon treaty.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to clarify his understanding of the exercise of the veto in this round of WTO negotiations and state whether the Government is prepared to exercise it.</P>
        <P>It has been asked whether the veto will remain after the passage of the treaty.  The reality is that the treaty states expressly the Council shall act unanimously for the negotiations and <Col N="775"/>conclusions of agreements in the area of social, educational and health services.  This is the link that enables a veto to apply in the present case but if there is a similar mixed international agreement in the future, this provision would apply and a veto could be exercised.  It is important to recognise that the Government has a veto on a mixed agreement and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The farm organisations and others, including political parties, have made a link between the WTO talks and the Lisbon treaty.  The reality is that there is no legal link although there is a political one.  Farm organisations must be aware that if they make the political link and persist in doing so, there will be consequences.  It is incumbent on the Government to clarify the position.</P>
        <P>The medium-term economic review published this week by the ESRI pointed out the importance of services to our economy.  Agriculture is very important but, according to the review, services now account for 43% of our exports and will account for 60% by 2015.  Therefore, a balanced agreement is important.  We need to achieve a good agreement for agriculture and also for services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Many opinions were expressed on public sector reform.  If one analyses Members&rsquo; views, one will note that each may have a different definition of what is meant by the term &ldquo;public service reform&rdquo;.  Public service reform should be geared specifically towards the delivery of public services in an efficient, cost-effective manner.  Rather than devoting sound bites to the matter the Order of Business, it probably merits a full debate.</P>
        <P>Without doubt there are excellent people in the public service and there are also those who operate sufficiently to justify their positions.  There are also under-performers, as there are in every sector, including the private sector.  The big difference is that, in the private sector, the under-performers do not survive.  Unfortunately, they do in the public service and this needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Cost-effectiveness is an issue.  I was surprised recently by the psychiatric nurses dispute.  I do not want to comment on the issues in question because I believe they should not be raised in these Houses.  There is industrial relations machinery in place that serves as an effective mechanism to address them.</P>
        <P>I noticed in some reports the sickness benefits that apply within the psychiatric service and, I am sure, in many other categories of the public service.  When staff become permanently ill, they receive five sixths of their salary.  There is no way one would buy permanent health insurance in the private sector such that one could obtain 50% of one&rsquo;s salary, not to mention five sixths.  There has been very little highlighting of this issue and it needs to be addressed.  All such practices and unsustainable systems in the public service need to be examined, but in a way that is fair on those who devote their lives to working in the public service.  I request a debate on this subject.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow a debate on inflation?  We had a good debate last night on the economy.  Disparate views were expressed on a range of factors affecting it but we would be better <Col N="776"/>to focus on specific factors that are essential to our economic success.  Perhaps we can influence policy by focusing on them specifically.</P>
        <P>Major price increases are being sought in the energy sector.  Oil prices are affected internationally, as we know, but the prices of electricity and gas are also increasing rapidly.  This will have an adverse effect on people if this continues.  The problem needs to be addressed and I ask that there be a full debate thereon.</P>

	<P>Senator Keaveney suggested that for those of us learning Irish, the Seanad should meet in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  There are a number of us studying French and I propose that a small delegation consider going to Provence or the Riviera.  We would not have any difficulty with that.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh referred to the cost of energy.  An interesting lecture was given on energy policy last week by a Cambridge professor as part of the<b> </b>RDS <i>The Irish Times</i> lecture series.  The lecture was entitled &ldquo;Nuclear Energy &mdash; Why is it on the Agenda?&rdquo;  It should have been entitled, &ldquo;Nuclear Energy &mdash; Why is it not on the Agenda?&rdquo;  We have not discussed nuclear energy because we did not need to in the past.  I was in France recently and noticed the French do not need to worry about it because a large proportion of their energy is derived from nuclear sources.  I am not advocating nuclear energy because we have not even had the debate.  However, it is clearly worthy of debate.</P>
        <P>An article on China in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> states China is building a coal-burning unit every six days.  Moreover, in a single year, the amount of new coal-burning units they are developing equals the total output of the British national grid.  We must find a solution under energy economics, energy saving and climate change to ensure Ireland has the ability to handle this issue and the debate on nuclear energy should not be excluded.  Members should consider holding a debate on energy.  Although debates on energy have been held previously, this time Members should include the possibility that nuclear power should be on the agenda.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday Members had a helpful debate in respect of rural development.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, was very forthcoming on issues under his remit.  He also suggested that Members might invite him back to the House a number of times because the portfolio under discussion is multifaceted and very comprehensive.  Although yesterday&rsquo;s debate had been allocated a reasonable amount of time, Members found they were unable to get to the nitty-gritty of some of the issues in which they were interested.</P>
        <P>Obviously, the news that the Minister will announce details next week of the Leader programme with a budget of &euro;425 million is welcome.  However, Members would like to discuss many issues that fall within that budget.  I refer in particular to the need for diversification into non-agricultural areas of employment, social issues and so on.  While many issues may apply to both urban and rural areas, rural Ireland undoubtedly has specific issues and challenges.  As more than one third of the population lives in rural Ireland, it requires a considerable amount of attention.</P>
        <P>I listened to &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; the other night.  Other Members also may have seen the programme.  It featured Councillor Michael Healy-Rae who to an extent was representing rural Ireland.  It struck me that the points he made regarding one-off housing, planning restrictions and so on struck a chord with what basically was an urban-based audience.  While I was surprised by the good reaction he received, most fair-minded people will agree that a serious issue exists.  One cannot have rural development without people and all Members will have <Col N="777"/>encountered cases that are very difficult to explain.  It is a matter neither of bad planning nor of having no respect for the environment.  It is quite the opposite because the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Senator seek a debate on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.  The Minister should be invited to the House for a number of debates on different issues.  However, an issue such as one-off housing can no longer be sidelined.  Daughters and sons are not allowed to build houses near their families and no good reason is given other than something that is quite vague.  Members must take the bull by the horns in this case and take a stand to help rural Ireland in a practical and proactive way.</P>

	<P>Immediately after the conclusion of the Order of Business this morning, Members will complete their deliberations on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 by debating the Bill&rsquo;s Report and Final Stages.  As Members are aware, this Bill was initiated in this House and in recent weeks, Members have devoted much effort to it.  Many Members spent much time on the Bill, tabled many amendments and debated it at length with the Minister who accepted many of the amendments.  Last week, Members spent several hours debating amendments without concluding Committee Stage, which Stage resumed on Tuesday and, after several more hours of debate, concluded at 6 p.m.</P>
        <P>After the conclusion of Committee Stage, the Bills Office must then print the Bill as amended.  Members were given a deadline of noon yesterday by which to have tabled Report Stage amendments.  Senators Donohoe and Norris and I spent much time going through the amendments.  Although Members had the opportunity to debate the Bill first in this House, the matter has been rushed at the end for no practical reason.  Members have not been able to conclude it properly.  They should be given time to research the issues, respond to the Minister&rsquo;s replies, take up and seek advice on the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding his own advice and to respond.  Yesterday morning, while Members were attempting to table amendments, the electronic version of the Bill was not available on the Internet, which is completely unacceptable.  The Bill probably will sit on the D&aacute;il Order Paper for three months.  At a minimum, I ask the Leader to respond to this issue positively.  Members must have at least a week between Committee and Report Stages to be able to do justice to legislation and in particular to legislation that commences in this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the need for public service reform and the need for an urgent debate.  Yesterday, in his contribution on the Private Members&rsquo; motion, Senator Walsh referred to the fact there should be a pay freeze.  Under no circumstances should a pay freeze be countenanced given the increase in inflation.  In fairness to public servants, they deserve a minimum of a moderate pay rise.</P>
        <P>I will provide one example of the need for urgent reform of the public service.  Earlier this week I met a person who works in a key position in the Health Service Executive and who intends to take maternity leave.  Her job was advertised, interviews were held, a candidate was selected and offered a job and was informed the start date would be 1 May.  The successful applicant then received a telephone call to state that arising from the embargo on staff recruitment, the job would not be filled.  This leads to a lack of service delivery.  To borrow a phrase used yesterday, this constitutes a dereliction of duty to the people.  Public service reform arises in the context of management.  It pertains to the way in which it is being managed rather than to the front-line staff or the public servants who deliver great service every day.</P>

	<P>I do.  The Government has funked the issues since it took office.  Ministers come to this House, mouth off and then run off to do something else.  Leadership and accountability is required from the Government.  What does the Taoiseach mean by public service reform?  To whom is he referring?  The people on the front line should not be blamed.  Rather, one should blame those who implement change and who created the quangos and agencies that are in place.</P>

	<P>It is clear that public sector reform now means giving the Health Service Executive &euro;30 million to sack 1,000 people who work under its auspices at present.  This morning in the D&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste replied to questions from the Opposition by stating the Government was considering an application by the HSE for &euro;30 million for the aforementioned 1,000 redundancies.  According to Government sources, it is as though there is no connection between the HSE and the Government.  However, the Government created the bureaucratic nightmare that is the executive.  This body is almost impossible to deal with from a customer service point of view and is equally difficult to deal with from a public representative&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Members are being asked to believe it is a stand-alone authority.  I revert to a point I have made in the House previously, namely, that body was created to shield the Minister for Health and Children of the day from criticism and this is not good enough.  Moreover, it is not good enough to announce such plans on the airwaves without any consultation with the trade union movement.  This is a disgrace.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised a point in this House approximately two weeks ago regarding the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and contracts it was offering in respect of ferry transport services from offshore islands to the mainland.  I raised the issue regarding west Cork in particular, where the European TUPE regulations on the transfer of undertakings to guarantee workers&rsquo; rights and protect their standards were removed from one such contract.  However, the Northern Ireland Administration offered a contract in respect of the Rathlin Island ferry in which the same clause was inserted.  Has the Leader given consideration to my request to allow Members time to debate this issue with the Minister in respect of ferry contracts?</P><Col N="779"/>
        <P>I support Senator Brendan Ryan&rsquo;s point.  While I do not believe the Leader intends any malice in this regard, it is neither good enough nor practical to take Committee and Report Stages within a 24-hour period when the deadline for amendments after Committee Stage is 12 noon and Members still do not have access to an electronic version of the amended Bill to deal with.  This is creating all kinds of nightmares for staff, both in the Bills Office and in political parties, who have to deal with such a short timeframe.  I am sure the Leader will consider this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much debate on the Lisbon reform treaty and today an article in the<i> Irish Independent  </i>states that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign will spend approximately &euro;3.5 million in spreading its message.  That campaign includes the Libertas group which will spend excessive amounts of money on the same errand.  I am not sure where this group comes from nor how it is funded.  Many people would like to know, however, how it is funded and to whom it is accountable.  The message that Libertas is putting out during this campaign is confusing the electorate.  I call on that group and on other organisations calling for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to stop scaremongering and to tell the truth.  One of the areas in which Libertas is raising fear is that of taxation, its message being that there is a threat to the taxation rate set in this country.  That is untrue because unanimity is totally protected in all taxation matters.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has addressed that issue correctly and he is the man we should be listening to, not to those who are scaremongers.</P>
        <P>With regard to baggage charges in our airports, we are now in the summer season and many families and individuals may wish to go abroad on holidays.  People travel more often than before and therefore they look for the best deals by booking on-line with airlines, travel agents and so on.  The difficulty is that airport baggage charges are increasing.  Last week Aer Lingus increased its charge for a bag from &euro;12 to &euro;18.  These are hidden charges which consumers do not see when booking a flight.  They are hit with excessive charges if they do not book on-line and so must pay at the airport.  This is an area that affects very many families on low budgets across the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call on the Leader to have the matter investigated in the House.  The Consumer Protection Agency has a role but I believe that this House should invite the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come here and that we should examine this issue in the next number of weeks.  The Leader has an interest in this matter and I call on him to do this, given that it is a time when many people are considering booking flights.  This morning a company advertised a seat sale that is valid until midnight tonight.  There is indeed a seat sale but when a person gets to the baggage situation he or she is penalised for extra baggage and associated charges.  This area must be investigated because consumers are being attacked and are walking blindfolded into those charges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls by other Senators for debates on various matters.  I entirely support what Senator Ryan said this morning about the lack of time allowed between the different Stages for the Bill on the Dublin transport authority.  The thinking behind its current handling is that if it is done in this way its progress through the Seanad will be accelerated.  This is counter-productive.  What happens is that because of the lack of time between the different Stages, when it comes to putting down amendments the temptation is to restore all the amendments that were discussed only days before.  This is because there is so little time, first to get the legislation and then to consider it properly.  I suspect that the Stage of debate to take place in the House this afternoon will take a lot longer than it should because on this side of the House there has not been the amount of time needed to do what the Government and the people expect of Members.  I am sure this does not happen because of <Col N="780"/>any malice on the Leader&rsquo;s part but it is getting in the way of Senators performing a proper role regarding important legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; made reference to the debate on community affairs that took place yesterday with the<b> </b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I took an opportunity to listen to some of this debate and it seemed to be a very interesting and productive discussion.  I believe that when such debate is engaged in the future we should recognise that issues regarding community life are not exclusively rural.  I would appreciate if, during any debates we set forth on community life, the terms of reference would permit Senators to raise issues that concern the other two-thirds of the population.  I do not denigrate in any way what was discussed yesterday but there are many other topics and issues affecting community life in urban settings that merit discussion as well.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the current funding of housing projects in the State.  Most major public housing projects are being delivered through public private partnerships.  There are four such in my constituency.  Of late there are rumours that developers are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver this work because of the current credit crunch.  Confirmation of this has appeared in some newspapers today.  I would appreciate if the Leader scheduled a debate on how this country funds these projects and  in particular, on the use of public private partnerships.  The aim is to ensure that  good use might be made of these in the changed economic environment.  While this might appear to be a dry, technical topic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am.  We should remember that the people who are suffering because of delays are those who have been looking for new housing, for years in many cases.  The carpet is now being pulled out from under their feet due to circumstances beyond their control.  I want to see how the Government will respond to this and I would appreciate a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to inquire from the relevant Department concerning the financial regulation of transactions taking place in the markets, such as those in France which were the work of one bank official.  The interesting thing about that situation was that so much money was involved without any regulation and yet other matters are regulated to a high degree.  These things affect us and this could happen again.  It has happened concerning the re-packaging of loans by a couple of banks in the sub-prime lending market.  In the ongoing Irish and European context there does not appear to be a system to regulate the very large amounts of money that are invested at high risk and thus ensure that the liquidity and the safety of banks are kept at a safe level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole and Norris have called for another debate on issues regarding the Health Service Executive, particularly its announcement of reduction of staff levels in management and front line staff.  I have no difficulty in assigning time for this.  Senator Twomey called for a debate with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, concerning housing levels and the 80,000 houses that were under construction over the past number of years and the 25% of the population who have moved into new houses over the past ten years.  We can examine all of this. There is great value for anyone who is trying to buy a house and there will never be as good a bargain as exists on the market today.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;called for an urgent debate on the public service.  I have no difficulty with allocating time for that.  There is much merit in having such a debate at the earliest opportunity and I will facilitate the Senators&rsquo; request.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan and Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill expressed their views on the Lisbon treaty, with Senator Hannigan correctly pointing out that the referendum will be held on this day four weeks.  They also spoke about the tactics being used by various parties.  There will be no difficulty in allocating further time for a discussion on the treaty so the public can be informed to the best of the Senators&rsquo; abilities.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan, Senator Boyle and Senator Quinn sought a debate on energy costs.  This is a serious challenge facing the nation at present, and it is not of our making.  All sides of the House realise this because energy costs were a major challenge when the Opposition was in Government many years ago.  We can only learn from their experience.  It has been painful, to say the least.  We must focus on alternative energy.</P>
        <P>When we have the debate on energy and energy costs, we should also examine the alternatives.  I understand an advanced technological plan is being put together by the Mulcahy group at present.  If that plan is feasible, it will solve Ireland&rsquo;s energy problems for hundreds of years.  Being an island nation is a huge advantage with regard to wave power and if the plan comes to fruition, it will be a leader not only in Europe but the world in confronting the ills of the energy challenge.  The energy challenge is serious because when energy costs increase, food costs also increase and the poorer sections of our community are badly affected.  Nobody wants that to happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan asked me to clarify who is the Minister for arts.  It is Deputy Martin Mansergh, a distinguished former Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, who was in the House last night. <Col N="782"/> We are very proud of his new appointment.  As a Deputy for the Tipperary South constituency he will look after the Munster area.  Why should he not?</P>

	<P>Where is the one who does not love the land where they are born?  The Senator, along with his friend, Deputy Healy-Rae, will be pleased to hear who will be looking after them for the next four years.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney spoke about the problem being experienced in County Donegal.  It is not possible to indicate at this stage when the animal health Bill, to update the animal diseases legislation, will be published.  However, I will keep the House informed as the Bill progresses through drafting.  The Senator also had a suggestion as to where the Seanad should sit.  That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If the Senator wishes to pursue her suggestion, she should write to the Cathaoirleach, who is the Chairperson of the committee.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked me to convey his views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to tariffs and the other issues he highlighted.  I will do that.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely again asked about questions he raised on the Order of Business and he also raised the issue of support.  The Taoiseach has back-up in the D&aacute;il, with civil servants sitting at his right hand side when he takes the Order of Business and Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  The job of the Leader in the Seanad is to order the business of the House and to take note of queries and urgent matters raised by Senators and pass them to the various Ministers, which I do each day through my secretariat.  There is also the issue of urgent debates on matters of importance to the nation.  We decide that on a weekly basis and I consult with the leaders of all groups for half an hour before the first sitting day each week.  We do that in an orderly manner and try to secure consensus on an all-party basis.  The system has been working successfully.</P>
        <P>However, I will take Senator Callely&rsquo;s proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Perhaps the Seanad reform proposals could address the matters which the Senator raised this morning.  I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of his request and will endeavour to progress it.</P>
        <P>We will consider Seanad reform after the summer recess.  It is one year into the term of this Seanad and we have established the areas that need to be addressed.  There is a new Taoiseach and Government in place, so it would be timely to consider Seanad reform in October and November and perhaps produce a proposal for Government before Christmas.  It is a matter on which the assistance of all Senators will be required.  We wish to make our presence more relevant and to help the Government, Departments and the various Ministers to ensure the country&rsquo;s future success.  I look forward to receiving the views and proposals of all Senators on this issue.</P>
        <P>The debate on Burma will take place after the Order of Business next Tuesday.  Senator Callely suggested that the earthquake in China be included in that debate.  We have seen the devastation being endured by the poor people of China on our television screens.  It is appalling and one&rsquo;s heart goes out to them.  It makes one realise how fortunate we are that this part of the world does not have the dreadful events being experienced by those poor unfortunate people.  I will include China in that debate on Tuesday.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn sought a debate on fish stocks in the lake county and the abuses occurring there.  I had put in a request to the Minister but as there has been a change of personnel, it will probably be a few weeks before the new Minister&rsquo;s diary will facilitate a visit to the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Regan spoke about the World Trade Organisation negotiations.  This is due to be discussed next Wednesday in the presence of the new Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith.  Various <Col N="783"/>points were made this morning by a number of Senators, particularly Senator Regan, about our veto.  I am sure the Minister will clarify the issue on Wednesday.  Senator Regan, along with Senator Jim Walsh, also sought a debate on the ESRI report on the medium-term economic outlook.  That would be timely and I will allocate time for it.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator Donohoe spoke of the successful debate yesterday with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on rural development.  I can organise another debate on the subject.  When one considers that one third of the population lives in rural Ireland while 50% of the other two thirds of the population are people from rural areas living in the cities and larger towns, most people can identify with this issue, although the success in our quality of life is due to people from all parts of Ireland, be they rural or urban.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of one-off rural housing.  It would be timely to examine this issue.  We might consider the experience with the Westmeath county development plan.  A new county development plan was produced for 2008 to 2013.  The councillors had another look at it a month later, realised the definitions and terms might not be what they had intended, appointed a sub-committee with representatives from each political party and fine-tuned the plan and brought it in last Monday week.  My dear colleague, the late Tom Cowley, who died last week, was one of those who popularised the idea that young people deserve to be able to live in the place of their birth.  Most Members of the Seanad support that idea, regardless of whether they come from rural or urban areas.  Given that local authority members elect us as legislators to this House, we need to support them when they put these plans in place.  I agree with the request made by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Donohoe for a lengthy debate, perhaps a half-day debate, with the Minister on how best to meet the challenges we will encounter in this area.</P>
        <P>Senators Ryan and Donohoe are 50% right and 50% wrong with the point they make about the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008.  The first day of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill was a week ago.  I have been impressed by the contributions made by all Senators, including transport spokespersons, during the debate on the legislation.  The Minister accepted amendments on Committee Stage because he was impressed by the genuine proposals being made.  When the Committee Stage debate did not conclude a week ago, it had to be resumed on Tuesday of this week.  Senators Ryan and Donohoe have suggested that the timeframe that was set out did not afford them a chance to propose amendments, for genuine reasons.  I remind the House that as the Bill was initiated here, it will return to this House after it has been considered by the D&aacute;il.  We are aware that the Minister has an open mind on the Bill.  When legislation is being handled by a Minister with such an attitude, it is worth making proposals when it returns to the House.  I ask Senators for their co-operation in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan suggested that the Bill might stay in the D&aacute;il for three or four months, but I understand that the D&aacute;il is likely to conclude its consideration of it before the summer recess.  It will return to this House in the first week of July, which is the final Seanad sitting week before the recess.  I assure the House I will grant Senators Ryan and Donohoe any extra time that is needed at that stage.  I thank them for their participation and co-operation in respect of this legislation.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that another Bill, the Broadcasting Bill 2008, will be initiated in the Seanad next week.  It will be considered by Senators on Second Stage next Thursday.  It is uplifting that so much legislation is being initiated in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy asked me to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come to the House to discuss ferry services and contracts.  I have no difficulty setting time aside for such a discussion.</P><Col N="784"/>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill called on the Minister for Transport to participate in a debate in the Seanad on the issue of airport baggage charges.  There have been many changes in the travel industry over the past 20 years.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair has made an immeasurable contribution to Ireland in that time.  Ryanair has added to the attractiveness of Ireland as a tourist destination.  When Irish people living in other countries wish to come home, they can do so less expensively.  If my local team was in a county final 20 years ago, people could not afford to come home for the replay if the match ended in a draw.  We now have affordable travel, thankfully.  I accept that certain companies are trying to get a little extra from passengers by imposing baggage charges.  I have no difficulty setting time aside so Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill can discuss this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe has suggested that the House should debate the issues of house funding, public private partnerships and long waiting lists.  It is a very good proposal.  We will set time aside for a discussion.  Perhaps Fine Gael will use its one remaining Private Members&rsquo; business before the summer recess to initiate a debate on these matters.  It will be difficult to meet all Senators&rsquo; requests before the recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin highlighted the dangers which may result from the serious position in which banks throughout the world currently find themselves as a consequence of sub-prime lending.  The Senator mentioned a particular example that was highlighted by a bank official.  I have no difficulty with having a debate on this subject.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House.  I wish to inform Senators that there is an error in the first printed version of the Bill as amended by the Seanad on Committee Stage.  In accordance with Committee Stage amendment No. 84 which was agreed by the House, section 80(3) of the Bill should have been deleted.  It was retained in the Bill in error, however, when it was first printed after Committee Stage.  A reprinted version of the Bill was circulated to all Senators yesterday.</P>
        <P>I remind the House that each Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  I should also point out that on Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.</P>
     </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" Just="Left">In page 12, line 23, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 24</i>, <i>sections 36</i> to <i>40</i> and <i>section 80</i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 24</i> and <i>sections 36</i> to <i>40</i>&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>This technical amendment amends the wording used in the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in section 2.  It deletes a reference in the definition to a later section that was deleted on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 12, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the borough of Drogheda and&rdquo;.</P><Col N="785"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I raised this matter on Second and Committee Stages.  The Minister has included places such counties Meath and Kildare in the definition of the greater Dublin area but he has not included Drogheda which has developed to the extent that it is almost seamless with Dublin.  I live in the northern end of the Fingal administrative area, which is quite close to Drogheda.  People are aware of that.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another point which the Minister of State might consider in terms of including Drogheda at this stage.  The people of Balbriggan, which is a massive growth area, who commute by train to Dublin city centre do so by way of the Drogheda commuter line.  There is no access to the DART which stops at Malahide.  The same applies to Skerries, where I live, as well as to Rush, Lusk and Donabate.  The population of those areas has grown tremendously in recent years and train commuters all use the Drogheda line.</P>
        <P>People who travel by bus from Balbriggan to the city centre have two options, but in the main they use the 101 route, which is a Bus &Eacute;ireann service from Drogheda or Dundalk.  I see the logic of including places like Kildare and Meath, but there is also a case to be made for Drogheda and north Fingal where commuters use the transport services to which I have referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments which point to an important aspect of this legislation.  If one is inside the greater Dublin area one will get a particular focus and service from the Dublin transport authority, which will not be available to those outside that area.  The competent national authority for people living outside the greater Dublin area is the Department of Transport.  A potential vulnerability could be created if two different organisations are looking after transport needs.  How will we ensure that integration is delivered at all times?  After all, that is one of the main objectives of this legislation.  How will we ensure the introduction of integrated ticketing allowing access to various modes of linked-up transport?  Senator Ryan referred to the number of rail commuters using the Drogheda line into Dublin, which merits this change being made.  I am happy to support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their comments but I understand this matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  On that occasion the Minister, Deputy Dempesy, indicated he was anxious to maintain a coherence between the greater Dublin area &mdash; as mentioned in section 3 &mdash; the existing regional authority and regional planning boundaries.  There is a general acceptance of what the greater Dublin area is.  I do not deny that a number of people currently commute from Drogheda.  However, I was a local authority member for years and in the accepted sense, particularly at regional authority level, there is a fairly clearly defined acceptance of what constitutes the greater Dublin area.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, wants to maintain that coherence so that people in the various bodies do not refer to different areas when they talk about the greater Dublin area.  </P>
        <P>There is a provision in section 3(<i>c</i>) to extend the geographical area of the greater Dublin area by ministerial order, should that prove to be necessary in future.  I request the Senator to withdraw the proposed amendment.  We want to keep to a standard definition and understanding of what constitutes the greater Dublin area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to press the amendment but I wish to comment on the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  The legislation is trying to deal with the transport requirements of regular commuters into the Dublin region.  It is wrong to exclude somewhere like Drogheda and not take into account the needs of commuters in the north Fingal area who use Drogheda commuter line trains to reach Dublin.  We have already dealt with subsection (<i>c</i>), but not to include such places now is putting things off and waiting for some future date when we will <Col N="786"/>suddenly realise that we should have acted thus on day one.  I think it is a mistake but I do not intend to press the amendment. </P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 3 arises from committee proceedings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment seeks to change section 10(<i>a</i>).  On Committee Stage, the Minister agreed to revert to this matter on Report Stage with a Government amendment implementing Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s suggested rewording of section 10(<i>a</i>) once no legal issues arose over what was suggested.  I am happy to report that no such issues arose and this amendment basically gives effect to the change of wording.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Before commenting on the amendment, I should say that it was remiss of me not to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and congratulate him on his new appointment.  I am conscious that in recent times the Department of Transport has not had a Minister of State, and I wish him well in his new job.  It is good to have a Dublin-based Minister of State in the Department who is aware of the relevant issues in the city and its suburbs.</P>
        <P>I welcome the change the Government has made in this amendment as a result of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  I know it is a small change but it is welcome nonetheless because it recognises that, of itself, transport can play a role in increasing the rate of economic growth.  Given the current economic circumstances, that is worth recognising.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 arises from committee proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
        <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 14, line 33, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) promote increased recourse to cycling and walking as a means of transport, and&rdquo;.</P>
   
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A discussion took place on Committee Stage, which was prompted by Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s proposed amendment highlighting the importance of cycling and walking in the wider transport context.  On that occasion, Senator Donohoe suggested that the Bill, as initiated, may have treated cyclists and walkers as being of secondary concern.  That was certainly not the intention.  The provisions regarding cycling and walking are included at several different points in the Bill.  However, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, agreed that a higher level of prominence should be given to the matter and this amendment achieves that.  As it addresses the concerns raised by Senators Donohoe and Fitzgerald, I ask them to withdraw their amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the change the Minister of State has made through this amendment.  I will not move amendment No. 5 in recognition of that change.  An important theme in our contributions on Committee Stage concerned the need for a joined-up and coherent approach to facilitating cycling within the greater Dublin area.  The example we cited was <Col N="787"/>of cycle lanes not being linked up.  While it may seem like a negligible matter, cycle lanes that suddenly disappear can discourage people from using bikes instead of cars.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>f</i>) demographic, economic, social, travel and transport trends in the GDA,&rdquo;.</P>
      
    
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes some additional text to section 12(5)(<i>f</i>).  On Committee Stage the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, agreed to revert with a preferred wording to incorporate the spirit of the amendment tabled by Senator Paschal Donohoe.  This was to include a specific mention of transport and travel trends within the greater Dublin area to which the authority shall have regard when preparing its transport strategy.  I suggest this amendment achieves its purpose and I hope Senators will accept this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not move amendment No. 7 in recognition of what amendment No. 6 achieves.  The thinking behind the amendment is that for too long our transport strategy has been preoccupied with linear routes in an attempt to get people in and out of areas.  I was concerned that was the focus of this legislation, whereas we know there is also a need for a radial transport strategy for a given area and not just a linear plan.  The change proposed by the Minister of State achieves this and I will not press my amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 8 is one of a series of three Government amendments which oblige the authority to consider the views of the people and organisations with which it consults when preparing its transport strategy at section 12, its integrated implementation plan at section 13 and its strategic traffic management plan at section 64.  The amendments arise from amendments tabled by Senator Paschal Donohoe on Committee Stage and meet the intent of the Senator&rsquo;s proposals.  Therefore, I request that Senators withdraw amendment No. 9.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not move amendment No. 9 in light of Government amendment No. 8.  The spirit of this amendment and others was to try to increase the accountability of a potentially very powerful organisation to the Oireachtas, local authorities and to individuals and communities affected by its work.  While the proof of the extent of this accountability will be apparent once the organisation is up and running, the amendment proposed by the Government does make some progress towards this end, therefore, I will not move my amendment.</P>

Amendment No. 11 is a logical alternative to amendment No. 10; amendment No. 15 is a logical alternative to amendment No. 14; and amendment No. 37 is a logical alternative to amendment No. 36.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 10, 11, 14, 15, 36 and 37 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>

	<P>As with the previous group of amendments this amendment is one of a series of three Government amendments placing an onus on the authority to seek written submissions while preparing its various plans and strategies.  The amendment seeks to provide the intent of amendments which were tabled by Senator Brendan Ryan on Committee Stage and which the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, agreed to consider.  I hope these amendments address the Senator&rsquo;s concerns and I ask for amendments Nos. 11, 15 and 37 to be withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, to delete lines 45 to 48 and in page 17, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(12) The Minister may, in relation to a draft transport strategy submitted to him or her&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">In all cases the Minister shall present the draft transport strategy to a Committee of the Oireachtas for approval.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One of the main themes of our critique of this legislation at its earlier Stages was to try to ensure the correct mechanisms are in place to deliver accountability of this new body to the Oireachtas.  Much time is spent in this Chamber discussing organisations and issues over which the Oireachtas no longer has the control and power which it believes it should have.</P>
        <P>The organisation that will be established by this legislation will be especially powerful within the greater Dublin area in terms of its ability to intervene and perform roles previously carried out by other organisations and in terms of its ability to override such organisations.  This amendment represents our proposal to strengthen the link between Oireachtas committees, the Members of the Oireachtas and the proposed new organisation.  The amendment intends that when the Minister for Transport agrees the proposed draft transport strategy which will guide the new organisation, he or she will submit it to the Oireachtas for consideration so that Members have an opportunity to makes their views known to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, indicated on Committee Stage it is not possible to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  The purpose of this amendment seems to be to allocate responsibility to the Oireachtas for approving the proposed authority&rsquo;s draft transport strategy.  I am concerned the amendment transgresses the accepted boundary between the executive function of Government and the legislative and oversight roles of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not consider such a transgression appropriate or desirable.  The function of the Oireachtas is to provide an oversight role, it is not about control and power, which were the words used by Senator Paschal Donohoe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everyone, including political parties and public representatives, will be entitled to make his or her views known during the preparation of the authority&rsquo;s draft transport strategy.  However, the authority will be responsible for preparing the strategy and it is the Minister for Transport who will be responsible for approving it.  The Minister will, in turn, be accountable to the Oireachtas for any decision taken in respect of the strategy.  The relevant committee of the Oireachtas, currently the Joint Committee on Transport, will be able to call in the authority at any time.  It will also have the power to make recommendations to the authority and there is provision for this in section 41.  This power can be exercised when the authority is preparing its draft transport strategy if the committee decides it is appropriate to do so.  That is the position and I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.  While it is for the transport committee to exercise its power and its influence to call in the authority, it is the Minister for Transport who is responsible for approving the plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have not discussed the control and power of the Oireachtas over the proposed Dublin transport authority.  I fully understand the role of the Minister, his or her executive power, its limitations and the division of power between the Minister and the Oireachtas.  I welcome this new organisation that we will establish, but I predict both sides of this and the other House will, at some stage in the future, blame the new authority for what is happening.  It is inevitable.  It is almost certain that the same Members will ask why they do not have the power to influence the decisions it is making or the power to understand why it is making those decisions.  I am pretty sure those points and complaints will not be confined to our side of the House.  They will be widely shared by the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues.  While I am disappointed the Minister of State is unable to accept the amendment, I will not press<?oasys _jy ?>it.</P>

It would be preferable to have a separation between the governing board and the management in the form of the chief executive to ensure accountability.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on his previous visit to the House indicated that is changing and the trend is in a different direction.  The brief surveys I have carried out in the time since Tuesday indicate this is the way to do it.  I disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s response.  However, I do not intend to press it today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment, as proposed, would undermine one of the central tenets of the Bill which is the establishment of a strong, independent, strategic body that will <Col N="792"/>have responsibility for all surface transport in the greater Dublin area.  The inclusion of members of existing public transport authorities in the membership of the authority is not being considered.  Furthermore, as the authority will also assume responsibility for securing the provision of public transport passenger services by means of contractual arrangements as outlined in Part 3, it would be inappropriate to have members of the public transport service providers acting also as members of the contracting authority.  In the circumstances I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 19, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(3) On the election of the person who is directly elected to the position of Mayor of Dublin, or such other comparable position, that person, and their successors, shall be the Chairperson of the Authority for such period as they hold the office of Mayor.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One of the main themes in the debate is the need for this organisation to be accountable.  A major change we are all expecting and looking forward to in local government is the creation of the role of a directly elected lord mayor for the region of Dublin.  One of the important elements in ensuring this new office will be effective is to give it the powers and the ability to make a difference to the lives of the people it will represent.  It would be disastrous if a major effort was put in to creating a directly elected post and not give it the necessary powers to make a difference to the lives of the people it will represent.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt transport is one of the main issues for the people of Dublin.  Given that this organisation will have the ability to develop strategy that will make a major difference to the people of the greater Dublin area and the power to implement that strategy, it is imperative that the new post is created in such a way that the office holder will sit on the board, have an opportunity to lead it and is the chairperson of the authority.  If this organisation is to work, we must ensure the right element of accountability is in place.  More importantly, if the role of a directly elected lord mayor for Dublin is to work, we must ensure that office has the necessary power, and this amendment is vital to making that happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear what the Senator is saying but the amendment  attempts to amend the Bill now on the basis of what might happen in the future.  It is not necessary at this stage.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has just published the Green Paper on local government reform and it includes a proposal for a directly elected mayor for the Dublin region who may become the chair of the Dublin Transport Authority.  However, the Green Paper is the subject of consultations and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has indicated that he will bring forward a White Paper on that issue later this year.  Given that the process is at an early stage, it is premature to insert in the Bill a provision along the lines suggested.  We should await the outcome of the process currently under way in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In any event, legislation will be required to give effect to the local government reform and the changes in the governance of the DTA will be implemented at that stage.  That will be part of the Department of the Environment, <Col N="793"/>Heritage and Local Government Bill.  What the Senator seeks in his amendment may be in order in the future but the process will happen outside of what he suggests.  I ask him not to press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>We will press this amendment.  It is the role of legislation to anticipate what could happen in the future.  Government policy clearly articulates that this is something it wants to happen in its term of office.  One of the Government&rsquo;s partners in government is very committed to making this happen because it is a good idea.  If it is done properly it should make a major difference to the lives of the people living in and around Dublin.  </P>
        <P>I witnessed the excitement and interest generated by the mayoralty election in London.  One of the main issues in that election was congestion charging and public transport.  Much less commented on but equally important was the turnout in interest from mayoralties in places likes Middlesbrough, which have directly elected lord mayors also.  There was a high turnout in those elections because the office of the directly elected lord mayor was meaningful.  In this amendment we are trying to ensure that when this office is set up it can make a difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, if that happens legislation will be brought forward at that stage.  Any change that may seem likely or possible will happen at that stage.  It is neither necessary nor sensible to do it now.  I understand what the Senator is saying.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Government generally will be delighted to have the Senator&rsquo;s wholehearted support for what is contained in the programme for Government, and if this comes about after the formal consultation process, new legislation will be brought forward and the change will be made at that stage.  We cannot include in legislation everything that might or might not happen in the future.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(5) The Authority shall be required to provide an account of the continuing necessity for the subsidiary to remain in being on the expiration of two years from the date of its establishment.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There has been a dramatic increase in the number of organisations, some 16 in total, involved in transport provision for the Dublin area.  The Bill provides for the authority to establish its own subsidiary organisations to deal with specific or technical issues.  This amendment seeks to acknowledge the ability and power of the authority to do so but to ensure any such established organisations account to the authority regularly and allow it to determine if they are required.</P>
        <P>The authority is being established to deal with the proliferation of bodies and agencies dealing with commuter problems.  It is, therefore, appropriate the authority does not generate unnecessary bodies.  The amendment will allow the authority to review any bodies it establishes to decide whether to prolong or terminate them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concerns but cannot accept the amendment.  Under section 25, the authority must receive the consent of the Ministers for Transport and Finance before establishing any subsidiary.  Such consent would not be given lightly.  Both Ministers would have to be satisfied there were real and substantial reasons for establishing a subsidiary.  Also, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s code of practice for the governance of State bodies sets down clear requirements as to the information needed before a decision is made <Col N="795"/>on a proposal to establish a subsidiary.  This includes a requirement for a full business case and a range of financial information.  The corporate governance permissions of the code apply to subsidiaries in the same way as to parent bodies with the same accountability.  Any subsidiary must be established under and comply with the Companies Act.  There is ample scope under section 41 for the Committee of Public Accounts, or any other Oireachtas committee, to raise concerns with the authority regarding establishment or the continuing in operation of any of its subsidiaries.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(6) Pending the designation of the Authority for the purposes of public access to disclosures under any other statutory code, a disclosure under this section or <i>section 36</i> or <i>37</i> shall be recorded in a register together with particulars of any interest of members of the Authority or persons to whom <i>section 36</i> or <i>37</i> applies, and the register shall be available to public inspection during office hours.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment provides for a mechanism for public information regarding interests or conflicts of interest on the part of members and staff of the authority.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, in response to a similar amendment on Committee Stage, said the authority would be designated for the purpose of access to disclosures under the Standards in Public Office Act.  The Report Stage amendment has been adjusted to make clear it will only apply pending such designation.  That should relieve the Minister of any difficulty associated with the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport indicated on Committee Stage that disclosure requirements in respect of the authority will be met through the role of the Standards in Public Office Commission which implements the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Standards in Public Office Act.  The current procedure involves the Minister for Finance making a regulation to add new bodies to the existing list of prescribed public bodies at the beginning of each year.  The order specifies which designated directorships and positions in public bodies are required to make a declaration of interests to the commission.</P>
        <P>Once established the authority will be added to the list of prescribed bodies at the earliest opportunity.  This is similar to the approach used in bringing new bodies under the remit of the Freedom of Information Act.  This is the preferred approach to such disclosure.</P>

	<P>The purpose of section 43, based on provisions in section 19 of the Roads Act 1993, is to ensure no one can seek to claim damages from, <i>inter alia,</i> the authority or a subsidiary of the authority in circumstances where the authority or its subsidiary fails to conform or comply with its statutory functions.  In other words, we are ensuring that no one can take any action against the authority or its subsidiary for something it did not do.  It is important to recognise there will be no bar on anyone taking an action regarding alleged damage arising from the exercise by the authority, or a subsidiary, of its statutory functions.  That is the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>

	<P>I regret I cannot accept the amendment.  This chapter of the Bill supports the continued provision by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann of the existing subvented bus services in the greater Dublin area.  It also provides that any future growth in the market for subvented services will be addressed by way of public service contracts which will be granted following open tendering, which will allow private operators and Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann, as appropriate, having regard to the geographical remit that applies to their operations, to submit tenders.  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, as well as any other public transport operators, will have the opportunity to compete for such open tendered services in compliance with EU Regulation 1370/2007, which comes into effect on 3 December 2009 and will apply in respect of any public service contract for the provision of subvented public bus passenger services.</P>
        <P>Members will recall that in addressing issues in regard to this chapter raised during the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister set out the general background of Regulation 1370/2007.  In particular, he referred to the fact that the chapter had been crafted with the direct involvement of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to ensure compliance with the provisions contained in the EU regulation.  This amendment would, in effect, give priority to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in the consideration of proposals to issue contracts for new public bus passenger services.  That approach would not be in compliance with Regulation 1370/2007 and, in these circumstances, I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While the new EU Regulation 1370/2007 will have full effect from 3 December 2019, following the ten-year period in which it takes effect, member states are being encouraged to take measures to gradually comply with its provision.  This chapter of the Bill provides for the first time in Irish transport law a contracting regime to govern the subvention of public bus and rail passenger services in respect of which public service obligations apply.</P>
        <P>Section 52 establishes that the three CIE companies have exclusive rights to provide the services that are the subject of State financial support and for growth in respect of rail services, subject to future legislative change.  In the case of bus services, the exclusive right is also subject to the grant of bus route licences to private bus operators under the Road Transport Act 1932.  Direct award contracts will be entered into with the three CIE companies to support the provision of the funded services that are the subject of those exclusive rights &mdash; this is what they currently do.</P>
        <P>The section provides that the initial direct award contracts in respect of bus services provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will be for a period of five years.  It also provides for the review of such contracts and for the making of subsequent contracts.</P>
        <P>The fact the initial direct award contracts are limited to a five-year period, allied to the review provisions and the power to enter into subsequent direct award contracts, ensures the <Col N="798"/>provisions of Regulation 1370/2007 will be fully complied with within the timeframe envisaged in that regulation.  This goes back to member states being encouraged to take these measures to gradually comply with the provisions.  This is why we are doing this over a five-year term, so that within the ten-year term we will have fully complied.  In those circumstances, I ask the Senator to accept that the provision as drafted is correct and to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment does not remove but limits the right of the authority to amend contracts unilaterally.  This is helpful to the Bill and, in our view, would certainly improve it.  I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>EU Regulation 1370/2007 provides that the making of a determination that a public service obligation is to be applied in respect of the provision of public bus and rail passenger services is a matter for the competent authority.  That role is vested in the Dublin transport authority, subject to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>For that reason, as well as the associated responsibility given to it to ensure funding for the delivery of the services in respect of which the public service obligation relates is in compliance with Regulation 1370/2007, the authority must be empowered to carry out reviews of the public service contracts at its exclusive discretion.  This is encapsulated in section 52(5).  I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator.  We have had advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on this aspect.  What is laid down is in line with the legal advice.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As was the case with amendment No. 30, the role of reviewing direct award contracts must rest with the authority.  However, in the case of a review under section 52(5)(<i>b</i>), the authority must engage in a public consultation process provided for in section 52(5)(<i>d</i>).  As part of that process, the authority is required to consult the service provider as well as other potential interested parties, including the users of the services, before it makes the amendment.  The authority is also required, through section 52(5)(<i>e</i>), to publish a report as <Col N="799"/>to the reasons it promoted the amendments made as a result of a review under section 52(5)(<i>b</i>).  The section provides the opportunity for all interested parties to make their views known to the authority.  I consider that the approach set out is appropriate and, in the circumstances, perhaps the Senator will withdraw his amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 45, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;but any such provision must expire after two years from the commencement of such service or on a date to be specified by the Minister on notice to the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">One important feature of the new organisation will be its ability to be a provider of last resort.  On Second Stage the Minister acknowledged the potential difficulty this could cause.  The issue is that the organisation could act as a regulator and provider at the same time, thereby creating an inherent conflict of interest.  In our discussion, the Minister was good enough to accept an amendment from a party changing the conditions upon which the organisation could step in as a provider of last resort.  This is precisely because of the recognition that if the DTA is so badly needed to deal with many of the vested interests in respect of transport in the Dublin region, we need to ensure it will not become a vested interest of itself when it is operational.</P>
        <P>My amendment, which is one of the two new amendments we have introduced on Report Stage, recognises that if the authority needs to step in to provide a service in the specific and limited circumstances envisaged in the Bill, the duration for which it can do so should be limited.  The amendment suggests a limit but, in recognising the executive role of the Minister, stipulates that he or she may decide to change that limit.  This is to ensure the authority will focus on the role upon which it should be focusing, namely, regulation rather than the maintenance of a service it is required to provide according to the conditions laid out in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The intent of section 56 is to allow the authority to intervene to ensure the continued provision of public passenger transport services where there is a complete or partial failure by a public transport operator to provide them.  The focus of the section is to establish the circumstances in which such an intervention can take place.  An intervention can only arise in respect of a service that is the subject of a public transport services contract and is in operation.  To ensure clarity on this issue, an amendment proposed by Senator Donohoe was accepted by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
        <P>The focus of the amendment now proposed by Senator Donohoe is to establish either a specific time limit of two years or time limits that would be determined by the Minister and subject to a notice to the Houses of the Oireachtas of any intervention by the authority.  As I stated regarding other amendments to this Chapter of the Bill, an essential guiding principle that informed the crafting of the provisions in the Chapter concerned the need to ensure compliance with EU Regulation No. 1370/2007.  The regulation establishes a specific structure for the intervention of a competent authority as an operator of last resort.  That structure provides that intervention can only occur for a maximum of two years.  Were the DTA required to intervene as an operator of last resort, it could only do so in compliance with that regulation.</P>
        <P>Acceptance of the amendment would mean there would be a possibility that the period of intervention could last for longer than two years.  It would also give a direct role to the Minister <Col N="800"/>to make a determination on the length of an intervention which would not be consistent with the role of the DTA in exercising its role as the competent authority.  As I indicated, that role is exercised subject to the provisions of the Bill.  We are fundamentally trying to apply and be guided by EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 and, as such, I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will withdraw the amendment.  From what the Minister of State said, it appears parts of the provision are compliant with the EU directive in terms of the suggested time limit for the provision of a service of last resort.  If there are elements that are inconsistent with the directive, we will consider them as the legislation passes through the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The intention behind my amendment is good, that is, to ensure the authority will be primarily a regulator and that if it needs to step in as a provider of last resort, it will do so in exceptional circumstances for a very carefully determined duration.  The great strength of the DTA will be to deal with the various interests and it would be very unfortunate if it were to end up as one of those interests.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 51, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(9) The Authority may require private bus operators to provide off street parking for their vehicles.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment is important for two reasons.  There is a general requirement on operators such as Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide off-street parking, which is certainly very beneficial in promoting traffic flow.  Private bus operators often park their buses in residential areas where they live and this can be a nuisance in the estates in question, particularly if the operator has three or four buses.  It can cause many problems and give rise to many objections from other residents.  Since the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has not accepted any amendments today, and bearing in mind that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, accepted a few, an opportunity arises for the Minister of State to accede to one amendment.  I ask him to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, it was stated that section 11 of the Road Transport Act 1999 requires a bus operator, as a condition of his operating licence, to ensure he has adequate parking spaces and operating premises in the State for the vehicles being operated or intended to be operated under the licence.  During the course of their day-to-day operations on public roads, bus operators are subject to the Road Traffic Acts, including in respect of parking.  The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 enable road authorities to provide short-term bus parking areas but they also enable road authorities to prohibit the parking of large vehicles such as buses at a specified location, such as public roads in residential areas.  The enforcement of parking regulations is a matter for the Garda, local authority traffic wardens, etc.</P><Col N="801"/>
        <P>I understand what the Senator is saying about residential areas and I am familiar with the problem.  Even Dublin City Council has a set-up whereby one cannot park any bus or lorry over three tonnes in the city.  In Dublin city, a general ban is in place except where it is allowed.  While Fingal County Council may do it differently, local authorities, working with the Garda, have the power to control the problem raised by the Senator.  I accept problems can arise from parking, hanging about and when people set off at 5 a.m. by turning on a blunderbuss of a thing.  Part 3, Chapter 4 concerns traffic management and gives the authority scope to develop a vehicle parking strategy for the greater Dublin area generally, which the individual road authorities will be required to implement.  The Road Traffic Acts will continue to provide the legal basis for control of parking.</P>
        <P>Essentially, sufficient legislation already is in place.  Other means already exist and as such, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 51, after line 48, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(9) The Authority shall require private bus operators to provide off street parking for their vehicles.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I also wish to address this point.  This amendment generated a considerable amount of debate on Committee Stage.  Senator Ryan has detailed well the difficulties that such private bus operators can cause in many residential areas.  Another aspect that also causes much difficulty is the practice whereby private bus operators park their vehicles or leave them for long periods in locations such as Parnell Square, Mountjoy Square and so on, that are partially residential in nature.  Not only does the presence of the buses cause difficulty to the residents, but in many cases such areas are of great architectural and cultural value and they are being gradually eroded by the persistent presence of private buses.  Their engines are engaged much of the time and it is having a highly negative effect on both the appeal and appearance of such areas.</P>
        <P>I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point regarding the existence of legislation and law, ranging from the city council&rsquo;s by-laws to the laws at the disposal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, in many cases, for whatever reason, such regulations and laws are not being implemented.  Were an organisation such as the proposed authority to step in and do its bit to make a difference, it would be welcome.  Such an improvement would be noticed and appreciated by people who live in all kinds of residential communities within the area for which the DTA will be responsible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>While I already have covered these points, as a condition of their operating licence, operators must have adequate parking spaces.  The day-to-day issues regarding parking and control are matters for the Garda and local authorities.  As for the locations mentioned by the Senator, such as Parnell Square and Nassau Street, the problem was under considerably less control ten years ago.  I accept that private bus operators were parking anywhere and everywhere.  At present however, they park in specified, agreed, areas under law and regulation and in agreement with local authorities.  This is what can be done and is being done.  Legislation is in place for all of these matters.  If laws are not being enforced, passing more laws will not make them enforceable.</P><Col N="802"/>
        <P>In the main however, the daytime problem now is managed and controlled in accordance with existing regulations.  Parking in Parnell Square, Nassau Street, Dublin Castle or wherever is done by agreement.  As for overnight parking or similar activities, regulations are in place to prevent it if the local authority wishes to do so.  However, operators are meant to have adequate parking as a condition of their operating licence.  A driver who is on an early morning run and who decides to bring it home can be dealt with under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>I am most familiar with city conditions and while I do not suggest they are perfect &mdash; nothing is &mdash; significant areas exist in which one cannot park anything over three tonnes at night.  The Garda might try by persuasion to implement this provision.  If not, the clampers constitute the fall-back plan, which usually carries more clout.  However, the regulations already are in place and it is not necessary to amend them further.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment ensures the authorised officer&rsquo;s power is constitutional.  When I raised this issue on Committee Stage, the Minister stated the amendment was not necessary and implied it was not used in other legislation.  However, this is incorrect.  Similar wording is used in many other recent Acts and I will cite three of them.  I refer to section 17 of the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, sections 96 and 131 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and section 16 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004.  These constitute three good examples in which this provision is used and appears to be required.  The sense of what is appropriate prompted me to table the amendment in the first place.  My comments today are in response to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Committee Stage.  The amendment should be accepted this time, based on the information I have provided.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Senator&rsquo;s point on his three examples and cannot state whether he is correct in this regard.  As he noted, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, accepted the importance of protecting legal professional privilege.  The Minister stated that in <Col N="803"/>his view, such privilege did not require specific mention in each new item of legislation.  I heard the Senator&rsquo;s comments on the three examples but this matter has been checked with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and confirmed by it.  That office has stated it is not necessary to include it each time because the general provision covers it.  In what years were the Acts mentioned by the Senator passed?  Were they passed recently?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment arises from a procedural error that arose on Committee Stage, which led to the inadvertent deletion of section 80(3).  The position is that on Committee Stage, while Government amendment No. 29, which provided for the deletion of a subsection in section 20 was withdrawn, amendment No. 84, which was related, and should also have been withdrawn, was agreed to.  The purpose of the amendment under discussion therefore is to reinsert the original subsection.  I regret any confusion caused and ask Members to support the amendment.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and on my own part, I thank the Senators for their contributions which I understand have been very constructive all along.  I was not here to witness all their efforts but I know the commitment involved, particularly on the Opposition side, in going through a detailed Bill such as this.  I thank them for their efforts.  I am sorry that we were not able to accept more amendments but I understand that in the earlier part of the process, some of the points made on Committee Stage gave food for thought and some amendments were taken on board.</P>
        <P>We have been talking at different political levels about the need for a Dublin Transport Authority for a number of years and I am sure that all are glad to see it finally established.  It is to be hoped that it will do the work required and that some of the fears which people might have had will not come back to haunt us.

	<P>Indeed.  I wish to thank Senators for their personal good wishes.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is from County Meath, which is only out the road so he should have some good knowledge of the general Dublin area.  It is probably unusual for me to be passing compliments to a Meath man but I can put my pennyworth in as a Dublin representative and a former member of Dublin City Council.  He is not from very far away and he comes through the traffic every day so between himself and his officials there must be good knowledge of the problems.  I thank all for their remarks and their co-operation.</P>
