      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Bill 2008, Second Stage, to be to taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes, other Senators for eight minutes and Senators may share time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of recurring themes we speak on in the Seanad across all parties.  This morning I heard Pat Kenny on RTE read a letter from a woman who stated it was a very bad week for parents in Ireland.  She was referring to the horrific deaths of the two Polish men &mdash; the second man has now died &mdash; caused by what appears to be a gang of young people.  She was also referring to the tragic suicides in the west of Ireland, with two reported again this week.</P>
        <P>This is a sad commentary after ten years of the Celtic tiger and an indictment of the Government, which has taken its eye off the ball with regard to public services, health services and a focus on drugs and alcohol.  We have also had ongoing discussions here about drugs and alcohol and at a conference organised by MEAS yesterday we heard about the numbers of people, as young as 13, having access to alcohol.</P>
        <P>I make a special request this morning that we ask the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children to come together to begin a serious initiative to deal with these issues, as they are very corrosive.  We would be letting down future generations if we did not address these issues.</P>
        <P>We have had many task force reports on alcohol and it is time for action.  We have all the information.  I ask the Leader to bring to Government the request from this House for a serious initiative in this area of underage drinking and anti-social behaviour.  This links to justice issues with regard to more community policing.  We have seen a very depressing scenario this morning and I strongly believe we must invest more in public services.</P>
        <P>I strongly believe there has not been the focus on social issues that there should have been in recent years.  We will pay a very heavy price for this.  It will not just be the more disadvantaged communities which will suffer, it will be Irish society as a whole that will pay the price.</P>
        <P>Linked to this, another issue has emerged from the organisation of primary school principals, the IPPN.  It is extremely concerned about funding <Col N="1367"/>for primary schools.  The IPPN president has stated that each of the 455,000 children in our primary schools is supported at a rate of 96 cent per day, or half the cost of a loaf of bread.  It is hardly a level of investment likely to enable us to keep pace with our EU neighbours.</P>
        <P>The IPPN president also repeated what many of us here know, that many primary schools must raise funds to remain open and pay for basic necessities such as heat, light, insurance, cleaning and maintenance.  Pressured parents sell jam and cakes to keep schools open.  Funding for primary schools will have to be re-examined in light of this comprehensive survey which is being done in all primary schools and being reported on tonight on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to bring this information back to the Minister for Education and Science and allow us have another debate in this House on primary school education.  It is very clear schools are continually being disappointed at the moment.  I had a group of young pupils in yesterday from St. Brigid&rsquo;s school in Palmerstown who were excited about moving into a prefab so their school could be rebuilt.  I received a reply from the Minister which was equivocal and which did not confirm the building would go ahead.  This is one of many schools around the country who have been very disappointed at the lack of funding and the building programme seems to be grinding to a halt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will also speak on a point raised by Senator Fitzgerald, the funding of primary schools.  It is a good time to remind the House this Government promised during the election that the capitation grant for primary schools would be doubled but this has not happened.  This is the outcome.</P>
        <P>Parents and teachers met around the country, organised by the INTO, prior to the last election.  Meeting various groups, the Government gave a commitment to the rise but there is no sign of it.  Schools are now skimping and scraping trying to make ends meet and managing schools on a shoestring but they are not succeeding.  The cannot make available what is supposed to be available.  It is time we saw exactly how schools are doing their business and how schools cannot be run on the amount of money available.</P>
        <P>There was also a commitment that every school in Ireland would have broadband.  I saw a reference two days ago in a publication to the effect that 98% of schools now have broadband availability.  I have double-checked that in the past few days.  It is ludicrous to suggest that 98% of schools have access to broadband.  These issues have been raised with everyone in the House.  There should be a priority list of schools designated for building work or new schools this year.  It should be open, transparent and available.  We should see it when it is published and it should continue.  People might not be aware a list is put together one year <Col N="1368"/>and if it is not completed, a new list is drawn up the next year with no reference to the schools prioritised the previous year.  Everyone in this House has been lobbied by some school or other for information wanting to know where it stands on the list and when the building work is likely to happen.  There are nine stages and schools are held back at every one of them, not knowing how to get to the next point or where the blockage exists.  It is appalling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted to see that Meteor mobile telephone company has been named as one of the top 50 Irish employers in the past year.  It promotes a work hard, play hard ethos and that is why it has achieved a growth in subscribers of 150,000 in the past year which increased Eircom&rsquo;s profits.  Meteor&rsquo;s revenues have risen by 30%, not only because the number of subscribers has increased but also because the average revenue per user has, as Rex Combs from the company said this morning.  According to ComReg&rsquo;s report last December Irish mobile telephone users pay more than users in any of the European countries ComReg has studied.  Paying higher than average charges for mobile phone usage will impact on our competitiveness.  Although we have an open market we are paying high prices.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to meet ComReg and the mobile telephone providers to come up with an action plan on how mobile telephone charges can be reduced for users in this country?</P>
        <P>Yesterday traffic crawled at a snail&rsquo;s pace through Dublin following the closure of the port tunnel and once again the emergency services failed to plan adequately for the incident.  Only a few weeks ago a different incident brought the whole of Dublin to a standstill.</P>
        <P>I do not accept that nothing can be done.  I read in the latest edition of <i>Garda Review</i> that divisions often have to share equipment so, for example, public service vehicle inspectors must collect equipment from one division and bring it to the scene of an accident before they can clear the scene.  That can take hours and such delays are common.  Work could be done on issues such as this to improve the process.  Will the Leader speak to the Minister for Transport to impress upon him the need to put adequate emergency planning procedures in place so that we do not continually suffer such gridlock as we did yesterday?</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been several suicides of young males recently in Longford, Westmeath and the Mullingar area.  Statistics prove that the suicide rate among males aged from their mid-teens to 28 or 29 is seven times that of young females.  Despite all efforts made to grapple with this problem it is a creeping cancer in society.  It is time we had another debate on the subject in the hope that worthwhile sugges<Col N="1369"/>tions will come forward.  Whatever we do and whether we like it or not, this issue will not go away.  If one puts the reality under one&rsquo;s pillow at night it remains the same in the morning.  Can we have an urgent debate on this matter as soon as possible?  Senator Corrigan is our spokesperson so perhaps she and the Leader could arrange such a timely debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those of Senators, including the Leader, who expressed confidence yesterday in the independence of the Mahon tribunal.  The tribunal has treated each witness in equal terms and no special provision has been made for the Taoiseach or any witness although the tribunal has been intimidated in that regard.  I also commend the tribunal&rsquo;s professionalism in unearthing new secret accounts of the Taoiseach, which brings the sum under investigation to &euro;500,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That contradicts what the Senator has just said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have allowed the Senator speak in general about the tribunal but I do not want any Senator to speak about specific evidence. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I should respect my betters so I will defer to the Cathaoirleach.  It appears from newspaper reports today that the Taoiseach is putting it up to the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Cowen, to show unqualified support.  Will the Leader clarify that the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s support is unqualified in respect of questions arising from the Mahon tribunal?</P>

	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate across the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children in light of the death of a second young Polish man this morning.  A few weeks ago we held an effec<Col N="1370"/>tive and worthwhile debate on alcohol and drug abuse.  While the Celtic tiger society is affluent, certain fabrics in our society have broken down.  It is not all the fault of the Health Service Executive.  One has to consider families, homes and parents.  We awoke this morning to hear of the death of that young man, another death by suicide in Westport and the case of a young girl being bound and gagged by colleagues in her classroom in Galway a few days ago.</P>
        <P>I call the youngsters in Drimnagh young thugs.  One wonders what is in their system that they can commit murder in cold blood in broad daylight.  This is worrying and I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that it requires an urgent debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Leader intend to make time to debate the Bill at No. 11 on the Order Paper?  It could be dealt with quickly because it is a uncontentious Bill which I presume has full Government support.</P>
        <P>The Government will introduce new standards for nursing homes and nursing home care soon.  This is not before time and probably will help redress some of the neglect of our elderly citizens we have witnessed in the past.  When will the regulations and standards be fully implemented?  Will the Minister for Health and Children come into the House to indicate when the promised nursing home support Bill will be published?  We will need time to consult and reflect on the Bill after publication and I hope it will not be rushed through the House.  That is the last thing we need for such important legislation.  Will the Leader say when the Bill will come to the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to facilitate a full debate on Ireland&rsquo;s EU involvement and the role it plays therein.  It also is important to recognise that Ireland has contributed &euro;914 million this year in overseas development aid, ODA.  As Ireland is the sixth largest contributor in the EU, it is important to have a debate on this subject.  Almost &euro;46 billion was contributed last year by the 27 member states of the EU, which plays an important role in the development of Third World countries.  The European Union should continue to play a leadership role in the implementation of the millennium development goals to help tackle the poverty in the Third World, intensify the battle against HIV-AIDS and maintain good governance in respect of the expenditure of donated moneys.  Ireland plays an extremely important role within the European Union in helping countries that are less well off.  I am glad that Ireland is playing its role in this regard.  While it has been criticised in the past for not coming up to scratch, I believe it now plays its role, as well as showing leadership.</P>
        <P>I regret that my colleague from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Senator Regan, continues to make cheap publicity on behalf of the tribunals.  It is not good enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should desist.  I do not want Members talking across the floor saying anything about any other Members present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am entitled to have my say.</P>

	<P>No.  I call Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Fitzgerald about the appalling tragedy in Drimnagh.  That said, I know Drimnagh, which it is a very pleasant area and the people there are very decent.  It was a corporation estate and many residents had the opportunity to buy their houses.  They include a good friend of mine who made a beautiful job of the house in question.  One must be careful not to tar an entire district of Dublin because it is a place in which I would be proud to live.</P>
        <P>However, it is interesting that Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of parenting, as did many people who spoke about the killings on the radio today.  Among the points made about some of the gangs of youths that go around was that decent people are afraid to approach the parents involved because they are even more abusive and have threatened to let the children do precisely what they want.  This puts in context the very useful debate held in the House last night, in which one or two Members suggested that the only possible family model was the heterosexual family model, comprising a man and a woman.  While this model can be very good when it works, no one has suggested that gay parents were involved in any of these cases.  Hence it is not universally true that the panacea is to have a man and a woman as there are highly dysfunctional families that let down the whole of society.  Moreover, if one considers, for example, the question of the Kilkenny incest case or sexual abuse of children in general, it happens predominately in the home and is perpetrated by one of the parents or a sibling.  One must bear this in mind when using children to attack gay couples.  While I am sure there can be bad ones &mdash; I do not know of any &mdash; such couples are obliged to choose and sometimes even to fight to keep their own children.  I know <Col N="1372"/>of no gay family that has a reproach of this kind on it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another interesting point to arise from this case is that apparently, the children, young people or whatever, were congregating in an attempt to get drink.  They asked the Polish people to buy them drink and it was when the latter refused that they were so savagely and brutally murdered.  In common with many other Members &mdash; I do not claim a unique role in this regard &mdash; I have raised the manner in which licences have been distributed throughout the country.  Every huckster&rsquo;s shop is up to the ceiling in wine, gin, beer and everything.  When I said this on television one of the judges sued RTE, which of course collapsed like a paper bag and paid up.  Members should have a further debate on this subject.  I do not attack the family, which is an excellent institution.  However, Members must recognise its blemishes and must not use children as a weapon against gay people.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a matter that has appeared in the<i> Phoenix</i> magazine and I have been contacted by the persons involved.  Two articles were published that appear to set out to smear someone who appears to be a very fine man.  I refer to Mr. Michael Semple, a diplomatic representative of some kind in Afghanistan, who was paid through the overseas development aid fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Apparently, he now is being hung out to dry, abusive articles are being written about him and both he and his family are highly distressed.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should come before the House to make a statement outlining Mr. Semple&rsquo;s work.  This man, unlike the Americans, actually speaks the local language, loves the Afghan people and has used his understanding of the conflict in Northern Ireland to help to resolve it.</P>
        <P>This differs greatly from an occasion some years ago when I was invited by the American representative to a lunchtime talk to convert me on the war in Iraq.  I met their expert on Iraq and when I asked him when he was last there, he replied he had never been to Iraq.  I then suggested that he kept in touch through reading the local newspapers but he replied he did not, as he could not read or speak Arabic.  It is no surprise the Americans got themselves into trouble.  The case to which I refer involves a talented man who understands the situation and who may have been talking to some elements of the Taliban, which is a highly complex organisation.  One must talk to one&rsquo;s enemies to achieve progress.  The Minister should come before the House to defend this man who does not have the money to take on the press in an expensive libel case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>A very good debate was held last night on Senator Norris&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion.  Perhaps it is not useful to refer to a single small section of the debate because each section must be put in context and most Members spoke for eight minutes last night. <Col N="1373"/> I accept that perhaps Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments did not refer to my contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  However, the general tone of the debate last night was not such that any efforts were made to use children as a target or otherwise.  The debate will be helpful in future and Members should read the Official Report of the debate because I was particularly impressed by the sensitivities that were expressed and by the forward thinking that also was evident.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and it may be helpful to have a debate on the downside of the Celtic tiger.  There must be more to progress than fast cars, designer clothes, big houses, drugs parties and so on.  There is much more to life than that and the old quality of life, on which we all prided ourselves so much, is now under attack in some ways and this issue must be considered.  In particular, I find there is not a great sense of responsibility shown in some areas by parents towards the control of their children.  In many cases, children are parentless for most of the day.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As for the aforementioned tragic case, there were reports on the radio this morning of cases in which eight year olds and ten year olds have physically attacked older people, which is highly worrying.  I also heard on radio this morning that the crime under discussion could not even be described as a crime of passion because one of those involved had time to go home and get a screwdriver before returning to kill two innocent people.  The references for the victims showed they were models in the community and in their workplaces and this is a highly worrying development.  In addition, drunken louts feel they can terrorise and make fun of older people.  All these issues must be considered.  While I am unsure whether they necessarily should come in under a debate on institutions, everyone must pause and take stock of the present position.  There has been an erosion of values in society and lives are being taken on a daily basis.  The approach of accepting that life is sacred is no longer present.  Even acknowledging the wonderful progress the country has made, we are not fulfilling out role as legislators if we do not get off the bandwagon every so often to analyse this issue in a much deeper way.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that the Minister for Health and Children be invited to the House for a debate on the ambulance service, an issue I raised previously on the Order of Business and on the Adjournment.  There is a danger of going down the wrong road in terms of developments in this critical service, on which I received some disturbing evidence in recent weeks.  Press reports have covered this issue.  The manner in which the ambulance service in the mid west has been treated recently is disturbing.  Recent decisions, <Col N="1374"/>based on clinical procedures, to bypass hospitals constitutes a separate debate.  Ambulance drivers need clear direction, training and support from the Department and from the HSE that will allow them do what is a very difficult job.  Unfortunately, in the space of two weeks they were given two different directives, one which allows them, in certain circumstances, to bypass certain hospitals and bring patients to major trauma hospitals if they are over 55 years of age, and the other relates to patients under the age of 55.  Such directives do not constitute a clear direction.  The HSE would not admit that technically it had made a mistake.  Instead it engaged in a spin on the issue and said this was a procedural matter with which people like myself were trying to play politics.  Ambulance drivers from across the mid west have told me that what the HSE has proposed is unworkable.</P>
        <P>This issue comes on the back of a number of others.  The Government gave a commitment that advanced paramedics will be allocated to work with the emergency medical technicians in the ambulance service.  The allocation of such personnel is way behind schedule, which is particularly disturbing.  Some ambulances now carry only one stretcher and advanced paramedics are required because the capacity of the service in that respect has halved.  Furthermore, emergency medical technicians require training, which is also behind schedule.</P>
        <P>The ambulance service has been increasingly privatised.  We hear stories that this is the development in certain circumstances, but it has become more of an issue.  Ambulance personnel have expressed concern to me that the personnel who provide the service are not trained to the required standards.  We could have a crisis on our hands if private ambulance personnel deal with cases with which they are not qualified to deal.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments of previous speakers who raised the issue of the funding of primary schools.  The primary school network has pointed out that parents have to sell jam cakes and engage in other activities to raise funds for schools.  That is disgraceful.  I was contacted in this regard by schools I attended.  What does the Government propose to do about the removal of the summer works scheme?  Its removal is of concern to Members across the House as Members on the Government side have raised this issue.</P>
        <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will allow me to say the following&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>They have all been waffling; they should give me some order.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on what Buddhist meditation experts would call his startled reaction time.  The speed at which he now reacts to Senator Regan&rsquo;s coat-trailing is getting faster and faster.  I will not interfere and have him rule me out of order.  However, I cannot let it pass without referring to Senator Regan trailing his coat in here again this morning about the Mahon tribunal.  Not being a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, I do not have to pay lip service to the Mahon tribunal.  Senator Regan has built himself a bubble reputation.  He is the darling of the <i>Daily Mail</i> for his endless pronouncements and reactions to the Mahon tribunal.  What will he do if it ever delivers a judgment?  Has he not got a club to go to?</P>

I welcome and note the metanoia of the director general of RTE, Cathal Goan, and Mr. Mulholland yesterday on their conversion to the need for impartiality, independence and balance.  The article in this morning&rsquo;s edition <i>of The Irish Times</i> gives Senator Harris his answer.  A serious debate on the independence of our national broadcasting station is needed.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister responsible to the House for such a debate because for too long certain media commentators have been setting agendas and trying to score political points.  Perhaps Members opposite should consider the stable from which they come and the way in which they pillory certain members of my <Col N="1376"/>party?  I will defend Senator Regan and challenge Senator Harris to a debate on Senator Regan&rsquo;s integrity any place any time.</P>

	<P>The Minister with responsibility for community affairs has not been invited to the House since we resumed this session.  This morning we have read and heard in this Chamber of the breakdown of Irish society.  Those of us involved in community life, schools and sport know there is a need for a debate on the pressures exerted on young families forced to spend an inordinate amount of time stuck in traffic and who have to pay for child care and repay mortgages, thus requiring both parents having to work.  In many ways what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said is correct. There is a breakdown in society led by poor Government leadership.  I request the Leader to arrange for a debate on the creation of sustainable communities and the way in which the Government, which promised zero tolerance on crime ten years ago, has abandoned any policy on justice and law order here.  </P>
        <P>I also request a debate on our integration policy.  Basketball Ireland gave a great presentation at the Joint Committee on Sport and Tourism yesterday on the role it plays in integrating people into this country.  It is a lesson from which we could learn.  As is evident this morning, our integration policy is not working.  Such a debate is urgently required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concern expressed about the tragic murders of the two young Polish men and the escalation in the incidence of youth suicide.  I raised this issue previously and complimented a number of Members of this and the other House, in particular, Deputy Neville, who has done great work in the area of suicide prevention.  We need to examine the progress we can make to work with the people who have pioneered the issue of suicide prevention in recent years because the escalation in the incidence of suicide is frightening.  I ask the Leader to accommodate a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Concern was expressed about the level of expertise and training of personnel in the ambulance service.  I would not like the message to go from this House that there are unqualified personnel in the service.  I record my appreciation of the level of expertise and training undergone by ambulance personnel and those in the emergency services.</P>
        <P>For those who have not visited them, I recommend a visit to the emergency services training centres on the Malahide Road in my constituency of Dublin North Central and in St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in the Phoenix Park.  All the emergency services, both State and private agencies, the first <Col N="1377"/>response personnel and all the other specialties undergo a regime of regular training.  It is important to acknowledge the commitment, dedication and enthusiasm of the people involved in the emergency services.  They provide a service in very difficult circumstances on occasions.</P>
        <P>I have raised the issue of homelessness and since I raised it there seems to be a heightened awareness and a focus on the issue.  Today I note a question mark over the Health Service Executive decision to impose a freeze on funding for services to the homeless.</P>

	<P>I have raised the issue of homelessness.  Today I note the report of a freeze by the HSE of funding to the agencies dealing with homelessness.  I have asked the Leader to arrange that the HSE, the local authorities and the agencies be given an opportunity to come to the House so that we can discuss the issue of homelessness and the mechanisms that are in place to address the issue.  It is not just a matter of money but rather a matter of commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The survey by the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network displays a clear shortage of money for the day-to-day running of our schools and this is very disturbing.  The 455,000 pupils in our primary schools are being subsidised by their parents to the tune of one euro a day and this cannot be easy in all circumstances.  The schools and the parents&rsquo; associations are running cake sales and a myriad of functions to try to subsidise the schools.  I ask the Leader to put this to the Minister and also in debate form.  The funding of our primary schools should be an absolute priority and that kind of fund-raising activity should not be necessary.</P>
        <P>The mushrooming population in the commuter belt towns of our big cities is not being served because the schools building programme is inadequate.  While recent moves have been made recently to link up the granting of planning permission to developers with the building and improvement of schools, not enough is being done.  There is no doubt that the school building programme should be transparent and should follow sequentially year by year.</P>
        <P>It is very disturbing that the summer works programme would be removed from the schools building programme.  The summer works programme was how schools were given a face-lift and prepared for the new academic year.  It helped to keep older schools going.  It is an absurdity to end the scheme and it will cost a fortune in the long term if it is removed.  I support the call by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole and other Senators to have a debate on the question of school buildings, on the maintenance of schools and on the input of parents to their funding.  I ask the Leader to put it again to the Minister that the greatest priority for investment in education must be investment at the very junior level because that is where it makes the most difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader advise me of the last occasion the Standing Orders of the House were reviewed?  I am now in my second term in the House.  The Order of Business is a vigorous and robust session.  I refer to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill which was dealt with this week.  I am pleased that the contributions were above political considerations and that Senators from both sides of the House participated.  However, I am concerned about the use of the title &ldquo;Statements&rdquo; by some and &ldquo;Debate&rdquo; by others.  We discuss the most serious topics in these sessions.  I am not referring to last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion because the subject could have been provocative but the debate was instead robust and stimulating.  However, in all honesty, I find the statements and-or debates not to be debates and to be quite sterile.</P>
        <P>We are calling this morning for an examination of the cracks in the Celtic tiger society with an increasing number of young men dying by suicide.  We must find out how these problems have arisen.  Statements are usually made and <Col N="1379"/>people then leave the House.  I would prefer to see some form of discussion or cross-party debate resulting in an agreed consensus.  I refer to the issue of suicide and the societal changes brought about by the Celtic tiger.  There is no doubt society has become more selfish and aggressive.  This has been one of the downsides of the Celtic tiger but I do not believe we have gone bad altogether.  This matter is above partisan politics.  I would like to see participation as we had last night on Senator Norris&rsquo;s motion.  I ask if the Standing Orders could be reviewed to allow this to take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to express my extreme concern and anger at how State services deal with my constituents.  I am referring to customers of State services, in particular, people on social welfare and on housing lists.  These are the most vulnerable people in society who are in poor housing and on low incomes.  I am referring to people whose documents are consistently going missing, who are being asked repeatedly to provide the same documents and whose cheque payments have been stopped on them.  At the end of the week their money has been used up but their payments are not available, in some cases unjustifiably so.  When I speak to the management it can be sorted out in two or three hours.  This is unacceptable.  In the case of missing documents the response from front-line staff is often that they do not have them and the applicant will need to bring them again.  I am sure many Senators are familiar with this situation.</P>
        <P>I worked in the private sector before I became a full-time politician when I was elected to this House.  Inefficiencies such as loss of documents would not be acceptable in the private sector and they cannot be acceptable in the supply of State services.  The management in these Departments talk the talk about customers but there is a serious gap between the rhetoric of the management and on the websites and customer charters and what is happening locally.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should come to the House to explain that gap and why these most vulnerable people are being treated so disgracefully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on the health services with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am particularly concerned about the report regarding the acute surgical services in Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital that has been submitted to the HSE.  However, the HSE will not give elected Members a copy of the report and will not consult with us in this regard.  It has no democratic mandate to agree to downgrade the services at Roscommon County Hospital and deprive the people of that area of acute surgery, which has far-reaching consequences for the future viability <Col N="1380"/>of the hospital.  However, the elected representatives, including former Ministers and Deputies, are not being consulted.  The Department of Health and Children appears to have washed its hands of responsibility for the HSE.  To bring back accountability to this House the Minister should give account of all policy decisions regarding vital services for the people of our area and the country.  We are being left redundant in this regard.  We are being snubbed by the HSE in many issues.  It is about time that we, as the second House of the Oireachtas, brought the Minister into the House to question her, like the arrangement you have, a Chathaoirligh, through you and the Leader of the House.  We should put questions to her and get answers in regard to our issues.  We represent the people.  I never came across the HSE or any of its officials on a ballot paper.</P>

	<P>I call for a debate on the relationship between freedom and responsibility in our society.  I do so in the context of two issues which have been already raised by colleagues.  One is the horrible murders of the two Polish gentlemen in Drimnagh and the second is the very bad news from a small town I know very well in my county where a number of male students in a second level school set upon, bound and gagged a female student and filmed her in a way that shocks and appals.  We are dealing with urban and rural horrors that amount to the same thing, which is a shocking disregard for the person.  I was listening to the radio this morning.  At times like this we hear criticism of politicians and we hear people giving out about facilities.  However, it is much deeper.  There is a crisis of values in our society.  There is certainly a crisis in parenting and in family life.  Contrary to what my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, said the challenge being faced by families is not an argument for stretching further the definition of family.  It is an argument for recognising that families cannot be families in isolation; they need social support.</P>

	<P>If I were to stick rigidly to my time I would not have allowed Senator Mullen to come in.  Is that clear with him?  Two other Senators indicated earlier and I hope to allow them to speak also.  I remind all Senators that they should shorten their contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I respectfully suggest that my contribution has been very short compared with many others.  That is a repeated phenomenon.  I have a problem with the way time is allocated to different Senators.  I will, if necessary, approach the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the matter.  Perhaps we should allocate a set amount of time to each speaker.</P>

A stitch in time saves nine.  We need to operate on this now by having an honest debate about values and we need to stop being so shy about what we fear is moral judgmentalism and consider how we can form the minds and values of the next generation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for arranging yesterday&rsquo;s excellent debate on Malin Head and Valentia, which was very constructive.  It was one of many fine debates organised by the Leader, which I wish to acknowledge.  I support Senator Glynn who has raised on many occasions in this House the issue of men&rsquo;s health including that of younger males.  Unfortunately, there have been a number of suicides in the west of Ireland in recent times.  We have also seen considerable coverage on Sky News of a spate of suicides in Wales.  It would be timely for us to return to that subject forthwith.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to come to the House to discuss the Lisbon treaty and give us a date for the referendum.  I understand the Taoiseach is abroad consulting other European colleagues and is making statements in that regard.  It would be timely and appropriate to know when the referendum is to be held.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators have called for a debate on values and how our communities are responding to the issues they are facing.  I call for a debate on establishing joint policing committees and policing forums that were recently introduced under legislation in many towns and cities.  They have been in place for between only one and two years.  In my constituency of Dublin Central, four of them are in operation.  Other Senators have raised issues this morning regarding how communities respond to upheaval in their lives caused by serious crime.  The forums within which that is taking place locally are in many cases policing forums that have been established by legislation.  I would like to have a debate on the operation of joint policing committees and policing forums.  We need to review how they are working.  In many cases they are pointing up deficiencies in how communities are policed and deficiencies in legislation.  By having a debate we could make practical suggestions about how our communities could respond to issues that have been raised.</P>
        <P>I again call for a debate on transport infrastructure.  The Dublin Port tunnel is the pride of civil engineering in our city.  It was closed for most of yesterday because the company with responsibility for it was unable to make it operate.  I call for the Leader to organise an urgent debate on the policy of how we fund public transport infrastructure and how it is run.  The Minister should come to the House and be made accountable for the issues raised by all Senators in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Feeney, Norris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Kelly, O&rsquo;Reilly, Mullen and Donohoe expressed their concerns regarding issues that Senator Fitzgerald highlighted in her opening remarks.  I too am horrified and we send our condolences to the family of the second Polish man who lost his life.  As has been said here this morning, these were model <Col N="1383"/>citizens coming from Poland to a beautiful part of Dublin called Drimnagh.  With every day that passes the standards and respect for life are getting worse.  I will arrange to have the Minister present here to update us on the challenges and his proposals to meet those challenges regarding the events that have taken place in recent months.</P>
        <P>As I said in the House yesterday, I am endeavouring to get the Minister to come to the House to have a full debate on the abuse of alcohol.  We have 4,000 off-licences in the country.  The situation regarding such outlets must be reviewed given the dangers involved in young people being able to obtain alcohol freely.</P>
        <P>Senators have expressed various views on primary schools and I will arrange for a debate on that subject with the Minister present.  In 2008 alone, the Department of Education and Science will provide &euro;167 million to primary schools for day-to-day running costs.  This year the primary capitation grant increased by &euro;15 to &euro;178.58 per pupil, thus providing schools with more money to cover expenses such as heating, lighting and insurance.  Since 1997, the standard capitation grant has increased by 212% from &euro;57 per pupil to its current level.  Over the past ten years the ancillary services grant has also been increased, by &euro;6 to &euro;151.</P>
        <P>That updates the House on major investments that have been made to allow primary school boards of management to cover costs such as secretarial and caretaking expenses.  Taken together these increases mean that primary schools eligible for full ancillary service grants will this year receive &euro;330 per pupil, which is an extra &euro;21 per pupil to cover their day-to-day running costs.  A primary school with more than 300 pupils will receive &euro;6,300 more.  In fact, such a school will receive almost &euro;100,000 this year from the Department to meet its costs.  Members of this House have made an immense contribution to education and I will have no difficulty in arranging for the Minister to attend the House for a full, open and frank debate on that sector.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan and Donohoe expressed concerns about the Dublin traffic management plan, particularly in view of what happened at the port tunnel yesterday.  I will arrange for a debate on this matter at the earliest possible date.  Senator Hannigan also referred to the top 50 companies in Ireland and congratulated Meteor on its rapid growth and success.  It was pointed out in the House yesterday that Ireland is the second most expensive mobile phone area in Europe, which is unacceptable.  We must see what we can do about it as a matter of urgency.  I will allow for time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Glynn, Callely and McCarthy called for an urgent debate on suicide.  I fully agree with those sentiments and will arrange for such a debate.  I note that Senator Glynn has worked all his life in the medical sector.</P><Col N="1384"/>
        <P>Senator Cummins referred to item 11, the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members)(Amendment) Bill 2008, but as he knows the timeframe is very tight from now to the Easter recess.  The House will be dealing with legislation every sitting day until Easter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the sentiments behind the Bill the Senator has published.  Many of us on this side of the House would be only too willing to support it but I suggest the Senator should raise the matter in Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; time.  This would mean the Government would take the matter to Cabinet and then make a decision on it.  If the Bill were taken in Private Members&rsquo; time it would speed up matters so it could be dispensed with before the Easter recess.  The Whips and party leaders can discuss this after the Order of Business to see how we can progress Senator Cummins&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>I will also make inquiries about the nursing home support Bill and will revert to Senators about it.  I understand a serious challenge lies ahead as to what corrective measures must be taken in this area.</P>
        <P>Senators Butler and McCarthy called for a debate on the EU and the Lisbon treaty.  I am endeavouring to arrange such a debate.  Senator Butler correctly pointed out that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU, at &euro;914 million, is the sixth largest in the Community.  It is a sizeable amount of funding and will help less well off countries that are where we were 15 years ago.</P>
        <P>I will revert to Senator Norris who called for a debate on the case of Michael Semple.  I would have no difficulty in arranging for such a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators Kelly and Callely want a debate on health and children, especially concerning ambulance services and the availability of professional medics.  I have no difficulty in leaving time aside for such a debate.  The Minister for Health and Children will attend the House next Tuesday from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m to deal with the pharmacy issue.  I will try to secure another date in the Minister&rsquo;s diary, possibly after Easter, for the debate that has been sought.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to attend the House for a debate on family values and integration policy, and I have no difficulty with such a debate taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on homelessness and I gave a commitment on this in the House yesterday.  I would like to see such a debate taking place before Easter if possible, with the support of the party leaders.</P>
        <P>As regards Senator Mary White&rsquo;s intervention, Standing Orders are reviewed from time to time and can be amended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  All good suggestions can <Col N="1385"/>be considered by that committee.  I welcome this opportunity to extend an invitation to any Member of the House to write to the Cathaoirleach, who is the chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, regarding any suggestions they may have.  I assure Senators I will do anything possible to enhance the proceedings of the House.  I have an open mind on making the House more relevant and more attractive from the point of view of media attention which gets our message across to the public.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all those who participated in last night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate.  It was one of the finest expressions of free speech I have heard in my 26 years in the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on State services.  Like many other Members, the Senator has much experience in the public sector.  I will take on board his viewpoints, including the sentiments of frustration he has brought to the attention of the House.  I will arrange for the Minister to attend the House and I give Members a commitment that this matter will be treated as a priority immediately after the Easter recess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden called for a debate on accountability in the public health services, particularly concerning Roscommon hospital.  Public representatives have fought for a long time to retain the services provided by that hospital.  Senator Leyden has been a champion in that respect along with other colleagues in various political parties.  It is a good suggestion to have a debate on health service accountability with the Minister present so that Senators can highlight issues and ask for an update on health matters in their own areas and what is happening with the Health Service Executive generally.</P>
        <P>I am endeavouring to have a question and answer session following debates and featuring Ministers and spokespersons.  It is working successfully and I thank all party leaders and spokespersons for their co-operation.  The system is enhancing the affairs of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and we appreciate the opportunity that Ministers and Ministers of State afford the House in this respect.  I hope we will be able to take that even further in the next three or four years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Donohoe called for a debate on the Garda&rsquo;s community response programme and joint policing with communities.  I have no difficulty in allowing time for such a discussion.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for facilitating today&rsquo;s debate.  I appreciate the opportunity to introduce the Bill in the Seanad and I look forward to positive contributions from Members.  The Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 was first debated in the Seanad, so it is fitting that this short confirmatory Bill relating to the 1971 Act is introduced in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>Before referring to the Bill, I will provide some background information on the 1971 Act.  The purpose of that Act was to enable the Minister, by order, to establish corporate bodies to provide for the local authorities and-or the Minister such services as are specified in the establishment orders.  The immediate need in 1971 was to establish a body to enable the local authority conciliation and arbitration scheme to operate effectively.  The Act was framed in general terms so that the powers it conferred could be used to establish bodies to provide other services for local authorities, if that was found to be necessary or desirable.</P>
        <P>Since 1971, 13 bodies were established under the 1971 Act, of which seven are still operative.  Some of the bodies established were merged with other bodies or dissolved, depending on the demand for the service specified.  The initial body established, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, still exists but is now known as the Local Government Management Services Board.  Due to changing circumstances, the National Road Safety Association, the Fire Prevention Council and the Irish Water Safety Council were merged in 1987 to form the National Safety Council.  Since then, the National Safety Council has merged with the Road Safety Authority, while Irish Water Safety has been re-established.</P>
        <P>In general, the bodies were established to provide specified services for local authorities where it was more useful to have a single provider rather than each local authority acquiring or providing the service.  A good example is the Local Government Computer Services Board which provides large computer systems that can be used by each local authority.  The other services generally related to fire safety, water safety and road safety.  In total, 41 orders were made under the 1971 Act.  Apart from the 13 establishment orders, the balance consisted of <Col N="1387"/>orders amending the establishment orders, revoking various bodies and designating bodies for which bodies established under the Act could provide services.</P>
        <P>The legislation we are discussing today is a short Bill to address matters concerning bodies established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.  Following the advice of the Attorney General in regard to the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961 and the subsequent passing of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, the Attorney General advised that the possible unconstitutionality of section 3 of the Act of 1961 in respect of health related bodies also extended to local government bodies established under section 3 of the 1971 Act.  This arises as the 1971 Act contains similar provisions as those found in the 1961 Act.</P>
        <P>It is not a question of any of the corporate bodies concerned having &ldquo;no legal basis&rdquo;.  I assure the House that all were properly constituted under the 1971 Act by way of statutory instruments.  However, given the advice and recommendations from the Attorney General, this Bill is required to confirm the orders for existing bodies.  In view of the importance of the bodies established under the 1971 Act to the local authority service, it would not be appropriate to allow any doubt to exist in this matter.  Therefore, early enactment of the Bill is desirable to confirm the establishment orders of the seven existing bodies in primary legislation.</P>
        <P>Apart from the amendments to the Limerick regeneration agencies establishment orders, the Bill involves no policy change and no additional charge on the Exchequer.  It clarifies the areas covered by the Limerick Northside Regeneration Agency and Limerick Southside Regeneration Agency and provides for two additional appointments to the board of each agency, one from F&Aacute;S and another from the local community or local business community.</P>
        <P>These two bodies were established in June 2007 on foot of the findings of the April 2007 report, Addressing Issues of Social Exclusion in Moyross and Other Disadvantaged Areas of Limerick City, by former Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald.  The agencies are tasked with driving forward the development of comprehensive measures to tackle issues of social exclusion in Moyross, Southill and adjacent areas.  Given the need for urgent action in this matter, the agencies were established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971.  The ambitious work programme of the agencies has delivered, in recent weeks, vision documents for Moyross and Southill housing developments and lands adjacent to these developments, which were launched by President McAleese.  Comprehensive master plans for regeneration of the areas concerned will be drawn up by the summer.</P>
        <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 are standard technical pro<Col N="1388"/>visions setting out the definitions used in the Bill and making provision for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  While no direct expenditure in implementing the Act is anticipated, it is prudent to include this standard provision.</P>
        <P>Section 3 confirms the establishment orders made under the 1971 Act for current bodies and provides that these orders have statutory effect as if made in primary legislation.  Subsection (3) provides for the standard provision in legislation of this nature to ensure that the confirming provisions cannot be construed in such a way as to infringe any person&rsquo;s constitutional rights.  Subsection (4) takes account of the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 which provides for certain staff to continue in employment after the age of 65.</P>
        <P>Section 4 confirms the validity of acts carried out by dissolved bodies in accordance with the establishment orders of the bodies concerned.  Subsection (2), in the same manner as provided in subsection 3(3), provides that, if this provision were to conflict with the constitutional right of any person, its operation will be subject to such limitation as is necessary to ensure it does not so conflict.</P>
        <P>Section 5 and the associated Schedule amend the establishment orders for the two Limerick regeneration agencies to provide for the appointment of two extra members to each board and to clarify the areas covered by the agencies.  Section 6 is a technical provision stating that the Act may be cited as the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Act 2008.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a short document but nevertheless important.  It is considered that the Minister should have authority to establish bodies to provide services to local authorities where there is a specific purpose and where it would be more practical and economical to provide the service by a single body rather than each of the 34 major authorities acting separately at much greater cost.</P>
        <P>The 1971 Act was brought forward initially to permit the establishment of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board, now the Local Government Management Services Board, to provide industrial relations expertise for the local government system.  Prior to its establishment there was no formal central forum to discuss pay issues relevant to local government in general.  The wisdom of this move has been demonstrated over the years by the excellent service provided to local government management by the Local Government Management Services Board and its predecessor, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.  These boards have provided a central centre of excellence in industrial relations, human resources and other management services to local authorities in the last 30 years.</P><Col N="1389"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>In various constitutional actions over the years concerning whether secondary legislation infringed Article 15.2 of the Constitution, the need for the Government to have a mechanism to establish corporate bodies has been recognised in judgments of the High and Supreme Courts.  In his judgment in the Pigs and Marketing Board <i>v</i>. Donnelly case, Hanna J. acknowledged that &ldquo;the functions of every Government are now so numerous and complex that, of necessity, a wider sphere has been recognised for subordinate agencies, such as boards and commissions&rdquo;.  However, as was stated by the then Chief Justice in the judgment in the City View Press case, the test of the constitutionality of the legal instrument establishing corporate bodies is that it gives &ldquo;effect to principles and policies which are contained in the statute itself&rdquo;.  I intend to review the relevant section of the 1971 Act to ascertain what strengthening it requires to meet the constitutionality test or whether new legislation is required.</P>
        <P>This is a short Bill.  It follows from the advice of the Attorney General to ensure there is no uncertainty attaching to the seven existing bodies established under the 1971 Act and follows the same provisions as contained in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 which the House passed last December.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for explaining the necessity of this Bill.  Fine Gael recognises that necessity and has no difficulty with the legislation.  I would like to speak about the agencies and boards covered in this legislation.  When I was a councillor between 1999 and 2007, I was not fully aware of the functions of the Local Government Management Services Board, for example.  I thank the Minister of State for furnishing Senators with an explanatory document.  I now understand the need for the board which interacts with management at local authority level.  When I first became a councillor in 1999, the board employed 19 staff at an annual cost to the Exchequer of &euro;1.9 million.  By the time I resigned as a councillor in 2007, the board employed 30 staff at a cost of &euro;9.5 million.  Can the Minister of State explain this large increase in costs?  Is there a real need for such an increase?  Perhaps the Minister of State will examine this matter.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Local Government Computer Services Board plays a necessary role at local authority level.  In 1999, the board employed 93 staff at an annual cost to the Exchequer of &euro;5.8 million, but by 2007 it employed 96 staff at a cost of &euro;15 million.  The cost of running these boards has increased significantly.  Would it be possible to evaluate the performance of each of the many boards that serve local authorities in the context of the forthcoming Green Paper on local govern<Col N="1390"/>ment reform?  Some of the boards could be amalgamated to streamline their operations, cut their costs and deliver better efficiency in the running of our local authorities.  We need to maximise the return on the expenditure of public funds.</P>
        <P>One of the boards I mentioned is responsible for overseeing public service indicators at local government level.  I accept that systems need to be in place to measure the delivery by local authorities of services to our citizens.  As local authorities operate at the front line, they deal day in, day out with issues of concern to citizens.  In my role as a member of a local authority corporate policy group, I have seen the results of studies of public service indicators.  I question some of the figures which emerge from such studies because they seem too perfect to be true.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this matter.  Given that we do not live in a perfect world, as we all know, I do not accept the 100% returns on some of the indicators.  Having been a councillor for eight years and had discussions with councillors throughout the country, I believe we have a long way to go before we attain the figures which have been delivered under some of the performance indicators.  Perhaps the Minister of State agrees that the reality is nowhere near what is suggested in such figures.  We need to consider this matter.  Almost every councillor from all parties will agree with my views in this regard.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State were to take this point on board.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has doubts about the future role of the Dublin Transportation Office, which is also mentioned in the Bill, because it is toothless.  The proposed new powerful Dublin transport authority needs to be established quickly in the interests of transport planning and delivery in the greater Dublin area.  The Dublin Transportation Office would then be made redundant because we do not want overlap, duplication and the waste of public funds.  We need to take a more stringent approach to such matters.</P>
        <P>It is important for Senators to acknowledge the work of the Limerick regeneration agencies which have made a positive contribution to the regeneration of troubled areas.  Fine Gael supports the work of the agencies which can serve as useful models when problems arise in other local authority areas.  As I said at the outset, Fine Gael does not have a difficulty with this Bill.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will pass my views on the issues which need to be addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials, Mr. Devlin and Mr. Greene.  As the Minister of State has said, this legislation was introduced after concerns, some of which were mentioned in his opening remarks, were expressed by the Office of the Attorney <Col N="1391"/>General.  I agree with Senator Coffey&rsquo;s remarks about the purpose of the Bill which is to confirm orders made under section 3 of the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971 in respect of bodies established under that Act.  The bodies concerned are the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Dublin Transportation Office, the Local Government Management Services Board, the Affordable Homes Partnership, Irish Water Safety, the Limerick Northside Regeneration Agency and the Limerick Southside Regeneration Agency.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey made some important points about the various bodies.  The two Limerick regeneration agencies are the only two bodies on the list whose functions I am familiar with.  We do not receive progress reports about any of the other organisations.  I congratulate the former Dublin city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, who is doing an excellent job in Limerick.  I wish him all the best in his endeavours.  He tends to achieve 100% success in everything he tackles.  I congratulate the Franciscan priests and brothers who are doing an excellent job in certain parts of Limerick.  I have read a lot about them.  I hope to visit them at some stage to see how they are getting on.  The work being done as part of the Limerick regeneration projects represents one of this country&rsquo;s success stories.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Coffey&rsquo;s remarks about many of the bodies covered in this legislation.  Like many people, I do not know what they do.  We need to establish whether the continued existence of such organisations is of any value to society.  Could they be amalgamated so that they function in a more meaningful manner?  I agree with Senator Coffey that the Minister of State should examine this matter.  Perhaps we should ask representatives of these agencies to attend a joint committee meeting.  If they play an important role which we do not know about, it would be no harm for us to investigate it and learn about it.  The Bill amends the establishment orders for the Limerick regeneration agencies to provide for two extra members to be appointed to each agency board and to clarify the areas covered by the agencies.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has explained to the House the purpose of each section of the Bill.  There is no need for me to repeat  what he has said.  I thank him for his explanation of the legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank Senator Coffey for his valuable contribution.  I was thinking along the same lines myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.  The Labour Party will not oppose this technical Bill.  I welcome the clarification we were given about the areas covered by the Limerick Northside Regeneration Agency and the Limerick Southside <Col N="1392"/>Regeneration Agency.  I agree with the comments of the previous speakers about the work being done there.  The model being used in Limerick seems to be working.  We wish the regeneration agencies every success in their endeavours.  It must be acknowledged that they have made good progress to date.  I welcome the additional appointments which have been made to the boards of the agencies.  It is particularly good that community representatives and a F&Aacute;S official have been appointed to the boards.</P>
        <P>Like Senators Coffey and Brady, I am not familiar with the functions of some of the bodies covered by this Bill.  As I come from an information technology background, I have some knowledge of the role of the Local Government Computer Services Board.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the increases in the board&rsquo;s costs.  My knowledge of this area means I have specific concerns about information technology projects.  I often find that the economies which are supposed to be gained from the amalgamation of various local authority computer services do not actually materialise.  Such problems are not caused by the systems themselves but by issues relating to the reasons the various computer services were being brought together in the first place.  The systems analysis, as it is known, of the economies that should be achieved is probably not being done.  I have seen some over-runs in my time.  I would be concerned if there were any over-runs in this instance which would contribute to costs.  The Minister might examine that.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We will support this technical Bill.  In view of the impending Green Paper the Bill affords me the opportunity to make a number of observations.  Local government reform is badly needed.  In Ireland we have a form of local government which is one of the weakest in Europe.  It is essentially a form of central government dominating local administration, more appropriate to mini-states within a larger country rather than an independent modern European country.  Unlike European local authorities, local authorities in Ireland have little say on issues such as education, health, policing and transport.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The crux of the matter and the benchmark by which we will know if there is real reform in future is the area of funding.  We have been on a slippery slope since 1977.  I am not making political points but that is when the funding of local authority underwent change.  The result today is that the only sources of direct revenue are rates on commercial and industrial properties, housing rents, some service charges, motor tax and development levies.</P>
        <P>There is an over-dependence on development levies.  In my constituency some people cite these levies as the reason why some planning applications are granted.  With the downturn in the economy I am concerned that councils anticipated certain levies that will not now materialise. <Col N="1393"/> This may affect the construction of some roads and other infrastructure projects dependent on levies.  Local councils may have included levies in their budgets for development and local area plans which will not now materialise.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that reform legislation will be further delayed.  I would like to know exactly when it will be published.  Yesterday in the other House he was not clear, only saying it would be published soon.  How soon is soon?</P>
        <P>A key issue for reform is the provision for directly elected mayors.  The Labour Party supports this proposal as it will mean greater accountability.  In this context local government will not be reformed unless there is a re-balancing of the allocation of powers between elected councillors and the executive.  It is appalling that we have centrally appointed managers making executive decisions for cities, counties and towns over publicly elected representatives.  This lack of accountability results in un-elected managers of the local authorities being too powerful.  The cross-over between reserved and executive functions needs to be addressed and clarified.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party argues for changing the role of county manager to chief executive of the council.  Chief executives should have no policy making functions other than to assist and advise the elected council in making policy.  That is very important.  While they would have reserved functions they would exercise a limited number of executive functions, similar to those originally intended in the city and county management Acts.  The strategic policy committees were meant to deal with some of these issues, including the cross-over of reserved and executive functions and the role of elected representatives.  Unfortunately in some cases the committees have become talking shops.  This needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Another issue that needs to be addressed in the reform of local government is the role of town councils and the disparity between local populations.  This is evident everywhere, as I am sure many senators can demonstrate.  For example, the Roscrea community development association has been arguing for years that it has no town council, yet its near neighbours in Birr and Templemore each has one.</P>
        <P>For years a particular person has been fighting for association status which is covered under the 2001 Local Government Act.  This is an in-between position that acknowledges a town without sufficient population to have a town council but one nonetheless able to perform certain functions from a representative point of view.  I brought the issue of association status to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and asked how it might be achieved.  I believe I was the first person to do so because they required clarification about the request.</P>
        <P>Roscrea will be looking for potential association status in the near future, which will be a <Col N="1394"/>precedent.  This issue needs to be addressed in the Green Paper.  If it is not, there will be anomalies and people will feel disenfranchised.  We need a system for all towns that is equitable across the board and based on population.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party believes there should be two levels of local government: regional authorities, to include city authorities for the larger cities, and local authorities to include county town and district councils.  The city and regional authorities should have responsibility for areas such as strategic planning, implementation of the national spatial policy, transport and traffic, economic development, employment services, health and communications infrastructure.  We also believe in the creation of a greater Dublin regional authority.</P>
        <P>What key services should councils provide?  It is essential to look beyond the obvious services.  The Labour Party believes councils should have a consumer protection role in relation to private sector services.  It should be possible to question private refuse collectors, cable television operators and personnel from telecoms operators, schools, rail companies, airlines and local banks within the council chamber.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also believes in strengthening the role of the elected council to provide the citizen with accountable public services.  Councillors should have the power to seek accountability from any agency, public or private, that provides public services within their area.</P>
        <P>The Government should look at the issue of decentralisation of Government functions, not merely the relocation of offices, with an eye to providing services locally.  The allocation of national lottery funds could assist in the areas of sport, leisure and tourism.  There is no reason regional offices of IDA Ireland or F&Aacute;S could not work with local authorities regarding the industrial sector.  Similarly, in the area of social and family affairs, relevant offices could work through local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party also calls for the establishment of a national forum on the financing of local government.  This is a key component and a fulcrum of local government reform.  I was not convinced by yesterday&rsquo;s reply by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the cap on a candidate&rsquo;s expenditure during a local election.  Given that we know the date of the election, more progress needs to be made on this.  In response to a question from Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch yesterday, the Minister was far from convincing in saying that we would have legislation to cover this area.</P>
        <P>I wish that citizens and community members were involved on the consultative committee on local government reform.  Three councillors from my party were brought onto the committee, which is welcome.  It is regrettable, however, that no one representing citizens&rsquo; or community <Col N="1395"/>groups was invited.  Reform of local government first must take into account the requirements of people and communities at local level.  Reform in itself is not the point.  It is about how best to deal with the public and help people and communities at local level.  One example of reform for reform&rsquo;s sake in organisational structure is the Health Service Executive, thereby demonstrating that reform on its own is no guarantee of success.  We need to go beyond such examples in looking at local government reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that not only are we debating this Bill today but also that this is the first Bill to be initiated in the 23rd Seanad.  The record of the 21st Seanad and 22nd Seanad in initiating legislation was very good.  As members of this Seanad we should be seeking similar access towards progressing legislation.</P>
        <P>This is a technical Bill and the contributions to the debate so far have been brief, indicating the depth of the legislation.  It does not contain many issues of note but is important in terms of having the issues properly and legally clarified.  That said, it also offers Senators an opportunity to talk briefly about the general situation regarding local government.  At very least, we are on the threshold of a wide-ranging debate on this issue.  The Green Paper on local government reform will be published in a matter of weeks.  This will initiate a process confirmed in the programme of Government and it will be followed by a White Paper and relevant legislation.  Unlike previous speakers, I am confident that will result in wide ranging reform and will address matters that were comprehensively answered in other chambers, particularly restrictions on spending for local government elections.  I look forward to a comprehensive local government Bill at the end of this year or in early 2009, which will confirm these amendments.  It is important that reform extends beyond the bodies covered by this legislation and the technical changes as to how they operate and what they are called and introduces 85 years after the foundation of the State a real system of local government.</P>
        <P>We have had a system of local administration and while Ireland is a small country, there has been an imbalance between how decisions are made by the Government and local government agencies.  This must be corrected to introduce vibrancy into our democratic procedures.  This will help the nature of our society and it will have an economic impact.  Local government needs to be local.  Not only has that imbalance existed throughout the years, there has been a worrying trend in the past 20 years, which has been confirmed by Governments of various compositions and all political parties, of not only properly centralising powers and taking them from local authorities but also putting them into a less account<Col N="1396"/>able tier under which a plethora of agencies has been established, which lack accountability and whose make up is questionable in the context of membership and nominations.  When the local government process begins in earnest with the publication of the Green Paper, I would like that issue addressed.</P>
        <P>When I was elected to Cork Corporation in 1991, many of these agencies were being set up and their establishment was assisted through EU funding.  I recall having conversations with other councillors who were afraid of people involving themselves in these community structures on the basis of a lack of accountability and the establishment of a parallel political system.  Those elected to local authorities are subject to an imbalance in decision-making between national and local government and between executive and reserve functions.  Since the early 1990s, councillors have had very few decision-making powers, particularly in allocating resources within their communities.  The agencies covered by this legislation are in place to advise but they exist in the shadows.  These bodies are seldom mentioned in the House nor are they the subject of further examination, accountability or discussion.  Perhaps, as part of the reform process, annual reports should be laid before the House, even though they form a weighty pile in our offices.  However, the job of knowing what these agencies do, asking questions of them and examining their effectiveness is not being done by either House or through the committee system.  Very often, the only opportunity we have to refer to these bodies is through legislation such as this.</P>
        <P>While this is a short Bill, it is important for us to take the opportunity to highlight that accountability is a central role of ours, as a Parliament, and we are collectively failing in this regard.  If, in dealing with the legislation, we can address that issue and devise proposals to overcome that failure, we will have done part of our job as parliamentarians.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the use of the Seanad to initiate the Bill.  I look forward to this being the first of many Bills relating to local government reform about which both Houses will be exercised, at least for the next 18 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  While this is a short, technical Bill, it affords us the opportunity to comment on other aspects of local government.  I welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments on the proposed Green Paper and White Paper on local government reform because that is the core issue.  A significant shake up in the funding and organisation of local government is needed.</P>
        <P>I wish the Limerick Southside and Northside Regeneration Agencies well and I am sure they <Col N="1397"/>will do a great job.  Will the agencies be in place for a limited time?  Similar agencies, which were established under similar legislation previously, are still in place.  Will the Limerick agencies be retained?  These projects have come about because of the failure to fund and pay attention to local government.  As a last resort, projects have been set up in Limerick because of the lack of power and funding available to the local authority in the city.  The people have been failed because funding was not in place.  The Government was left with no choice but to set up an agency to put in place a plan for those areas and back it with funding.  Now there will be no problem at all with funding.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Green Paper on local government because it is needed.  Many local authorities are experiencing a financial crisis.  Senator Kelly referred to the dependence of such authorities on development charges.  The reason for this is they have few means of generating revenue.  I hope the Green Paper will address the issue of both the Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government dealing with local government issues.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be in charge of local authorities and the transport issues for which they are responsible.  Local authorities have few sources of funding and they have depended heavily on development charges in recent years.  With the downturn in the economy, the only way they can raise funds is through water and sewage charges.  For example, my local authority, Mayo County Council, charges businesses supplied with water and sewerage services more than &euro;10 per 1,000 gallons of water and sewage.  That equates to &euro;500 per house based on the 50,000 gallon allowance to households.  Is the Government giving &euro;500 per house to local authorities annually to run the services given that it is supposed to fully recoup the charges incurred on water and sewerage services?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State might supply us with information on how much the Government is giving local authorities because I am aware that not all of them charge for sewerage services even though the Government insists they have to do so under the polluter pays principle.  This is a heavy burden on service industries, such as small restaurants and pubs, and major businesses like Baxter Healthcare in Castlebar.  The latter&rsquo;s sewerage and water bill has increased by approximately &euro;2 million, which is a huge amount for an employer to absorb.</P>
        <P>The funding of local government is an important issue.  When the Minister was in Athlone two weeks ago, he stated that local authorities would have to pay pound for pound for the moneys spent by his Department on county road improvements.  Where will local authorities get this money given that their only means of rais<Col N="1398"/>ing funds is by means of rates and water and sewerage charges?  In my county, the local authority contribution for water and sewerage services can be 20% or 30% of projects that cost as much as &euro;50 million.  How are local authorities to finance themselves in the future given their dependence on development charges which are dwindling due to the downturn in the economy?</P>
        <P>I asked questions about the duration of the north and south Limerick regeneration agencies and the age factor for those over the age of 65.  People who have been in other employment may want to continue working in agencies but that is not provided for in local government or Civil Service legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister of State well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Bill 2008.  It is a small but important Bill in light of the advice of the Attorney General on its necessity.  I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, is in the Chamber because he has a long and distinguished background in local authorities, having started his career in Clare County Council.  In the many years I have known him, I have found him a strong champion of local authorities and their elected members.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not about reform <i>per se</i> but it none the less affords me an opportunity to speak about the Green Paper on local government reform.  I warmly welcome the Green Paper because it will provide us with an audit of local governments&rsquo; current performance in respect of service delivery.</P>
        <P>I have been involved in local government for 25 years and served on Westmeath County Council and Mullingar Town Commission.  I am pleased a proposal has been agreed by the Government to establish new town councils where towns have experienced a growth in population that merits the establishment of such bodies.  The upgrading of the former town commissions to real town councils is also welcome.  In recent years, the term &ldquo;town commission&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;town councils&rdquo; but nothing has changed beyond the name.  As a former member and chairman of a town commission representing a large number of people, I found it the most frustrating of experiences because the commission just about had the power to pass a vote of sympathy.</P>
        <P>Town commissions previously had powers as housing and lighting authorities and as regulators of fairs and markets but they gave these away.  A former town commission member who has since gone to his eternal reward once told me that Mullingar Town Commission did a great job by passing responsibility for lighting to the county council.  I told the member that Westmeath <Col N="1399"/>County Council has 23 members but Mullingar Town Commission has only nine members, so he would get one 23rd if he was lucky as against one ninth formerly.  That was not a good balance.  The blame for this loss of power cannot be laid solely at the doorsteps of Ministers because locally elected members have given up many of their powers, which I bemoan.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to use his vast experience of local government to give a real basis to the former town commissions.  Rapidly growing towns such as Shannon in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency, Mullingar in my county, Leixlip, Greystones and Newbridge have no powers.  Their influence begins and ends with an elected voice.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, who as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had town councils included in policing committees.  It does not require rocket science to realise that the bulk of crime is committed in towns and cities.</P>
        <P>When we speak about performance audits we have to consider how local authorities have performed.  Regardless of whether it operates at national or local level, if an authority does not have powers to raise and spend money it has nothing.  It is an exercise in self-delusion.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the upgrading with great enthusiasm.  There are a number of options for funding.  I remember in 1988-89 when I was chairman of Westmeath County Council we brought in paid parking.  I was threatened, received anonymous telephone calls and people said they would stand against me but I, along with a number of my colleagues, stuck to my guns.  As a result of that decision, many important infrastructural works were provided in Mullingar, including roundabouts, traffic lights, bridges, car parks, etc.  More importantly, there has been an increase in the level of commercial activity and shoppers can get parking so almost everyone is happy.</P>
        <P>When we refer to funding we talk about service charges about which there has been much hoo-ha.  The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978 partly abolished rates.  When the Government of 1977 took office, one third of rates had been abolished.  We then had the grant in lieu of domestic rates and the grants of those who did not collect service charges were reduced.  Government always wins when it comes to funding because if there is a shortfall, there are no marks for guessing who suffers &mdash; the local authority.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions)(No. 2) Act 1983 provided the basis for the service charges we now have.  There was also much hoo-ha about that.  As I said previously, the three main parties took the line of least resistance in terms of the funding base of local authorities, which was the rates system.  The <Col N="1400"/>High Court case taken by the Wexford farmers resulted in the abolition of agricultural rates.  As a nation, we have not been clever in regard to local government funding.  If any system of government, local or national, does not have the power to raise finance and spend it, it is nothing but a talking shop.</P>
        <P>We also have looked at other ways to raise funding.  Paid parking is self-explanatory and anybody who knows anything about it knows it regulates the length of time for which one can park, generates income for the local authorities and complements commercial activity.</P>
        <P>Considerable efforts have been made by successive Ministers in regard to littering but we are not winning the war.  We must be more proactive and the only way to hit the litter bug is in the pocket where it hurts most.  The litter bug will not listen to anyone.  One can put up all the signs one likes but the litter bug takes great pleasure in disregarding them.</P>
        <P>The Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies)(Confirmation of Orders) Bill is a short but important one and I commend it to the House.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for their constructive comments.  A number of interesting points were made, although not all necessarily confined to the remit of the legislation before the House.  They were, nevertheless, interesting for any of us who have served on local authorities, who acknowledge the wonderful work they do and who suspect they could do much better work if the framework was more user-friendly.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised a number of questions which were raised in one format or another by almost all speakers.  Senator Brady and others referred to the role and remit of these bodies, whether we all know what they do, whether we have all heard of some of them and so on.  That is a reasonable point and Senator Brady said it would be useful to invite them in to explain what they do.  The Oireachtas committee system has very much facilitated that in respect of many bodies.  Perhaps the system could be used in this instance and I might come back to that.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Local Government Computer Services Board.  The increase in costs arises <Col N="1401"/>mainly from an increase in the workload.  The e-Government project and other projects have assisted in saving money through increased efficiency at central level, although Senator Kelly asked whether that was the case.  The evidence strongly suggests it is.</P>
        <P>The annual cost of the Local Government Management Services Board includes almost &euro;4 million for the workplace partnership<b> </b>process at local authority level and the balance is for the cost of administrative staff and arises from an increase in the functions of the board such as the performance verification group and a larger body of employment legislation, especially in the area of health and safety.  It is charged with assisting local authorities in delivering and understanding that.</P>
        <P>I cannot answer the question about performance indicators at this stage.  It is a critical one in terms of an element of the role of the bodies.  If I am successful in getting additional information, I will be more than happy to revert to Senator Coffey with it but I cannot promise I will.</P>
        <P>A review of the roles of the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board is taking place to consider their future roles, which will be important.  The issue of the Dublin Transportation Office was raised by a number of Senators.  It has been within the ambit of the Department of Transport since 2002 but it was set up in 1995 under the 1971 Act.  That is the reason it is listed on this occasion as part of this legislation.  I understand the Minister for Transport has indicated he intends to set up the Dublin transportation authority in the not too distant future and that it will subsume the role of the existing agency.  I believe it will have a much wider remit and perhaps more powers.</P>
        <P>I refer to the timescales for the Limerick regeneration agencies.  The establishment order for both agencies set a date of 14 June 2012 for the agencies to conclude their operations.  It is fair to point out that until the agencies deliver their masterplans this summer, it will be very difficult to predict the timescales because we do not know exactly the extent of the job with which they are charged.</P>
        <P>I believe Senator Burke raised the question of people in the various bodies retiring at 65 years.  I understand entrants to the public service following the enactment of the 2004 Act will not have to retire at 65 years.  Others are guided by the previous legislation, or at least their terms and conditions are.</P>
        <P>I will come back to Senator Coffey on the details of the remit of the Limerick agencies.  The important point in regard to their inclusion is that any doubt which might have arisen in terms of their validity, having been set up under the 1971 Act, is removed by their inclusion.  However, I <Col N="1402"/>will come back to the Senator with additional information.</P>
        <P>Senator Brady said the roles of the bodies should be examined.  As I said, two of them are under examination.  There was some examination of the role of Irish Water Safety, or at least a proposal that it go elsewhere.  It has been found to be efficient and performing very well.  It is a body about which I knew relatively little prior to being appointed to this post.  Having had the opportunity to examine the type of work it does, I am convinced it plays an important role in ensuring a much better water safety regime and that fewer people die by drowning.</P>
        <P>When one applies the criteria under which bodies were set up and one finds they are working reasonably well, one tends to continue with them.  Senator Kelly also made a point about the role of the bodies.  As I pointed out to a committee the other day, I am under considerable pressure to set up an additional body, a fire safety authority.  That is something which must be considered on its own merits.  It is not always correct to state that there are too many bodies in existence, particularly if people do so only because they feel they do not know much about a large number of them.  Sometimes there are areas where the process of obtaining outcomes is best served by having in place a national authority of one kind or another.  The Senator also inquired whether IT savings always arise in circumstances where a central body is in operation.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle and others referred to the Green Paper.  The Senator made an important ancillary point in respect of the accountability of agencies under the normal procedures for the auditing of their accounts by the relevant local government body or the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Questions of policy and accountability also arise and these might well be examined by the relevant Oireachtas committees, which might deal with them more efficiently than those operating at local government level.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke referred to domestic charges for local authorities and inquired as to whether these are fully recouped by the Department or are, <i>de facto</i>, charged to businesses in order to make up the difference.  I will forward to the Senator figures in respect of the current position in that regard.</P>
        <P>Like other Members, Senator Glynn referred to the role of locally elected representatives and local authorities.  He voiced concerns that perhaps this role has diminished, particularly in the case of town councils in respect of which the Senator has an interest.  The point he made was almost the reverse of the central principle, namely, &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo;, behind the Boston tea party.  Many of us are of the view that local authorities would have no great power or relevance if they were not in a position to raise revenue.</P><Col N="1403"/>
        <P>The question of financing is not relevant to the debate on the Bill.  It will be relevant, however, in the context of the Green Paper, in respect of which the Minister, Deputy Gormley, answered questions in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  It is important to remember that a Green Paper sets out the framework for discussion that will allow us to proceed towards developing a White Paper.  It is of major importance that Members of this House &mdash; rather than their colleagues in the Lower House &mdash; have access to and dealings with local authority representatives at a particular level and that they have an insight that will be critical in moving us through the three steps from Green Paper, to White Paper, to legislation and on to setting out a framework for local government which could well serve the country for the next two generations or perhaps even a century.</P>
        <P>The role of the House in examining the policy and the legislation that will emerge from it will be critically important.  I hope I will still be with the Department when the legislation is introduced in the House and that I will be here for at least some of the debate on it.  The House has a perspective &mdash; this does not just reflect that of local authority representatives &mdash; which will enable it to be extremely constructive in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I also thank my officials for the briefing notes provided and for their assistance.  I look forward to the Committee and Report Stage debates on the Bill.</P>

        <P>The programme for Government refers to the establishment of a freely available and personalised national programme for personal health checks to provide for the prevention and early detection of illnesses in respect of both men and women.  The Government has been in office for more than six months and the proposed programme of personal health checks has not yet been discussed to any great extent.  As far as I am con<Col N="1404"/>cerned, getting the ball rolling in respect of this programme should be a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>This debate comes at a poignant time because the Irish Thoracic Society yesterday published its INHALE report, Ireland Needs Healthy Airways and Lungs &mdash; The Evidence.  This report contains figures which indicate the death rate from respiratory diseases in Ireland is the second highest in Europe.  Asthma is now the most common chronic childhood illness in this country.  Respiratory diseases cost the health service &euro;437 million in 2006 and more than one in five people visit their doctor at least once a year because of respiratory illness.</P>
        <P>Dr. Neil Brennan, one of the authors of the Irish Thoracic Society&rsquo;s report, said that  whether it is lung cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, the picture is the same &mdash; death rates and prevalence are either rising or are higher than they should be and the resources to effectively prevent, diagnose and treat these diseases are inadequate.  The Irish Heart Foundation has also released figures, in preparation for its national information campaign, Message from the Heart, which indicate that 36% of all deaths in Ireland are caused by heart disease.</P>
        <P>The obesity rate among adults in Ireland is on the increase &mdash; it has reached 13% &mdash; according to the latest OECD indicator reports.  Very few people are aware that obesity is related to chronic illnesses such as diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer.  Under its budget for 2008, the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s current spend will be &euro;344 million, &euro;29 million of which will be spent on cancer, and the capital spend will be &euro;52 million.  In 2006, the VHI paid out &euro;139 million in respect of cancer patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As of December 2007, 24% of the population in Ireland were listed as smokers.  The higher percentage of these individuals is male.  Although the percentage of those who smoke has decreased significantly in recent years, particularly following the introduction of the smoking ban, tobacco remains a prevalent killer in society.  The highest percentage of smokers &mdash; 25.21% &mdash; in Ireland is to be found in Munster.  Why is that the case?  Are we not communicating effectively enough with members of the public in Munster?</P>
        <P>I would like matters of this nature to be addressed in the context of personal health checks.  As stated on the Order of Business earlier this week, we need all-island approaches in respect of health measures and public awareness campaigns.  If personal health checks were introduced, we would obtain information that would enable us to identify the areas on which we should focus.  For example, people in Munster obviously need a little more information regarding the dangers of smoking.</P><Col N="1405"/>
        <P>The number of illnesses caused by obesity, alcohol consumption and smoking is on the increase, as is the cost to the State in terms of being obliged to provide treatment.  This is why the Government&rsquo;s programme for personal health checks is vital.  The programme needs to be initiated in order to curb costs.  Personal health checks will result in early detection of illnesses, thus reducing the cost to the State.</P>
        <P>Annual personal health checks will provide members of the public with information on all aspects of their health and lifestyles.  Many people are unaware of how their diets can affect their health.  Leading medics throughout the world constantly reiterate that simple exercise and a regular diet of fruit and vegetables can lower the risk of cancer.  Lifestyle factors relate to choice but people need to be aware how their lifestyle choices affect their personal health.  Personal health checks could provide this information as well as assisting in the early detection of illnesses.</P>
        <P>According to Professor Crowe of Vanderbilt University, early detection through screening and annual check ups could increase the proper use of antiviral medicines, reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics &mdash; thereby reducing antibiotic side-effects &mdash; and help reduce hospital waiting times and free up beds.  Good health is necessary for individuals to flourish as citizens, workers, family members and consumers.</P>
        <P>The basic message is straightforward.  Last week, a company provided free check ups, on a voluntary basis, to Members who wished to avail of them.  I was surprised by the number of people who stated that they did not want to have a check up because they did not want to discover how bad might be the state of their health.  We want to roll out BreastCheck services on a nationwide basis but I am referring to the roll out of a more comprehensive health check.  If person health checks are to be introduced, people should be made aware of the need to avail of them.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising the issue, which I am responding to on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to the development of a freely available and personalised national programme to provide for the prevention and early detection of illnesses for both men and women.  The programme intends that guidelines should be developed for the personal health check based on best available national and international evidence of what works well, with structured call and recall arrangements during a person&rsquo;s life and provision for appropriate clinical follow-up where required.</P><Col N="1406"/>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is examining at present a range of issues which need to be addressed to decide how best to proceed on this commitment in the context of international best practice, our own national health policy and the many competing priorities for health service development.</P>
        <P>By way of context, it is appropriate to acknowledge that chronic diseases represent a major challenge for the health services and society generally.  They represent the major component of service activity and expenditure in the health care system as well as being the major contributor to mortality and ill health in this country.  Given projections which predict a doubling of the elderly population over the next 30 years, this will give rise to a significant increase in chronic diseases, which will bring a significant challenge to our society and health care system as well as to individuals and their families.</P>
        <P>The main causes of chronic disease are known and largely preventable.  Lifestyle factors, including tobacco and alcohol usage, together with physical inactivity, poor diet and obesity are key risk factors along with high blood pressure and cholesterol for chronic disease.  Effective interventions are known and it is estimated that 80% of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes as well as 40% of cancer could be avoided if major risk factors were eliminated.</P>
        <P>It is also very relevant that the challenge of chronic diseases and the lifestyle factors that contribute to them is especially acute among lower socioeconomic groups.  The policy question that arises here, as elsewhere, is to how to use scarce resources to help those who need help the most.  The context, therefore, in which the role of a personal health check is being worked on is one in which there will be a strategic and integrated approach to the prevention, detection and effective management of chronic illness.  This is an area in which the Department of Health and Children at present is preparing a policy framework which will be completed in the coming months.</P>
        <P>Among the issues to be considered for a personal health check programme are whether whole age cohorts of the population should be offered or encouraged to have a periodic health check or whether a more targeted approach is preferable.  Also to be considered is the appropriate clinical content of a personal health check and the interval between checks according to individuals&rsquo; age, gender and relevant risk factors.</P>
        <P>The appropriate degree of State involvement in any programme and the organisational issues which would arise will also be considered, along with direct and indirect cost issues.  The Department of Health and Children therefore is considering these and other relevant issues to inform the best way to proceed.</P>

	<P>I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Tony Killeen, is present to take this matter.  This motion relates to the Falcarragh and Gortahork water supply scheme, which has approximately 3,000 connections, and the Rosses regional water supply scheme, which has between 10,000 and 12,000 individual connections.</P>
        <P>The Falcarragh water supply scheme was included for upgrading in the announcement made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 18 September last, with an associated cost of &euro;3.4 million and outlined as a scheme to commence in 2009.  Donegal County Council is carrying out a specific survey on this scheme, with a view to upgrading further the Ardbeg treatment plant, which serves the scheme, at a projected cost of approximately &euro;675,000.  Notwithstanding this work, major capital investment is required for the scheme.  I understand from Donegal County Council that the scheme has water leakages or losses of approximately 60% from its daily production of 1,600 cu. m. of water.</P>
        <P>What steps is the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government taking to ensure these major water leakages from the scheme are addressed?  As part of the county water conservation programme, digital mapping has been carried out on the scheme by Donegal County Council and the installation of metering is planned.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Department assists the council in addressing this by having the urgently required corrective action taken, which may well include funding for the replacement of the pipes in the scheme if this emerges as the problem.  It is clear the extent of the losses is having an adverse effect on water quality and this has been acknowledged locally.  When can we expect the major capital work on the scheme to begin if it is on schedule for 2009?</P><Col N="1408"/>
        <P>The Rosses regional water supply scheme was also included in the 18 September announcement from the Minister and it is scheduled to go to planning in 2009, with an anticipated cost of &euro;3.4 million.  Work was carried out over recent years under the council&rsquo;s water conservation programme to address the leakages pertaining to this scheme, and the work proved to be successful.</P>
        <P>However, 16 km of pipe work on the scheme requires urgent replacement.  This work has an estimated cost of &euro;4.7 million.  The Rosses regional network was split into seven district meter areas, which are Meenbanad and Kincasslagh, Meenbanad and Dungloe, Kerrytown Bridge, Dore and Arduns, Crolly Bridge, Brinlack and Kentucky.  As can be seen from the cost in those seven distinct areas, the replacement in the Rosses regional scheme is a major issue.  I understand discussions are ongoing between Donegal County Council and the Department with a view to securing funding to have the pipe replacement carried out.</P>
        <P>In the interim, the water inspectors have a monotonous daily task of replacing bursts and leakages along the network, which is unacceptable as we look to conserve as much water as we can.  I impress strongly upon the Minister the importance of having funding made available for the replacement of these pipes.</P>
        <P>Are the asbestos pipes which carry the water through both these schemes safe and what happens if a pipe bursts?  Does this have an adverse effect, when ingested, on human health?  To give the Minister of State a figure, approximately 25% of the pipe work in both schemes combined has asbestos pipe connected to it.</P>
        <P>As a food technologist and someone who has studied the area of food and water safety, I have done my own research and I know the position of the World Health Organisation.  I would like reassurance from the Department, if possible, for the people of west Donegal who are served by these water pipes.  Are the men who work for the council on these pipes when they make repairs exposed to any health risks?  The Minister of State may be able to provide answers today but if not, I would be quite happy to wait on answers at a later date.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising these important matters and for the opportunity to clarify the important issue of the use of asbestos cement pipes in water schemes.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P>Asbestos cement piping formerly used in local authority water mains was required to meet the specifications defined in Irish Standard 188 and, in common with international practice, to include bitumen lining and coating.  The main health risk associated with asbestos products relates to inha<Col N="1409"/>lation of airborne asbestos particles.  The potential exposure to such risk has led to a decline in the use of asbestos materials generally.  With the availability of more robust materials, asbestos cement piping is no longer used in Ireland for new public water mains or sewer pipes.  The World Health Organisation&rsquo;s position on asbestos in drinking water is that there is no consistent evidence that ingested asbestos is hazardous to health and that there is no need to establish a health-based guideline value for asbestos in drinking water.  This response does not deal with the question of men working on the scheme but it is a requirement of the safety statement of the county council as their employer and the risk assessment to deal with those issues.</P>

        <P>Both the Gortahork-Falcarragh and the Rosses regional water supply schemes are approved for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  Donegal County Council has submitted a design brief for the appointment of consultants to the Department for the Rosses scheme, which sets out the local authority&rsquo;s requirements in detail, including an outline programme for the completion of the work.  The Department is examining the Rosses brief and will shortly issue a response to the council.</P>
        <P>Donegal County Council is finalising the preliminary report on the Gortahork-Falcarragh scheme prior to submitting it to the Department for approval.  The preliminary report will set out in detail the need for, and objectives of, the scheme, the design parameters, the procurement options and estimated costings.  When this report is submitted to the Department it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
        <P>The two proposed schemes, in Gortahork-Falcarragh and the Rosses, will enable Donegal County Council to assess the current state of the water mains in these locations and to bring forward proposals for new, upgraded or replacement pipelines where the existing pipes are deficient or in need of repair.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>My item concerns the need for the Minister for Education and Science to advance the planning process for Howth Road national school to development stage.  This is a bad case of a delay in the development of a school on the north side of Dublin which has been inexplicably caught up in bureaucracy and difficulties.  It has caused immense frustration to the pupils, parents, board of management, teachers and everybody else there.  A simple move in the Department might hasten the school&rsquo;s development. </P>
        <P>This is an inclusive Presbyterian school and it seeks rapid development into one which can compete and appear as physically competent and modern as its colleagues.  The school has received only one injection of &euro;50,000 from the Depart<Col N="1410"/>ment of Education and Science since 1980.  It has been on the same premises, with the same buildings since the 1970s.  In 2002 the board of management, in conjunction with the parents and the Presbyterian Association, decided to invest in the fabric of the school as there was a crying need for this and the State was not providing the money.  This produced classroom and office space, general redecoration and a special needs room.  The full cost was &euro;80,000 of which the Department provided &euro;50,000, with the school and parents raising the balance, to build a prefab which is not the ideal accommodation for schoolchildren.</P>
        <P>The school has been designated as needing a new building.  It has reached stage 3 in this process but is frustrated because the Department appears to have put it on hold.  It had expected to have reached stage 5 a long time ago which would mean it could go ahead as soon as possible with State planning approval and funding.  The school feels that it has been on hold for ten years, although the Department assured it that the process would be shorter.  It is particularly important not to delay schools of this type for so long.  A pupil might be educated in a prefab for most of his or her school life.  Pupils should have a modern, well-equipped school for part, if not all, of their education.  I do not see any sense of urgency about this school in the Department.</P>
        <P>In March 2007 an architect visited the school and passed the plans but in the sort of hiccup that is typical of the public service, the architect left his position.  A new architect was sent out to the school and the process started again.  This architect halted the past plans, then gave them the go-ahead last November but it seemed unnecessary to many of those involved to have two architects approve the work.</P>
        <P>Stage 4 is planning, Stage 5 is tendering.  I plead with the Minister of State to assure me that the school has not been relegated to the end of the list and to convey to the Minister the urgency of this case and the need to expedite it immediately.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the proposed provision of additional accommodation and refurbishment works for Howth Road mixed national school.</P>
        <P>Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will facilitate the provision of new schools and extensions in developing areas and the improvement of existing schools through the provision of replacement schools, extensions or large scale refurbishments.</P><Col N="1411"/>
        <P>The Howth Road national school has an enrolment of 94 pupils and is staffed by a principal, three mainstream teachers and a special education teacher.  The proposed project will consist of the construction of an additional classroom and ancillary accommodation and the conversion of two existing classrooms into one.</P>
        <P>The Department has recently approved the stage 3 submission for this project.  The Senator will appreciate the progression of all large scale building projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase, is considered on an on-going basis.  I will, however, as the Senator requested, pass on the additional information to the Minister and ask her to ensure that the building section takes it into account.</P>
        <P>The Minister will announce further school building projects to progress as part of her <Col N="1412"/>Department&rsquo;s school building programme.  The Minister and her Department are committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Howth Road mixed national school at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply because he gives no date.  Will he please ask the Minister for Education and Science to assure me that the Department is doing everything it can to hasten the construction on this site, not doing anything to block it, and that this school has not been relegated to a lower place on the waiting list?</P>
