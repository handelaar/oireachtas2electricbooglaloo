	<P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to ensure the metro construction works in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Dublin, cause minimal damage to the environment and the least possible inconvenience to the public.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the action the Government intends to take as a result of the information that has come to light that Irish consumers are paying up to 50% more than consumers in the United Kingdom for similar goods.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to allow the people of Ireland to continue cutting turf as they have done for generations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today is No.1, statements on the World Trade Organisation talks, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes, all other Senators eight minutes, on which Senators may share time by leave of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding remarks and to take questions from spokespersons; No. 2, statements on the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s welfare and protection services for children, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, with spokespersons having ten minutes, all other Senators eight minutes, on which Senators may share time by leave of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons; and No. 20, motion 39 re Transport 21, to be taken at the conclusion of No.2.

      </Speaker><Col N="842"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On foot of yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, it is important we have a debate on public private partnerships at the earliest opportunity because the future of an enormous number of projects in this country is dependent on such partnerships, given the policy adopted by the Government in recent years.  I understand Senator Dan Boyle has a particular interest in this area, having written a paper on public private partnerships some time ago.  We must examine this issue, especially given the plans for co-located hospitals which are heavily dependent on public private partnerships.  On that note, I draw the attention of the House to the &euro;1 billion cost for those co-located hospitals, which is far more than was originally intended.  This begs the question whether this is the best way forward in terms of increasing the number of hospital beds in the country.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the future of the Abbey Theatre.  I wish to ascertain what stage the relocation plans have reached.  There have been a number of suggestions in the House that the site should be reconsidered.  I ask the Leader to give Members a briefing or arrange a debate on the future of the Abbey Theatre and the timeframe for the building programme.  It is critical that there is clarity and a firm commitment on the future of this important cultural establishment.</P>
        <P>Later today we will discuss Transport 21 during Private Member&rsquo;s time.  I note that yesterday Senator Dan Boyle and Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe took a bus trip around St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  They proposed, as a result of that trip, to tax commuters who do not use public transport.  Perhaps the Leader or Senator Boyle will take the opportunity to clarify whether it is now Government policy to tax people for not using public transport which is simply not available in many areas.  There are quality bus corridors in Clondalkin with no buses running on them.  In Lucan, because of outdated legislation, Dublin Bus cannot schedule additional buses because there is a private operator in the area.  It seems the Government is putting the cart before the horse.  Will Senator Boyle support the Government motion on Transport 21, given the Green Party&rsquo;s serious criticisms of it?</P>
        <P>This is Say No to Ageism Week and it is very important we lead in this House with a debate on ageism.  Such a debate was scheduled for a few weeks ago but had to be cancelled.  It is an important area and there are many examples of ageism throughout the country.  It is an insidious problem.  We must expose it and change practices in a number of areas.  A debate in the House would be a good place to start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the issue of public private partnerships, which I have defended and proposed on many occasions.  I have looked for details regarding the regeneration projects in Dublin but cannot find any, which is why I am raising the matter in the House.  I ask the Leader to provide Members with information or invite the appropriate Minister to the House.  My understanding is that decisions on public private partnerships are in the gift of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The idea was that the NTMA would examine any proposal from all points of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the nature of a contract that allows a party to walk away from it seven or eight months later without the imposition of any penalty clauses?  We went through this process a few years ago with the cost of roads and it was sorted out by the insertion of clear timelines and penalty clauses.  I am not making any accusation until I have the information, but we are entitled to know what the NTMA put into the contract for this development, the penalty clauses and timelines and whether the people involved are right or wrong.  We can have a discussion when we have the facts.  It certainly raises extraordinary questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It seems we are fated here everyday to correct yet another piece of misinformation regarding the European treaty.  For the record, the European trade union movement has been fighting for years to get the charter of rights enshrined, or reflected as closely as possible, in European <Col N="843"/>law.  Any information that appeared to be given this morning which was at odds with that is incorrect.  The European trade union movement has been pushing for many years for the charter of rights to be included in European law.  It considers the charter to be a major prize, as do all people who are committed to human, civil and other rights.  Therefore, anybody who says otherwise is misleading the public.  I do not want to get bogged down with words mentioned yesterday, namely, the difference between the word &ldquo;lies&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;misinformation&rdquo;, but what I said is fact.</P>
        <P>On another issue, despite what is provided in the Constitution, somebody has taken the opportunity to make direct contact with the President.  There should be a clear indication from the Houses that the appropriate procedure in this situation is for the President to remain silent, not to respond, react or reply.  That is what would be expected and in that way nobody could read any implication into her actions, and nothing could be read into the fact that she choose, should she do so, not to reply to that communication, which should not have occurred.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Leader that is an important position to articulate on behalf of the House.  The House should indicate that we do not consider the President should have a role in this regard, that it appreciates she has been put in an embarrassing position and that we expect her simply to park that rogue correspondence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal to close the accident and emergency unit in the Mercy Hospital in Cork from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. from 1 June will have a significant impact on the waiting times for patients in the second largest accident and emergency unit in the country in Cork University Hospital, which, as we  were told yesterday, has the second largest neurosurgical department in the country.  The current waiting times for patients in that accident and emergency unit is approximately 14 hours.  The additional 7,000 attendances that will be visited upon that unit in Cork University Hospital because of the closure of the unit in the other hospital signifies a lack of planning in the area.  The Government needs to be aware that there are significantly more patients on trolleys in hospitals than there were this time two years ago and that there has been a significant increase in that number since the embargo was put in place on 4 September last.  Is the Government prepared to name the accident and emergency units that will close due to the lack of a consultant on their hospital staff?</P>
        <P>I also want to raise the issue of Crumlin hospital, the largest tertiary referral centre in the country.  The position there has reached crisis level because the hospital is short 44 of its complement of nursing staff.  This issue needs to be addressed urgently.  A finding of the report into the investigation of the unfortunate loss of life of a young child following her appendicectomy was that a children&rsquo;s nurse should be always on duty in all accident and emergency units to aid and facilitate the treatment and diagnosis of children attending that unit because such practice is specialised.  That is why there are many different disciplines in nursing.  It is an area of expertise, and research would prove that nurses involved in treatment and diagnosis on a full-time basis assist as much as a consultant in diagnosis.</P>
        <P>The outsourcing to a private company of the writing of letters to those people affected by the situation in the north east has ethical implications.  It also demonstrates that the job is best done by the professionals who deal with sensitive and confidential information every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The ethical aspects must be upheld in this regard and note must be taken of that.  What was done was a mistake and it needs to be urgently addressed.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="844"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to prejudge tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate but I want to respond briefly to some of the points raised by Senator Fitzgerald on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  In regard to Transport 21, I can affirm that it is within the provision of the programme for Government, and every element of the Transport 21 programme will be attempted to be achieved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Attempted?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;within the lifetime of this Government or of the plan itself.  From my party&rsquo;s viewpoint, we would like elements of Transport 21 to be rejudged in terms of which projects should be given priority.  That was the nature of yesterday&rsquo;s exercise.  </P>
        <P>On the Senator&rsquo;s second question about the imposition of a congestion charge, a question was raised on this matter by a journalist having regard to the congestion charge in place in London.  I can assure the Senator and other Members that such a congestion charge could and should be introduced only if there are proper public transport alternatives, which obviously are still not in place here.</P>
        <P>On the question of whether we should have a debate on public private partnerships, Senator Fitzgerald alluded to the fact that while I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I had a report published by the committee.  That report outlines the position in regard to openness and transparency in terms of contracts, a question raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  We should have such a debate in the House.  There are circumstances in which public private partnerships should be used, but there are circumstances where they are seen not to be working.  If we can contribute to an ongoing debate on this matter, we will help in the provision of future infrastructure in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a matter of serious concern not only for Waterford but for the region and the nation, namely, the predicament of Waterford Crystal.  As many people are probably aware, 500 jobs are at stake in that company which has an iconic brand, not only for Waterford but for Ireland.  This is a flagship company that has benefited our economy for many generations.  Generations of taxpayers in Waterford have contributed enormously, even through tough times, to our economy.  Now they are calling for help from the Government to underwrite a &euro;39 million loan, which we were told last night has been declined.  </P>
        <P>There is serious concern in Waterford city and the region about the future of the company.  This matter is of such importance that I wish, under Standing Order 30, to appeal to the Leader to make time available today for a special debate on this matter.  Manufacturing industry is under major threat in this country.  Waterford Crystal has been at the frontline of our export products for many years.  We need only think back to the introduction of the millennium in New York when the Waterford Crystal ball was the highlight of the event.  We cannot afford to lose this company and its product for this country.</P>
        <P>This company is important not only for our manufacturing industry but for our tourism industry, for which it has major spin-offs.  The Leader will appreciate from his background in tourism in the hotel industry the importance of tourist attractions in an area.  Waterford Crystal is one of the leading tourist attractions in the country.  It attracts luxury liners into the Waterford Estuary where thousands of Americans or other foreigners visit the south east and travel beyond.  I seek to raise this matter under Standing Order 30 in the hope that the Leader will be able to facilitate even a half hour debate and invite the T&aacute;naiste or some other Minister, if available, to the House, as it is a matter of urgent importance.</P>
        <P>There is great fear in Waterford this morning because if this company closes it will tear the heart out of Waterford city.  I do not say that lightly.  When I was driving to the House this <Col N="845"/>morning there was more talk on the national airwaves of Dustin the turkey than of the real threat to Irish manufacturing and tourism, which worries me.  If Waterford Crystal goes down, it will take with it its tourism product that tourists throughout the world find attractive.  I strongly appeal to the Leader to make time available to debate this important issue.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me the time to raise this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has already given me written notice of that matter under Standing Orders 30 and I will rule on it at 11.50 a.m.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader obtain a brief from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and from Dublin City Council on the implications for local authority housing stock in Dublin in light of the recent news on the public private partnerships not proceeding in certain complexes in the city?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to another matter of huge importance which I have raised in the past, namely, homelessness.  Would it be possible for this House, or for the appropriate committee, to arrange a special meeting on homelessness in Dublin city?  Could we invite in those working with the homeless?  I received a letter from the city manager which states there is no doubt that a huge amount of money has been assigned to fund homelessness relief in recent years, that much good work has been done and that, in the main, there is a bed for everyone who wants one in this city.  However, that is not reflected on the streets.</P>
        <P>I know some Members attended the recent book launch of Alice Leahy of TRUST and she told me there are serious consequences arising from, and problems with, homelessness.  Will the Leader arrange with the other leaders, or the relevant committee, to invite in those involved in this area to focus on, and deal with, homelessness, particularly if the money and the beds are available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat a request I made to the Leader some weeks ago.  It may have been touched on yesterday but I was not here and I apologise to the House if that is the case.  I refer to the issue of financial regulation and corporate Ireland which, according to today&rsquo;s media, is in the dock for certain things which have been going on.  It would be appropriate for us to debate not only financial regulation but the Companies Act which this House passed more than 15 years ago and in which insider dealing was made a criminal offence.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that a case of insider dealing has never been successfully prosecuted in this country and that it is very rare for such a case to be taken.  It is regrettable that the DCC-Fyffes case was left to the Supreme Court which made an unambiguous judgment that insider dealing had taken place and that dealings had taken place on the basis of inside information held by an individual.  Nothing has been done about that, except that corporate Ireland has stood behind that behaviour.  It is a very serious issue for us because either the law is not tight enough or this is not going on at all, although that is not what the Supreme Court found.</P>
        <P>It would be appropriate if this House was to regard itself as relevant in matters of this sort.  We should not debate only this specific issue.  The DCC-Fyffes case is a landmark and is a disgrace for us internationally, as was raised by Senator Quinn recently.  We should examine what is happening to the regulators and why they are nowhere to been seen in this extraordinary episode.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to send the good wishes of this House to Ted Kennedy and his family at this difficult time.  The Leader met him when he was in Washington a number of weeks ago.  This House and this country owe an enormous debt not only to Ted Kennedy <Col N="846"/>but to his brothers who played an enormous role in instilling a sense of pride in being Irish.  Ted Kennedy is a champion of our peace process and of the poor and the underdog and he has spoken for those who have no voice.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Ted Kennedy and his family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments on Waterford Crystal of my colleague Senator Coffey.  What is happening is very serious for my city of Waterford.  The Government decision not to guarantee the loan to Waterford Crystal puts in jeopardy the jobs of the remaining 550 workers in this flagship industry.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must come to the House to clarify what assistance will be made available to this company to protect the jobs of the remaining 550 workers.  However, this involves not only the jobs of these people.  As was stated, Waterford Crystal is of considerable benefit to tourism not only in Waterford but throughout the country.  It would be a disaster if anything happened to this company.</P>
        <P>The Government said it did not want to set a precedent but precedents have been set previously with PMPA, Larry Goodman and several other companies which were bailed out by Governments over the years.  I reckon the workers of Waterford Crystal have paid more PRSI and tax to the Exchequer than those in any other company but when they asked for support from the Government, they were turned down.  This is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must come to this House to explain what will be done to protect these workers.  We have spoken about the manufacturing industry for a number of years but nothing is being done to protect that and other indigenous industries.  Our competitiveness is declining daily but the Government is doing nothing about it.  I support the call for a debate on this issue by my colleague Senator Coffey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss Waterford Crystal.  It is part of the history of Waterford and we cannot let it go.  I have confidence the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will find a way forward.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>We support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s request for a debate under Standing Order 30 and I hope that, when a vote is called, Senator Ormonde will support it.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome this morning&rsquo;s news that funding has been agreed for the next Leader programme for rural development.  Michael Ludlow, the chair of the Irish Leader network and a man I worked with on Meath Leader when I was a director, said that as a result of &euro;400 million in seed funding, we can expect to see &euro;1.7 billion in investment in the rural economy.  I am glad the Irish Farmers Association has welcomed the news.  I support the requests that tourism initiatives and community transport schemes are included in local plans.  It is important to get this right.  People have predicted that it could lead to 10,000 additional jobs in rural areas.  Europe has been, and continues to be, very good to us and I would like the IFA to say it is time to support Europe and to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Members should not name people who are not in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to agree to a debate on commodity prices which continue to rise significantly.  Many commodities are bought and sold in much the same way as stocks.  The person who buys futures in wheat or corn never sees the commodity and would not know what to do with it if they got it.</P><Col N="847"/>
        <P>If we had been forewarned about sub-prime lending, we could have done something about it.  However, we have been forewarned about this.  The price of oil is increasing to $129 per barrel and the price of rice, wheat, corn and other commodities continue to increase.  It appears part of the reason for this is that market traders will no longer trade in currencies and have turned to commodities.  This is serious at any time, but at a time of food shortages it is dangerous and I call for a debate on this issue.  I do not know how we can deal with it because it is outside our jurisdiction but, notwithstanding that, we should raise an objection to it.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s request that the President should not reply to the Independent Deputy who asked her to provide clarification on aspects of the Lisbon reform treaty.  It is wholly inappropriate to attempt to involve the President&rsquo;s office.  This is unfair manipulation by the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.</P>
        <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today about proposed EU guidelines for websites.  I welcome this in light of the mention we made yesterday of cyber bullying and intimidation across the web.  It is important for the European Union to take the initiative and consider self-regulation and legislation for this area that will protect the welfare and safety of our children.  Parents and children will welcome this move forward because many of the sites that affect our children are hosted outside of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I call for the Minister with responsibility for energy to come to the House to discuss the increasing price of fuel, particularly diesel.  The increases are affecting the costs of all market goods, particularly food and the cost of living is spiralling out of control.  Diesel has just gone up by another 5 cent at pumps in Galway and the same has probably happened throughout the country.  The Minister is waiting for renewable energies to come on stream, but what measures is he going to take in the short term to curb inflation and reduce the costs of getting our goods to markets and to reduce the cost of the fuel needed to transport our goods?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support Senator Coffey on his call for debate on the fate of Waterford Glass, which is one of our most historic industries and represents Ireland all over the world.  Just yesterday, visitors to the House admired the beautiful Waterford Glass chandeliers that grace this Chamber.  I have, however, some concern with regard to Government intervention.  We must look back, for example, at its intervention in the case of the banks.  That was highly unpopular with taxpayers and the moneys were never repaid.  Why should capitalist enterprise be propped up by taxpayers?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I support a debate, but it must be nuanced.  Sir Anthony O&rsquo;Reilly and his empire have made clear their advocacy of the open market and people do not want to shovel bucket loads of cash into his already overloaded pockets in order to sustain Waterford Glass.  If taxpayers&rsquo; money is put into the company, there should be certain guarantees provided.  Either the company should be partly nationalised &mdash; I would be proud of it as a State enterprise and hope it would work &mdash; or guarantees should be provided to the State as a preferential creditor.  If the company is an embarrassment to Sir Anthony and he is making a commercial decision that he can no longer support it, let him give the shares to the State.  He has plenty of other things in his back pocket.  I understand he has previously supported Waterford Glass out of his own pocket.  I appreciate his generosity in doing that and understand that he may not wish to do it any longer.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader confirm something he said yesterday and give me a date for a discussion in the House with the Minister on the question of the location of the Abbey Theatre?  The editorial of Monday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> mentioned that the recent unveiling of the proposal for the Carlton site in O&rsquo;Connell Street illustrates the necessity for a landmark cultural component to counterface the commercial overload of the plan for this key location.  I understand a major <Col N="848"/>British retail force will be located on the Carlton site, but there has been no mention of a cultural aspect to the site or any mention of the Abbey Theatre.</P>
        <P>I call for debate on the National Roads Authority and its attitude towards the environment.  This is biodiversity week, but consider how it is being celebrated in County Meath.  The National Roads Authority has contacted Meath County Council and it has franchised out the spraying of the hedgerows with 2,4-D, a highly toxic chemical.  This is killing nestlings, destroying a huge variety of plants and fouling the groundwater in the area.  One of the reasons given for the spraying was that the massive scale of the motorworks in the area has disturbed noxious weeds so that seeds have been distributed everywhere.  The NRA is behind this disturbance.  The contract for the spraying has been given to Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root, KBR, which is owned by Halliburton, whose chief executive is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Much that depends on public private partnerships is now in doubt and I strongly support the comments of my colleague Senator Fitzgerald on the subject.  I also support the comments of Senator Norris on the future of the Abbey Theatre.  In September 2006, the then Minister, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, announced the Government&rsquo;s approval for a design competition for the theatre.  The original brief on the theatre dates from 2002, but I understand it is still being revised.  It is now mid-2008 and we are still in the dark about the future of our national theatre and its proposed location despite the fact that some &euro;138 million was earmarked for the project in the national development plan.  I support all the calls for debate on the issue and on public private partnerships.  There is much this House could contribute to any review the Government is conducting on the issue.</P>
        <P>I supported Senator Ross previously on his comments on bad practices and unsavoury doings of a section of corporate Ireland.  Will the Leader arrange for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss the relevant provisions of the Companies Acts?  It would appear to lay people that the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s five judges is being flouted by that section of corporate Ireland.</P>

	<P>We have often had debate in the House on the health service and will, no doubt, have one again soon.  I would like to raise the issue of how we treat children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and their families.  I spoke to a parent recently who was advised by the school her child attends that the child is at a critical stage and would benefit from speech therapy.  When the parents inquired about speech therapy from the HSE, they were told there was nothing that could be done for them and were referred to a clinic which referred them back to the HSE.  The parents have been given to understand that their child does not fall into the specific category of disability which would entitle the child to assistance.</P>
        <P>We need a debate that will include whether children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome and similar children should be rated top priority when it comes to how we dispense our health budget, whether arbitrary categorisations are being made by our health authorities and whether these categorisations do an injustice to some families.  This is a time sensitive issue in the situation I mentioned and if the parents are to get private speech therapy for their child, it will cost them <Col N="849"/>over &euro;5,000 per year.  Are such people to be looked after by the system?  We need to address that question in our debate.</P>

	<P>He is an Independent Deputy.  The basis of that request is to identify the constitutional implications of the Lisbon treaty.  It will not be passed by the Oireachtas but by the people in a referendum.  As constitutional issues are decided by the people, it is a ludicrous request in some respects and should be dismissed with the contempt it deserves.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point that no implication should be drawn from a refusal to entertain the request is well founded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to follow up on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and workers' rights raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.

Citing them ignores the fact that the majority of workers&rsquo; rights have emanated from Europe, and many from the European courts.  These include equal pay and opportunity, health and safety at work, protection of workers in insolvency situations and the rights of part-time workers.  The conclusions of the Viking case are not negative towards workers&rsquo; rights and it leaves it to the member states to determine the specific issues.  This misinformation on these court cases and ignoring what Europe has contributed to workers&rsquo; rights constitutes misinformation in this campaign.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is the culmination of the efforts of trade unions in Europe to have a set of rights enshrined in the treaty.</P>

	<P>I support the calls by Senator Coffey and others for a debate on the future of the Waterford Crystal plant in Waterford.  Although I come from an adjoining county I must recognise that this plant produces an iconic Irish brand and I hope we will have time to debate the matter and insist the Government uses whatever mechanisms are available to aid this industry.  It is important for Waterford, Munster and Ireland that the Waterford Crystal plant continues to thrive.  It is one of the Irish brands known at home and abroad. </P><Col N="850"/>
        <P Just="Left">I support what Senator Healy Eames said on the price of diesel.  Last week the AA called for an inquiry into the huge increases in diesel prices in recent months.  It appears the motorist is being ripped off.  While we all recognise that the price of a barrel of oil in dollars has increased on the world market, the euro is increasing in strength against the dollar and has been for quite some time.  It is difficult to understand why diesel prices should have increased at such a rapid rate as to make motoring almost unaffordable.  It is costing families, businesses and jobs.  This needs a full investigation and I support what Senator Healy Eames said today and last week&rsquo;s request by the AA for an inquiry into diesel prices by the appropriate Departments.  There must be a combined attack on fuel inflation because if affects every family and is losing jobs in this country.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan called for an urgent debate on public private partnerships and what the alternatives might be.  I have no difficulty with this taking place as tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion is on Transport 21.  I will endeavour to have this take place at the earliest time, and certainly before the summer recess.  Senators Fitzgerald, Norris and Coghlan called for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to update the House on the progress with the Abbey Theatre.  There was an important request to have a landmark site identified so that when people from all 32 counties of Ireland visit the Abbey Theatre they will know where they are going and will not depend on people to direct them.  While I do not want to get involved in commercial affairs, Senator Norris&rsquo;s suggested site is ideal.  Everybody knows where O&rsquo;Connell Street is.  It would enhance the north end of O&rsquo;Connell Street which deserves the major investment at which the Celtic tiger seems to have only glanced.  I support the Senators in this regard and this debate will take place in the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald called for a debate on ageism.  The value of experience cannot be bought.  For people in very important positions who have achieved great success in their lifetimes to be told at the age of 65 they are no longer wanted and have to retire when they are excelling and at the peak of their careers defies logic.  It is no longer acceptable.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Healy Eames and Regan correctly pointed out to the House issues on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, workers, the achievements of the European trade union movement, the advantages of the Lisbon treaty and those who support the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote related to trade union and workers&rsquo; rights.  I agree with the sentiments expressed and at our next leaders group meeting I will endeavour to see how we can enhance this proposal.  I agree with the sentiments expressed on the affairs of the President and we have had the views of some very experienced Senators in this area this morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast spoke on the units in Cork University Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and everything pertaining to the concerns of parents and the services for children in these magnificent hospitals.  I have no difficulty in having further time left aside for the Senators&rsquo; views particularly on matters pertaining to the HSE.  We will have an update from the HSE and a debate on all matters pertaining to the HSE, but particularly on Senator Prendergast&rsquo;s issue, before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Coffey, Cummins, Ormonde, Hannigan, Norris and Bradford called for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coghlan, to come to the House to debate the position in which Waterford Crystal finds itself.  We all will be aware of the world-class product that is Waterford crystal, the world brand name that Waterford Crystal has established and the amount of endeavour that has been put into this company.  The success of this Irish company has been almost unprecedented worldwide.  I can only think of one or two others that have had the success of Waterford Crystal.</P>
        <P>I am endeavouring for the past hour, with the Government Whip, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, to see if we can provide time for this debate at some stage today.  I will return to the House at 12 o&rsquo;clock, after the Order of Business has concluded, to update the House on our progress.  I am endeavouring to have this debate take place some time between 1.45 p.m. and 3 o&rsquo;clock but if that is not possible and if it is possible at all, it will take place at 7 o&rsquo;clock.  I am endeavouring to ensure this debate will take place.  This is a request on an urgent matter and I certainly fully support the call this morning of Senators from all sides of the House.  The plight of the workers is important but the continuation of the company and the brand name for our country is vital.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on local authority housing, particularly in the city and county of Dublin, and also on homelessness.  On the homelessness aspect, there is no difficulty in holding such debates in the House but matters as urgent as this can be discussed in the relevant committee charged with the various portfolios of Ministers every week.  Members of the committee who are Senators can play a big part in assisting with the difficulties of various groups, as Senator Callely pointed out, to push these issues along and get responses from Ministers who attend the committee meetings on a weekly basis.</P>
        <P>Senators Ross and Coghlan called for an urgent debate on financial regulations, particularly on the Companies Acts and insider dealing.  This is an urgent matter which needs to be debated.  We are at an advanced stage with a new companies Bill, which I understand contains in the region of 1,280 to 1,400 sections.  It will be the largest legislation to be presented before both Houses of the Oireachtas in 70 years.  I will endeavour, with the Leaders, to have a debate take place within the next week on this issue Senator Ross raised correctly in the House.  It is an important area that needs to be addressed urgently and this House must not be found wanting in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Daly asked that I send best wishes to US Senator Ted Kennedy on his recent illness.  On behalf of the House, as Leader, I join in wishing Senator Kennedy well and, hopefully, a speedy recovery.  The Kennedys, and Senator Kennedy in particular, have been outstanding friends of Ireland in times of great need.  Their achievements lifted us up, as a nation, from <Col N="852"/>1963, in particular, when the late President John F. Kennedy, his brother, visited Ireland.  That was the start of the Ireland of today that we all know.  It was a privilege and an honour for me, and Senators Daly and Walsh, to accompany the Taoiseach and the Ministers to the historic proceedings in the House of Representatives and to be greeted and received so warmly by Senator Kennedy for our stay in Washington.  I wish him well and look forward to meeting him again, please God, on another occasion.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan highlighted that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, announced yesterday &euro;425 million in Leader funding which, with other funding, could be brought up to &euro;1.7 billion.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister.  As 95% of my local electoral area is in CL&Aacute;R, we certainly are looking forward to getting our fair share of Leader funding.  It is only under such funding that the areas that have lost 50% of their population over the past 75 years can really get their fair share and play a major part.  Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s constituency and mine are similar and I fully agree with his sentiments in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator John Hanafin called for a debate on commodity prices and the cost of oil.  Senator Healy Eames also raised this matter.  As oil prices increase, energy costs increase.  As energy costs increase, food costs increase.  We must look at what is really happening.  The consumer price index fell last month from 5% to 4.5%, but the cost of oil, and particularly diesel for those of us who have such cars, at the filling stations has risen astronomically.  We should have an all-party debate in this House on why prices are increasing so rapidly when one considers, as Senator Bradford pointed out to the House, that the dollar is falling against the euro.  I will return to the Leaders of the various groups to see how soon we can have this debate take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  This will probably be touched on this evening in the Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; motion on Transport 21.  I would hope the Senator would air his views at that debate this evening.  There are only five sitting weeks left, if one disregards the week of the referendum.  There is only so much business we can do in the House.</P>

    <Title>WTO Negotiations: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the House and I congratulate him on his new portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I thank you and your colleagues in this House for your good wishes on my appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the ongoing WTO negotiations.  The current round of negotiations, known as the Doha development round, has been underway since 2001.  Since then, many deadlines have been set for its conclusion and many intensive negotiating phases undertaken with a view to reaching a final agreement.  However, due to the wide range of sectors covered by these negotiations and the complex nature of the negotiations in each of these sectors, it has proved to be an extremely difficult task to reach a comprehensive and complete agreement.</P>
        <P>The WTO rule-based multilateral trading environment provides very significant benefits to Ireland.  As a small open economy, we are very dependent on the ability to trade our goods and services across the world.  This is why an ambitious and balanced WTO agreement will present significant opportunities for the Irish economy.  However, these opportunities will only be realised if the final agreement is balanced, providing real liberalisation across all elements of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>It is in this context that the Government and I have serious concerns about the current direction of the negotiations.  There is a clear over-emphasis on the agriculture negotiations.  The other major negotiating areas, such as market access for industrial goods, trade in services, trade rules and trade facilitation, have not progressed or do not currently present the same level of ambition as that being pursued in the agriculture negotiations.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the importance of the outcome of these negotiations for Ireland and I recognise the challenges which an agreement will present for Irish and EU agriculture.  The current position in the negotiations is all the more disappointing, given that the EU has prepared in a constructive and responsible manner for these negotiations and has made significant contributions aimed at progressing the negotiations to a successful conclusion.  The reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, agreed in 2003 as part of the mid-term review of the Agenda 2000 package, were undertaken with the next WTO agreement clearly in mind.  As part of the 2003 reforms, the EU made a deliberate decision to prepare in a forward looking and positive manner for the challenges which Doha set for agriculture.  The EU move to decoupled payments was carried out with a view to fulfilling the Doha target of substantially reducing trade distorting domestic supports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Decoupled payments, which by their nature are not linked to production, are considered non-trade distorting by the WTO.  This EU move away from coupled and market support type payments has reduced very substantially our levels of trade-distorting supports, therefore fulfilling one of the key objectives of the Doha declaration.  In addition, the reforms have also made European agriculture more competitive, better prepared for globalisation, more compliant with food safety requirements, more environmentally sustainable and more conscious of animal welfare requirements.  All of these outcomes show the multi-faceted nature of the CAP and highlight that European agriculture policy is designed to deliver much more than economic benefits to society.  The EU made another significant contribution at the Hong Kong ministerial conference, with the commitment to the full elimination of export refunds by 2013, on condition that all other forms of export subsidy are eliminated.</P><Col N="854"/>
        <P>I am disappointed to point out that these contributions made by the EU have not been matched to date in the negotiations by the other major WTO negotiating partners.  I am fully convinced that if we are to reach an acceptable conclusion to these negotiations it is now time for the other major negotiating partners, both developed countries and those emerging economy developing countries in a position to do so, to step up and make equivalent contributions which will result in a balanced and ambitious outcome.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that we are currently in the middle of another intensive negotiating phase, with the director general of WTO pushing extremely hard to reach an agreement by the end of 2008.  Only this week the chairmen of the agriculture and market access for industrial goods negotiating committees issued new papers which will be used to move forward the negotiations with a view to reaching agreement in these areas at a ministerial meeting before the end of June.  These papers are currently being examined by my Department and the intention is to call a meeting of the WTO consultative committee in the next week or so to share our assessment with that of the industry.  While full details of these papers are still under consideration, our preliminary view is that they do not address all of the concerns which Ireland has identified in the negotiations.  The papers only became available on Monday night.</P>
        <P>The latest agriculture paper is along the same lines as that issued last February, but it includes more precise language or numbers on some of the main issues.  For example, the level of tariff cuts proposed for the lower tariff bands is specified, whereas a range of possible cuts was included in the previous paper.  The chairman makes clear in his cover note that where he has done this, it does not imply that negotiations are concluded on these points.  These are his proposals and they are not conclusions.  For the crucial highest band, the potential range of reduction proposed remains 66% to 73%.</P>
        <P>The prospect of reducing the tariff cut for sensitive products by two-thirds remains in the text.  This means that a number of tariffs, which would otherwise have to be cut by up to<?oasys _jy ?>70%, would instead be cut by 23%.  An increased tariff rate quota, or TRQ, would have to be conceded in return.  How useful this is depends on the detailed provisions.  The chairman again proposed in the new paper that the TRQ be based on consumption.  The partial designation methodology is included, as advocated by the Commission, but only as one of two options.  In our contacts with the Commission and with other member states, we have stressed the importance of achieving meaningful protection for sensitive products.  I remain very concerned about this point and will be pressing the commission further on it on the basis of the new text.</P>
        <P>The latest text also contains disturbing new language on the definition of the green box, where the concept of ceilings appear to be mooted.  This is of major concern and I will be insisting that the assurances given on this matter as recently as last Monday by Commissioner Fisher Boel are fully honoured.  The paper does not alter earlier proposals on export competition and I continue to have concerns about the lack of parallelism in this area.  My view is that EU commitments to dismantle its export refund system must be matched with equivalent commitments by our trading partners.</P>
        <P>I also have some concerns that new market realities and emerging food security issues are being ignored in the rush towards an agreement.  The world has changed substantially since the Doha round began in 2001 and we need to take these changes into account in concluding the round.  We must safeguard our agricultural production base in the EU so that we can meet the future demand of our population for food, feed and bio-energy, while at the same time remaining in a position to assist least developed countries to meet their growing food needs.</P>
        <P>I have doubts about the wisdom of pressing for conclusion of the negotiations at a time when the United States is in the throes of its presidential election campaign.  The recent progress of <Col N="855"/>the farm Bill in Washington does not suggest that there is any appetite in Washington for a deal at this stage, yet we are closer to the point where it is expected that the WTO director general will call a ministerial conference to attempt a partial conclusion of the round.  I have to question this approach.</P>
        <P>There remains a clear imbalance in these negotiations between the level of ambition in the agriculture pillar and that of the other negotiating sectors.  Equally, there is an imbalance within the agriculture negotiations across the different negotiating pillars and in respect of what the EU is being asked to concede and what it is receiving in return.I want to assure the House that while I am committed to a successful conclusion to the round I am determined to ensure the interests of EU agriculture are not undermined for the sake of an agreement.  There must be an equitable agreement which deals with all elements of the negotiations and ensures continued economic development for Ireland and the EU.</P>
        <P>I, my colleagues in Government and my officials have taken every opportunity to make our concerns on these negotiations clear to the EU Commission in bilateral contacts and at meetings of the EU co-ordinating groups in Geneva, the Article 133 committee, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and the General Affairs and External Relations Council.  I can confirm to the House that we will continue to take every opportunity to highlight and express Ireland&rsquo;s concerns as these negotiations progress.  At this week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I informed the Commission, in no uncertain terms, of Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental concerns with the direction of these negotiations.  This view was supported by the clear majority of member states who intervened on this issue at the meeting.</P>
        <P>I recently met my French counterpart and I can report that Ireland and France are at one on this issue and will not accept a WTO agreement that would sacrifice EU agriculture for the sake of a deal.  At this meeting we exchanged detailed views on the ongoing negotiations and it was clear we had very similar concerns about the lack of balance in the present situation and about the push for an early agreement even though many important issues have yet to be resolved.  Both of us had serious misgivings about the negative impact of the current proposals on EU agriculture.  We agreed it was important to communicate these concerns forcefully to the Commission and to build alliances with like-minded member states in support of our position.</P>
        <P>This meeting was one of a series of contacts concerning WTO that I am arranging with the Commission and my counterparts in other member states.  I am travelling to Slovenia next week where I will have bilateral discussions on WTO with my colleagues from other member states.  I will also continue to ensure that Ireland plays a leading role in the group of more than 14 like-minded member states who have come together to express concerns about the direction of the WTO agriculture negotiations.</P>
        <P>My objective for agriculture negotiations continues to be to ensure that the 2003 CAP reforms, which have been already implemented, and which represent the limit of the EU mandate in these negotiations are not undermined.  My specific priorities in the negotiations cover the main negotiating pillars, namely, domestic supports, export subsidies, market access and non-trade concerns.</P>
        <P>On domestic supports, my aim is to ensure the EU system of decoupled direct payments continues to qualify as non-trade-distorting payments under the WTO green box classification and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round.  There can be no question of the decoupled single farm payments being undermined by any WTO proposals for reviewing the green box.  This is a clear red line for the Government which cannot be crossed in the negotiations.  There are threats to the definition of the green box emanating from recent discussions in Geneva and, as I mentioned earlier, from the latest paper from the Chair of the agriculture committee.  I will be vigilant to ensure these threats do not come to fruition.</P><Col N="856"/>
        <P>On export subsidies, my priority is to ensure there is full parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidy and to seek the maximum flexibility in the phasing out arrangements for the EU export refunds scheme.  In the CAP health check discussions I also have been emphasising the critical importance of maintaining effective flexible market management measures, including export refunds.  While export refunds remain a policy tool of the EU, they should be used by the Community whenever the situation requires.  There is strong support for this position in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council.</P>
        <P>Regarding market access, it is vitally important that Irish and EU farmers have sufficient time to adjust to the CAP reform and, in particular, the impact of the introduction of the decoupled payment system.  An effective import regime has a vital role to play.  Therefore, my aim is to retain the most effective level possible of protection for our producers and exporters from increased imports.  I have been strongly pressing the Commission on this issue as have my colleagues in Government at every opportunity and in every available forum.</P>
        <P>The current negotiations in Geneva are significantly focused on market access issues at present and in particular on the question of sensitive products.  This is a core issue for Ireland and it is crucial that sensitive product status should deliver real and meaningful protection for key sectors of our farm economy.  This is a fundamental issue for our country and I will continue to make sure the Commission is in no doubt about that.  I will continue to take every opportunity to raise the issue of recognition for non-trade concerns in the WTO negotiations.  The Doha mandate, which sets out in broad terms the objectives of this round of WTO negotiations, provides for the recognition of non-trade concerns in the final agreement.</P>
        <P>I wish to repeat the strong commitment the Government and I have to achieving a successful conclusion to this round of WTO negotiations.  However, other WTO negotiating partners must realise that the EU has made its contribution and it is now time for them to step up and make appropriate moves to facilitate a balanced and ambitious outcome.</P>
        <P>I want to assure the House that I and my Government colleagues will continue to play an active role in the ongoing negotiations and vigorously pursue the key objectives I outlined today.  I will also continue to work closely with the Commission and other like-minded member states to secure a balanced agreement that will benefit Ireland into the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned that I met the French agriculture Minister, Michel Barnier, on my second day in office.  We had a useful discussion and France is like-minded on these issues.  At the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting last Monday, I vigorously outlined our concerns to the Commission members present.  I also had short bilateral meetings with colleagues from other countries.  On Sunday night and Monday at the Council meeting and in face-to-face meetings with other Ministers I will emphasise our serious concerns about the negotiation and our ambition to achieve an ambitious and balanced outcome, one that does not sacrifice European or Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, and all members of the Government, will continue to take every opportunity available in all fora to ensure the clear message to the Commission is that we will not allow Irish or EU agriculture to be sacrificed for the sake of getting a WTO deal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share four minutes of my time with Senator Regan.</P>
        <P>I welcome to the House the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, congratulate him on his appointment and recognise that he has had a baptism of fire with the question of WTO talks and their profound impact on Irish and European agriculture.  The Minister concluded his remarks by referring to a recent meeting with the French Minister, Mr. Barnier.  We read about the meeting and, from the point of view of Irish agriculture and Irish <Col N="857"/>farmers, it was refreshing to hear the French Minister express the willingness of his department and Government to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the current WTO proposals by the possible use of the veto.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not state this morning his willingness to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the same determined fashion.  Also, he did not mention this morning Peter Mandelson, a name which is currently striking fear into the Irish agricultural community.  Some 10,000 farmers protested outside the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann some weeks ago against the Mandelson proposals.  Peter Mandelson is bringing to the table a British-type perspective in regard to cheap food and a reduced emphasis on agriculture and that is a dangerous formula.  This is frightening from the perspective of the future of rural Ireland and the agriculture and food production sectors in Ireland and Europe.  Without a doubt, farmers are not crying wolf.  The very future of our industry is at stake.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A minimum of 50,000 jobs in farming and 50 to 1,000 jobs in the agri-food sector across the country will be affected.  If this is not bad enough, food security in Ireland, Europe and across the world will also be affected.  A significant policy change since the commencement of the Doha round is the world food crisis with riots on the streets of capital cities in regard to the cost of food.  The policy emphasis must change.</P>
        <P>We are currently debating the ongoing CAP programme.  Healthcheck was announced yesterday.  At the core of any debate here, in Brussels or worldwide in respect of the future of agriculture must be food security and supply.  We must ensure this issue remains at the top of the agenda.  With that in mind, we cannot allow to come into being any set of proposals that would decimate Irish and European agriculture.</P>
        <P>I am worried that we are not sending from this House or this country to our European colleagues a sufficiently strong signal that we will say no to the proposals.  It is fine to speak about a balanced deal which is what everybody favours.  Also, it is fine to speak about the need for an eventual agreement.  We all know that at some stage an agreement will be reached.  However, we must state clearly and publicly that if we reach the point of so-called no return, the Irish Government will use the veto which has been used on a limited basis on at least two occasions by previous Irish Governments.  The farming organisations and agricultural sector want to hear the Minister state Ireland will take the ultimate step of taking the Mandelson proposals off the table.  I had hoped the Minister would make that statement this morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the concerns shared by Ireland and France and to the serious misgivings of the French and Irish Governments.  If the French Government and agriculture Minister can state clearly and publicly that they will ensure the WTO negotiations will not go beyond a certain acceptable point, we should be able to state likewise.  I appreciate the Minister was only recently appointed to this portfolio but he is not new to agriculture.  The Minister comes from a rural background and must be fully aware of the appalling consequences which would flow from the Mandelson proposals.  I hope he will state louder than he said this morning and more clearly than he stated yesterday in the D&aacute;il that Ireland will take the ultimate political step at EU level to block these proposals.</P>
        <P>As we speak, the American political system is responding in its own way to the future of agriculture in the United States and is putting in place a new regime of significant support for American farmers.  Yet, at European level little is being done in this regard.  We are perhaps even moving in the opposite direction.  It will be difficult to reach a final agreement when America is moving in one direction and Europe is moving in another while simultaneously facing an ongoing global food crisis.  Let us not rush into accepting proposals which would be so detrimental to us all.</P>
        <P>There remains a tiny minority who do not accept the seriousness of the situation.  A number of years ago we debated in this House and elsewhere the future of the Irish sugar industry.  People said at the time that it could not come to pass that an entire industry would disappear. <Col N="858"/> However, with the strike of a pen in Brussels an Irish industry was wiped off the map.  This WTO deal would decimate rural Ireland.</P>

As we all know this company has been a major plank for the economy of the southeast and Waterford city.  We need to debate not alone the issue of manufacturing in Waterford but of competitiveness in Ireland in general.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Waterford Crystal continued to export goods when no other industry could do so and it now needs Government support in finding a mechanism through which it can continue into the future.  I mentioned earlier the tourism implications of this company folding.  It is a major flagship for tourism in the south east and it must be supported.  It promotes inward investment from the luxury liner industry.  Many of the liners moored in the Waterford estuary during the summertime provide spin-off tourism benefits for the many hotels, restaurants and business in the southeast.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I look forward to working with him in this House.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s outline of the existing position regarding the WTO ignores the questions raised in this House and the issue signalled to the Leader that Members required to be addressed.  It is not a question of vetoing the WTO as it stands; it is a question of backing up one&rsquo;s words about defending Irish agriculture and indicating one&rsquo;s intention to utilise the veto if required.  That is the assurance being sought by the Irish Farmers Association and the ICMSA.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s outline of the position also ignores the context in which this discussion is taking place which is the Lisbon treaty referendum and the serious concern expressed by farmers in regard to the WTO as reflected in a poll recorded in the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>.  A political link has been made between the Lisbon referendum and the WTO discussions.</P>
        <P>Ireland has moved from being a predominantly agricultural country to being an industrial service economy.  The United States and France are major industrial powers yet they protect and safeguard their agriculture in these type of negotiations.  As Senator Bradford stated, France which is a like-minded country in regard to agriculture has clearly signalled its intention to use the veto if necessary.  Up to now the Government has not accepted it has a veto to use.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>This matter has now been clarified, in particular by the intervention of the European Commission spokesman on trade, whose words clearly indicated that every country has a veto on these negotiations and that situation will not change with the Lisbon treaty.  In view of this perhaps the Minister could, in his reply, clarify whether the assurance which he was given that the Government wishes to support and safeguard Irish agriculture will be made stand up and count when the time comes.  It is very easy to make these statements and then wash hands if the negotiations do not go according to plan.  It is incumbent on the Government to give a clear indication whether it has the bottle to say that it will use the veto if Irish agriculture is undermined by these negotiations.  Farmers deserve no less.</P>
        <P>The European People&rsquo;s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, made a clear statement on the WTO agreement.  A fair and balanced WTO deal is necessary and agriculture must not be sacrificed.  It also called for the European Commission not to exceed its existing mandate and to confirm that it will accept an agreement that will safeguard the European model of agriculture and ensure a high level of food security in Europe.  There is a broad consensus on that but perhaps the Minister might address the matter in his reply.  In the event that the wish of the Government to safeguard agriculture cannot be secured will it be prepared to utilise the veto which is, as is clearly established, at its disposal?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>The benefits of our EU membership are countless but perhaps farmers make up the group that enjoys most support.  From 1973 to 2006, Ireland received a total of over &euro;41 billion from the EU.  This is worth noting in light of the present mistruths being circulated regarding the veto.  In terms of direct payments and market supports, 38% or &euro;0.7 million came from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  These are in addition to the accompanying measures including the Rural Environmental Protection scheme, REPS, and schemes for early retirement, fish withdrawal and forestry.  Receipts from the EAGG Fund amounted to &euro;2.7 billion in the same period to fund Leader programmes, schemes for farm waste management, installation aid and dairy hygiene as well as forestry NDP schemes on native woodlands.   On the fishery side, funding was provided for decommissioning of fishing vessels and investment in agricultural projects.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">In the period from 2007-13, Ireland can expect to receive approximately &euro;12 billion from the Common  Agricultural Policy, with &euro;2.3 billion coming from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to fund REPS, ERS, farm investment programmes, installation aid schemes and Leader programmes.  Almost &euro;10 billion will come from the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund and this will be used to fund the single payment scheme and market support measures.</P>
        <P>Treaty opponents allege that the Lisbon reform treaty will result in Ireland losing its veto in certain future WTO negotiations.  This is not the case.  Regarding the WTO negotiations, the treaty will leave the situation essentially unchanged.  This means that efforts to link the WTO and the treaty referendum are not grounded in the facts.  The Minister mentioned in his speech that at this week&rsquo;s Council of Agriculture meeting he informed the Commission in no uncertain terms of Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental concerns regarding the direction of these negotiations.  He also met with his French counterpart, M. Michel Barnier, and reported that Ireland and France are at one on this issue and will not accept a WTO agreement which would sacrifice EU agriculture for the sake of a deal.  That is worth noting and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, had what she described as a &ldquo;robust&rdquo; meeting with Commissioner Peter Mandelson some weeks ago.  I urge the new Minister to have another meeting with Mr. Mandelson and to re-emphasise his position on this matter and let the Commissioner know that he will not get away with what he is proposing.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of EU Ministers for Agriculture it was noteworthy that 20 EU governments opposed Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s strategy, including those of France and Germany.  It is very important for Ireland that such large countries will not take into consideration what the Commissioner proposes for Irish agriculture.  I agree with Senator Bradford that much has changed since the Doha talks began, as world food shortages have become an issue.  I noted yesterday when the CAP was discussed that setaside was to be examined.  That is important.  It was criminal to have the finest land in Ireland set aside in the past number of years.</P>

	<P>It was a retrograde step and one that I believe we will pay for but I hope that even at this stage we can get back to producing food in a proper way.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well.  With regard to the veto, I have no doubt that when that time comes &mdash; remembering that no negotiating body should ever reveal its hand &mdash; the Minister will use his best judgment and advice from Government colleagues on the future direction of Irish agriculture.  I am confident that the Minister will not sell out.</P>
        <P>I listened to the &ldquo;Farm Diary&rdquo; programme and noted that the Minister&rsquo;s brother, who is very much involved in agriculture in west Cavan, laid out a very stringent line.  He made valid points <Col N="861"/>and it was clear that, as far as he is concerned, the Minister will not be in the clouds.  He will keep his brother well grounded on what is happening.</P>
        <P>A &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this referendum would mean that Ireland will lose influence.  This is a very sensitive political time in Europe when we must undoubtedly address matters in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I appeal to farmers today to come out and to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the Lisbon treaty.  It will give the Government a stronger hand.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; that will weaken our negotiating power in Europe during the coming months.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

It is well deserved for a diligent hardworking politician and I congratulate the Minister.  I look forward to him doing well.</P>
        <P>Like the previous speaker, I also listened to the Minister on &ldquo;Farm Week&rdquo; which, incidentally, is one of the better programmes on RTE and should be required listening for every public representative.  On a week by week basis it gives an insight into farming and rural Ireland which is, as a general rule, missing.  In my opinion RTE runs the repeat of that programme too close to the next edition, as it goes out on Friday night and again on Saturday morning.  More space should be allocated between editions when people can pass the word to others that the programme is worth catching.  Time and time again, the programme strikes a chord with anyone who has an interest in what it does.  It is superb.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to be careful with regard to the WTO.  I read and listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and I do not disagree with anything in it.  However, I have fundamental difficulties with it.  Prior to going any further with this, will the Minister look back at what happened in Irish agriculture in the 1990s?  Irish farmers were misled by their elected leaders and every political party to believe that in some way Irish beef prices would be different from global prices.  We had this debate during the 1990s when farmers had a go at every Commissioner for Agriculture.  I got tired of defending Commissioners for Agriculture and Ministers with responsibility for agriculture, including Ivan Yates, Ray MacSharry and various other people, who were doing their best.</P>
        <P>Let us all get behind this issue and recognise it is not about a veto.  In point of fact, a veto has no place in a democratic structure.  The idea that one person can overrule the rights of the majority is wrong but this is a debate for another day.  I hope it does not come to the Minister having to use the veto.  If it exists, of course it should be used if it is necessary to do so.  My view, however, is that a veto can never be justified in a democratic structure.</P>
        <P>We need to consider the Treaty of Rome writ large.  The only reason we have WTO talks is that we dumped on the Third World and the developing world and we did not allow world farming to develop.  Reference was made already to the fact that after millennia of encouraging farmers and farming to increase production, to refine production methods and to become more efficient, we came up with set-aside, food mountains and producing food we do not need.  The Minister has responsibility with regard to world food prices and world hunger and we need to consider these in global negotiations.</P>
        <P>If the Minister could arrange tomorrow morning for the Treaty of Rome &mdash; in other words free movement of trade, goods and labour &mdash; to be in force throughout the world we would not be having this conversation because everything would sort itself out very quickly.  However, western countries can dump food with export subsidies to cheap and poor countries in Africa. <Col N="862"/> This would be fine if the workers in those countries could go to the United States or to Europe and earn money at the same level.  We would finally have an equation.  Eventually, this will happen and we will have a levelling off.  The WTO is about how we guide this and have fairness while protecting our industry.</P>
        <P>This issue is not about the WTO or the European veto.  It is about a fundamental point, namely, the income farmers receive.  It is appalling.  As a trade unionist, I am appalled at the level of income on which colleagues in the farming industry must live.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not blame the Government for this.  This is not a political point.  With my trade union background, if I had to face into negotiations where the people I represented were paid less now for labour than they were five, six or seven years ago, I would kick the door off the hinges on the way in and no one would leave until we had a deal.  I have great sympathy for the farmers in this matter.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister take home with him a copy of the Abattoirs Act, throw it in the fire and start again?  If the Minister were to visit a hotel close to the Border in his constituency and ask who supplied the steaks the people eat in the restaurant he most likely would be told they are supplied by a butcher from the other side of the Border because the Department here imposes stronger and more stringent requirements on retail butchers than in the North.  A butcher who lives next door to a hotel in a small town in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency supplying the local hotel is considered to be a wholesaler.  It is difficult enough being a butcher given the regulations with which they must comply as a retailer, but if a butcher becomes a wholesaler the regulations are doubled up with a new set of inspectors.  Will the Minister examine this?</P>
        <P>When the Minister and I grew up, one bought meat from a local butcher who knew it was from his or her own land, a neighbour&rsquo;s land or from land down the road.  It came off the grass and it was clean food and properly put together.  When one buys from a local butcher now, however, the chances are that he or she cannot state for sure from where the meat comes.  I know I will receive correspondence about traceability but if one walks into an abattoir one will see animals from 25 different areas of the country being killed at the same time.  Nobody need tell me one can be sure where an animal goes.  Even the design of abattoirs is wrong.  Butchers should have their own locked chilling rooms in abattoirs for the meat they kill themselves.  The requirements for killing are far too stringent.  Local butchers should be encouraged to kill, hang, skin, cut up and serve their own meat.  We would then know from where it comes.  It is a small matter which would deal with a number of issues.</P>
        <P>Every year I walk into French supermarkets and look at the price of Irish lamb.  Irish lamb is cheaper in French supermarkets than it is in Irish supermarkets.  How can this be?  After being carried all the way to France, it is cheaper there.  At the same time, Irish farm gate prices for lamb are extraordinarily low while we pay top dollar in the supermarkets.  These are the issues we need to examine.  We need to support our farmers properly by putting shillings in their pockets and helping them to produce and do their work properly.</P>
        <P>We should also examine production methods.  People have forgotten the time when no beef was produced on grass.  It was all produced through hormones and growth promoters.  I wish the Minister well in a difficult job.  His focus must stay on the issues he discussed on the radio last week and on the people who depend on agriculture.  We need to allow them to make money, earn a living and continue their contribution to the Irish economy and community, particularly the structured rural community throughout the country.  They deserve our support and are far more important than the WTO.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, for sharing his time with me.  I heard speakers describe Commissioner Mandelson as acting in a very British manner.  This was an unnecessary comment.  We should analyse what he is doing.  I do not know whether it is British.  I am not sure what &ldquo;British&rdquo; means in this sense.  He has certainly behaved with a lack of caution and taken a fairly bullying approach.  Perhaps it links in to the colonial past but we associate ourselves with it in many ways when it puts pressure or a squeeze on some of the least developed countries on the planet.  I am glad Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole raised this point.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech contains an interesting paragraph where he discusses safeguarding production based in the EU to meet future demands of our population for food and bioenergy.  I am glad this was mentioned because population is rarely mentioned, and it must be examined.  The problems for departments in every country go back to the explosion in population, about which nobody is talking.  The population is at twice the level it was at when I entered Trinity College.  During my adult life, the population of the planet has doubled.  Perhaps it will do so again during the next 50 years.  This is what is putting pressure on agriculture resources.</P>
        <P>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole is correct about the dumping of food on the Third World.  It is not a level playing field.  Often in politics the level playing field approach is advocated.  Our activities as part of the European Union mean we are part of an attempt to impose economic partnership agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which exceed the demands of the WTO.  The demands of the WTO are even unfair, as has been indicated by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  How much more unfair then are those demands which exceed them and to which we are party?  I appeal to the Minister to examine this liberalisation of trade in the selfish interests of the European Union which goes even further than the WTO.  These agreements, as they stand, do not constitute development friendly partnerships, as they go beyond what is required for compliance.</P>
        <P>A number of west African ministers have deplored the message exhorted by the European Commission in a statement following a meeting of theirs recently.  The African Union Assembly declaration stated, &ldquo;The process leading to the conclusion of interim EPAs did not build on what was negotiated earlier and, in particular, political and economic pressures are being exerted by the European Commission&rdquo;.  Mr. Mandelson was referred to again in the context of the tantrums he threw and bullying engaged in.</P>
        <P>I have three requests to make of Government.  We should back independent evaluations of any impact assessment of what has been agreed in the economic partnership agreements.  There should be renegotiation of any aspect and we should reduce it at least to the minimum necessary for WTO compliance.  We should allow for complete flexibility for developing countries in any negotiations on trade-related issues such as intellectual property to be led by a developing country.  This flows directly from our practice, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, of not only protecting our own farmers but disadvantaging the poorest and least advantaged on the planet.</P>

The explicit purpose of these negotiations is to deal with the needs of the developing world and how trade can be used as an instrument to improve the lot of two thirds of the world&rsquo;s population living in subsistence.  It is curious we are discussing the talks in the context of a political debate and their ramifications for an important sector of our society and how it may vote in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  That is as far away from what the WTO talks are about as one can be.  It is important that when we have such a debate in the House we are assured of its proper context.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>We can argue politically about the effectiveness of these talks and whether people who are intimately involved in the talks such as Peter Mandelson, who is representing the Union, have operated in the best interest of all concerned but we can be sure the people who should be least affected by the outcome of the talks are those involved in our agriculture industry.  I am glad the Minister for State with responsibility for horticulture and food is present because the WTO talks offer, aside from present concerns, a significant opportunity for the restructuring of domestic agriculture.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others said, farmer incomes in Ireland are unacceptable.  Those who depend on agriculture for a livelihood are looking too much to their capital resources to generate an income farming does not provide.  There are disadvantages to the system of agribusiness practised in the State because large multiples earn profits from the sale of food that are not gained by farmers.</P>
        <P>However, there is an opportunity to put in place a system of agriculture that relies more on the growing of food and direct selling by the farmer to the retailer.  The Minister of State is intimately involved in these issues.  We can rail as much as we like against the changing international climate and trade agreements but, ultimately, my party believes the prosperity of rural communities, agriculture as an industry and the business of farming depends on getting the relationship right at local level.  This is where the political system continues to fail the agriculture industry and rural communities.  I would like a wider debate on those issues at a different level.</P>
        <P>I refer to the role of Commissioner Mandelson, how he is dealing with these talks and the likely impact that will have on Ireland.  He is operating within a mandate.  A series of agricultural reforms has taken place in Europe, which will eventually phase out the use of subsidies in the industry.  The Commissioner has no mandate to go beyond what has been agreed.  It is clear, because of the importance of agriculture in this country, the Government will not agree to an extension or abuse of that mandate.  It is also clear Ireland will not operate in isolation in taking the Commissioner to task in following his mandate.  Other countries, most notably France, which takes over the EU Presidency shortly, have a similar view and they will be similarly exercised to ensure such a turn of events will not happen.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole about whether Ireland should rely on the threat or use of a veto in its international relations.  The use of a veto in negotiations very often signifies a failure of international diplomacy.  The veto does not exist because of agriculture.  Previous EU treaties have been modified in order that the use of the veto for agricultural purposes can no longer be applicable.  The veto could be used in these negotiations in regard to other services under discussion.  That is a rich irony in the context of the protection of domestic agricultural interests but that is the reality.</P>
        <P>It is bad negotiating practice to threaten to use a veto beforehand without knowing where the end game lies and where a country is most diplomatically advantaged in using it.  Those who are calling for the veto to be used are tying the hands of those representing the State within the Union and the Union in the WTO talks.  On all those grounds, it is a side issue, which is personifying other areas of discontent in rural communities and the agriculture industry.  That is why I reiterate my call for a wider debate about issues that need to be addressed, which are a million miles from the WTO talks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I congratulate Deputy Brendan Smith on his recent appointment to Cabinet and I wish him well in the onerous task that awaits him.  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute on my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party to the debate and I thank the Leader, my friend and colleague, for <Col N="865"/>facilitating this discussion.  He has provided time for a number of interesting and constructive debates since taking up his role last September and this debate is no different.</P>
        <P>Coming from a rural constituency in Tipperary, I am acutely aware of the importance of the WTO talks and the genuine fear and uncertainty farmers are feeling about the negotiations.  We face one of the greatest threats to Irish agriculture since we entered the Common Market in 1973.  The industry has been the backbone of the economy.  When it is thriving, Ireland does well and when it is in crisis, everybody is affected and not only the farming community.  Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals to open the EU market, increase food imports and reduce tariffs by up to 70% will have a massive and detrimental consequences for our farmers.  The IFA estimates the cost of the deal on the table at approximately &euro;4 billion per annum.  This will decimate Irish agriculture.  There is no other way to put it.  It is time for the Minister and the Government to get real on this issue and to start fighting for Ireland and Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>There was much talk, and rightly so, about the closure of the sugar industry in Ireland and I do not want to diminish in any way the difficulties that this caused for people, particularly in Mallow and Carlow.  However, the current WTO proposals will have much more serious and far-reaching consequences.  The loss of the sugar beet industry should have been a lesson to us all.</P>
        <P>Rural Ireland has been through a tough time on this Government&rsquo;s watch.  Since this Government came into office 11 years ago, it has activated policies that are slowly but surely closing the lid on rural Ireland.  Rural creameries are now a thing of the past.  The Government finished off the rural pub and rural post office as if it were eating them for breakfast.  Between itself and the Health Service Executive, it is making a good job of bringing about the extinction of the rural pharmacy as well.</P>
        <P>Any deal of this sort would seriously damage the EU&rsquo;s stated commitment to preserving the European style of farming, which is based on family farms.  The future viability of the family farm structure as we know it is now in danger as a result of these proposals.  This deal also effectively allows large volumes of food to be imported from outside the EU, which undermines the biosecurity of the agricultural sector, an area that Irish farmers have done their utmost to protect.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, has a great interest in that regard.</P>
        <P>In recent times, we have heard of numerous food scares with non-EU produced food products.  Any agreement must ensure food safety and security.  We have also heard about problems of global food shortages and the dramatic rise in food prices.  Food security needs to be made a high priority in these talks and this is not the case at present.</P>
        <P>It is not right to have a situation where Irish agriculture measures up to the highest standards of production, hygiene, safety and traceability and yet large quantities of imported products from dubious sources are allowed to enter Ireland and the European Union.  The question arises as to what the Minister and his predecessor have done to protect Ireland&rsquo;s welfare.  We are told that they have been working to build alliances in Europe in an attempt to get a better and more balanced deal.  If that is the case, I ask the Minister to inform the House today if, after all the alliance building, there is a sufficient blocking minority at the Council of Ministers to force a rethink on this deal?  It is a simple question and the House deserves to know the present status.</P>
        <P>This is not a good deal for Irish agriculture, rural Ireland or Irish exports and the Government should not be afraid to say it.  The Government should not be ashamed to stand up and protect the interests of Ireland.  So far, it has failed to do so.  A colleague in the other House put it best when he said:</P><Col N="866"/>
        <P LI="1">The Minister and the Government must do whatever is necessary to protect Irish farming by ensuring there is no sell-out in the WTO talks.  Time is running out and a marker must be put down quickly.  It is not sufficient and it is too vague to suggest that we will negotiate a balanced agreement.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach left the Department of Finance a few weeks ago in turmoil.  Unemployment and inflation are rising at a rate unseen for 20 years, competitiveness is disappearing and tax revenues are falling.  Let there be no doubt about it.  If Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals for agriculture under this deal become a reality, the picture will get worse.</P>
        <P>Dairy farming is extremely important to the local economy of south Tipperary from where I come.  This deal will put dairy farmers in Tipperary to the pin of their collar and put many more of them out of business altogether.  After dairy farming, the beef sector is the main staple of Irish farming.  In recent years, margins have been so tight that most beef farmers have had to take on another job to subsidise their way of life.  Beef farming is now largely a part-time venture.  This deal will make it unviable and if viability were to collapse, it would be devastating for rural Ireland and the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>I really feel that the Government is failing in its duty to Irish agriculture.  By its failure to keep farmers informed, it has created a great sense of fear for the future among the farming community.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor refused to make available or to articulate her analysis of the implications for Irish agriculture of Mandelson&rsquo;s agenda.  This has done nothing to ease the legitimate concerns of farmers.  Perhaps the new Minister might be prepared to do things differently.</P>
        <P>Over recent weeks, we have all been going around the country informing people about the EU reform treaty.  This work is important and the people have the right to know what is in the treaty.  This is equally the case for the WTO talks and the implications for Irish agriculture and jobs in all sectors.  I urge the Minister and the Government to be more open.</P>
        <P>If a deal is to be made, and I am not that confident that agreement at WTO will be reached, it must be fair and balanced.  In no way must a deal be made at the expense of Irish farmers and the future of Irish agriculture.  The Government must spare no effort in defending Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  That is its duty and it will be held to account by future generations if it fails.  My final question to the Minister of State is a simple one and it requires a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; response.  Is the Government prepared to give a commitment to the House that it will use its veto at the Council of Ministers if the WTO deal is bad for Irish agriculture?</P>
        <P>I will end by quoting Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s concluding remarks during a recent Private Members&rsquo; motion in the other House.  His remarks powerfully articulate the Labour Party&rsquo;s position on these negotiations:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our view is one which unashamedly seeks to protect the national interest.  In seeking to do so, we are protecting our economy, particularly the rural economy, and a way of life that is under threat.  Commissioner Mandelson has an agenda which is incongruous with the founding principles of the European Union on issues of subsidiarity and its position as a Community-based trading bloc.  We are now left with an appalling scenario whereby the Mandelson agenda is totally at variance with that of certain members of the Council of Ministers, including our Minister.  The Commission must take its mandate from the Council of Ministers.  It must not exceed its mandate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We cannot and must not trade away the rural economy at a time when other sectors of the economy have been undermined.  The agribusiness sector is the one that has remained constant <Col N="867"/>through thick and thin and throughout the history of our State.  It is the sector that will always be there.  If we are to trade away the concessions that have been hard won through tough negotiations and diplomacy, all those concessions will have been in vain.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the Chamber and congratulate him on his recent re-appointment.  He has a very interesting and challenging role and I am sure he will do an excellent job.  I make this contribution today in the full knowledge of what is unique and valuable about Irish rural life and the economies that sustain it.  I was raised in a rural part of east Galway where every single neighbour was either directly involved in agriculture or only one generation away from a farming background.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that our membership of the EU has provided major supports for Irish farming over the past 35 years but I also believe that we are now approaching a seminal moment when the very survival of Irish farming and our rural way of life is under immediate threat.  The WTO talks are moving towards a final deal and conclusion and if the direction being suggested by Commissioner Mandelson is pursued to its logical conclusion, Irish farm incomes and Irish rural life will be devastated.  Our beef industry, which represents more than 40% of our total agricultural output, could see prices fall to less than &euro;2 per kilogramme and the dairy sector could see milk prices fall to less than 24 cent per litre.  The negative impact on Ireland would at least be of the order of &euro;2 billion per year, with the loss of our suckler cow herd and thousands of jobs in the meat industry.  The concessions already suggested by the Commissioner Peter Mandelson have put 50,000 Irish jobs in imminent danger.</P>
        <P>This Doha Round of the trade talks began in 2001 under vastly different global conditions to those that pertain today.  Oil was less than a quarter of today&rsquo;s price and the world was judged to be submerged under surpluses of cereals, meat and dairy products.  We now see a whole range of countries from the US to Russia to Argentina taking concrete steps to tax or limit exports of cereals to ensure their internal needs are met in the future.  We see other countries such as India and China taking steps to limit the use of cereals in bio-fuel production and everywhere we see a new consciousness of the need for adequate food security.  With oil prices approaching $150 per barrel and the responsibilities placed upon all of us in tackling climate change, how much longer can we justify transporting foodstuffs thousands of miles from farm to fork?  I very much support the contribution made by Senator Boyle earlier on when he said that we must explore the strengths of the Irish rural economy and Irish farming in being able to provide for a whole new need for consumer-driven, high-quality foods.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also mentioned earlier on that he has the opportunity to travel to France every now and again, as do I.  The very high regard for artisan-produced foods held by consumers in France always amazes me.</P>
        <P>They are willing to pay a premium for such foods because they trust their origin and believe in the passion and commitment of the producers.  That is an area of farming that has never been explored properly in Ireland.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, has made good progress in that area and I would encourage him to do more.</P>
        <P>The realities surrounding world trade in agriculture have fundamentally changed since these talks began.  The WTO system has not recognised that change in agriculture.  In particular, the system has not recognised the gaping differences between the standards in food production in Ireland and those of the so-called emerging economies.  Irish farmers cannot be expected to compete with a Brazilian beef sector where there are much lower standards of traceability and the indiscriminate use of animal medicines is widespread.</P><Col N="868"/>
        <P>I am particularly concerned about the so-called new concessions to farmers announced on Monday last.  Mr. Shelby Matthews, the chief policy adviser representing European farmers, said the new proposals would give rise to agricultural losses of &euro;30 billion per year and that these losses would not be made up by gains in industry or services.  The new text means that sensitive farm goods, which the EU can choose to shield from the full impact of tariff cuts, would get almost no special protection from imports.  The EU&rsquo;s sensitive goods list is likely to include beef, dairy, poultry and other farm products.  Mr. Matthews went on to say that every time the talks produce new papers, it seems to get incrementally worse for farmers.</P>
        <P>In Ireland we are at a critical time in our history when we are being asked to renew our faith once again in the EU and its institutions.  I believe the EU deserves our support and our confidence in what it can continue to achieve for us, the people of a small island on the western periphery of Europe.  Irish farmers, despite all of the difficulties I have described, also continue to have faith in the EU and in Ireland&rsquo;s ability to play a meaningful and powerful role in securing a viable future for Irish farming.  For this faith to remain strong and unerring, Irish farmers and the people of rural Ireland need to believe their distinctive way of life will be protected for future generations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of Deputy Brendan Smith as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  He held the position of Minister of State at the Department in the last Government and has very close family connections with the agricultural sector.  I was very enthused by both the content of the Minister&rsquo;s address to the House and the passion with which it was delivered.  He will stand full square behind Irish farmers in these negotiations.</P>
        <P>The Government must confirm that Ireland currently has a veto on the outcome of these talks and that it will retain this veto after the Lisbon treaty is ratified.  It must also confirm that it will use that veto if the final trade arrangements threaten our farming sector.  Such a commitment must be made very soon.  In an interview in the <i>Kilkenny Advertiser </i>on 16 May, the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan said that it was far too early to consider a veto, but she confirmed that it could be used at some time in the future.  While I agree the negotiations must continue to try to achieve a satisfactory outcome, it is now time to reassure Irish farmers that our veto is intact, will remain intact after Lisbon and that it will be used if our unique way of life in rural Ireland is threatened to the point of extinction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Healy Eames.</P>
        <P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, and acknowledge his commitment to agriculture.  I also offer my congratulations to the new Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith.  I wish to acknowledge the good wishes of Senator John Carty to the Cavan football team for the coming season.  He will be aware we had a very good start last Sunday, winning at senior and minor level.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Dan Boyle&rsquo;s suggestion that we have a full debate on issues raised by himself and Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole regarding how we should de-regulate agriculture, an issue that would be close to the Minister of State&rsquo;s heart.  We should discuss issues such as how to make it possible for people to farm and sell their produce locally, abattoirs and so forth.  That should be a separate debate, for another day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are confronting something extraordinarily serious today, a crisis for this country.  This is not just some notion of mine &mdash; all facts support this assertion.  If the Mandelson proposals, as we understand them, are to be implemented or agreed, it would decimate the beef sector in this country, with the loss of thousands of jobs among primary producers and in processing.  I <Col N="869"/>wish to refer to the statistics again and although people are becoming much more aware of the facts and figures, they merit repeating.  The Mandelson proposals would result in 50,000 farmers going out of business as well as 50,000 job losses in manufacturing related to agriculture and in services.  Approximately 1 million suckler cows would be slaughtered and &euro;2 billion in exports would be lost.  In County Cavan &euro;94 million per year would be lost to the local economy, with 1,300 job-losses in agri-related employment.  These figures, while mostly supplied by the IFA, have been verified by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>That is what we are up against and the scale of the problem.  If the Mandelson proposals go through, another sinister dimension arises in the context of world food shortages.  If we put Irish agriculture out of commission, as well as much of the agriculture on the mainland of Europe, we ultimately deplete food supplies, with implications for Europe and the world.  Such a depletion could add to food-price inflation and reduce the supply of food.</P>
        <P>Before I deal with the major issue in this debate, namely, the veto, I wish to point out that the animal welfare regulations in this country and our investment in animal welfare at both farm and departmental level are major elements in the high cost of production.  It is wrong if, in achieving the best standards in food production, our farmers are penalised.</P>
        <P>The Irish dairy and poultry industries are also significantly threatened by these negotiations.  We tend to focus on the beef sector but a 70% cut in import tariffs for dairy products would result in milk prices of 24 cent per litre, which is unsustainable.  Similarly, lamb production would be unsustainable under the proposals of Mandelson.  These changes could have a cataclysmic impact on Ireland.  The gravity of the proposals and their potential impact cannot be understated.  The Department should do more to highlight the potential costs of these negotiations to Ireland.</P>
        <P>In the current circumstances, Ireland&rsquo;s veto may have to be used.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to state in summary to the House that it will be used as an ultimate weapon, if necessary.  Nobody wishes to use the veto, but it should be our ultimate weapon and that should be made clear to all.  This should be clearly signalled in the context of the negotiations and in the context of securing a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; &mdash; pro-European &mdash; vote in the Lisbon treaty referendum.  It a failure on the part of the Government that to date it has not clearly signalled it will use the veto.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Smith, said he will meet the Slovenian Minister for agriculture next week, which is to be welcomed.  He has met the French Minister for agriculture.  He must conduct bilaterals with every European member state, even in the context of the latest developments.  A set of bilaterals should be held throughout Europe in the next few weeks.  In addition, there should be an explicit threat that we will use the veto.  Why should we not threaten the use of the ultimate weapon?  Farmers need that reassurance, as do the rest of people in this country, to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the Lisbon treaty referendum.  There is no reason not to give it.  It would be a good proud statement of nationalism.  Of course we would qualify it by saying the caveat is that we do not wish to use it, that we wish to negotiate and that we will negotiate to the end.  There should be no doubt, however, that we would use it and, ultimately, it may have to be used.  No native, sovereign government could contemplate accepting the proposals put forward even in a diluted form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am glad he is here for this debate because he is sincere in his interest in this area.  Our food exports are important to us as a nation.  I am worried about the future of Irish farming.  I am married to a beef farmer and grew up on a dairy farm.  Therefore, I have a fairly intimate knowledge of both sectors.  Like previous speakers, I seek information, which is needed, on whether the <Col N="870"/>Government will use its veto if there is an unacceptable deal for agriculture arising from the WTO talks.</P>
        <P>This is ultimately about the protection of Irish farming and farm incomes.  Farmers are vulnerable to outside threats.  I must be honest and say I could not possibly rely on farming to make my living.  Farmers are vulnerable to global factors, such as energy costs, with the increases in the price of oil and fertilisers, the price of the latter having gone through the roof.  Farmers&rsquo; livelihoods are literally wavering in the wind, not to mind weather conditions that can pose a threat to cattle and sheep.</P>
        <P>To satisfy farmers, clarification is needed about the use of the veto prior to the vote on the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I accept, as Senator Carty rightly said, that the Lisbon treaty and the WTO talks need to be decoupled.  Farmers, however, need that reassurance.  Their stance is holding up agreement on a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum, but one cannot blame them because they are under threat.</P>
        <P>It appears Commissioner Mandelson is selling out European agriculture in favour of other industries and services.  We have no proof he is achieving anything in those other sectors, yet we have considerable proof he is losing a great deal in terms of agriculture.  Where is the gain?  I was disappointed to hear the Minister, Deputy Smith, say in his contribution that, &ldquo;These are his proposals, not conclusions.&rdquo;   I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister not to string on Irish farmers on this issue.  The Minister of State and the Minister are Irish and we are relying on them now.  There is a cross-party approach to work together for Irish farmers.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State not to fool us but to deal with Commissioner Mandelson because he is sending Irish agriculture down the swanny.</P>
        <P>No country in the EU is as dependent on food exports as Ireland.  This is why we are so vulnerable.  In the overall context, we are the fourth largest beef producer in the world, after South America, North America and Australia.  We cannot compete with those large countries with their vast tracks of land, low labour costs and, countries such as Brazil, where there are no environmental or health controls.  I know the Minister of State appreciates the importance of such controls.  We need a safe food supply.  That is what needs to be impressed on the consumer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To take the example of my own County Galway, under Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals beef prices will decrease from &euro;1.20 per lb. to 70c per lb.  Such a price decrease would take the floor from under the industry.  Following the BSE crisis, farmers were struggling, and I know this was the case when the price of beef was 87c to 88c per lb.  We had far lower energy and fertiliser costs then.  The price of milk &mdash; about which one should talk to my father &mdash; currently at 36c a litre, would decrease to 24c a litre under Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals.  Lamb prices would be decimated and Galway is the largest sheep producing county in the<?oasys _jy ?>country.</P>
        <P>We were former land buyers but that business is gone due to farmers gradually getting out of sheep farming.  Effectively, if Commissioner Mandelson gets his way, there will be no sheep or suckler cows in Galway.  The only dairy farmers who will remain will be ranch-type ones.  I am focusing on Galway to localise the issue.  In Galway there has been a loss of &euro;134 million in farm outputs which puts jobs, rural towns and rural life at risk.  There is something much bigger at stake than farming.  Rural life is under threat.  I would like the Minister of State to say whether the Government will use its veto if there is an unacceptable deal for agriculture arising from the WTO talks.  We need this clarified in advance of the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I ask the Minister of State to let us know where he stands on this issue.  I thank him for listening to me and the Acting Chairman for allowing me this time.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, to the House to discuss this important issue.  I take the opportunity also to congratulate my constituency colleague, the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, on his appointment, which is richly deserved.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon reform treaty would leave the position regarding the World Trade Organisation negotiations unchanged.  Linking the WTO negotiations and the treaty referendum is wrong.  Farmers are concerned, however, and we must do our utmost to allay those fears.  Losing a further 8% per annum from their single farm payments is not an appetising prospect for farmers.  However, we hope to be able to ensure that such a proposal becomes a voluntary option for member states to deal with individually.  Commissioner Mandelson cannot be allowed to negotiate on his own.  All European member states must take a stand against him doing his own thing against their wishes.  In his contribution earlier, the Minister, Deputy Smith, said there must not be an agreement merely for the sake of it but one that is fair and equitable.</P>
        <P>The benefits of our European Union membership are countless but the group that enjoys the most support are farmers.  From 1973 to 2006, Ireland received more than &euro;41 billion from the EU in funding for agriculture.  In the period from 2007 to 2013 we can expect to receive approximately &euro;12 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, some linkage has been made between the current World Trade Organisation talks and the Lisbon treaty.  Farming groups are concerned about the direction of the talks but the Government&rsquo;s consistent position remains that of getting a balanced outcome.  We do not want to undermine Irish and European agriculture.  My constituency colleague, the new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, will make the case for Ireland at all available opportunities and I have no doubt he will make the strongest possible case for Irish farmers.</P>
        <P>Beyond the WTO, there will be major issues for Ireland in regard to EU agriculture policy in the short, medium and long term.  It is essential we retain the long-enjoyed goodwill of our fellow EU member states.  Anything which would jeopardise that, such as the rejection of the Lisbon treaty, must be avoided.  The loss of this goodwill would be very damaging for Ireland, Irish farmers and the community.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and the Leader for the opportunity to discuss this serious issue.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  Last month 10,000 farmers converged outside Leinster House to demonstrate their strong opposition to Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s World Trade Organisation deal.  I have attended several meetings of farming organisations in my constituency and the biggest issue on the agenda is the request for the Government to make clear its position on Ireland&rsquo;s right to veto the WTO proposals, especially if there are issues which are very damaging to agriculture.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I was disappointed to hear the Minister say a good deal had been negotiated.  I find that quite extraordinary.  After her meeting with Commissioner Mandelson, the former Minister was so forthright in stating that there were only losses and certainly no gains for Ireland in the WTO deal.  She said there was nothing for farmers, the industry or services in the WTO deal.</P>
        <P>The farming community has made it clear that it is interested in ensuring a union of the member states which would guarantee efficiency and a functioning Europe which would be very influential on the world stage, especially with the emerging powers, the US and Asia, which was referred to by my colleagues.</P><Col N="872"/>
        <P>Commissioner Mandelson has abandoned the interests of the people he is supposed to represent.  He has ignored the past decisions of the Council of Ministers.  Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s record in office represents power without any responsibility.  It is an ego trip.  His brief is as our appointed negotiator but he sells us out at every turn.</P>
        <P>This idea of sensitive product status for beef is not viable.  Prices will be &euro;2 per kg, which will wipe out Ireland&rsquo;s 1 million beef cows.  The Minister should not shilly-shally about this and should let the farming community know about the veto because so much depends on it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish the new Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, well.  He has a tough few months ahead but he is a great negotiator.  The ongoing World Trade Organisation talks have the potential to seriously undermine and decimate agriculture in this country if Commissioner Mandelson is allowed to go beyond his remit and agree to major cuts in import tariffs.</P>
        <P>Many in this House will be aware of a recent presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by the IFA on the implications of Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals on agriculture in this country and in the EU.  The IFA&rsquo;s economic section has calculated that the proposals in the current format will cost the Irish economy &euro;4 billion per annum, drive 50,000 out of business and cost the manufacturing and services industries 50,000 jobs.  A 70% cut in tariffs on beef imports would lead to cattle prices falling to &euro;2 per kg.  As a farmer, I would find it impossible to survive financially if prices were to fall that low.</P>
        <P>Equally, cuts of between 55% and 70% on other products, such as lamb, pigmeat and poultry, would have a devastating affect on the agriculture sector.  Our traditional family farmers could not survive the impact of these reductions in import tariffs.</P>
        <P>It is imperative we do not allow Commissioner Mandelson to sell out Irish agriculture in the name of getting an overall deal in the WTO talks.  I echo the Minister&rsquo;s recent statement that the Common Agricultural Policy must not be undermined by ill-considered reform and unbalanced agreement.</P>
        <P>The results of Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals would be devastating for Irish agriculture and the Irish economy at large.  It is often forgotten how important agriculture and the agriculture food industry is to the Irish economy.  We have become focused on other sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>To put the importance of agriculture to our economy into context, Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world and the sector contributes 25% of jobs outside the greater Dublin area.  This is one instance where farmers and the national interests are intertwined.  Agriculture has been the mainstay of our economy since the foundation of the State and will continue to be as long as Commissioner Mandelson is not permitted to sell out the sector in the name of getting a deal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The CAP was reformed in 2003 with the understanding that this reform was necessary to prepare for the WTO negotiations.  It is clear that Mandelson has not taken cognisance of this fact in the WTO negotiations.  I find this worrying as he is meant to represent the best interests of the European Union and undermining agriculture is not in the best interests of Europe and its people, particularly at a time when food security is a major issue.</P>
        <P>There are some who claim that those opposed to Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals are pursuing a protectionist agenda to the detriment of poorer countries but nothing could be further from the truth.  The reality is that the only beneficiaries from the Mandelson proposals are the multinationals, the corporate ranchers, the US and South America.  Only agreements tailored specifically for poorer countries&rsquo; needs can help foster and stimulate Third World economies.</P><Col N="873"/>
        <P>There is also a danger some farmers may vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the upcoming Lisbon referendum in the mistaken belief that this will serve to highlight their opposition to the WTO talks.  I call on the IFA and my farmer colleagues to vote in favour of the treaty.  Ireland needs to be at the heart of Europe to best represent its interests.  Let us not forget that the CAP health check is under negotiation and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote will give us more leverage to get the best deal for our farmers.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged, however, by the Trojan and spirited opposition shown by the former and current Ministers to Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals in regard to agriculture.  I hope that there may be a fair and equitable outcome to these talks.  We are being strategic in our opposition and have forged many valuable alliances, especially with France and Germany.  The Minister is energetic in this regard and met the French Minister, Michel Barnier, within days of his elevation.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday at the Council of Ministers meeting which underlined the resolve to achieve a balanced outcome to the WTO talks.</P>
        <P>The Minister hails from a county which has a strong and very productive agriculture and agrifood sector.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>He understands the imperative of protecting agriculture and I have every confidence in his ability to deliver a balanced outcome for agriculture here working together with other EU countries that have expressed concern and opposition to the proposals currently on the table.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, was here earlier and I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  His appointment comes at an important time for the development of the agriculture industry here.</P>
        <P>I am glad we have the opportunity today to discuss the WTO talks.  I have been seeking debate on the issue for some time and am glad it is finally taking place.  I pay tribute to the Irish Farmers Association because nobody would be discussing the WTO talks if it had not highlighted the issue.  Previous speakers referred to the protest that took place a number of weeks ago where over 10,000 farmers gathered, close to here, to highlight the difficulties involved for Irish farmers with regard to the proposals put forward by Commissioner Mandelson for the Irish agriculture industry.  I completely oppose those proposals.  The Government must send a clear message to him that we will not accept what he has put on the table so far with regard to Irish agriculture.  If what he proposes is implemented, family farming as it exists here will be destroyed.  I come from a farming background and am still involved, as relief milker, when the call comes from the family farm.  Farming is close to my heart.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers mentioned the Lisbon treaty, which I encourage the farming community to support.  I believe, however, that the WTO talks and the Lisbon treaty have become linked, despite the fact there is no direct link between them.  This has happened because the farming community rightly believes that the Government has not done enough to stand up for farming interests.  Farmers see the treaty as the only opportunity they have to get a result on the WTO talks and want to use the opportunity to get some leverage with the Government.  I urge the Minister and the Government to provide farmers with some reassurance over the next few weeks so that they will be encouraged to vote on the merits of the treaty on 12 June rather than on the difficulties pertaining to the WTO talks.</P>
        <P>Mr. Mandelson has a clear policy on the food industry, namely to promote cheap food, and this has been the policy in the United Kingdom for a number of years.  This is in direct contrast to policy in this country and most of the rest of the European Union.  At a time when there is such global concern with regard to food security and when 5% to 6% of the global population <Col N="874"/>lives with starvation, it is important that we consider carefully the proposal by the European Commissioner for Trade to decimate our food industry.</P>
        <P>I know something about the WTO talks as my area of the country suffered directly, as a result of decisions taken at previous negotiations, when we lost our sugar beet sector.  The beef sector here is 30 times more important than the sugar beet sector was and if any decision is made at the WTO talks that will have a detrimental effect on the beef sector, it will have devastating consequences for large parts of the country.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the fact that under the existing regime within the European Union, the 49 poorest countries in the world have access to the European agricultural market.  Many of those who oppose the CAP are opposed to it because of the harm that is being done to the developing world, but the European Union does more than any other trading block to help the poorest countries in the developing world with regard to their agriculture.  If Mr. Mandelson gets his way, those 49 countries will be the first to be decimated.  They will be swept away before the Irish agricultural sector because their preferential treatment within the Union will be hit first if Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals see the light of day.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the sectors affected by Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals, namely, the beef, lamb, sheep, pigmeat, poultry and milk sectors.  Under his proposals the price of beef could fall to approximately &euro;2 per kg, almost half the current price.  The price of milk could fall from 34 cent per litre to approximately 24 cent per litre.  This is at a time when energy costs have risen enormously and the cost of fertiliser has increased dramatically, having doubled in the past six months and likely to get even more expensive in the coming months.  It is clear that our agriculture industry will not be able to continue on those reduced prices.</P>
        <P>If Mr. Mandelson&rsquo;s proposals are implemented the loss to my county, Kilkenny, is projected at approximately &euro;120 million per annum and approximately &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million per annum to County Carlow.  Under his proposals, some 700,000 tonnes of prime cut beef steaks will enter the European market, more than 25 times current Irish output.  This will happen despite the stringent guidelines we have for our food producers in terms of food hygiene, standards under which the product is produced, labour restrictions and ever improving environmental standards.  This is in stark contrast to production in many countries, particularly in the beef sector in South America.  All of these proposals are being made at a time when there is no prospect of any benefit from the WTO talks for the European Union in terms of services and industrial goods.  We get nothing in return and agriculture will be sold down the Swanee if Mr. Mandelson gets his way.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister and the Ministers of State to ensure that Mr. Mandelson knows we are prepared to use our veto.  I would like to see a situation where it is not necessary to use it, but we must be prepared to use it as a threat.  I urge the Government to send that clear message in the coming weeks, because if the proposals as they stand are implemented they will be the death knell for rural Ireland as we have known it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer first to the European Union.  The discussion on the WTO talks impacts on the reform treaty referendum of 12 June.  The European Union has been hugely advantageous to Irish farming and agriculture.  Having grown up on a very small farm in west Donegal, I know the benefits of the CAP have been advantageous to Irish agriculture, particularly for small farmers in the west and rural communities.</P>
        <P>Since we joined the European Union in 1973, Ireland has gained over &euro;41 billion in direct transfers under the Common Agricultural Policy, with a further &euro;12 billion expected from 2008 to 2013.  For that reason, it is important to reflect on the significant role of the European Union.  Payments may no longer be directly linked to production, but nonetheless, they are important <Col N="875"/>to ensure that rural life continues to be as it is and was.  While many farmers continue to be actively engaged in production, the cheque in the post from the Department is a necessary top-up that enables small and large farmers continue with their livelihoods.  Opponents of the treaty allege it will result in Ireland&rsquo;s losing its veto in future WTO negotiations.  That is not true.  The Lisbon treaty would leave the situation on the WTO negotiations essentially unchanged.  This means efforts to link the WTO and the treaty referendum are not grounded in any facts.  Although there are changes of detail in the treaty, the essential point remains that Ireland will continue to be able to block any unacceptable deal emerging from negotiations such as the current WTO talks.</P>
        <P>While many people, including me, have a common disregard for how Mr. Mandelson is dealing with this issue and how he dealt with the cheap import of goods from China and other countries, the only way to deal with discussions is to work together with other member states.  Under the Lisbon treaty a unanimous decision by the member states will continue to be required for the conclusion of agreements in areas such as trade, services and commercial aspects of intellectual property where unanimity is required for the adoption of internal rules.  The Lisbon treaty also provides for unanimity should any trade agreement impact on foreign direct investment, FDI, in circumstances where unanimity is requested for the adoption of internal rules.  This ensures foreign direct investment arrangements, including our corporate tax regime, will continue to be decided here by the Irish Government and people.  The Council must also act unanimously in the field of trade and social, educational and health services where these agreements risk seriously disturbing the national organisation of such services and prejudicing the responsibility of member states to deliver them.  This means claims that the treaty would be used to impose the privatisation of health and educational services is false.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the weekend I issued a statement calling on Donegal farmers to support the treaty for two reasons.  The first reason is that it will strengthen our case on the CAP health check due to be discussed and decided on in December under the chairmanship of the French agriculture Minister, Mr. Michel Barnier.  The second reason, and perhaps more important to this country, the IFA and all farmers and rural communities in the country, is the WTO trade agreements.  Some 151 countries seek a piece of the action under the negotiations.  Ireland is one of those and it is my firm view that the only way we can use our leverage to its full potential is by working within the structure of the EU.  If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June I firmly believe we will undermine our position.  Instead of taking the opportunity to strengthen our position, we will weaken our position.</P>
        <P>Opponents of this treaty should stop playing politics with this issue and support the farming sector by seeking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Many farmers, when reflecting on the decision they will make on 12 June, will decide to vote for the treaty because it is the right thing to do for Irish farming, agriculture, rural Ireland and to strengthen our case to work with the other 26 member countries in negotiating a better deal for Ireland under the WTO.  We have many allies in the EU, including France, Germany and others who support and agree with our stance on WTO.</P>
        <P>My constituency colleague, the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, did much work on this area.  She went to Brussels and discussed the issue with Mr. Mandelson.  She represented Irish farming interests with distinction.  We have a very able new Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Deputy Smith.  He is steeped in agriculture and knows the business.  We should not undermine our Minister&rsquo;s hand in the negotiations by voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Under WTO we can strengthen our position and get the desired result by supporting the referendum on 12 June.  Voting against it would not support rural Ireland and farming communities.  We should take that message clearly on board and I believe the farming interests will do that.  From speaking to very many farmers over recent weeks and canvassing for the <Col N="876"/>referendum I know the farmers believe they will be best equipped to get the best deal by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 12 June.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>During recent weeks there has been much debate in this Chamber on the World Trade Organisation and the implications the Lisbon treaty will have on the conclusion of any agreements the WTO talks will reach.  One of the reasons this debate was tabled was to issue some clarity.  However, I note from the printed version of the Minister&rsquo;s speech that neither the word &ldquo;Lisbon&rdquo; nor &ldquo;veto&rdquo; appears in the text and that is disappointing.  On 12 June the people will go to the polls and whatever happens on that day, Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe is secure.  That is without a shadow of a doubt.  Over recent weeks there has been much comment but little debate on the facts of the Lisbon treaty and I welcome the opportunity to make some comments on the WTO talks and the implications for Irish farming in future talks if the Lisbon treaty is passed.</P>
        <P>It is clear that there is a great deal of confusion about the contents of the Lisbon treaty, including among senior Ministers. Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste incorrectly stated that larger states had two members on the European Commission.  A few days before that the Taoiseach was forced to admit that he had not read the treaty in full, while the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, incorrectly said that this State has a veto on other EU states coming together in mini military alliances.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, incorrectly said Ireland will retain a veto on international trade agreements.  To make matters worse, on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last week the Chief Whip, Deputy Pat Carey, and Deputy Simon Coveney of Fine Gael, when asked if there was a link between the Lisbon treaty and the WTO talks, contradicted themselves repeatedly.</P>
        <P>Irish farmers and families across rural Ireland are rightly concerned at the agenda being pursued by European Trade Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, in the WTO talks.  His approach is part of a pattern that emerged under his predecessors, Mr. Pascal Lammy and Mr. Leon Brittan, and will continue after he is gone.  It is an agenda that aggressively promotes free trade irrespective of the costs to European family farms and rural communities or to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.  The IFA has estimated that the European Commission&rsquo;s trade agenda will cost &euro;4 billion in lost revenue to the State as well as 50,000 farm livelihoods and 50,000 jobs.  It would undermine the Common Agricultural Policy and the European model of farming based on preserving family farming and food security.  Sinn F&eacute;in shares the IFA&rsquo;s analysis.  We are also concerned that this bad situation will be made worse by a number of specific provisions in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Because of the confusion in this Chamber last week and in previous weeks I would like to set out in some detail the facts on the loss of a veto on international trade agreements if the Lisbon treaty is passed.  Others in this Chamber said the veto will be maintained.  None of them referred to the Lisbon treaty.  Let us hear about the articles.  Article 188 of the Lisbon treaty deals with the EU common commercial policy.  It outlines the remit and rules for the negotiation and conclusion of international trade agreements with non-EU countries and international organisations such as the World Trade Organisation.  This article makes a number of important changes from the current situation.</P>
        <P>Article 188 details the specific rules for the opening and conclusion of such agreements.  At present, qualified majority is the general rule for such agreements except if they include services such as health, education, social services, cultural and audio-visual services and intellectual property.  The current round of the WTO trade talks include agriculture and such services.  This means that the kind of international trade deal currently being negotiated by Commissioner Peter Mandelson at the WTO could be blocked by the Government if it was bad for Irish <Col N="877"/>agriculture, which it is.  However, if the Lisbon treaty were ratified this veto would be lost.  It would be replaced by a much more limited veto on health, education, etc., which could only be used if the agreement could be proved to &ldquo;risk seriously disturbing the national organisation of such services&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>What does all of this mean for Irish agriculture?  The WTO negotiations are unlikely to conclude before the Lisbon treaty referendum, and earlier the Minister stated as much.  Article 188 removes the grounds on which such a veto could be used.  If the treaty is ratified no veto will be available to the Government and it will be powerless to block any deal.</P>
        <P>As if all of this was not bad enough, the loss of an Irish Commissioner for five out of every 15 years from 2014, and the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s voting strength by 50% at the European Council, will further reduce our influence.  Further review of the Common Agricultural Policy is likely after 2013.  This means that future discussions at Commission level could take place without an Irish voice at the table.  It also means that our voting strength at Council will be reduced while those of states such as Britain and Germany will increase.  I ask how could any of this be good for Irish agriculture.</P>
        <P>In recent years the European Union has overseen the destruction of the Irish fishing and sugar beet industries.  Many people rightly ask if it intends to do the same to Irish farming.  The Lisbon treaty is no doubt a bad deal for rural Ireland.  I would call on rural communities to come out and vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June so that the Government can be sent back to negotiate a better deal for Ireland, for Europe, for rural communities and for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s debate clearly highlights the importance of achieving an acceptable outcome to the current round of WTO negotiations.  There can be no doubt that the outcome of these negotiations will present challenges for EU and Irish agriculture.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, highlighted the concerns of the Government in terms of the current direction of the negotiations.  We remain committed to seeking a positive outcome to these negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland has much to gain from the efficient and multilateral trading system provided by the WTO.  However, we must ensure that the final agreement is comprehensive and provides real benefits to the EU and Irish economies.  This will only be achieved if there is real progress made across all of the different sectors of the negotiations.  At present, there is an over-emphasis on the agriculture negotiations and this is leading to the possibility of EU agriculture carrying a disproportionate burden in the negotiations.</P>
        <P>The EU has made significant contributions to the negotiations to date and has supported in real terms efforts to achieve an ambitious outcome through the significant negotiating commitments it has made.  The 2003 reforms of the CAP, which have introduced farm payments decoupled from production and which are considered non-trade distorting in the WTO context, and the agreement to eliminate export refunds represent the EU&rsquo;s real commitment to reform and to reaching an ambitious outcome to these negotiations.</P>
        <P>It is disappointing to have to report that other WTO negotiating partners have not to date made equivalent contributions.  This lack of commitment from other negotiating partners is a major reason for the current imbalance in the negotiations.  The Government is concerned about this imbalance.</P><Col N="878"/>
        <P>Some of the current proposals in the agriculture sector would, we believe, place a disproportionate burden on EU and Irish agriculture.  This is not acceptable to us and to many other member states.  It is now crucial that the other areas of the negotiations make real progress which will facilitate a balanced overall agreement which does not sacrifice EU agriculture.  My Government colleagues and I, together with officials in the Department, will continue to use every opportunity available to us in our many bilateral meetings with the Commission and our EU counterparts, in the EU Council of Minister meetings and in the EU and WTO negotiating forums, to outline and highlight Ireland&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>We have entered another intensive phase of negotiation with the issuing of new papers by the chairs of the agriculture and market access for industrial goods negotiating committees.  The latest indications from Geneva are that the WTO Director General wants to convene a ministerial meeting towards the end of June with a view to reaching agreement in the agriculture and industrial goods sectors.</P>
        <P>Given the significant number of outstanding issues and the imbalance in the level of ambition across the different negotiating areas, it is not clear if and when a ministerial meeting will go ahead and, ultimately, when a final agreement might be reached.  In addition to the large number of complex issues across the broad spectrum of negotiating areas which are unresolved, the uncertainty of the US political situation will play a crucial role in whether the proposed timetable for reaching a final agreement is achieved.  Nevertheless, we must prepare ourselves for the eventuality that a ministerial conference may take place next month and that determined efforts will be made to conclude the negotiations this year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the negotiations continue, while I am committed to a successful conclusion to the round, I assure the House that the Government is determined to ensure that EU agriculture is not sacrificed for the sake of an agreement.  We are striving to achieve an equitable agreement which delivers real benefits across all elements of the negotiations.  The EU must secure an agreement which will ensure continued economic development of its agriculture.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s objective in the agriculture negotiations is to ensure that the CAP reforms, which have already been implemented, and which represent the limit of the EU mandate in these negotiations, are not undermined.  At the same time, we will pursue vigorously with the Commission and elsewhere the detailed technical requirements for the EU to maintain effective import protection for critical products.  This includes equitable treatment of sensitive products that provides meaningful levels of protection, the price for which is reasonable and fair.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has undertaken a wide-ranging analysis of the proposals as they have arisen in the current round of WTO negotiations.  This analysis covers a large number of different scenarios and their impacts on a wide range of agricultural products.  In particular, it evaluates the levels of import protection which would apply under different tariff reduction scenarios which have arisen in the negotiations for the main agricultural products.</P>
        <P>There are a number of independent studies carried out which have also informed this process.  In particular, I would point to the FAPRI-Ireland report of March 2006 and the 2003 Forf&aacute;s report.  The FAPRI assessment is being updated on the basis of the last proposals from the chairman of the WTO agriculture committee and will be finalised shortly.  Some Senators have asked for this analysis to be released publicly.  I would be reluctant to do this in the middle of the negotiations but I would be happy to brief Opposition spokespersons on some of the details if they so wish, and the Minister, Deputy Smith, made the same offer.</P><Col N="879"/>
        <P>The question of whether Ireland should invoke its veto in these negotiations has been raised by some in the House and outside it.  To those who would pose this question, my reply would be that these WTO negotiations are still very much in progress and there is no clarity as yet on either the eventual outcome or the timing of any deal.  In those circumstances, it is premature and defeatist to speak in terms of a veto at this point.</P>
        <P>There are many aspects of the negotiations still outstanding and we should not rush into taking a position on this matter at this time and thereby alienate potential allies.  The important point is to continue to fight strongly for a balanced deal which does not sacrifice agriculture and delivers benefits for Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the House can rest assured that everything possible is being done, and at every political level, to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are best protected in these negotiations.  I, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and other Government colleagues intend to spare no effort in highlighting our concerns and achieving a positive outcome from these negotiations for Ireland.  We will continue to work with other member states in the days and weeks ahead as these negotiations continue to ensure an acceptable outcome is secured for Ireland and the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make a brief comment on the confusion being once again created regarding the veto issue and then ask a specific question on the Minister&rsquo;s proposal on the veto.  Senator Doherty outlined the Sinn F&eacute;in perspective on the veto.  I welcome Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s conversion to the view that Europe is good for Ireland and I welcome its willingness to support Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the broader European family.  I think the Senator&rsquo;s comments are misleading, although they are not deliberately so.</P>
        <P>Last week the European Commission representation in Dublin stated that confusion in the referendum debate about the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s effect on the rights of individual member states to veto trade agreements requires a clear response.  The response is that all member states must currently approve a trade deal between the EU and a third country, including the World Trade Organisation, for such a deal to come into effect, which is effectively a veto right.  It went on to state that this right will not change under the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty also referred to Article 188 of the Lisbon treaty, which states that for the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements, the Council will act by a qualified majority, but for negotiation and conclusion of agreements in trade, services and intellectual property, the Council will act unanimously.  The Doha round of the WTO negotiations not only includes trade in agricultural products but also trade in non-agricultural products such as services and intellectual property.  Therefore, it is a mixed agreement and under the Lisbon treaty, the Council can only adopt any deal by acting unanimously.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;are being simultaneously debated.  It is a bit like the phrase &ldquo;Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA&rdquo;.  Some people say they are connected while others say they are not.  The WTO negotiations are separate from the Lisbon treaty.  Can the Minister of State clarify the points on the veto?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two specific questions for the Minister of State.  The second question is very detailed, and if he cannot respond, can he write to me as soon as possible with the detailed information that I request?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the Minister both alluded to my first question.  Does the Minister of State believe that no agreement will be reached on the WTO talks before the Lisbon treaty referendum?</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s reading of the Lisbon treaty leads us to believe that we will lose the right to veto the outcomes of the current WTO talks.  Will the Minister of State clarify the treaty basis of the current veto that can be used on international trade agreements such as the WTO deal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bradford&rsquo;s outline of the situation surrounding the veto.  There are probably two aspects to the veto, namely, the nature of the veto &mdash; Senator Doherty&rsquo;s second question &mdash;  and how to use it tactically.  The strong view expressed on threatening the use of the veto is that it undoubtedly has an impact of alienating prospective allies and supporters.  When WTO negotiations began almost seven years ago, Ireland was pretty isolated on some of these issues.  One of the important elements that has slowly entered the WTO debate in the interim is the question of food security.  This has caused concern among a number of EU states, including ourselves.  The impact on us has been that Ireland has gone from being close to isolation to having seven or eight allies.  Now there are about 20 EU member states that share our concerns about food security.  It is foolish and self-defeating to talk about using a veto when that many colleagues are supporting our position.  I am frustrated that the WTO negotiations have not yet taken account of the dramatically changed circumstances on food security, but that will happen gradually.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford also asked a question about Article 188 and unanimity.  Almost any article of any treaty is subject to some interpretation.  In my view, the most reliable interpretation that we can put on it is that put by the Council legal services.  Ultimately, that interpretation has to hold sway over my own or that of any other Member of the Houses.  It certainly should hold sway over any interest group advocating a vote in one or other direction.  The clear view of the Council legal services is that unanimity is required for the EU to agree to the WTO proposals in this instance and to the other areas of Article 188 that were mentioned by the Senator.  I am strongly disposed to accepting the advice of the Council legal services rather than any other advice.</P>
        <P>I will check if there is any additional material on this which I could send to Senator Doherty or anybody else with an interest in it, but the judgment call is best made by those who know best.  In this instance, the people of the Council legal services are those who know best.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty said that our position in Council voting arrangements will be diminished if the Lisbon treaty is approved.  It is infrequently the case that the qualified majority voting system is invoked.  It will be twice as difficult under the new system, because it requires not just a majority of the votes, but also a majority of the states.  In my view, the new formula <Col N="881"/>considerably strengthens Ireland&rsquo;s position.  At official and ministerial level, we have managed to engage with other countries and the existence of these allies has been of considerable benefit to us.  As somebody who has attended 15 to 20 Council meetings at three different Councils, I believe that is a great strength and will benefit us after 12 June.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty asked when an agreement will be reached.  It would be a major achievement if agreement is reached this year.  There are many issues involved and as the food security issue comes to the forefront, Ireland&rsquo;s wish to include all of the areas, rather than isolate different areas will be essential to reaching any agreement.</P>
        <P>The point was also made that Ministers have made mistakes on detail when questioned about the treaty.  Anybody who has been in the Houses for a number of years will be aware that it is impossible to read and remember all the detail of any complex document.  It is even more difficult when dealing with the EU, as the situation which originally pertained has been changed by each of the treaties that were passed.  The position on the number of Commissioners no longer pertains, and it is difficult to remember the current situation sometimes.</P>
        <P>With regard to the loss of a Commissioner for a term, the key consideration is that the Commission is more and more an EU Commission rather than a Commission representing individual states.  That will be to Europe&rsquo;s benefit.  The big states such as Germany, France and the UK, will be in exactly the same position as Ireland in respect of membership of the Commission.</P>

    <Title>HSE Child Welfare and Protection Services: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children and youth affairs and wish him well on his appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his kind remarks.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity this afternoon to discuss the important issue of child welfare and protection services, a subject of concern not alone to the Oireachtas but to society generally.  Modern Ireland has seen a considerable rise in the profile of child welfare and protection issues in recent years.  At the same time, we have more recently seen a period of major investment in child care and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns with more than &euro;240 million in Government funding having been added to the annual investment in child care services since 1997.</P>
        <P>The core principle underpinning these reforms and additional funding is to provide children and young people with the highest possible quality of care and to provide services to protect them as far as possible from all forms of harm.  Since taking up office I have in all my contacts stressed the priority which both I and the Government place on the need to provide appropriate services to the most vulnerable young members of our society.  In this regard, my aim is the provision of world-class child welfare and protection services for Ireland.  I realise this goal will present many significant challenges in terms of resources and service reform.  I look forward to addressing these challenges on behalf of our children.</P>
        <P>A recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme highlighted many issues and created a much higher level of interest in this area.  I welcome this and thank those responsible for producing the programme.  The media has an important role to play in public affairs.  The programme concerned contributed to our overall knowledge and created a forum for proper discussion on <Col N="882"/>the issue.  There are real issues to be addressed.  I was troubled by the cases presented in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  I am concerned that no child should suffer from problems with services.  However, it is often the nature of our modern media to focus on negative aspects of a given topic.  We must realise that within the short time available to broadcast a programme, the full picture can never be achieved.</P>
        <P>Child welfare and protection in Ireland is primarily predicated on the Child Care Act 1991 and the Children Act 2001.  The Child Care Act 1991 places a legal obligation on the Health Service Executive, HSE, to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and attention.  In implementing the Act, the primary emphasis must be on prevention and early intervention where possible and supporting children in their family situation in the community.  Only in the case of serious problems as judged by social work professionals should alternative appropriate care services which place children outside of the home be provided.  The Act allows for a child at serious risk to be taken into care on a voluntary basis or pursuant to a court order.  Provisions for emergency situations where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of the child are also included in the Act.</P>
        <P>The Children Act 2001 for which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has main responsibility brings about a major reform in the law relating to juvenile justice and the protection of children and makes provision for non-offending out of control children and children whose actions, but for their age, would be a criminal offence.  The focus of the Act is to minimise the need and duration of detention.  A number of pilot programmes have been put in place to cater for children&rsquo;s needs in their own communities.</P>
        <P>There also exists a range of policy and related documents in this area, including the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy, the Children First Guidelines, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and, most recently, the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services, the overarching policy document of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched in December 2007.  The agenda with its clear renewed emphasis on family support, coupled with reflective questions to enable service provider self evaluation, is part of the fundamental change now under way in respect of the formulation and delivery of Government policy in regard to children.  It has been developed drawing on research and best practice at home and internationally.  It requires an outcomes focus and integrated service delivery in line with the recommendations of the recent OECD report.</P>
        <P>In this regard, it is worth noting that action has been taken on all key child welfare and protection related items in the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy with the pace of such action increasing significantly on virtually all fronts since the formation of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  In addition, there have been significant additional HSE-led actions such as the children services committees and the development of children&rsquo;s services plans under Towards 2016.  These commitments are moving ahead in Dublin South, Dublin City, Limerick and Donegal and involve all public service providers in those areas.</P>
        <P>I have been struck, in the short time since I took up my position, by the developments under the children services committees.  I believe they are a model for the provision of excellent services across the statutory agencies.  Members will be aware that there are in many areas of disadvantage various agencies trying to achieve the same end, namely, better outcomes for children.  However, they often do not communicate or share information.  We are bringing together for the first time the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities, VECs and schools in order to provide a strategy which will deliver better outcomes.  Ultimately, I would like if the non-statutory agencies were involved.  Developmental early intervention programmes jointly funded by Government and Atlantic Philanthropy are also being implemented.</P><Col N="883"/>
        <P>All of these initiatives are aimed at producing better integrated inter-agency service provision.  They also seek to provide for earlier intervention via much more comprehensive interlocking service provision for children based on clear planning aimed at agreed outcomes in line with the move to family support initiatives.</P>
        <P>The establishment in 2006 of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, then known as the Office of the Minister for Children, was key to realising the goal of bringing greater coherence to policy making for children.  The purpose was to bring together the agencies responsible for the development of policy in areas that affect children.  Child policy sections from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform came together to create a new policy environment of cross departmental co-operation.</P>
        <P>The office also maintains a general strategic oversight of bodies with responsibility for developing and delivering children&rsquo;s services.  This integration between policy areas is already having a significant impact on improving outcomes for our young people and children.   It is enabling better planning and improved communications between those key areas that must work in co-operation. Those working in child policy areas recognise how important it is that the health, education and justice sectors work together in all sectors of children&rsquo;s services.</P>
        <P>An integrated approach is the only way to deliver better services and ensure improved outcomes for our children.  The setting up and operation of my office in respect of inter-agency, integrated service provision has been praised in the recent OECD report on the Irish public service.  That is a credit to the people who work in that office, to my predecessor, Deputy Brendan Smith, and, before him, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
        <P>Child protection is a key part of the agenda in the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  An extensive programme of specialised residential provision for a small number of children and a range of other child welfare and family support services has been put in place in recent years.  The HSE informs me that it has created over 300 new social work posts since the start of 2005.</P>
        <P>Two days after the broadcast of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme I met with senior officials from the HSE to discuss, among other topics, the issues raised by that report.  One of my primary concerns at this meeting was the issue of vulnerable children being placed on waiting lists for services.  The HSE has assured me that in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, it responds immediately and takes appropriate action.  All child abuse reports to social work departments are subject to a phased process of initial screening and assessment aimed at providing appropriate interventions.  In addition, legislative mechanisms are in place to allow for responses from the Garda, such as, for example, the taking of children to safety in emergency situations.</P>
        <P>I was informed also that a detailed consultation and reporting process is already underway to determine the current state of the waiting list issue.  I expect a report detailing the outcome of this exercise before the end of June.  In addition, I will chair regular meetings on child welfare and protection issues convened between senior officials of the HSE and my office.</P>
        <P>In recent years there has been a rebalancing and readjustment of child welfare services towards early intervention and support for families in order to reduce the numbers of children who may become dependent on State care.  This reflects the Government&rsquo;s policy of emphasising a preventive and supportive approach to child welfare.  In many cases this is done in partnership with non-governmental agencies where the focus is on building capacity in vulnerable communities.  This is in line with the principles of the Children Act 2001 regarding early intervention.  Any parent or person with commonsense knows that early intervention is the key,  particularly with children.  If a child is neglected or abused this will eventually come to the <Col N="884"/>attention of the State, most likely by way of criminality or truancy in the child&rsquo; s later life, if services and welfare are not provided early enough.</P>
        <P>A specific example of such community-based service development is the Springboard Family Support Programme, which is designed to improve the well-being of children and families in Ireland.  All Springboard projects have a general strategy of being openly available to all families, parents and children in their communities, as well as a more specific strategy of working intensively with those who are most vulnerable.  As with other family support programmes Springboard offers a range of interventions including individual work, group work, peer support, family work, advice and practical help.  The HSE is committed to further development of the programme.</P>
        <P>Another example of community-based family support services are the Youth Advocacy Programmes.<b> </b> Established on a pilot basis in 2002, these programmes provide supportive community-based alternatives for the care and protection of children most at risk.  These programmes aim to maintain in their own homes young people who are at risk of out-of-home placement.  There are currently five Youth Advocacy programmes in operation.</P>
        <P>Increases in resources for child care and family support services have continued in recent years.  In addition to the significant number of additional social work posts the HSE has created since 2005, funding of family support services has increased by 79% since 2003.  This reflects the commitment of this Government and the HSE to the ongoing implementation of the National Children&rsquo;s Strategy and, most recently, the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services, already mentioned. Indeed, the HSE has made significant advances in many areas of children&rsquo;s services.  A well-managed national approach is in operation, for example, dealing with the most needy children in HSE care, offering special care and high support.</P>
        <P>In this regard I would like to place on record my appreciation for the work carried out by social work teams and their managers.  These are hard working, dedicated people who must routinely deal with cases that are becoming ever more difficult, complex and intractable.  They very often put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way.</P>
        <P>I am aware that social work out-of-hours service proposals are currently under consideration by the HSE, my own office and the broader Department of Health and Children, to examine how this service can best be introduced nationwide. Notwithstanding this move towards a national approach, a number of out-of-hours service arrangements are in operation to part-cover this service around the country, in Dublin, for example, to deal with homelessness.</P>
        <P>I should point out that not all services for children at risk must be provided by social workers.  The HSE provides a multiplicity of services which can effectively address the needs of children at risk.  Therapy, medical, nursing, psychological, community care and a very wide range of services benefiting children at risk are provided.  In addition, non-governmental bodies provide key services for children and families at risk, on behalf of, or in tandem with, HSE services in areas such as residential care, foster care, community mentoring, family support schemes such as Springboard, Teen Parenting and Youth Advocacy, and in many other areas.</P>
        <P>The latest information for children in care dates from March 2008.  This shows that 5,362 children are in care.  Of these, 406 are in residential care and 4,799 are in foster care.  That latter figure is 88%, a higher percentage than in most other countries, and a great success.  Other care arrangements are in place for 157 children, such as provision for remaining in the family home under care order.  The identification of children at immediate and serious risk is, of course, a clinical decision, but professional social workers generally have no difficulty in perceiving what is an immediate and serious risk versus a less immediate risk.  I would again <Col N="885"/>emphasise that the HSE has stated that those at immediate serious risk are assessed and offered service.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed me that at the end of 2007, 90% of children in care have an allocated social worker and that social work services are available to all children in HSE care.  It must also be made clear that child protection is the responsibility of everyone in society and particularly all public service providers including teachers and doctors.  It is critical that everyone shoulders that responsibility.</P>
        <P>The HSE service provision is guided by what it terms its &ldquo;Children and Family Services Strategic Objectives&rdquo;.<b><i>  </i></b>These seek to grant children the right to express views freely in all matters affecting them and to ensure that decision making in the planning and delivery of all children and family services is informed by an evaluated approach, based on empirical data from evidence-based research.  The objectives also aim to re-orient supports and services so that they are fully integrated and easily accessible.  They lay emphasis on prevention and early intervention, with a strong community based response.  They further seek to ensure professional development and supervision to attract, retain and develop staff to support quality, child-centred service delivery.</P>
        <P>The focus for development in the coming years is on preventive, community-based services which provide early intervention within a primary care context.  The development of alternative care services will, over time, impact on the numbers of children in residential and foster care.</P>
        <P>A differential model of service provision is also being considered by the HSE to respond to the needs of children at risk by directing them to protection or welfare and support services.  This would counter the growing trend to classify large numbers of cases as child protection cases.  International and Irish research indicates that in many situations cases can best be dealt with by way of welfare and care services which do not always require full-time social worker input to work well.  My office and the HSE aim in this way to energise and involve communities in their own welfare and thereby effectively and validly reduce the later emergence of child protection issues.</P>
        <P>The ongoing Child Care Information Project is initially implementing standard assessment and referral methods and thereafter moving on to better standardising national child protection procedures.  This project, in tandem with other major standardisation projects such as the review of the Children First child protection guidelines, and the publication by HSE of its child protection framework, will work in synergy with the Knowledge Management Strategy for child welfare and protection, due to be completed in summer 2008.  This will work to ensure availability of better information, improved communication and application of research findings to service provision, management evaluation and policy analysis.  As these initiatives indicate, the HSE is well aware of the need to work from well-defined information and evidence; and not from uncorroborated anecdote.  It is, however, essential that the evidence used is robust validated material.</P>
        <P>While I am disturbed at any suffering by children I am confident that my office and the HSE can together ensure significantly improved and better integrated child welfare and protection services for all children who need such services.  The work I have described shows how much is being done to realise this objective.</P>
        <P>The development of robust, responsive and appropriate child welfare and protection services is a priority for both myself and this Government.  The National Children&rsquo;s Strategy was published in 2000.  Its vision was described thus:</P>
        <P LI="1">An Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make and a voice of their own; where all children are cherished and supported by family and the wider society; where they enjoy a fulfilling childhood and realise their potential.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P FLI="0">It is my intention to do everything I can to realise this aim.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate which gives us an important forum with the Minister of State to discuss the issues highlighted in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report.  Those of us who take an interest in this area are all too familiar with the waiting lists and the difficulties families have in accessing services, even where serious problems exist.  What &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; told us was not new.  However, it illustrated in a dramatic way some of the problems in the area.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I congratulate him on his new appointment, which is an important role.  No one has the high moral ground on this.  Everybody wants to see the best services in place for those who need them.  A number of issues concern me about the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and the responses given by the Minister of State today which I will highlight.  I do not want this discussion to be seen as rhetoric or posturing.  I hope it will have a real impact on the services available and on the Minister of State&rsquo;s interest and action.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; investigation showed the shocking situation of many children and the failure to respond with the services they need.  The issue predates the programme.  A commission of inquiry is examining inadequacies in child care services during the latter half of the 20th century.  A redress board is paying compensation to victims who experienced sexual abuse in residential care in this country.  Have we learned from the past and are we doing things differently now?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State was clear about the resource issue.  We come from a low base in this regard and we needed these resources.  The resources may be enough but what is happening?  Why are the front-line services not receiving them?  This is a key question which is raised with regard to health all of the time but is also relevant to child care services.  The best ally of abuse and neglect is denial.  We have seen this in the past where people in positions of responsibility did not believe children, dismissed concerns and brushed the issue under the carpet.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that denial is not confined to history but is current.  Take the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and the response from the HSE.  I do not want to vilify the people working in this area in the HSE who are trying to do what they can.  I am concerned about the reaction which showed a level of denial.  I am also concerned about the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response in the D&aacute;il.  He stated great progress has been made and that resources are in place.  This misses the point that children are at risk and the structures are failing.</P>
        <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister of State that he was troubled by those cases.  I am glad to hear this because the Minister of State should be troubled, as should the officials.  These individual cases tell the story that families do not receive a service and the question must be asked as to why.  In his speech, the Minister of State stated he was reassured by the HSE that, &ldquo;. . . in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, it responds immediately and takes appropriate action.&rdquo;  Is the Minister of State convinced about this?  I suggest he meets the front-line staff and teams.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope he will do so as a new Minister of State in this area.  The word on the ground from people working in child psychiatry making referrals to social services is that the teams are under severe pressure.  This is not just anecdotal.  People on maternity leave are not replaced.  Some of this boils down to what the HSE means by &ldquo;serious and immediate risk&rdquo;.  Will the Minister of State tell us what this means?  The word is that social <Col N="887"/>workers are not allocated to many serious cases or children are not assessed quickly enough and are being ignored.  This is of concern to me.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech contains a contradiction where he states, &ldquo;I was informed also that a detailed consultation and reporting process is already under way to determine the current state of the waiting list issue.&rdquo;  If the HSE does not know the cases on the waiting list or does not have a breakdown of the type of cases waiting to be seen, how can the Minister of State categorically state in a previous paragraph that the HSE has re-assured him, &ldquo;...that in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health or welfare of a child, the HSE responds immediately&rdquo;?  Will the Minister of State examine this because I do not believe it is convincing.</P>
        <P>This may not be a resource issue.  It may be a question of where the resources are going, recruitment or the size of the teams responding to the increased needs.  Will the Minister of State take on board the point about denial because it is a key issue?  People have a tendency to state it is not true when children need services.  It is in our history and it seems to be a repeating pattern.</P>
        <P>The programme gave many statistics, which belie what the Minister of State stated.  A total of 374 social work cases in the north Dublin area have not been properly assessed.  In central Dublin, the waiting list for a child to be given a social worker is up to one year.  In Kerry, a child may expect to endure a waiting list of three and a half years for a psychiatric report.  As we speak, the Cavan-Monaghan child psychiatry service is closed as is the Kildare service, which is not even taking referrals for a waiting list.</P>
        <P>What is a parent of a psychotic 13 year old to do if there is no local child and family service or mental health service available?  Have guidelines been provided to GPs in those counties who will see children who require immediate service?  Will the Minister of State take an interest in this aspect of emergency services?  They are not available at present.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House how many children classified as at risk are on waiting lists and receive no psychiatric or social care intervention?  How many are at risk who have not yet been classified?  The previous Minister of State, who has been promoted to the position of Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was unable to answer these questions in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the social workers who co-operated with the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report had to do so anonymously.  I was a social worker before entering politics.  Why do well-trained social workers feel they cannot speak out either through their union&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or directly to the Minister of State and speak about their experiences?  What guidelines were issued to them about speaking to the media?  Why can we not hear their voices publicly and hear what they have to state about the delivery of service?  During the recent negotiations on the consultants contract an attempt was made to prevent consultants speaking of their experiences of the health service.  Nobody is going to talk about individual cases.  However, I am extremely concerned about the fact that people working with the most vulnerable in our society did not feel they could speak out publicly without risk of something happening to them within their work setting.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State examine this?  It would be worth his while to speak to the front-line teams to hear about their experiences.  The workers in the field should have the confidence to speak out about their direct experiences in the interests of children and families.  What has happened to prevent them from doing so?  They do not do so for the sake of it.  They are not <Col N="888"/>trying to pretend an emergency exists when it does not.  They are genuine people.  Why do they feel they must go on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; anonymously?  Will the Minister of State examine what guidelines have been issued and why professionals do not feel they are able to speak about their experiences in a proper context in an open society?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the HSE culture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the number of children who have gone missing in the asylum process and otherwise.  For example, one of the Kenyan girls who went missing was aged 11.  The Minister of State said the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for them.  Can his Department liaise with that Department and the Garda to ensure proper searches are carried out and proper attempts are made to find out what happened to these young people who are trafficked and who are probably the most marginalised and vulnerable in Europe?  A systematic response is needed when such children go missing involving both Departments and the Garda.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I congratulate him on his elevation to high office and I wish him well in his tenure.  &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;, as I said on the Order of Business earlier, has become a valuable programme.  The makers should be congratulated on the programmes they produce every Monday evening.  The week before last, welfare and protection services for children were investigated, which led to this debate, and last Monday, cyber bullying, which also affects children, was investigated.  I have asked for a debate on bullying.</P>
        <P>The issues highlighted by the programme over the past two weeks are very emotive.  They set everybody thinking and talking and I am delighted the House has an opportunity to debate them.  The programme last Monday week highlighted the significant number of children on waiting lists who may never be seen or dealt with by a social worker.  We were told they were numbers in filing cabinets.  Social workers would never get around to them.  I found that hard to believe and when I made inquiries, I was told that although the children may not be allocated a social worker, it does not mean they will never be seen because sometimes the social worker refers them to the services mentioned by the Minister of State and suggest to families they should self-refer to an voluntary organisation such as those mentioned by him run by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The cases outlined in the television programme were worrying, particularly that of the foster child.  When she was well enough and felt secure, she was permitted to partake in home visits to her natural parents.  However, when she returned to the foster home, she was disturbed and upset.  This was reported by the foster mother but she was not listened to until the child began to show more visible signs of distress.  The case was examined and it transpired the young girl was being abused at home by her father, and her mother was not capable of doing anything about it.  Many voluntary organisations say child physical and sexual abuse is on the increase and, in most cases, a member of the wider family is the perpetrator.</P>
        <P>This issue is about societal values and not about health or money.  Family supports in the 21st century need to be examined, as we are challenged by alcohol and drug abuse.  Some parents rearing children are alcohol and drug dependent.  This is a different family support from those I experienced when I was growing up.  Such supports were associated with health and poverty and people providing food for families in need.  These supports are not as relevant nowadays and that is why issues such as drug and alcohol abuse need to be examined.</P>
        <P>I was delighted the Minister of State stated his office and the HSE aim to energise and involve communities in their own welfare.  I am thrilled because the HSE needs to priorities services at community level.  Over the past three weeks in the run up to Deputy Brian Cowen <Col N="889"/>taking over as Taoiseach, he referred in a number of addresses to community values and people looking after each other like they did in the past.  One must go forward, not back, but if the caring and sharing values we adopted as communities in the past could be brought to the fore again, it would not be a bad thing.</P>
        <P>In preparing for the debate, I visited two family centres run by the Daughters of Charity, a voluntary organisation.  The centres offer therapeutic and counselling services.  I was full of admiration for the work they are doing.  I had a sense of it not being all about money.  Significant money is being invested but they would like further evaluation of the services they provide and a survey conducted of where money is spent to ascertain if it is delivering what is needed by those availing of the services.  The staff I met were first class.  They meet those who come knocking on their doors.  A mother could arrive with a young son who is troublesome in school and help is needed.  When they talk to the young boy, they realise he is acting up because his mother is not giving him attention and when they talk to the mother, they establish she has a drug or alcohol problem.  When they try to get to the bottom of that issue, she says she is that way because the child&rsquo;s father beats her.  When they talk to the father, he has a problem with his mother or father.  There are generational links.  If we can provide for the child, we must also provide for the wider family and that is what these voluntary groups are doing.</P>
        <P>The Daughters of Charity stressed the importance of education for young mothers because that would help them become confident and competent.  They would then look forward to meeting people but they live in disadvantaged areas.  Their children attend local primary schools and are taught by the same teachers who taught them.  Parents sometimes feel the teacher had a set on them as a youngster and they now have a set on their child.  That is probably not the case but the mind of the young parent needs to be opened by educating him or her.  This service is offered in a number of deprived areas in Dublin and it is working.  Barriers are being broken down.  I would like the Minister of State to examine this option as a way forward.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the provision of services between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, is not ideal.  An out-of-hours service is provided in a number of areas but such a service must be expanded.  The Minister of State said we have come from a low base ten years ago.  The Ferns Report was debated by the previous Seanad.  The OECD has recognised the advances Ireland has made but the Opposition might say they are not sufficient.  Perhaps they are not but at least they are a start and we are going forward.  An Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, is in place.  I have met her because I sit on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children which is doing great work.  I heard the Minister of State speak in the past week since his appointment.  A total of 1,000 new posts will be created in the Health Service Executive and the embargo will be lifted in 2008.  I think the Minister of State said that 200 of those posts will be in the front-line area where they are needed.  There has been a 79% increase in funding.  Again, it was coming from a low base but at least it is a start.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on us as legislators, citizens and parents to deplore any neglect of children.  We should call on all people to actively report any abuse of children we see, even at a very minor scale.  As the Minister of State said, early intervention is the key.  Even if it is very small, it should still be reported.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to the Minister of State about an out-of-hours service.  We need to revisit this, especially in light of the tragedies in Wexford in the past 18 months.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I also echo the words of the others in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and congratulating him on his new appointment.  I very much welcome the words in his speech to the effect that he would make it a priority to provide services to some of the most vulnerable young members of our society.  We all agree that the protection of vulnerable children should be a key priority of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech with which we can all agree.  Much of it is like motherhood and apple pie &mdash; little that is controversial and much that is very positive.  The Minister of State spoke of the need to ensure integrated services for child protection.  Clearly, that is important.  He spoke of the need to ensure early intervention which, again, is vital.  He spoke of the need to provide family and community-based supports for children at risk.  Again, there is no disagreement there.  He also spoke of the great appreciation we all must feel for the great and immense work being done by social work teams.  We all agree with that.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the reality does not reflect the noble aspirations and very positive things said by the Minister of State in his speech.  It must be noted that in the very short time since the integrated Office of the Minister for Children has been created, three Ministers have already held that position: Deputy Brian Lenihan, Deputy Brendan Smith and the current Minister of State.  This in itself is symptomatic of a problem, which is that each Minister of State may have very noble aspirations and very positive commitments but they simply have not had the time for those commitments and aspirations to bear fruit.  Each Minister of State is beginning again in terms of making priorities, commitments and so on.  That is a real problem.</P>
        <P>Other speakers have mentioned the wonderful &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme which has done us a great service in terms of public service broadcasting in bringing to us the reality of the situation for children at risk.  Perhaps I should say that I have a small amount of knowledge in the area and should declare an interest in that I have worked as a barrister and appeared in what used to be called the Health Board Court in Dolphin House, so I have seen some of what is happening on the ground.  Certainly, the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme made us very much aware of the great difficulties facing social workers in providing a service to protect children at risk and to support children who are in care.</P>
        <P>I know for a fact that many social workers are very concerned by the response of the Health Service Executive to the issues raised in the programme.  The HSE spokesperson on the programme asserted that children at serious risk receive appropriate social work support services.  This was said and repeated in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech despite the fact that HSE managers throughout the country are regularly advised and are made aware by social work teams of the real inadequacies in terms of service.  In his speech, the Minister of State said, and I believe it is accepted, that the HSE has 5,362 children in its care at present.  What is buried in the figures is that he then said that 90% of those children in care, to whom the HSE bears a statutory responsibility, have an allocated social worker.  Clearly, what this means is that 10% do not.  We are talking about more than 500 children in care to whom the HSE bears a statutory responsibility yet who do not have an allocated social worker.  That is a matter that should be of serious concern to us all.  That figure of 10% does not take into account how many of the 90% have allocated social workers who may have too heavy a caseload to be able to take on the full responsibility and provide the fully adequate service to the children for whom they are responsible.</P>
        <P>What do these inadequacies mean?  They mean that children in care may never have the opportunity to build up a relationship with a social worker, may not have adequate plans made for immediate and future care and may have plans made that are simply incapable of being <Col N="891"/>followed through.  Follow-through is a real problem, particularly in respect of plans made for them when they reach adulthood and are coming out of HSE care but simply cannot be abandoned into society.  These are children who have already been abused or neglected at home and who have already been let down by those responsible for them and by those to whom they should be closest, yet they are again being abused or certainly being let down by the State services.  This is nothing short of serious neglect by the State.</P>
        <P>The HSE response to this issue, as reported on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;, was less than adequate and betrayed a certain complacency in the approach of the executive to children in care.  The official spokesperson stated that &ldquo;we will probably never get to 100% in terms of the protection of children at risk but we would like maybe to get to 95%, 96%&rdquo; and that this is &ldquo;probably as best, as good as it can be&rdquo;.  That indicates a certain complacency in respect of the predicament and the serious situation for vulnerable children in Ireland today.  While saying that children at serious risk would immediately have services available to them, he also admitted that he did not think any manager of child welfare services would say that they were very comfortable with the way things are.  Again, that is a serious admission.  He said that:</P>
        <P LI="1">As long as there remain children out there who are vulnerable or whose needs are not being fully met, we have an obligation and a desire to meet those needs.  I think a huge amount has been achieved in recent years but at the same time, a lot more has to be done.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That much is certainly true.  A lot more must be done.  As Senator Fitzgerald has said, the difficulty with making plans to do more and provide the adequate services that are required is where the services themselves are in denial about the problem.  That is where the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme has done great value in making us more aware, but it is unfortunate that the HSE appears to be somewhat in denial.  I think there was a veiled attack on the critics of the HSE in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech where he said that claims made about the HSE services should not be working off uncorroborated anecdote.  I do not think there was an attempt to do that in the programme.  I would like to hear the Minister of State say how many cases he and HSE believe a social worker appropriately should have in terms of a caseload.  It is clear to us that if 500 children have no allocated social worker, there are many more who may have an allocated social worker but are simply not getting the service they need because their social worker&rsquo;s caseload is too heavy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Bacik, for sharing some of her time with me.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his career.  I think he is a very appropriate choice because I happen to know him slightly but I have also been very impressed by the highly capable, intelligent and humane way he has dealt with matters such as this and other politically related matters in the media in recent weeks.  As they say in the country, he comes from a good stable.  With a father and an uncle like his, he could not but start with good credibility in this area.</P>
        <P>I was especially impressed by one part of his speech where he said that: &ldquo;Two days after the broadcast of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&ldquo; programme I met with senior officials from the HSE to discuss, among other topics, the issues raised by that report.&rdquo;  It may not be that everything is satisfactory.  We know precisely from what Senator Fitzgerald said in a most impassioned speech and also from what Senator Bacik said that things are far from well.  That is a good example of what the Minister of State called for in the case of children &mdash; early intervention.  He intervened early, took action and met people.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about other things.  Senator Bacik put on the record of the House a number of matters about which I am concerned, as did Senator Fitzgerald.  I have been briefed in this area previously by people who are morbidly concerned that if they are employed in this area, <Col N="892"/>their managerial level will find out about it.  Will the Minister of State seek to provide a whistle-blower&rsquo;s charter for people within the Health Service Executive?  However good &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; is, it should not come directly from a television programme but from within and from consultation.  People should feel protected when they voice legitimate concerns to Members of this House.  It is not appropriate for Members of the Oireachtas to receive submissions from people who plead with us not to reveal their identities for fear of damaging their careers.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke of support for families to reduce the number of children who may become dependent on State care.  That is not sufficient and is far too weak.  While I abhor comments such as those reported in the British House of Commons that the most dangerous place to be is in the mother&rsquo;s womb, which is a frightful comment to make on the abortion debate, we must be very careful about suggesting that the family is the safest place for a child because that is not always so.  Child abuse very frequently takes place within the family.  Children need to be protected within the family but if a difficulty exists, it is not appropriate just to produce supports while the child remains <i>in situ.  </i>I am thinking here of the case of Ms Maria Colville whose return by the social services to her family resulted in her murder.  As a result of that case, Seanad &Eacute;ireann introduced the guardian <i>ad litem</i> clause to protect vulnerable children in that area.  Of the 5,000 children who are at risk, there are many for whom no plans are made or such plans that are made are not followed through.  Those children have been seriously let down and are a parallel to the children who were abused in institutions.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State a number of questions, one or two of which have already been posed by Senator Bacik.  Can he tell the House the percentage of children in the care of the Health Service Executive with an allocated social worker?  How many cases does the Minister of State and the HSE believe is appropriate, in terms of good social work practice, for a social worker to have on his or her caseload?  How many cases, on average, are allocated to HSE social workers in child and family services?  How many cases currently are open within the HSE social work department in child and family services?  How many cases are unallocated within the service?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would answer these simple and direct questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and wish him every success in his new position.  I do not wish to repeat the concerns and issues raised by my colleagues so far but will use the time available to raise some additional issues and thoughts.  I welcome this debate, which is essential.  This is an issue which has touched everyone in our society.  It has been the main topic of conversation for the past week and has given rise to anxiety, concern and much soul searching.</P>
        <P>Often when one thinks of child welfare and child protection, one thinks in terms of an urgent response to an emergency situation.  That clearly is one aspect of the issue but if we are serious about delivering the best possible child welfare, we must ensure our mindset is not limited only to this aspect.  There are other aspects that are essential for the delivery of child welfare that reflect a positive and proactive promotion of well-being.  Putting in place measures that promote the well-being of children and that can detect risk, identify indicators and allow for effective intervention can prevent the occurrence of emergency situations in the first place.  More importantly, such measures can prevent the infliction of hurt, pain and damage that such emergency situations bring with them.  The Health Service Executive child welfare and protection service strives to do this and the individuals working in this service work extremely hard and are very committed to best practice and ensuring they deliver the best possible service to the children with whom they work.</P><Col N="893"/>
        <P>I take this opportunity, with the Minister of State present, to outline briefly some issues, challenges and possible measures to be taken in both reactive and preventative aspects of child welfare.  On the issue of the measures in place to respond to emergency situations, I welcome that the HSE has initiated a detailed consultation and reporting process to ascertain the current state of the waiting list issues raised on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;.  This exercise is expected to be completed and a report prepared for the Minister of State before the end of June.  It is essential we have accurate information.  I suggest that the aforementioned report be accompanied by proposals on how the identified need on the waiting list can be tackled.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that public confidence is maintained in the State&rsquo;s capacity to respond and intervene in the protection of children.  It is essential we do not send out the message that if somebody is concerned about the protection of a child, there is little point in coming forward.  That is not the case.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State will chair regular meetings between officials of the HSE and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I also welcome that the HSE is recruiting 47 social workers to fill some of the 158 current vacancies and that 335 social posts have been created since 2005.  I ask the Minister of State if a timeframe for filling the remaining vacancies has been established.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Children First guidelines are under review.  Can the Minister of State indicate when this review will be completed?  The Children First guide and handbook provides excellent information not only for State services but also for community, voluntary and sporting organisations which are keen to play a role in the protection of children and to ensure they are in keeping with best practice.</P>
        <P>The vetting and training of all individuals who work with children plays a crucial role in preserving the safety of children.  I welcome the role played by the Garda vetting unit and the extension of the vetting service to voluntary organisations.  At present, this is a useful tool only in the screening of individuals with prior convictions but is of incalculable value.  We will have to face up to the dilemma concerning the use of soft information and data other than that relating to convictions.  Information that can also be considered as soft is often gleaned by the HSE and its child protection services.  Consideration of how we use such information in the future presents us with a difficult dilemma.  However, this issue is being considered by an all-party Oireachtas Committee, which I welcome.  Considerable work is being undertaken by all Members to meet the challenges and to ensure the strongest possible vetting procedures are in place to maximise the protection of children in a manner that is appropriately balanced with justice for individuals.</P>
        <P>It is essential that all people working with children are trained in keeping with best practice, are familiar with guidelines such as Children First, are aware of indicators that a child may be at risk or in distress and are familiar with how to respond and the appropriate action to take.  I welcome that the social work out-of-hours service proposals from the HSE are under consideration to determine how this service can best be introduced nationwide.  There are a number of out-of-hours service arrangements in place to partially cover need throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate to note that social work teams, their management and the people who support them, who must routinely work with difficult and complex issues, are very hard-working and dedicated.  Given this, it is essential to ensure supports for people who work on the front line are in place to enable them to work at their most effective at all times.  I welcome the various support programmes that have been undertaken by the HSE in conjunction with bodies such as the Family Support Agency which provides valuable parenting capacity building, play skills, behaviour management programmes and so forth.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P>I wish to refer to a few groups of children who are especially at risk.  I welcome the extension of the inspection of residential services to residential services for children with disabilities.  These were previously exempt from inspection, which was unacceptable given the particular vulnerability of their clients.  I also draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to the residential services provided by the HSE for unaccompanied minors and take this opportunity to raise the plight of approximately 400 such children who are unaccounted for who were registered with the HSE.  These children are clearly vulnerable and have no one to speak up for them or to monitor the search and efforts to locate them.</P>
      
        <P>Could an agreed protocol be put in place for any such child who goes missing with a more robust protocol for anyone seeking to claim custody of such a child?  At present it is only required that the child and the adult who comes forward to claim the child would have a similar story.  That is not sufficiently robust to protect the unaccompanied minor.  The Minister of State might consider the value of appointing advocates for such children, as they clearly do not have anyone else to speak up for them.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State also consider the plight of families where parents have an intellectual disability?  An increasing number of such families are coming to light where the intellectual disability was not initially picked up and the necessary supports were not put in place.  The children of these families come before the HSE child protection services and their cases end up in the courts system, which causes considerable distress to the children and their parents, in respect of whom supports could have been put in place previously.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State all the best in this challenging portfolio and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate the Minister of State and wish him every success in his difficult portfolio.  I am sure if there is any help we can give him, we would not be remiss in doing so.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The areas of welfare and protection services for children are wide and varied.  They range from catering to the very basic needs that must be met for all children to ensuring the health, safety and welfare of those children whose care rests with the State.  One of the areas of major concern to me is that of the plight of adolescents in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and care.  The HSE recently responded to a parliamentary question on the appalling lack of available beds for such adolescents, with a promise of 18 further beds being brought into service over the course of the remainder of 2008.  It also pledged that of the 3,598 children currently awaiting assessment, 70% will be seen within 12 months.  Today, there are only 12 beds available in Ireland for the treatment of these children and the HSE seems to consider that sanctioning a further 18 beds will be  tantamount to waving a magic wand which will almost immediately solve the problem.</P>
        <P>While I am aware that the majority of those on the waiting list will not need inpatient care, I find it difficult to believe that the provision of these extra beds, a drop in the ocean compared to the overall number of beds in service under the HSE, will have the desired effect.  In the meantime families are at their wits&rsquo; end, some of whom I know, who cannot leave their children out of their sight for fear of them self-harming or attempting suicide.  This is a very real problem, particularly when one knows somebody in this situation.  The case of the person I know has been flagged as urgent and all that goes with that, but a bed has still not been made available for this individual.  This is an immediate problem that has a detrimental effect on many people&rsquo;s lives &mdash; many more people than the lives of the family concerned &mdash; and it must be prioritised with real targets and realisable goals set.</P><Col N="895"/>
        <P>Another issue that needs to be investigated as a matter of importance is the provision of a child psychology service and the waiting lists associated with this service.  I have been contacted by a number of clients whose children have been referred for psychological assessment by their general practitioners.  One case in particular stands out, where a six year old child, suffering from severe psychological problems, was referred by her general practitioner 18 months ago to the local psychology department in South Tipperary General Hospital.  At the time her mother was informed that she could expect to have her child seen and assessed within six to 12 months.  When no appointment was received some months later, the mother again contacted the Department to be told that the waiting period had extended to 18 months and she could now expect an appointment at some stage in that timeframe.  Last week she received a letter from the psychology department stating that the waiting list is now running at two years and so it had to be temporarily closed.  The current plan is to offer those on the waiting list a one-off appointment, which would allow the professionals to redirect the client appropriately.   No doubt following this one-off assessment, this child will be placed on yet another waiting list.</P>
        <P>My impression is that this deterioration in this service coincides closely with the HSE staff embargo because it is having an effect across such a range of services.  It is difficult for the Minister of State in his brief to prioritise which service is more needy and depending on whom he is representing at a time, each case would merit that it should be given sufficient resources to meet its needs.  Staff are being lost through various routes and are simply not being replaced, as is the case in so many other services managed by the HSE.  On consultation with other health professionals employed elsewhere in Ireland, I am aware that this is not an isolated case &mdash; other waiting lists have also been closed temporarily for some time with no sign of being re-opened.  Only emergency referrals are seen at short notice and the chances of the existing waiting lists being cleared in any timely fashion seems remote.</P>
        <P>Once again vital frontline services have been eroded and children&rsquo;s welfare put at risk because the HSE cannot manage its budget adequately.  Early intervention is so important in many of these cases to minimise anti-social behaviour in later years, and it is a false economy to curtail such services in the interest of offsetting vital funds against budget overruns.</P>
        <P>I remember working in a paediatric unit as an innocent student nurse when I thought that if babies got sick, they were treated, got well and were sent home.  I recall an infant having a skeletal survey when admitted because of various aspects of bruising.  This baby was only ten weeks old and it had 11 fractures at various stages of healing.  I remember being very upset about that.  The baby was put immediately on an at-risk register and taken into foster care because the services at that time would have dealt with such a case in a timely fashion.  I do not know what the outcome was for that child, but I am sure the child had a better outcome than we can expect for children in similar circumstances today.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers expressed concern about a welfare and protection issue that has been vigorously highlighted in the media relating to the HSE&rsquo;s management of the care and ultimate disappearance of an astonishing number of immigrant children.  Despite numerous media discussions around the issue in recent months, we have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation from the HSE.  I am horrified about this issue.  I cannot conceive how 388 children &mdash; the figure may now be more than 400 &mdash; in the care of the HSE have simply vanished over the past seven years.  It seems that the majority of those missing are immigrant children who arrived in Ireland without parents and were taken into care for their own protection.  We know now that these children were frequently housed in inadequately supervised HSE accommodation, where there are no on-site child care workers.  While the HSE is responsible for the safety and care of such vulnerable children, it is imperative that the essential structures and services are put in place to ensure that these children cannot be exploited in any way while under our protection.  The statistic in this regard is horrifying.</P><Col N="896"/>
        <P>When a child tragically went missing in Portugal, the search for her knew no borders.  It was highlighted on every news channel and every man, woman and child in Europe knew that this had happened within 24 hours.  Yet here in Ireland all these children went missing and we did not hear a word about it.  This is bordering on the criminal, if only for the fact that broadcasting these children&rsquo;s photographs and statistics might have resulted in their being identified by the public and returned to safety.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, which will come into force in June, outlawing the trafficking of children for any purpose, it will be impossible to implement the letter of this law if we cannot initially provide a truly safe haven and adequate supervision for these children who come to Ireland in uncertain circumstances.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight an area that I previously raised with Professor Drumm.  Every child is entitled to a developmental check-up to ensure that he or she is meeting his or her milestones and also to pick up potential health or physical problems he or she may have.  The optimum time for the developmental check-up to be carried out is at nine months, but in recent times many children were not being called until they were two or three years old, which for some children was too late to deal with deficits, perhaps in hearing or other behavioural problems, that could have been addressed if they were picked up at the optimum time for the check-up.</P>
        <P>The HSE recently introduced measures to address this backlog, resulting in children being called to be seen by a public health nurse at between nine and 11 months old.   I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the present staffing embargo will not negatively impact on the new measures, and that children will continue to be seen at nine months old in accordance with best practice and recognised standards of care.</P>
        <P>A recommendation in one of the reports into the death of a young child was that a trained children&rsquo;s nurse should be on duty in all accident and emergency departments in the interests of prompt diagnosis of children with potential problems, a issue I raised on this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business.  While recommendations in any report are always difficult to implement, if there is a paediatric unit in a hospital we should go some way towards ensuring a system is in place that the some degree of the necessary expertise will be available to assess a child over whom there is a query about their condition in the interests of ensuring best practice.  With the best will in the world, one will always get co-operation and, as would be said in a hospital setting, such intervention amounts to fire-fighting techniques.  Staff are more than willing to help in a situation where they can prevent greater problems later on.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has a very difficult brief.  He referred to many initiatives, which I welcome.  I compliment him on the way he dealt with the media the morning after the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  While I am not casting aspersions on any of the previous holders of his office, I believe we have someone in charge who will fully engage with personnel to ensure the best possible outcome for our children because they are worth it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his promotion.  It is not an enviable task.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme has concentrated much public attention on the Minister of State&rsquo;s area of responsibility and that is the context in which this debate is taking place.  It is always important not to respond in a reactive way to media-generated headlines but many of the issues and gaps in services highlighted in the programme are a real concern and I know the Minister of State will look at them during his time in office.</P><Col N="897"/>
        <P>Rather than focus on some of the claims made in the programme, I would prefer to look at the broader policy framework in which child protection occurs in this State.  I will start with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Ireland signed up without reservation in 1992.  The convention places a positive duty on the State to protect and support children and their families.  Article 19 of that convention states:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment described heretofore, and, as appropriate, for judicial involvement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to an official assessment of the State&rsquo;s performance carried out by the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance which produced a report entitled, From Rhetoric to Rights, Second Shadow Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  This report reflected its views on the progress made by the State and it was published in March 2006.  While approximately two years have elapsed, the findings of the report pretty much echo some of the findings of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on this issue.</P>
        <P>In regard to services for those most at risk, the shadow report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Significant numbers of children in Ireland experience disadvantage, including those living in poverty, early school-leavers, homeless young people, those living with addiction or mental illness (either their own or that of a parent) or those who are part of a disadvantaged ethnic minority.  Much more needs to be done to support these children and their families through comprehensive preventive and early intervention services (rather than crisis intervention only), to coordinate the services targeted at these children, and to ensure that allocated funding produces positive outcomes.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These themes are consistent throughout the report.  There is a big emphasis on preventive and early intervention services.  There is a critique of the fact that much of the funding and official services tend to be focused on crisis intervention and there is repeated reference to the fact that services are not as well co-ordinated as they should be.  Evaluation is also highlighted as is the importance of ensuring the funding allocated to these services produces positive outcomes.</P>
        <P>Another important issue highlighted in the report is inappropriate services and placements.  The report points out that inappropriate services are often used to treat troubled children &mdash; those with mental health or behavioural difficulty, those who are in contact with the criminal justice system and those for whom there are abuse concerns.   The report states that because of a lack of adequate planning, investment and co-ordination in regard to both crisis and preventive services, the line is often blurred between welfare, criminal and health interventions.</P>
        <P>It further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In this context, the response to the needs of children with complex problems is too often determined by whatever service is available, even if the placement is inappropriate or potentially damaging.  For example, children have been inappropriately placed in youth detention centres (when they have not committed a crime) and in adult psychiatric hospitals.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P FLI="0">The report calls on the Government to actively commit itself to fulfil its obligations to children under the convention by creating sufficient and appropriate welfare, preventive and rehabilitative services that take into account children&rsquo;s best interests.</P>
        <P>As far as family support services are concerned, the report welcomes the establishment of the Family Support Agency in 1998 but points out that family support services lack an integrated structure, that the availability of services varies greatly across the country and that responsibility for the services is split between two agencies, the Health Service Executive, which is responsible for individual families at risk, and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is responsible for general community-based family support services.  It also points out that seven other Departments have responsibility for certain programmes for families and children and that there is a reliance by the Government on community groups to provide many family services.  However, it points out that the sector is under-resourced and under-supported to deal with the range of issues it confronts.</P>
        <P>The report usefully suggests that a comprehensive audit of all support services for families and children provided by the Health Service Executive and the Department of Social and Family Affairs is needed to identify where services are being provided, where there are gaps and to assess the quality of services.  It recommends that this audit would be the basis for the development of a comprehensive support services strategy to meet the needs of vulnerable children and families and those with special needs.</P>
        <P>The report also suggests that the support services strategy drawn up should provide for the evaluation of outcomes of family support services and for the mainstreaming of examples of best practice.  It adds that parents and children, who are the beneficiaries of these services, should be involved in the implementation and evaluation processes.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, the report emphasises prevention over crisis intervention and states that a key issue which a support services strategy must address is the fact that at present, the capacity and focus of social services is limited to crisis intervention and child protection and the result is that preventive and support services are seriously under-developed.  It calls for the provision of multidisciplinary professional teams to provide preventive and therapeutic services to move the emphasis away from crisis intervention.</P>
        <P>However, it also points out that there are ongoing difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified and experienced staff and that this must be addressed.  It suggests that one of the ways this could be done is through providing workers with adequate inservice support, supervision and training.  Lack of the above is thought to be the reason for much of the problem in holding on to experienced staff.</P>
        <P>The report refers to the need for a 24-hour social work service.  It points out that HSE social work services are not available outside office hours with the exception of a service for homeless children in Dublin on weekdays and that the absence of a general out of hours social work service is delaying the implementation of the youth justice diversionary provisions in the Children Act 2001.</P>
        <P>The report calls for the publication of two Government reviews of compliance with the Children First guidelines, the non-statutory guidelines on procedures for preventing child abuse and responding to allegations and suspicions of abuse.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the report, which are very comprehensive, apply today even though the report was drawn up two years ago.  They include placing the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing; developing a national child abuse prevention strategy; establishing a 24-hour seven-day-week social work service; ensuring adequate levels of support for staff, includ<Col N="899"/>ing social workers and better supports; conducting an audit of all support services for families and children provided by both the HSE and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and to use this as the basis for a comprehensive support services strategy to meet the needs of all families; implementing a plan of action to provide training in the Children First guidelines to all professionals and volunteers working with children; systematically involving children and parents in designing support services and policies; implementing on a national level the recommendations made in Listen to Me! Children&rsquo;s Experience of Domestic Violence; and, revising the Children First guidelines to take specific account of the needs of migrant children.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, congratulate him on his new post and wish him well for the future.  I wish to raise two specific issues, namely, missing children, an issue which has been raised by many Senators, and the serious understaffing of social workers in Galway city, which leads to serious child protection concerns.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, some 441 children have gone missing, 338 of whom are still unaccounted for.  Recently it was reported that five Kenyan children between the ages of 11 and 17 are still missing.  I want the Minister of State to instigate an immediate review of security procedures at HSE care facilities and to find out what supervision and monitoring exists in these facilities.  Where is the outrage with regard to these missing children?  If we were in another country and this was mine or the Minister&rsquo;s child, we would want to know the issue was being addressed and that such cases were being followed up.  We need an interdepartmental response on this issue.</P>
        <P>In 2007 there were 1,586 new referrals for the Galway city area on child protection issues, some 50% of which related to non-national children.  In other words, over 750 referrals related to non-national children.  These referrals related to children as young as seven being left minding babies, many cases of physical chastisement and cramped living conditions in both homes and hostels.  However, while 130 children were taken into care in the region in 2007, only ten of them were non-nationals.  I find this curious.  Is it the case that we do not give the same priority to non-national children?</P>
        <P>Ireland is a civilised and humane nation, but the fact we do not follow up on missing children leads me to suspect that we do not give due attention to the protection of children of the non-national community.  The child protection issues about which I am concerned are neglect of an emotional, physical and sexual nature and child welfare issues.  I urge the Minister of State to follow up on this issue, with particular regard to the non-national community.</P>
        <P>The main issue of concern I wish to raise is the issue of understaffing of social workers in Galway city.  This area has a population of approximately 180,000 and includes Oranmore, Kinvara, Clarinbridge, Claregalway and Gort.  This issue came to my attention a year ago when a mother came to me about her out of control teenager who was putting her two-year old child at serious risk in the home.  The situation involved drug and alcohol abuse and physical violence.  The mother in question was trying to survive as a single parent with a teenage son who was out of control.  She asked me to intervene and get help from the social workers.  I called the duty worker who gave me a hearing and led me to believe that the issue would be addressed immediately.  Two weeks later, the mother contacted me to say there had been no intervention and the situation was still as bad as ever.  I telephoned the social work department again, only to find out it had no staff to send out to examine the situation.  This was the case one year ago.</P>
        <P>To my horror, the situation is even worse today, which confirms the findings of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.  In the Galway city area we had 1,586 new referrals in 2007, but the waiting time for a child protection assessment is at least five to six weeks, unless it is a section 12 issue.  A section 12 issue is an issue involving a case where a parent is being sent to prison.  In that case the Garda contact social workers to take the children into care, which is done on that day. <Col N="900"/> Unless a case is that serious, it is not dealt with on the day.  The Minister of State stated in his speech that where there is a serious and immediate risk, there is an immediate response, but that is not true.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago, 50 case files in the Galway city area could not be opened because the social workers were not available to examine them.  How, therefore, can one tell whether there is an immediate or serious risk?  I have heard from a reliable source that some of those 50 cases are quite serious ones, but I cannot name my source because of the current culture within the HSE.  I do not wish to start a witch hunt within the HSE, which happened previously when I received reliable information.  Some 15 of the 50 cases mentioned had no prior assessment, making it incredibly difficult to assess their gravity.</P>
        <P>I have learned that Galway city is understaffed by five social workers to meet the need that exists.  I urge the Minister of State to address that need.  Furthermore, two social workers who have gone on maternity leave since Christmas have not been replaced.  Another social worker is on half-time, but no social worker has been employed to fill her half-time leave.  This was not the case in the past, but as a result of cuts by the HSE and the embargo on recruitment things are getting worse.  The job of child protection has become more difficult.</P>
        <P>I have heard it said that children are suffering because of the lack of resources and of that there is no doubt.  The Minister of State is new in the job and is full of hope and interest.  Let him try and do something.  I urge him to examine the situation in Galway city.  A reliable source has confirmed to me that female social workers on maternity leave are not being replaced during their leave of absence.  This was not always the case.  If that situation continues under the existing work pressures, it is likely to lead to discrimination against young female social workers at interview and male social workers will appear more attractive.  Human resource decisions are, therefore, becoming discriminatory as a result of cutbacks.  This may not be intentional, but that is the outcome.</P>
        <P>The situation with regard to social workers in the west is already uneven, with Sligo-Leitrim having six and a half staff per 10,000 population and Galway, with the worst ratio nationally, of two and a half social workers per 10,000 population.  Child protection services are under serious strain and the children of Galway are suffering as a result.  The social workers cannot cope with the caseload.  Waiting times are five to six weeks.  It is estimated that an additional five social workers are required to address the need.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to identify the gaps in the service.  Today, Senator Frances Fitzgerald asked him to identify the problems in the system.  I have pointed out one of them.  I urge the Minister of State to put the resources where the gaps are so that we get the best outcomes.  He should not waste the money nor throw it willy nilly at the services.  It must be put where the gaps are so that our children are protected.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to address the issues of the missing children, particularly as related to non-nationals, and the lack of adequate social workers in Galway city.  I presume I can give them the Minister&rsquo;s word that he will come back to them in Galway on that.</P>

	<P>I compliment the Minister and his young wife, Sin&eacute;ad, and wish them the best of luck.  They are a wonderful couple with complementary skills.  I wish them happiness and that they will have many achievements to their names at the end of the day.  I am sympathetic to and have empathy with what Senator Healy Eames said.  As I was out of <Col N="901"/>the country last week I did not see the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; report but I have in my hand a document published a month ago.  We did not have to wait for &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; to hear what goes on, but like so many issues in Ireland we have report after report and very little is done.  It is interesting that it has to be on television to catch the imagination of the politicians and the public.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been seriously criticised by Europe&rsquo;s top human rights watchdog for failing to adequately protect children under State care.  The first comprehensive report on Ireland&rsquo;s human rights record carried out by the Council of Europe warns that many foreign children are in danger of being trafficked for exploitation because they get insufficient care at State-provided accommodation.  It expresses deep concern on the large numbers of children who have already gone missing from centres that house mainly asylum seekers.  I recommend the Minister of State get a copy of this 58-page report by Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, the Commissioner for Human Rights on the Council of Europe.  There is a large section in it, section 3.3, on children and not just on the missing children.  I do not want to go into detail on it but it is exactly what I heard was on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.  This Council of Europe report has identified that we do not adequately look after children who are put into care, nor do we have the same proportion of social workers for them as we do for children in normal settings.</P>
        <P>I am the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children in the Seanad and we should very shortly call for a full debate on children generally.  I am writing a report on suicide and its prevention in Ireland and will have it available within three weeks.  I have been studying the issue since last September.  We have serious inadequacies in the health service as it deals with children.  Unlike other consultants attached to hospitals, a consultant child psychiatrist attached to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin has no dedicated beds in the hospital for children with psychiatric problems.  My research has indicated that there are children who are threatening suicide and are not able to get help.  When they attend a psychiatrist in the community service, the psychiatrist has no bed to put them in.  The consultant psychiatrist has no dedicated beds in the children&rsquo;s hospital; what a crime.</P>
        <P>I visited Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin for the first time a month ago.  Fortunately I had no reason to go there for my own child.  It should have been pulled down 30 years ago.  I was shocked by the physical structure of the building.  Will the new children&rsquo;s hospital be in the middle of the city?  It is not the right place to put it.  Is it carved in stone that it will be there?  Where is the fresh air in the city for the children?  It is a small site.  Why is it in the middle of the city?</P>
        <P>I had no chance to read the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech but Senator Corrigan mentioned he said the HSE was examining the provision of social services after 5 p.m. and at weekends.  I am sick of listening to that.  I do not blame the HSE but the Department of Health and Children.  The HSE has asked the Department of Health and Children to make social workers available after 5 p.m. every day and at weekends.  In the two cases of filial suicide in the south east no social services were available out of hours.  That is a crime.  I do not want to hear that the HSE has put a proposal to the Department.  Will the Department get its act together?  Will IMPACT get its act together too?  It is as bad.  There are 11 dedicated positions for suicide prevention officers and three positions have not been filled.</P>
        <P>I had a meeting with Dr. Patrick Doorley, the director of public health and planning with the HSE and I asked him why we have to wait because there is an embargo on filling positions.  What about somebody among the 130,000 people who work in the HSE being willing to take up those positions?  It is a matter of urgency that the out-of-hours social services be implemented immediately.  It has been proven in other countries that where out-of-hours or emergency social workers and psychiatrists are available, suicide levels decrease.  The lack of out-of-hours <Col N="902"/>services comes through in the report on children in care and in Mr. Hammarberg&rsquo;s report.  We need a full debate on the Minister of State&rsquo;s entire portfolio.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State may have examined the OECD report on the public service and the hoped-for future efficiency of the public sector.  It is a serious issue.  Having been a public servant for two terms and a business person for 16 years, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there must be some common sense that unions in the public sector cannot resist deployment of people where there is a crisis or staff are not available.  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>There is a tremendous challenge in front of the Minister of State, but it is also a personal opportunity.  We have a crisis in psychiatric services for children in Ireland.  My study shows that in the ages zero to 14 there is no suicide, although from my expert advice I believe there are children with serious mental problems, but from the age of 14 to 19 the suicide rate increases drastically.  We must get the child psychiatric services sorted to address the crisis in suicide numbers in Ireland.  We have a suicide epidemic in the country.  To prove my point that out-of-hours service is so important, most suicides and self harm episodes take place on Sundays and follow into Monday and one of the reasons is that there are no social services or psychiatrists on duty to help people in trouble.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senator Mary White on how media-driven all our comments seem to be at present, both at Government and politician level.  It is not bad when the media is to be commended on bringing issues of public concern to all our notice, but at the same time one wonders whether we live an age of spin and whether we should be spotting these matters in advance before the media must bring them to our attention.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome Senator Mary White&rsquo;s references to the Council of Europe.  At the outset, it is important that we start from the right philosophical and values base whenever we speak about child welfare and child protection services and the priority we give children in our society.  The Council of Europe, for example, among other matters, spoke of the way we incarcerate young offenders with older offenders, effectively putting them into a school for crime in many cases simply because our knee-jerk response in criminal justice terms almost overcomes the more important issues of child welfare and how we rehabilitate young offenders so that they become more solid citizens.</P>
        <P>I could speak about the issue I raised this morning when I drew the attention of the House to a family who have been told by the HSE that the type of speech therapy facility their child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome needs is just not available and they must go into the private sector to find it at a cost of approximately &euro;5,000.  That raises questions about how we regard the most vulnerable members of society.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State on a comprehensive speech &mdash; which I both listened to and read &mdash; which sets out clearly the strategy and structures.  I have spoken about the values that must underline this debate which, above all, must be ones of respect for human dignity.   I note Senator Norris was at pains to tell us the family does not always work best.  Equally, we can acknowledge that the family generally works best.  We should always start from the presumption <Col N="903"/>that the family is the best place to secure a child&rsquo;s welfare.  Sadly, it is a rebuttable presumption in many cases and that is where the State needs to step in.</P>
        <P>The best way for the State to protect children is by supporting and working in partnership with families and through early intervention and prevention.  There are generally high levels of support and professional commitment among public health nurses and social workers in providing for the needs of children and young people at risk, but there are a number of issues which need to be addressed.</P>
        <P>There are ever-increasing demands on child protection and welfare services.  There are long waiting lists for children at risk to be assigned a professional social worker, yet I am informed there is no central collation of these waiting lists for social assessment for a child deemed to be at risk or suspected of having been abused.  There is an understandable fear that child protection services have become increasingly occupied with crisis intervention rather than operating the necessary comprehensive preventative and early intervention service.</P>
        <P>Access for young people to specific services provided by the HSE, such as YAP and Extern, is restricted as the child must first have an assigned social worker.  Given the difficulties in getting children assigned to social workers in the first instance, this means there effectively can be no access in many cases.  Without doubt, the current HSE recruitment embargo is accentuating problems and all of this means vulnerable families and children are under increasing pressure and strain.</P>
        <P>The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance has recommended that a comprehensive audit be undertaken of all support services for families and children provided by both the HSE and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We need to identify where service is being provided and where there are gaps.  As I stated, there must be a central collation of waiting lists for social worker assessments and we need to promote the work carried out by various groups, which carry out innovative work in the area of family support through early intervention and whose volunteers often offer regular support, friendship and practical help to young families in their own homes, helping to prevent family crises and breakdown.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by referring to disparaging comments made by my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, about the debate yesterday on the subject of abortion in the British House of Commons.  He was disquieted by the fact that somebody stated that among the most dangerous places to be in the world today is in the mother&rsquo;s womb.  Whatever about the wisdom of that comment, whenever we speak about the dignity of the person and children&rsquo;s welfare, we must not be worried about being too politically correct.  Our job is to treat all people with dignity but to look hard at having a consistent respect for human life.  That will embrace unborn life but it must equally embrace the 5,000 in our society to whom the Minister of State referred who are either in residential care or who are being fostered.  Those people matter.  They, along with the unborn and along with other vulnerable citizens in our society, must be the last, not the first, to suffer when cutbacks are being made.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen faoin a am a roinnt liom agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, secured a D&aacute;il adjournment debate last week on the crisis in child protection.  I want to emphasise some of the points he made during that debate, but first I wish to address the reply given to him by the Minister of State, Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor, in the absence of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The reply was largely repeated here today and it shows the huge gap between the claims of the Government and the reality on the ground.  The Government throws out figures about money spent and numbers employed in the health services as if all was well.  It is as if the <Col N="904"/>&ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme was scare-mongering and as if the social workers at the front line of the crisis are somehow misrepresenting the situation.  I reject that.  The Government speaker stated that there was concern that any diminution in public confidence in the child protection system could result in people being reluctant to report child protection concerns, but it is the Government and the HSE who are undermining public confidence by their under-resourcing of an already inadequate child protection system.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme revealed the true extent of the child protection crisis.  Children are being abused and neglected or left at risk of abuse and neglect even though their files are in the hands of the HSE and they are known to be in these situations.  Dozens of files on children at grave risk are lying in filing cabinets with no action being taken because there are simply not enough social workers to deal with them.  That is not good enough.  This is the result of the HSE&rsquo;s cap on recruitment for which the Government, not the HSE or the Department, is ultimately responsible.</P>
        <P>Social workers and others working with children and for children&rsquo;s rights have repeatedly warned that the under-resourcing of child protection services, social work, community care, family support and psychological and therapeutic services is having terrible consequences.  The current regime of cuts being imposed by the HSE is making things even worse.  It is scandalous that we have waiting lists of more than a year for access to child mental health services and family support services.</P>
        <P>The Irish Association of Social Workers has stated its members are concerned, angered and frustrated that the right of children to effective protection and community care is being infringed.  It has repeatedly warned that children are at significant risk because of HSE failures.  The association stated the programme drew attention to the realities faced by social workers and by families attempting to access social work services.  I support the association&rsquo;s call on the Government and on the HSE to lift the current employment controls on social work posts, and to fully resource community care social work teams throughout the country.  Mr. Declan Coogan of the Irish Association of Social Workers,stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Children at risk of abuse and neglect are among the most vulnerable group in our society yet, judging by the lack of provision of funding for community care social work services, little consideration is given to their welfare.  We demand that the HSE fully resource community care social work child protection and welfare teams and fully resource community mental health services.  No child should have to wait for essential social work and therapy services because someone somewhere has said there is no money.  It seems that the protection of children is at the bottom of the list of priorities of those who make decisions about funding but are remote from the consequences of these decisions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In December last the Taoiseach, then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, attended the launch of Barnardos 2006 review.  That review stated that 91% of the children who came to Barnardos had family and relationship needs, ranging from family discord to domestic violence.  We need immediate action by the Minister for Health and Children to address the crisis by appointing the additional social workers and other community care and health professionals. This is required without delay to fulfil the State&rsquo;s responsibility to children known by the HSE to be at serious risk of abuse or neglect, or who are being abused and neglected, but currently receiving no assistance.  It is time to act for the most vulnerable children in our society.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator White on speaking the truth and castigating her own Government.  That is where the buck stops.  We need to take our head out of the sand and stop throwing up figures and assuming all is rosy in the garden.  There is a problem and the most vulnerable in society <Col N="905"/>are suffering because of it.  I ask for honesty about the immediate needs that were exposed by the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has been asked many questions during this debate.  I am sure he agrees with me that it has been a disturbing debate, with widespread evidence of a crisis in the child protection services.  What sort of emergency response is planned by the Minister of State?  Was he convinced by the HSE&rsquo;s reassurances to him that it responds immediately in all cases where there is a serious and immediate risk to the health and welfare of a child?  Can he go back and get more information from the people who briefed him with that statement?  Senator Healy Eames pointed out that the situation in Galway showed it is clear that a social work team can respond only when a section 12 action is being taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has been bombarded with all these questions.  It can sometimes appear that everything is his fault and that nothing will improve, no matter how much money is invested.  I am concerned that social workers were not willing to speak out publicly about their concerns.  There should be a system in place in order that they would not feel obliged to speak behind screens.  I accept a child might be identified if the social worker is known and we must not identify people unnecessarily, but I worry about concealing identities for retrospective deliberations on services such as that which existed in Wexford.</P>
        <P>Is there cross-departmental co-operation in the search for those missing children?  This issue needs serious consideration.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention over the past couple of hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that the Minister of State is new to the office, and I wish him well.  My party will be fully supportive of any initiatives brought forward to deal with this issue, which I believe is in crisis.  If we are to deal with this effectively, we need to recognise that there is a problem.  The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme was one of the most difficult I have had to watch.  I found it very disturbing to listen to the accounts of the social workers.  From viewing the programme, does the Minister of State accept that in one region social workers were not assigned to work with more than 70 children who had suffered abuse?  Is that an accurate assessment of what was going on, or did the programme and the social worker interviewed misrepresent the truth?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a brief period to respond to a great number of issues, and I will try to tackle them as quickly as I can.  People have been asking about waiting lists and the numbers at risk.  This is partly a legacy issue that goes back to the existence of the health boards.  Health boards defined assessed risk in different ways.  We have instructed the HSE to develop a common language throughout the different local health offices in order that what represents risk in the north east is the same risk in the south west.  We will then have an opportunity to deliver a strategic overarching plan that will tackle the same issues.  Through that, we will also be able to find out where the deficits exist.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames referred to deficits in Galway.  If deficits exist in Galway, there may well be surpluses in other parts of the country and we can look at the question of redeployment.  This will also feed into the national child care implementation programme, which is also under the management of the HSE and which is trying to set up a proper IT system in the area.  It will allow us to develop policy properly on the basis of facts.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>The answer to Senator Doherty&rsquo;s question on the accuracy of the programme&rsquo;s assessment is that I do not know.  This information was given anonymously and we cannot check it, other than through this particular method.  The programme makers have got until the end of June to get back to me with these figures, something which they promised they will do.  There are 8,972 child abuse reports to social work departments.  After initial assessment, there are 3,567 child protection concerns.  The number of confirmed abuse cases was 1,492, while confirmed non-abuse cases or unfounded cases came to 351.  There are 958 cases with conclusive outcomes, while assessment is ongoing for 766 cases.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to the 90% of children in State care who have a social worker and asked what is wrong with the other 10%.  The reality is that people in State care can be in residential care or foster care.  At the very high end of foster care, there is no social worker for people who have little or no need for social services or State intervention or supervision.  However, such people have access to social services, which explains the figure.  I can see why it caused people some concern.</P>
        <P>The problem of waiting lists was an issue of concern for almost all Members in their contributions.  The HSE service plan for 2008 commits the HSE to develop a mechanism for collecting information on the following for each administrative area from 1 July: the number of notifications made of child abuse or neglect; the number of assessments conducted following notifications; the number of children on waiting lists for assessments following notification of child abuse or neglect; and the average time spent on a waiting list for assessment following notification of child abuse and neglect.  However, we must first make sure that everybody is counting things the same way in order that the figures are coherent and allow us to formulate policy accordingly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Another issue raised by Members was the question of trafficking and unaccompanied minors that are going missing from the system.  The figures on people going missing while under the care of the health authorities are the same in Ireland as in Europe.  At the peak of this problem in 2001, a total of 81 children went missing.  Last year, 32 children went missing and this year just one child has gone missing so far.  Most of them are in the 16 to 17 age group.  Some of them have been rescued from situations of sexual abuse or some kind of labour exploitation.  There is an issue there but the majority are leaving to reunite with their families in other countries or entering labour situations.  This is not acceptable.  All children who come into the State must be treated equally and the HSE is developing new protocols to ensure there is equality of treatment of children in this State, whether they are non-nationals, children seeking asylum, unaccompanied minors or citizens.  Three new residential centres are being developed by the HSE which will ensure a higher level of security as soon as children come into the care of the executive.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme and we can be a little but precious about whether we should pay attention to the media or be led by the media.  It is a symbiotic relationship &mdash; the media, Members and members of the public are all involved in public affairs.  There have been many developments prior to the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; television programme which was the impetus for this debate.  These elements are linked and give us an opportunity to ventilate these issues.  I hope I have answered as many questions as possible.</P>

I do not believe guidelines are being distributed by the HSE but I will check that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann commends the Government on its commitment to transport investment under Transport 21.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now in the third year of Transport 21 and I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the progress made and to assure Senators that the Government remains committed to delivering the programme in full.  Transport 21 is a huge undertaking.  It is the first time a Government in this country has agreed a ten-year financial framework for any sector of our economy and the first time a capital investment commitment of &euro;34 billion has been made, an unprecedented level of investment.</P>
        <P>This level of funding is required.  For many years, up to the mid-1990s, our economy could not generate the level of funding necessary to improve and upgrade our transport infrastructure and, therefore, we were left with a poor road network and a public transport system that could not meet the demands placed on it.  It is only in recent years that we have had the internal financial resources to address these investment needs.  The excellent results of that investment are becoming increasingly clear, especially on our much improved national roads, our renewed railway system and in new areas such as the Luas.  We will build on these improvements over the coming years and create a world class transport system to meet the needs of our economy and society.</P>
        <P>We are addressing two major challenges: dealing with the effects of past under-investment and meeting the growth in demand arising from our unprecedented economic success and population growth.  Transport 21 identifies and prioritises the projects that will be completed in the ten-year period to 2015.  There will be more to do after that period and in the programme for Government we have committed to preparing a follow-on investment programme to Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The progress being made under Transport 21 is impressive.  Many major projects, particularly on the national road network, are being completed on time and within budget.  Construction is under way on many important projects, especially on the major inter-urban motorways and the railway, while others are at the statutory approval stage, design and planning stage or public consultation.</P>
        <P>Regarding national roads, the main emphasis is on completing the five major inter-urban roads from Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the Border and on the development of the Atlantic road corridor from Letterkenny through Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork to Waterford.  The evidence of the progress made on the inter-urban roads is there for all to see.  The motorway to the Border is now complete and open to traffic and anybody who has travelled the other routes in recent times will testify to the enormous progress being made.  At this stage, more than 85% of the major inter-urban road network is either open to traffic or under construction.  All the remaining projects are through the statutory approvals process and we are on target to complete the five major inter-urban roads in 2010.  At the end of 2010 that network will comprise more than 730 km of motorway and dual carriageway.</P><Col N="908"/>
        <P>We sometimes forget the progress made over the past decade.  As recently as 1990, we had only 26 km of motorway and a decade ago we still had fewer than 100 km.  Perhaps the most pleasing recent development is that most of the road schemes are now coming in ahead of schedule and under budget.  In early 2007 an acceleration of the funding provision of some of the major elements of the Atlantic corridor was announced.  Construction will now commence on the N18 Ennis to Galway route in early 2008, three years ahead of when originally planned.</P>
        <P>The upgrade of the M50 is also included in the Transport 21 programme.  The upgrade is being done in three phases, the first two of which will open this year and the remaining phase in 2010.  This year will also see the introduction of barrier free tolling on the M50, and road users, both commercial and otherwise, will see significant benefits when this is complete.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has also been made on public transport since the launch of Transport 21.  We have also seen tangible evidence of progress locally.  Already, a new rail station has opened in the Dublin docklands.  This was ahead of schedule and under budget and is delivering an additional 12 services each way per day on the busy Maynooth suburban line.  Some 67 new rail carriages were introduced on the Dublin-Cork rail route at the start of 2007 and hourly services are now provided.  The response of users has been very encouraging; total passenger journeys in 2007 were 14% higher than in 2006.</P>
        <P>New railcars have already entered service on the Dublin-Sligo, Dublin-Westport and Dublin-Limerick lines and more are being introduced gradually on other inter-city routes.  A total of 183 railcars will go into service, transforming the quality of service on the inter-city network.  These improved services are being delivered on a renewed railway infrastructure.  Over the past decade, since the approval of the first railway safety programme in 1999, we have renewed track, signalling and structures across the network in the biggest investment programme since the railways were built at the end of the 19th century.</P>
        <P>Construction work has begun on a number of projects.  These include Cherrywood and docklands Luas extensions and the four-tracking of the Kildare line.  These will have a critical role to play in improving public transport in the capital city and in opening up lands for residential and commercial development.  Work has also commenced on two flagship regional development projects, namely, the reopening of the Midleton rail line and the western rail corridor.</P>
        <P>The coming years will see a further escalation in the number of rail projects. A railway order application was recently approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the first phase of the Navan line on which construction work will begin later this year.  Planning in respect of the rail interconnector from Heuston Station to the Northern line is well advanced with public consultation taking place on station and alignment options.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Important steps have also been taken on metro north, the metro line from the city centre to Swords via Dublin Airport.  The RPA has selected the preferred route and is working hard on the preparatory document for a railway order application and is in pre-application discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It has commenced the PPP procurement process and prequalified companies were recently invited to submit tenders in respect of the project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last year, the RPA announced the emerging preferred route corridor for metro west.  It is currently undertaking further public consultation with key stakeholders and the public in order to define the exact alignment of the metro west route, its stops, park and ride facilities and depot.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of 2006 a total of &euro;60 million has been allocated to Dublin Bus towards the purchase of 100 additional and 200 replacement buses.  This has enabled Dublin Bus to increase the frequency of its services to areas such as Tallaght, Cherrywood and Tyrrellstown, <Col N="909"/>north of Blanchardstown.  New developing areas and existing and new quality bus corridors have also benefited from increased services.  The replacement buses have ensured the quality of the bus fleet is maintained at a high level and therefore attractive to the travelling public.</P>
        <P>During the same period a total of &euro;73 million was allocated to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the purchase of 235 new buses.  More than 110 of these have been delivered with the balance due for delivery by the end of this year.  In addition to replacing life expired fleet these new buses have enabled Bus &Eacute;ireann to launch new services in Cork and between Dublin and Navan.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the progress made to date under Transport 21.  The ten-year programme is on target to deliver the projects identified.  The Minister and I will continue to ensure that every effort is made to complete projects in the shortest possible timeframe.  The country needs this infrastructure and needs it quickly.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 is not just about building new roads or public transport infrastructure.  It is about improving the quality of life of our citizens and reducing commuter and travel times. When completed, Transport 21 will transform travel for everyone in Ireland.  The country will become a better place in which to work, live, visit and invest.</P>

        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;notes with dissatisfaction that:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the Government&rsquo;s public transport investment programme continues to suffer from completion delays and budget over-runs;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the continued congestion due to delays in providing an integrated and reliable public transport system is leading to damages to Irish business and social cohesion;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the Government&rsquo;s inability to deliver integrated ticketing and more buses for the Dublin region; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the failure of the Government to deliver plans to maintain and support Irish rail life.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am pleased to move this amendment on behalf of my party.</P>
        <P>The motto adopted by Transport 21 in the advertising and public relations campaign currently underway is, &ldquo;Progress in Motion&rdquo;.  While in fairness there has been progress in motion in respect of some parts of the Transport 21 package, progress in respect of many elements of it have been in slow motion with no apparent motion at all in respect of others.</P>
        <P>I will first identify from where we have come in terms of the delivery of the Transport 21 programme, second, point to where we now are and, third, set out where we need to go to with this vital project.  Yesterday afternoon we spent much time discussing the collapse of the public private partnership process in respect of housing projects in Dublin.</P><Col N="910"/>
        <P>What is happening in respect of Transport 21 is also important in terms of the vast amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money, almost &euro;35 billion in total, already committed or spent.  In far too many cases projects that will make an enormous difference to communities and parts of our country are running over time or are not happening at all.  Let us look at the statements made by the Government parties when Transport 21 was announced.  The former Taoiseach declared that his ambition and plan was to build a world-class transport system for the 21st century and to do so on time and within budget.  The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, stated at that time that he expected all agencies to deliver the programme in full, on time and within budget.  The main elements of those two statements were that projects be delivered on time and within budget.</P>
        <P>A number of years into this project it is clear that too many critical infrastructure projects are not being delivered on time or within budget.  Soon after the package was announced, warning sounds were made.  One institute quoted in a different context during the past week, the ESRI, had many things to say following its announcement.  It made the point, which if appropriate then is even more so now, that while the overall cost of the plan is &euro;34.4 billion the individual costing of each project is not apparent to Members of the Oireachtas or the public.  It also made the point that in many cases no alternatives were published or compared in respect of the billions of euro of taxpayers money being spent.</P>
        <P>The ESRI further made the point, which carries more weight now, that there has been under-investment in the mode of transport, namely buses, which are so important to many people in Dublin and the greater Dublin area and that the hard decisions in respect of new bus routes have not been recognised or acted upon.  It is of great concern to note that many of the crucial projects, about which my colleagues will speak later, that will make an enormous difference to the people we represent have been delayed.  I will provide a number of examples in this regard, all of which are taken from the last annual report produced by the Transport 21 team from the Department of Transport.</P>
        <P>None of the five key Transport 21 projects due to be completed in 2008 will be delivered on time despite the Government having committed almost &euro;8 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money in this regard.  The figure signature projects that are meant to be up and running, carrying commuters and making a difference to our economy and society will not be delivered on time.  The greatest example we have of the lack of integration in terms of how taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent is the joining up of the two Luas lines in Dublin.  While this project was to take place this year we now know that this will not be the case.</P>
        <P>Many of my colleagues will give examples later of the situation in respect of projects outside Dublin whereas I am more familiar with projects in Dublin.  The Cork-Midleton rail service which was meant to be operational by 2008 will not now be delivered.  The cost of all of these delays is apparent to our business, our community and our environment.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce estimates that the cost of non-delivery of these projects is approximately &euro;2.5 billion per annum.  We also know that the private transport system in Dublin is responsible for almost one-third of all carbon emissions.  The cost of the Government&rsquo;s inability to deliver important projects is enormous to our environment and our economy.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that if the Acting Chairman were sitting on the opposite side of the House and were about to speak on this issue he would accuse me of a dereliction of duty in not pointing out what we would do differently.</P>

	<P>I am clear on what we would do differently in some areas.  I have many ideas but will conclude by providing only three.  All 26 glorious pages of the annual report produced by the Department of Transport to update the public on progress in respect of Transport 21 continually sets out the success of the project.  Let us have some realism in these reports and let us note that not everything is happening in the way that it should. It is crucial for us to have a detailed, costed implementation plan published regarding the prioritised projects in Transport 21.  </P>
        <P>As the city of Dublin approaches the big dig, it is essential that a clear, transparent and detailed plan be managed so that community and business life in the city centre will be protected and maintained during the enormous construction period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator McFadden second the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I am sorry Senator Boyle is in the Chair because I intend to have a go at the Green Party launch statement of yesterday.  The Senator spoke about hitting commuters by taxing them for using roads over public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Senator to address the motion rather than the Chair, for once.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so and I thank the Chair for the correction.  I shall abide, as always, by the Chair.</P>
        <P>It is well and good to tax people for using roads if there is a public transport system in place but, sadly, what is being provided is inadequate and insufficient.  In its launch document, the Green Party called for a light rail in all major cities.  I fully support this.  When I was still a county councillor in Athlone, I included, in the consideration of the county development plant, an aspiration that there should be a light rail for the town of Athlone.  It would be far-sighted and visionary for a local authority to include such in its development plan and thus decrease the high dependency on cars, which, as the document states, has made us so vulnerable with increasing oil prices.</P>
        <P>This is all laudable but it is also ironic that the Green Party, a partner in Government, also stated yesterday that we are spending three times as much on roads as on public transport.  Since that party has joined forces with Fianna F&aacute;il what has their joint partnership delivered?  The Green Party has been very vocal on public transport issues since its inception.</P>
        <P>An important question is how to keep cars out of Dublin city centre.  On several occasions since I was elected Senator, I have raised the matter of public transport in the midlands and, specifically concerning County Westmeath, the re-opening of the Mullingar-Athlone rail link.  This was never included in Transport 21.  Today the Government parties are applauding themselves on how wonderful Transport 21 is but they have not given a jot to the people of Westmeath and the midland areas.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Mullingar-Athlone rail link should be included in Transport 21.  Many Ministers for Transport and politicians representing Longford-Westmeath have paid lip service to and have made false promises concerning the delivery of this line.  I believe that there is no political will to include the Mullingar-Athlone rail link in Transport 21 nor is there the will on behalf of the board of CIE to do so.  This is regrettable.  The line exists, no land needs to be acquired, the costs, in comparison to other projects around the country, would be very little and the benefits would be enormous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What would the opening of the Mullingar-Athlone connection mean to the people of the midlands?  It would improve access within Westmeath, complementing the national spatial strategy to which so much attention has been given, by connecting the gateway towns of <Col N="912"/>Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore.  According to the Indecon report, rail infrastructure has been identified as being very important in terms of providing mobility within the region.  This line would connect the people from Sligo, Longford, Mullingar and Maynooth to the west without commuters having to go to Dublin.  In economic terms, the rail link would improve the accessibility of workers, shoppers, students and tourists to the labour market, to Athlone Institute of Technology, to F&Aacute;S and to various tourism attractions in Westmeath.  Many worthy agencies support this, as is clear from the Indecon report, the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and the Border midland and western grouping, BMW.  They say that this is a commendable proposal and they cannot all be wrong.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to prioritise this rail link to keep car numbers and emissions down and to reduce stress and anxiety in people who must sit in their cars for hours trying to get in and out of Dublin.  There is another option for the Minister in this regard, which is to open the railway station at Killucan.  There is a superb land block there on which a park-and-ride facility could be built and people coming from Meath and north Westmeath would not find it necessary to drive into the city.</P>
        <P>We must have the vision to include these projects in Transport 21.  It is not all about Dublin, with respect to Senator Donohoe.  There are other parts of the country which are neglected and public transport is as important in rural Ireland as it is in Dublin.  I ask the Minister, in his new brief, to examine the re-opening of the Mullingar-Athlone rail link and the Killucan railway station.</P>

        <P>When we examine Transport 21 as a whole it is important for people to realise what was our starting point.  We must increasingly invest in public rail, roads and other public services in respect of transport if we are to improve what we have.  We have all seen  enormous improvements put in place over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a number of aspects that concern my part of the country before dealing with Luas and metro and the other matters that affect all who come into Dublin.  There has been enormous investment in the roads infrastructure.  We have seen projects delivered on time and now coming in under budget.  The NRA is to be complimented for the way in which it has upped its game in recent times in comparison with the early operation of some of its projects.  We now see projects delivered as they should be and credit is due to Mr. Fred Barry and the team around him in the NRA.  They are delivering well ahead of time on many projects, for instance on the M4.  I saw one project local to me, the by-pass of Dromod and Rooskey, which was delivered recently ten months ahead of time and under budget.  These are the benefits coming from some of our road projects.</P>
        <P>The project that most people have dealings with is probably the M50.  While this might not be progressing as quickly as everyone would wish there are now definite times concerning completion.  We will also have barrier-free tolling by the second half of this year. These are very important issues for people.</P>
        <P>We must also look to the future concerning the road infrastructure as a whole.  The proposals of last week for an outer relief road for Dublin, stretching from either Drogheda or Dundalk down to a point south of Naas point up what must be done if we are to have efficient road transport for the haulage industry.  By doing such we would make a double contribution.  We would save with regard to time spent on these routes and emissions would also be reduced.</P>
        <P>We are in a country where it is more important to load goods onto a truck than to use rail.  Anybody who knows about using rail for heavy goods will understand that bar a minimum journey of 600 miles, it is inefficient.  This might be sad to state but it is inefficient because of the costs of hauling to a station, loading and unloading.  This is why so many of our goods are transported by road.  It will always be the position in this country.</P>
        <P>The Luas has been a tremendous success and the proposed extensions are to be welcomed.  In doing this, I hope we will not have the same problems with regard to its construction as we did previously.  Parts of the city remained dug up for far longer periods than was necessary.  The RPA will no doubt take this into consideration because it was raised by many Members of both Houses.  We do not want to see it happening again.  We understand St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will become a building site for a while and we must accept this.  However, I hope proper arrangements will be made to allow traffic to move freely on other routes rather than having to go around the green during the construction.  When complete, the joining up of all the rail services in the city will be of enormous benefit to commuters.  It will mean somebody can go to a park and ride facility on the outskirts of the city and know they can get from A to B without having to walk for two miles or change from rail to bus.</P>
        <P>We have seen enormous improvements in bus services and the quality of the bus fleet.  This is welcome and will make a major contribution to the provision of services.  I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech the increase in the number of buses provided this year.  If we continue at this level we will encourage people to get out of their cars and use public transport provided it is efficient and that we will not end up with people jammed into buses with standing room only.  Thank God this seems to have disappeared.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is to be complimented on how well it runs the intercity services.  They are run efficiently and on time, which is important to people who use them.</P><Col N="914"/>
        <P>Major investment has been made in rail services with the provision of welded rail and the improvement of rolling stock.  No line has seen more of this than the one which goes from my neck of the woods to Dublin, namely, the Dublin to Sligo line.  The improvement in this line is justified by the extra services provided and the increase in passengers using it and everybody welcomes this.  It has increased by approximately 15% to 20% over the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden mentioned joining up western rail services with those from Dublin.  The western rail corridor, as proposed, will make a major contribution to providing a national rail service.  At present, if one wants to travel by rail to Limerick, one must first go to Dublin and then change train.  Once the western rail corridor is completed, it will mean one can travel from Sligo to Limerick or Cork.</P>
        <P>Any morning or evening in any station in the city one can see that the number commuters who have switched from car or bus to rail is phenomenal.  If one passes Heuston Station or Connolly Station when a train comes in one will see the number of people using the services.  Many people arrive into Connolly and then take the Luas to Heuston Station and around the city.  However, it will never be efficient until the metro is in place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and everything is joined up.  This must be the main aim of public transport policy in Dublin.  Examining it from outside, I see total merit in the provision of the metro and the Luas extensions.  They will make a major contribution to providing people with an efficient and reliable service.  People will know they will arrive on time and not be at the whim of a traffic jam or a minor road accident.  We have seen minor accidents jam the traffic in the city for hours.</P>
        <P>The removal of HGVs from the city through the use of the Dublin Port tunnel has made a major contribution to enabling people to go about the city in public transport or their cars.  It has removed traffic from the city centre.  None of us will regret that HGV juggernauts have been removed from the inner city because they caused problems with traffic congestion.  One always knew the time the boats sailed because if one was coming up the quays within an hour and a half of the boat, one saw the HGVs bumper to bumper.  Now they can get off the M50 via the port tunnel and arrive without causing inconvenience for people in the city centre.</P>
        <P>We must consider other measures making a contribution to Transport 21.  The Minister of State was right to state we never had the level of resources that we do now to provide public infrastructure and we all accept this.  In doing this, we do not want to see everything pushed into one part of the country.  Certain parts of the country, including my own, still have serious road problems.  Towns which previously had mini-bypasses now need bypasses.  I appeal to the NRA to examine these now and plan ahead.  I will mention Carrick-on-Shannon, which has a bypass but is becoming a bottleneck on the N4 at weekends and other times.  The bypass provided was a type of inner relief road.  The NRA is progressing this.</P>
        <P>The one benefit I see from the road improvements which have taken place, particularly on the N4 which I use, is that it now takes me 20 minutes less to get to Dublin than it did three years ago without having to break the law.  This is where we see the difference.  It is 20 minutes and a large amount of emissions saved because one is driving efficiently and not stuck in traffic jams.  I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will continue to drive Transport 21.  When we discuss it in two or three years&rsquo; time we will realise the bulk of Transport 21 will have been delivered and that commuters in Dublin and throughout the country will have the standard of service they deserve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it easy to agree with both the motion and the amendment.  The Government is congratulating itself on one of the most laudable parts of its policy and the Opposition is finding fault with smaller and minor parts of it.  However, most people support Transport 21.  I accept the Opposition&rsquo;s criticisms but the motion should be supported.  The tabling of the motion is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s commitment not to cut capital expenditure and I commend it on that.  In the fragile economic period we are approaching, it is important that such expenditure is not cut, particularly on infrastructure because of its importance to the economy.</P>
        <P>The motion highlights the infrastructural problems that were never resolved during the Celtic tiger era.  All forms of transport were inadequate because nobody foresaw the extraordinary boom in land, air and sea traffic.  Even if the motion is only aspirational, we should tie the Government to it, commend it on tabling it and accept it as a commitment not to cut capital expenditure in this area.  I welcome the motion for that reason.  The Opposition amendments are fair in their detailed criticism of delays and so on but, on the whole, we should encourage the Government to proceed full steam ahead with its plans and not carp too much about them.</P>
        <P>When I consider the problems in Dublin, I see the M50 in mind&rsquo;s eye.  It is symbolic of what happened to Dublin traffic and infrastructure in recent times.  We witnessed an appalling vista.  There was no foresight regarding the transport problems in the city and commuters and trade were allowed to be obstructed.  The Government was paralysed for years and did nothing about it and it was happy to see a private monopoly raking in money at the expense not only of individuals but also the economy.  I welcome the proposed introduction of barrier free tolling in August, to which Senator Ellis referred.  I also welcome the Government having the bottle to spend the money to do so because the benefits may not be immediate, tangible or measurable but the time saved by individuals, who are more important than anything, and industry and trade will be incalculable.  That will be an infrastructural benefit.</P>
        <P>The object of the exercise is to encourage people out of their cars and to avail of public transport.  They should not be forced to do this and they should make a free choice because they like public transport and it is better than travelling in their cars and it is preferable, more efficient, cleaner and so on.  I do not agree with the Green Party&rsquo;s proposal to tax people out of their cars.  I cannot understand why the Government or the Minister do not try a more radical solution.  The Labour Party went one quarter of the way there two years ago.  Why on earth will the Government not make public transport free for three, four or five years?  The Minister State should announce public transport is free, as the cost to the Exchequer would not be significant.  I have done calculations on this but I forgot to bring them to the Chamber.  However, if public transport were free, we could examine the movement of people from private cars to public transport.  I predict it would be dramatic, particularly at this time as people are beginning to feel the pinch and are looking to save money.  This is a discretionary expenditure, which they could choose.  Carbon emissions would be reduced and the Government would not face the detailed little problems such as integrated ticketing, which it is unable to resolve, because tickets would not be required and fewer cars would be on the road.  I fail to see why the Minister of State would not consider that as an alternative to the Green Party proposal for a congestion charge.</P>
        <P>My proposals would incentivise people, not punish them.  That is a radical, left wing proposal.  It is too far to the left for the Labour Party but it is not too far for me.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to make trouble for the Government.  This proposal should be considered and the Minister should think of this as a radical alternative.  A significant number of cars would be removed from the road.  He could go further and incentivise drivers to carry three or four people in their cars and not travel alone rather than penalising them.  That would also remove cars from the road if the Government is serious.  Public transport is not only about building more roads and making the system more efficient but it is also about incentivising people to make that choice.  The Minister of State should give consideration to this.  I am interested in his views.  I apologise for not having the figure for the cost to the Exchequer, which I obtained from CIE.  The Luas, buses, the DART and the metro should all be free.  The last time this happened was in communist Russia.  That is not a good reason for failing to do this if it works and takes cars off the road.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate him on his elevation to this position.  I have little doubt he will give it the same dedication he gave to his previous portfolio and he will be successful.</P>
        <P>I will confine my remarks to what will happen in the west in the next few years.  Great progress has been made.  The N5 upgrade between Castlebar and the county boundary with Roscommon is complete.  The final 14 km section was completed well ahead of schedule and it was opened earlier this year, even though it was not supposed to be completed until the end of the year.  We are on the right track to getting other works up and running.  Last Monday, Mayo County Council met to discuss the route for a dual carriageway between Ballindine and Galway city.  While it is included in the plans for the Atlantic corridor, it will be completed ahead of schedule because the Government has made significant moneys available for the development of roads.  A dual carriageway between Ballindine and Galway city will make a major difference to transport in the west because it will link with the N17 between Charlestown and Ballindine, which has been a great success in the past four years.</P>
        <P>The other part I would like to mention is the N59 coastal route which is proposed from Sligo via Westport to Galway.  This will benefit tourism hugely in that part of the country because everybody knows that it has huge tourism potential.  The tourism aspect has been developed over recent years but, unfortunately, the road network has not been that good.  I welcome the fact that it has been included in Transport 21 and look forward to its completion.</P>
        <P>The western rail corridor is another part of our development.  For the past 30 years, no train has run from Claremorris to Ennis or Galway but this has now begun to be put in place.  As we speak, work is taking place on the Ennis to Athenry route.  This will deliver direct, regular Galway to Limerick services timed to meet commuter needs.  It will serve Limerick, Ennis, a new station at Sixmilebridge, Gort, Ardrahan, Craughwell, Oranmore and Athenry and proceed into Galway.  The second part of that phase will see the development of the Athenry-Tuam-Claremorris route, which will be of huge benefit to my part of south and east Mayo and people travelling to Galway.</P>
        <P>There is also a proposal that it continue on to Collooney in County Sligo and link up with the Sligo-Dublin line.  That will take a lot of transport off the road as far as the transport of goods is concerned.  I would certainly welcome that because at the present time, our roads are taken up to a considerable degree with the transport of materials that could well be transported by rail.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, on putting money into the reinstatement of fencing and of part of the line from Claremorris to Collooney as well as the cleaning of the line.  This money was well spent and has given a new impetus to the development of that part of the track.  When it comes to Claremorris, I have little doubt that it will go on to Collooney in a speedy fashion.</P><Col N="917"/>
        <P>There are three trains per day from Westport-Ballina to Dublin, taking in all the stations in Mayo on the way there.  It is now proposed that by the end of the year, there will be five trains per day.  I congratulate Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on upgrading that line and putting on new carriages.  I travelled on that train twice in recent weeks and it was a comfort to do so compared with what we had before.  The new rolling stock is very welcome and its introduction is not before time.  This will take a considerable amount of traffic off the road.  I would ask Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to ensure there is an early bird service from Westport-Ballina to Athlone to meet up with the Galway train so that the people of Mayo could be in before 9 a.m.</P>
        <P>This Government has invested a substantial sum of money in Knock Airport, which is also part of transport although it is not in Transport 21.  The Government allocated &euro;27.1 million for the development of the airport.  I see that bringing in more people to the west for tourism.  This is why it is important we have good rail and bus transport and good roads in that part of the county.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am very glad to speak on this motion.  I am my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on the commuter belt.  This is an issue that affects not just me but many of the people I represent.  I want to focus on a small number of issues because, like previous speakers, I think a lot has been done on the issue of transport infrastructure.  I will suggest some improvements and ideas that the Minister of State might take away with him, focusing largely on bus services, the rail network and roads.</P>
        <P>Our bus network has seen significant expansion over recent years.  More needs to be done because buses are one area where we can deliver real improvements much more quickly than improvements to the rail or road networks which, of course, take time.  Additional buses can be introduced very quickly.  We would like to see 500 additional buses added to the Dublin fleet.  We would also like to see the completion of the quality bus networks not just in Dublin but also in other cities such as Cork.  We would like to see fast-tracking of the park and ride facilities, with express bus services from Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway.  We would also like to see better route information systems.  Information should be provided at bus stops so that when people arrive there, they can get information about the next service.  Information should also be sent to mobile phones and displayed on websites.  We would like to see a replacement of the travel pass scheme with a new freedom pass that would provide cheaper fares and integration for commuters.</P>
        <P>We would also like to see a revision of the way new bus stops are planned.  I will give the House an example without being too parochial.  Ashbourne in County Meath has grown significantly in recent years yet people must walk a mile to the nearest bus stop.  If one asks the county council to provide something, it will say that it is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will tell one to go to Bus &Eacute;ireann which will pass the buck back to the council.</P>
        <P>Last year, I attended a meeting with four county council officials, three councillors, two employees of Bus &Eacute;ireann and a local garda.  The meeting was chaired by a Minister of State.  This was just to get a bus stop.  That happened over a year ago and we are still waiting for the bus stop.  The way we go about planning and implementing something as simple as a bus stop needs to be looked at again.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could give this issue some thought because people have to walk to the nearest bus stop which is at least a mile way.</P><Col N="918"/>
        <P>I also want to raise the issue of the Navan to Dublin railway line.  I know the Government is committed to phase one but we have seen a delay happen and I want to be sure this scheme will not slip any further.  I would also like to ensure we are serious about extending the line as far as Navan.  I know the Minister has spoken in favour of it in the past.  However, we need to ensure this line serves not just the people of Navan but also the people of Dunshaughlin, Ashbourne and Ratoath, be it by changing the alignment or by putting in park and ride facilities to allow them to avail of this service.</P>
        <P>It is not the only rail project where we need to see improvement and where there have been delays.  The construction timetable for the Midleton railway line and the re-signalling of the Maynooth line have slipped and the completion date for Dublin&rsquo;s metro north has changed by two years from 2012 to 2014.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator McFadden&rsquo;s call for existing stations to be reopened.  I am aware of the station at Killucan.  It is far outside my constituency but having seen the business case for it, I think a case certainly exists and I ask the Minister of State to think again about whether the station could be reopened.</P>
        <P>When it comes to the issue of roads, we must compliment Transport 21 on delivering some projects on time and some projects before time.  An example would be the M1 link to Newry, which has opened and is a fantastic link to the North of Ireland.  The N2 bypass of Castleblayney and Monaghan is very welcome for people travelling there and beyond.  However, other schemes have seen delays.  For example, the Limerick southern ring road has had its completion date moved back to 2010.  More work needs to be done there.  Senator Ellis mentioned bypasses, on which there needs to be greater focus.  The village of Slane, for example, which lies between Ashbourne, which is bypassed, and Castleblayney, is choked with traffic.  The village of Julianstown, through which 22,000 vehicles go every day, needs a bypass, as does the village of Duleek.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I must agree with Senator Ellis again on the need for an outer relief road for Dublin, which would result in a reduction of carbon emissions.  I do not agree with the Green Party&rsquo;s comments on this, as reported in today&rsquo;s newspapers, where it was described as &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; to put such a scheme in place without first ensuring that everybody drives an electric car.  I think an outer relief road is essential in terms of emissions reductions.  I note that Senator Dan Boyle is looking quizzically at me, but I refer him to today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Deputy Cuffe was quoted as saying that a Dublin outer orbital route would be &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; but I believe it would be a great idea and agree with Senator Ellis on that point.</P>
        <P>We can provide for such schemes because there is additional money in the public coffers from the VAT on fuel, given that fuel prices have increased enormously in recent times.  With the downturn in the construction sector, there are people available who would be ideally placed to take on these schemes.  I ask the Government to focus on increasing the level of bypass building.</P>
        <P>Comrade Ross referred to the idea of getting rid of rail fares altogether, which reminded me of a story I heard when I was working for a rail company in the United Kingdom.  The Chairman of British Rail was asked why rail fares could not be made cheaper.  His response was that if he received the same level of subsidy as the Italian railway network, not only could he eliminate all fares, he could also give all customers a &pound;10 refund at Christmas.  One gets what one pays for.  If adequate subsidies were made available, we could have free fares.  If the Government wants to see improved emissions and more people using public transport, it will have to make the money available.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Hannigan for sharing his time with me.  It is very important, even though times may be difficult, that the Government keeps its nerve and invests in the long-term infrastructure of this country.  We have had situations in the past, particularly with the metro, where it was clear that the project was the only logical, sensible solution that would effectively address the traffic congestion in Dublin city but it fell off the agenda because of economic difficulties.  The Government must keep its courage on this one.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed, like other Members, that the time for the implementation of the metro has been extended by another two years.  We must have absolute commitment on this project.  While I am on the subject of the metro, much concern has been expressed about disruption to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  I understand that it must take place and I have lost a few votes by writing back to constituents and telling them that I am in favour of the metro and that the green must be dug up.  However, it can be done in a sensitive way.  I know, for example, in the Middle East that even mature trees can be lifted, tubbed, conserved and then put back in place.  I would like a commitment from the Government that this will happen and that the disruption to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will be temporary and that the park, which is very much beloved by Dubliners and all Irish citizens, will be reinstated and there will not be ongoing, ugly disturbances.  Any entrances to the metro station should be appropriate and, if possible, located outside the perimeter of the green itself.  Having said all that, the metro is essential.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the Dublin transport authority might take into account the views of Mr. Cormac Rabbitte and examine his Dargan project proposals.  Mr. Rabbitte is a serious player in this area and has had very sensible ideas.  Governments tend to catch up with him after the event.  He has come up with a proposal that would provide us with more than the metro as currently outlined, would be cheaper and would be a fully integrated orbital metro network.</P>
        <P>I spoke on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill in this House and was sorry the Minister did not agree to at least one of my amendments which related to the off-street parking of commercial buses, especially private ones.  It is insane to have buses all around Mountjoy Square, for example, where there is a cr&egrave;che and a children&rsquo;s playground.  It is very dangerous and I do not see why there should not be a requirement on the bus companies to provide off-street parking for their fleets.  The Minister responded that the provision existed in the legislation to which I respond that the wording should be changed from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, that is, the Minister shall require the companies to provide off-street parking because it is a public necessity.</P>
        <P>We also discussed the issue of cycle lanes on O&rsquo;Connell Street.  If we are going to provide cycle lanes, there must be consistency and coherence.  There is no point in having a cycle lane that starts at one point and then evaporates at a set of traffic lights.  Cycle lanes and cyclists must be protected.  I have been knocked off my bicycle not once, but twice on O&rsquo;Connell Street, with the result that I do not cycle down it any more.</P>
        <P>I raised a matter during the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill but I know the Minister of State at the Department of Transport is a good Dubliner and may take it on board.  This is a city of which we can be proud but not of the Dublin Port tunnel, to which Senator Ellis referred.  While it has been effective in removing the articulated traffic from the city centre, its treatment is appalling.  The entrance, which is one of the first sights of public note one sees coming from the airport, is ugly, amateurish and stupid.  It looks like a bit of an old hoover that has landed from outer space.  Why not address it properly and put it in a proper architectural context, to show that we are proud of it?  Furthermore, when we are building the metro, let us not build cheap stations.  Let us, for a few pence more in global terms, build decent stations which can be used as exhibition halls for reproductions of some of the great treasures we have in our museums.</P>

	<P>In the 1940s, writing in his Cruiskeen Lawn column in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Brian O&rsquo;Nolan, probably writing as Myles na gCopaleen or one of the other vast array of characters he used, talked about road development.  He was writing satirically at a time when the tram services had stopped in all the Irish cities and rail lines were being ripped up left, right and centre.  His argument was that one only really needed to build one new road, which did not even have to go to any particular location.  One just waited until the traffic filled that road and then one built a new one parallel to it and one kept building new roads parallel to it, indefinitely.  It was a very prescient column because it seems we now have that road.  It is called the M50.</P>

	<P>That type of transport planning which has bedevilled us over generations has always been, if the House will pardon the pun, the wrong road to go down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no need to question the fact that one of the most advanced inventions of the 20th century was the private motor car.  The freedom it gave to people changed the nature of society.  However, that freedom has come with a price.  It has meant using a scarce and diminishing resource that has environmental consequences.  Any society that wants to get people from A to B in the quickest possible time must have a proper balance between access to the private motor car and public transport.</P>
        <P>I spoke at a conference in Berlin recently, which is not a city I get to go to very often, but it was a pleasant experience.  I spoke on a Friday morning and had the rest of the weekend to potter around.  I bought a daily travel ticket for the city of Berlin and locations up to 20 km outside it, which cost me &euro;6.50.  With that ticket I could travel on the suburban rail, the S-bahn, the underground, the U-bahn, the trams and the buses.  Berlin is a city of 3.5 million people and there are obviously economies of scale at play but if we consider ourselves to be an advanced country, one of the wealthiest in the world, then we must ask ourselves why not.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that Transport 21 is the first attempt at putting in place an integrated approach to transport planning.  In our press conference yesterday, we mentioned the fact that spending between the years 2002 and 2006 was three times greater on roads than on public transport, which was totally the wrong approach.  The balance in the Transport 21 envelope is &euro;18 billion for road transport and &euro;14 billion for public transport, which is far better than the previous position.  We will never have sustainable transport provision, however, until that gap is bridged or even surpassed.</P>
        <P>From the Green Party&rsquo;s point of view, yesterday&rsquo;s press conference was to highlight a submission we made on the sustainable transport and travel action plan, which is a useful consultation process.  It examines Transport 21, its priorities and how it will be implemented into the future.  The programme for Government is quite emphatic in providing that Transport 21 will be implemented.  The projects have been identified and they are being put in place.</P>
        <P>On the roads side, lessons of the past have been learned in terms of many projects coming in under budget and on time.  That has not always been the case.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Senator what I am happy with.  He talked about an orbital ring road, with which I will deal later.  In terms of the practice of road building in the early part of this decade, the cost of the initial road programme in 1998 increased from &euro;5.8 billion to &euro;18 billion.  I am glad that those mistakes are not being repeated with Transport 21.  It is important that we get our sums right in our transport plans.</P>
        <P>I must admit I am disappointed that road projects are being done first and public transport projects will be done subsequently.  I am also disappointed that the public transport projects that have been started are falling behind the time set for their completion whereas road projects are not.  If Transport 21 is to be effective, those are balances that we must get right.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the arguments about rail freight.  Ireland is a small country but so are countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands which have a better balance than do we between goods transported by road and goods by rail.  The ratio in Ireland is 96% and increasing for road transport and 4% and decreasing for rail.  The European average is 87% and 14%, respectively.  If that balance is achieved in countries that are smaller than ours, I must ask why.</P>
        <P>I would like the delay in work on the Cork-Midleton line and on the western rail corridor to be overcome.  I would also like rail corridor extended from Cork to Sligo, as it is only envisaged it will run from Limerick to Sligo.   One cannot travel by rail directly from Cork to Limerick but must change at Limerick Junction, even though there is a traditional line from Charleville through Patrickswell to Limerick city.  These are existing options that we should be reconsidering.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government refers to the need to have public transport choices in cities other than Dublin.  I am glad there are studies under way in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway and what they bring forward must be acted upon within the lifetime of Transport 21 and begun within the lifetime of the Government.</P>
        <P>I will put an even more emphatic statement on the record.  If new public transport initiatives do not happen while my party is in Government, then there is no point in my party being in Government.  That must be clearly stated.  We exist to get a better balance in transport.  I recognise all that is valuable in Transport 21.  I want to see its full implementation but for it to be done consistently.  I also want to ensure that those who do not have access to private motor car transport, who number between one fifth and one quarter of all households, are better dealt with in this country because we still have, if one can pardon the pun, a very long road to travel in this regard.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute on the broader transport issue.  The motion is rather bland, hence the need for the Fine Gael amendment to it.  This a topic to which we should return and devote a day to debating.  Whether it be a town or country setting or an urban or rural setting, serious transport issues facing the country need to be resolved.</P>
        <P>I listened to the contributions of previous speakers, especially that of Senator Hannigan.  He spoke about subsidies which can make rail transport much more viable for commuters in certain countries.  If we wish to move towards increased use of public transport, as is the case in any other area, we must be willing to invest in same.</P><Col N="922"/>
        <P>On the broader issue of public transport versus private transport, in particular rail and bus transport versus the car and the motorway, there is a tendency to think in the George Orwell-speak of &ldquo;Four legs good, two legs bad.&rdquo;  In other words, that rail and bus transport are on the right side of the equation and that private transport and motorists are on the wrong side of it.  The issue is far from being as simple as that.  I do aspire to the belief, however, we must maximise the level of public transport available.  We must also maximise the incentive and the possibility of that being provided, but that requires serious levels of investment.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael amendment briefly mentions some of the obvious problems we face.  Everybody welcomes the apparent commitment of money under Transport 21, but the delivery and the provision of what has been written in that respect is another matter.  Some of the progress under the programme has been quite slow.  I have spoken on many occasions in the House about the need for investment on the rail side of the equation.  I welcome what has been done so far.  To paraphrase the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s phrase, there is a lot done, more to do.  Much more investment is required.</P>
        <P>A solution has not been found to transport issues in certain parts of the country.  I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of his Department and that of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment the difficulty being experienced by commuters on the Kerry-Mallow rail line where on a weekly if not daily basis, as a result of a labour dispute, commuters from Kerry are being brought to Mallow and Cork by bus.  It is causing considerable difficulty and as a result, some people are moving away completely from using public transport and returning to using their cars.  The dispute is obviously between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and its staff but this has been ongoing at a certain level for some time and needs attention.</P>
        <P>I will be parochial again and raise a road infrastructure issue I have raised on many occasions previously.  I had to express bemusement and amazement when the Transport 21 plan was announced, notwithstanding the large number of roads scheduled for investment, that two roads in my region in north Cork, the Mallow-Mitchelstown and Mallow-Fermoy roads, amazingly were left off the list.  I have brought this to the attention of the previous two Ministers for Transport.  Roads with such high levels of commercial and domestic traffic as the Mallow-Mitchelstown and Mallow-Fermoy roads are in need of urgent investment and should have been included in the Transport 21 plan, I am disappointed that issue has not been addressed.</P>
        <P>I hope we can return to the broader debate on this issue because we all favour maximising investment in public transport and allowing people the opportunity to travel in the most environmentally friendly way possible.  While the billboards and the advertising signs throughout the country are aspirational and in some sense would remind one of the old signs one would have seen in the former Soviet Union and the eastern bloc advising how their countries were progressing so well, in reality, projects are not as progressive as those expensive signs would lead one to believe.</P>
        <P>I genuinely look forward to having a broader debate on this issue as opposed to the issue being the subject of a Private Members&rsquo; motion where one person says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the motion and the other person &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it.  We need to set aside a day to debate transport, which affects every family and individual.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing his time with me.  I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the issue of transport.  I agree with Senator Bradford that we should have more debates on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Government motion, to which an amendment has been tabled, begged amendment.  It is a one line statement: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann commends the Government on its commitment <Col N="923"/>to transport investment under Transport 21.&rdquo;  It is the Government&rsquo;s job to invest in transport and the mechanism to do that is Transport 21.  The motion is a little like commending the Government on Christmas or the Department of Transport on being that Department.  Such investment is a function of Government.  I am delighted to support the Fine Gael amendment, as proposed by my colleague, Senator Donohoe.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise a number of specific issues.  Previous speakers mentioned advertising.  I was in Cuba last year and Fidel would be very proud of some of the posters on the Transport 21 initiative.  I disagree with a point Senator Ellis made about rail freight.  I travel the road from Dublin to Waterford and Kilkenny several times each week.  I acknowledge that in parts of the country in which there are no railway lines or railway stations, rail freight is not a viable option.  However, on that route and on other inter-urban routes where there are existing railway networks, we should do more to encourage people to use those to get freight off the road because there has been a huge increase in traffic from that sector in recent years.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers mentioned overruns in time and money.  Much of what was promised under Transport 21 has been put back and many projects in my immediate area, including the Waterford bypass, are scheduled to run behind time.  Even the Carlow bypass, which was due to open this month, will not open even though it appears most of the work has been completed.  However, it would be churlish of me not to admit that much money has been invested.  There has been a great improvement in the road network.</P>
        <P>However, the town with the most appalling traffic is my local town of New Ross, County Wexford.  Unfortunately, it is not in my constituency.  The bypass for New Ross has been on the agenda since I was elected to the county council in 1999 and it was projected to be completed a couple of years ago.  Not only is it not complete, it has not commenced.  It is a major European route because it is the link between Rosslare Port and Cork.  The stretch of road between Rosslare and Waterford is included in Transport 21 and yet nothing is happening to that stretch of road.  It is a nightmare for people living on the Kilkenny side of the bridge in New Ross, County Wexford.</P>
        <P>I refer to what Senator Ross said.  The former Taoiseach, in one of his more famous contributions, said he was a socialist and that there were only two or three left.  Senator Martin Brady was reputed to be one of the three but Senator Ross is in danger of stealing that mantle because he made a very good suggestion that the Government should consider providing public transport free of charge for a trial period of six months or a year.  I deplore this notion by the Green Party and others, who have ideological hang-ups about public transport, that the way to get people to use public transport is to tax them out of their cars.  People driving cars are taxed enough already.  If we want to encourage people to use public transport, we must provide the service and the possibility of providing that service free of charge should be considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  I congratulate him on his new portfolio and know he will do a good job.  He was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and for housing and he did excellent work.  He is man who always has his feet on the ground and who never loses the run of himself.  I wish him well in his new position.</P>
        <P>I refer to what the previous speaker said.  I do not mind being called a socialist because I always believe a socialist should have the best for himself or herself but I have not achieved that yet.  Much progress has been made in regard Transport 21 in recent years, which we sometimes we forget.  As recently as 1990, we only had 26 km of motorway while a decade ago, we had fewer than 100 km.  The most pleasing development is that most of the road schemes are coming in ahead of schedule and under budget.  No one can accuse us of overruns anymore.</P><Col N="924"/>
        <P>Some 234 new buses have been purchased and 110 have been delivered.  I congratulate CIE, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the role they have played.  They have done a magnificent job.  In the area I represent, Donaghmede, one can get a bus or a DART every ten minutes.  If one wants to go to the Red Cow roundabout, one can be there in less than three quarters of an hour.  Much progress has been made.</P>
        <P>In the old days when I had to go to Cavan at weekends, one got a bus at 6.30 p.m. and if one missed it, one would not get another one until 12 p.m. the following day.  If one went out to Blanchardstown, which Senator O&rsquo;Toole will know, there were lines of people on the road thumbing lifts because some did not have sufficient money to pay their bus fares and they depended on the goodwill of people with cars to give them a lift.  If the bus broke down, which happened to me one frosty night, one could be up to two hours waiting for a recovery vehicle.  If one was unlucky enough not to have a nice person sitting beside one, it could be quite a boring wait.</P>
        <P>Thank God the same situation does not prevail on that route today.  One can get a bus on the hour, which is very convenient for Bus &Eacute;ireann customers.  One can get a return fare from Dublin to Cavan for approximately &euro;9, which is good value for money.  People often complain about the bus service but in some cases, one can get a bus on the half hour.  Much progress has been made in that regard.</P>
        <P>I refer to the new inter-city trains which have been purchased.  I have been on some of them and it is like being in a sitting room.  They are superb and they run on time.  Some people say the trains are overcrowded but trains in many countries are overcrowded.  I have been in France and in various other countries and trains there are overcrowded as well.  There will never be a situation in which a train or a bus will not be overcrowded at some point in the day.  We are sometimes too critical and want to get the bus the minute we arrive at the bus stop.  That is not a reasonable expectation.</P>
        <P>I refer to taxi and hackney services in rural areas.  In some parts of the country, it is very difficult to get a taxi and people run mini-cabs.  If one is travelling five miles, one might have to do a country run of approximately 30 miles to get to one&rsquo;s destination.  In other words, a ten-minute journey might take an hour.  Senator Ellis and others raised this issue.  We must consider the situation in rural areas where people have become prisoners in their own homes.  They cannot go out because they are afraid to drive if they have a drink.  People used to go to the local pub, including one I know called Lisgrey House which is close to my home place, to play cards and do Irish dancing.  That has all stopped.  One of the reasons is that it is so inconvenient to get transport to and from the pub.</P>
        <P>Parents in rural areas have become taxi operators.  They must pick up their children, leave them at parties, etc.  My sister-in-law spent an entire Sunday driving children around.  We need to seriously consider that issue.  I do not know what the solution is but we must come up with proposals and put in place the proper infrastructure.  If we do not do so, the fabric of society will be damaged and the social element of rural life will diminish.  That would not be good for society in general.</P>
        <P>We cannot ignore the major progress which has been made in regard to transport but there is more to come.  We are not stopping at this.  More progress will be made and we will keep everyone updated.</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Pearse Doherty.  I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new portfolio and hope it goes well for him.  It is a challenging role to play.  I would like to say a few positive and negative things.</P><Col N="925"/>
        <P>I support the positive moves mentioned by Senator Martin Brady.  There is no doubt the extra trains are welcome, as are the new roads being built within deadlines.  I also welcome the speed with which the approval was given recently for the Navan rail line as far as Dunboyne.  That is a vindication of the new urgent infrastructural legislation.</P>
        <P>Having discussed transport in the House in recent weeks, we should keep in mind that rail transport in Ireland is as good as rail transport anywhere in Europe, despite what many people think.  Rail travel here is cheaper than in most countries in Europe.  While rail travel may be cheaper in Spain and Italy, rail transport in Ireland is significantly cheaper than in the UK, France and most other European countries.  Recently I checked out the cost of rail travel in the UK and found that to travel on a same-day return ticket from King&rsquo;s Cross to York or Northampton, more or less the same distance as from Heuston to Tralee, would cost me &pound;200, whereas the return ticket for Tralee would have cost just &euro;35.  I would urge people to be aware of this when they promote privatisation.  It does not work well in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>I would like to inform the Minister of State of some of the faults with regard to our transport system.  I drive into work each morning on the N2, but I would like to be able to leave my car at home.  On the odd day I take the bus, it drops me outside the House or in Abbey Street and I am happy with that.  The problem, however, is that I cannot rely on the bus, the reason being that not enough buses are available and they often get caught in traffic.  I refer to the Bus &Eacute;ireann service rather than Dublin Bus.  The service is excellent when it works, but if it is not reliable, people cannot take the chance on it.</P>
        <P>A more serious matter is that there are no park and ride facilities available on any of the main routes into Dublin city, which is disgraceful.  There are no park and ride facilities where the N3 reaches Blanchardstown, the N2 reaches Finglas or the N1 reaches Swords.  There is plenty of space available around the M50 where park and ride facilities could be easily provided, but that will not be done.  Consequently, people park by the grace and favour of publicans in public house car parks for the day so that they can take the bus.  This will continue until such a time as publicans start charging them and the system falls apart.  Park and ride facilities are a simple solution so that people can park their cars and take the bus.</P>
        <P>Let us consider areas outside Dublin where nothing is happening to improve transport facilities.  Take for example the city of Limerick which is ideally located, structured and designed for a proper commuter service.  A train line comes from directly north of the city, from Ennis, into the city.  Another comes from the north-east, from Nenagh and another from the south-east, from Limerick Junction.  There is also a train line from west of the city, from Tarbert, into the city.  However, these lines do not work most of the time.  The authorities reluctantly agreed to upgrade the Ennis line.  Since that was done, usage quadrupled immediately, despite the fact there was no selling of the line or there were no intermediate stops.  I welcome the commitment of the Government on finally getting movement on the western rail corridor.</P>
        <P>Another project which would bring improvement in the area of transport would be to complete the outer ring road proposed by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He was right about the improvement that would be brought by the completion of a ring road from Drogheda, to Slane, Navan, Naas and perhaps right around into Wicklow.  This would not be a difficult project to complete as the roads and space are available.</P>
        <P>We have not made adequate progress on transport.  I support the Fine Gael amendment.  Despite the fact the Government has done some good in the transport area, it is a bit early in the day for it to begin congratulating itself.  There is a lot more to do.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Tuathail as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  I welcome the debate on Transport 21 and will focus comment on a number <Col N="926"/>of issues.  The Minister of State mentioned that Transport 21 deals with a legacy of neglect.  They may not have been his exact words, rather they are mine, but it deals with the lack of investment in previous years.  There is no doubt that Transport 21 makes a substantial investment in transport.  However, we are just playing catch-up for previous decades of under-investment in our transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Even with Transport 21, we do not seem to have a joined-up approach in terms of road infrastructure.  I could name a number of projects where Transport 21 commits either a 2+1 lane road or a dual carriageway, although we await clarification that 2+1 roads will never again be built in Ireland because they are bad value for money and not the safest roads for transport.  I believe they will be consigned to history, but that has not happened yet.  We have seen 2+1 roads built in recent years, for example, the Castleblayney bypass.</P>
        <P>In a debate on transport a number of months ago the Minister of State said the Government is committed to delivering a dual carriageway from Dublin to Derry.  I am aware that in the Northern end of that project where moneys have been invested, the Northern Ireland Regional Development Minister, Mr. Conor Murphy, has gripped the reins and the dual carriageway will be delivered within the estimated timeframe of 2015.  What is happening on the Southern end and why are we building a 2+1 lane around Castleblayney?  In some parts it is actually a single carriageway road around Castleblayney.  Why are we doing this if we will have to roll in the machines again and dig it up?</P>
        <P>The Atlantic road corridor is another example of what is happening.  Transport 21 commits either a 2+1 or a dual carriageway for the corridor.  I have no doubt but that it will be a dual carriageway if it ever happens.  Why did we spend tens of millions of euro on bypasses in Ballyshannon and Bundoran, which are not even 2+1 roads, if it will be necessary to rebuild those roads within the timeframe of Transport 21, which has committed to having the road completed within seven years as a built dual carriageway?  The Government appears to making up its strategy as it goes along.  That said, there has been significant investment in transport infrastructure, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>We need, however, to see balance in terms of where money is spent.  The west must be given some attention in this regard.  The recent study from the Western Development Commission shows that only 2% of commuters in the west travel to work by public transport.  Why is this the case?  It is because public transport does not exist in the west and investment in rail and buses has not been made.  With regard to Donegal, I asked the Minister for Transport, by means of parliamentary question, how much money was spent on public transport for Donegal over the past two years since Transport 21 was announced.  The response was that slightly in excess of &euro;500,000 was spent.  Considering the estimated &euro;3.2 billion spent on public transport in the State, this is disgraceful and demonstrates the neglect of the west.</P>
        <P>A major element missing from Transport 21 is the creation of an all-Ireland rail loop.  We should be able to get a train in Sligo and travel all the way to Derry, but the connection does not exist.  I raised the need to progress this matter with the Minister in the Chamber a few months ago.  I am glad to say that today at the North-South Ministerial Council the two most senior politicians dealing with transport on this island have come together.  I know that Mr. Conor Murphy, as Minister for Regional Development with responsibility for transport, has agreed to undertake a study to consider the long-term social, physical and economic redevelopment of railways throughout the north west.  When that study is completed, it will deal with the consideration of a study into improved public transport links within Donegal.  That is what is needed.  We need to see a clear commitment from our Government that it will support investment into rail from Sligo to Derry and allow Mr. Conor Murphy and his Department to assist us in bridging the link from Derry to Donegal.</P><Col N="927"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I am glad to see we have got movement on this.  The Minister has instructed the deputy Secretary General of his Department to meet senior officials within Donegal County Council who are promoting the redevelopment of rail transport into Donegal.  There is significant potential for this but we need to ensure there is balanced regional development.  The best way to do this is to ensure the infrastructure needed is in place.</P>
        <P>We must be aware that not everybody lives on the major inter-urban routes.  Many people live in rural areas where they have only local roads or secondary national roads.  We need investment in these roads also.  While significant investment is being made in Transport 21, I urge the Government to look on investment in our infrastructure as key to building a sustainable economy.  We should borrow, if necessary, to ensure this is delivered.  I do not believe Transport 21 meets the needs of the west and rural Ireland because there are major deficiencies in terms of the north west and rail transport.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, congratulate him on his new portfolio at the Department of Transport and wish him well in it.  I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on Transport 21 and ask the Minister of State about a number of issues.  I understand a number of new services will come on stream on the train routes from Castlebar, Westport and Ballina to Dublin late this year or early next year.  It has been pointed out to me that the new services will not go directly from Westport and Ballina to Dublin but will have to change in Athlone.  If that is the case the people travelling from Ballina will have to change at Manulla and Athlone.  While there will be extra services it will be a great inconvenience for the people from Ballina to have to change trains twice in a 150-mile route.  Some of them may be in wheelchairs.  Why should the people of Mayo have to change every time?  Why should the people of Galway not change on some of the occasions?  I suggest that some of those services from Westport via Athlone to Dublin be direct.  At the very least we expect some of the services to be direct to Dublin.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s newspaper we saw that this jurisdiction and the North are agreeing on the height of container transport in the country and it is obvious the Dublin Port tunnel does not comply and is too low.  We need an explanation on this.  If super trucks come on stream in the South, does this mean they will go through the city of Dublin?  At certain times and for much of the day the tunnel, which was built at huge cost, is empty.  The toll should be reduced at certain times of the day which would take much of the traffic during the day.  This should be examined.  Is it the sole prerogative of the National Roads Authority?  Who has the power to increase, decrease or remove a toll?  If it is the Government&rsquo;s decision, does it have to compensate National Toll Roads?  Who makes the decision?  It should be examined.  The tunnel was a huge cost to the taxpayer and should be used.</P>
        <P>We should examine freight transport.  We cannot have freight going straight to Dublin Port.  A number of companies in my area, for example, Baxter Healthcare and Coca-Cola, would use freight transport going to Dublin Port if it were possible, but it is not.</P>
        <P>No major roads project is under way in counties Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and there will be none in the next couple of years.  A number of major projects under Transport 21 have been pushed back.  When will those projects begin?  Examples include the completion of the N26 in Ballina, the N5 from Castlebar to Westport and on to Bohola.  Some of those projects have been planned for now but have been pushed back.  This is a huge area of the country where no major project is taking place with the exception of a piece of the Athlone to Ballinasloe road in south Roscommon.  This part of our country gets slim pickings in health services as we saw in the D&aacute;il last night and tonight and it is the same in road transport.  While a considerable number of projects are in the pipeline for this area, they have all been put on the back burner.  When does the Minister of State think the projects that have been pushed back will be brought forward?  My county of Mayo has the highest number of national secondary miles in the country and there are no projects in the pipeline.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for listening to our debate on the motion.  It is obvious from Senators across the House that everybody accepts that major progress has been made on infrastructure and public transport.  We all accept that and want to see it continue.  This motion shows the Government is committed to Transport 21.  Over the past month the Taoiseach, Minister and previous Taoiseach have made it clear that infrastructure will be a priority.  If we are to have the development that it is said can take place in our economy, it is imperative we have a proper road and rail network and that Dublin has the Luas extensions and the metro.  These are very important to Dublin.  The quality bus corridors and other developments under Transport 21 will lead to a much improved transport service that will be on a par with anything available anywhere else in the world.</P>
        <P>I compliment all the Ministers who have had responsibility for Transport 21.  Deputy Cullen launched it and Deputy Dempsey is responsible, along with Deputy Noel Ahern, for its implementation.  This House should continue to have regular debates on infrastructure and how it is being improved.  It is very important we continue to make the public aware of the progress that has been made on infrastructure and the progression of Transport 21.  It was seen as a major initiative by the Government and when completed it will benefit every citizen of this country in one way or another.</P>
        <P>It was mentioned that some areas may not be seen to benefit as much as others.  However, as I said earlier, in the part of the country I come from the benefits of Transport 21 can be seen in the road and rail infrastructure that has been improved no end, leading to people in the west and north west being able to access Dublin much more quickly than in the old days.  The motion should be commended to the House.</P>

      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the need for the Minister for Transport to ensure the metro construction works in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green cause minimal damage to the environment and the least possible inconvenience to the public.  While many of us welcome the commitment of the Government to the metro and the capital expenditure that will be used for this project, the proposal to take away a large proportion of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green is causing a great deal of concern to many citizens.  These are not just environmental concerns, but also disturbances that may be made to traffic in the area, to the pond and to other parts of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.</P>
        <P>I understand the station in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will be modelled on Grand Central Station in New York.  While there is a great intent to integrate different types of transport, the damage to the St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will be considerable for at least four years.  Up to 20% of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will taken out of action, as 20% of an area running from near the Royal College of Surgeons to Dawson Street will be removed from public access and will be a construction site for about four years.  This is a loss to the people of Dublin.  The Fusiliers&rsquo; Arch will be taken down bit by bit, which is a loss to tourism.  We need assurances from the Minister of State that it will be restored properly, and that damage to the environment in the interim will be minimal.</P>
        <P>All sorts of statistics are being bandied around the place.  The proposal to drain the pond will cause environmental damage and a great deal of upset.  The ducks will be removed, as will a great number of trees that will also have to be replaced.  St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will not be what it was after these works have been completed.  I understand this project must be carried out, but I ask the Government that it be done extremely sensitively.  There are proposals for at least 16 protrusions, some of them for air vents, and I ask that they also blend in with the environment of the area.</P>
        <P>There will be plenty of protests when this work starts.  The Minister of State and the Government know this.  When the work starts, people will say it is dreadful and the construction work and the obstruction it causes will become the issue.  The end project will be submerged in the problems incurred by this construction work.  However, those who are offended by it will have a very good case.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to reassure us that all the historic works, especially the Fusiliers&rsquo; Arch, will be preserved.  I ask that the environment &mdash; there are 8,000 trucks projected to go down Dawson Street &mdash; will be protected.  I gather that the drill and blast techniques to be used will cause a great amount of noise and air pollution, and I ask that it be minimalised.  The people of Dublin should look forward to some great infrastructure, but in the meantime they <Col N="930"/>should be protected by the Government from the worst effects of the construction that is going to take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the concern of the Senator, but it was discussed in this House on Committee Stage of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008.</P>
        <P>Transport 21 will transform our transport infrastructure.  In Dublin, the delivery of projects such as metro north, the interconnector, metro west and new Luas lines will provide an integrated network of rail services, which will bring significant benefits to the city and the region.  It will provide the infrastructure required for Dublin to become an even more vibrant city in which to live and work.  There is no doubt there will be problems while the construction work is taking place.  Metro north and the interconnector will be the spine of the new public transport system, which has integration as a fundamental planning principle.  Integrating these new rail lines with the existing Sandyford Luas line at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will allow the city centre to grow and become an even stronger focus for work and leisure than that which exists at present.</P>
        <P>It is important, however, that the delivery of these critical projects is managed in a manner which minimises the impact on the city centre.  It is in this context that the Minister recently met key stakeholders and agencies in the city to get an update on the major transport projects in Dublin, to identify the principal concerns of the business community and to review progress on traffic planning for the construction phase of these projects.  The Minister intends that this will be the first in a series of meetings, which he will hold on a regular basis over the coming years to this end.  There are concerns at these major works in the city but we do not want to send a negative message.  The message we want to send is that the city is still open and that businesses are open.  We do not want to frighten people away, we want them to shop in the city.  It is a question of facilitating businesses, shoppers and commuters.  We do not want people going to suburban shopping centres, from where they might not come back to shop in the city centre.  The message is that the city is open for business.</P>
        <P>Regarding St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, both larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, are working closely together in designing the station for both metro north and the interconnector.  They are doing this within constraints agreed with the Office of Public Works and in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Dublin City Council, and other key stakeholders.  Dublin City Council is developing a traffic management strategy to minimise the disruption caused to traffic from works at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the station at O&rsquo;Connell Bridge.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the sensitive heritage and environmental issues in this area, specialists including conservation architects, archaeologists, and arboriculturists are currently being taken on board by the RPA to advise on these significant matters.  A detailed landscaping plan to reinstate the park will be also agreed with the Office of Public Works.  Prior to any work being carried out detailed surveys, reports and photographic records will be commissioned as agreed with the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>Before undertaking any work in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green the RPA will require a railway order to be granted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The agency will set out in detail the mitigation measures it will take in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green during construction in the environmental impact statement required under the planning process.  The agency will fully restore the green on the completion of construction.  In addition, the National Monuments Acts requires the RPA to obtain the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for works on <Col N="931"/>the green.  There is therefore a twofold statutory protection of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green under both the railway order and the national monuments consent procedures.</P>
        <P>I am aware of concerns about the works to be undertaken in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  However, we must not lose sight of the benefits these works will bring to the city.  Substantial work has been undertaken by both the RPA and larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to minimise the impacts and to ensure we will not only retain the heritage and amenity of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green but also obtain the benefits of a high quality and integrated public transport system in the heart of the city.  It is one of the cornerstones of Transport 21 and will entail a colossal amount of work, but much detailed planning will go into it.</P>
        <P>There may not be space for all vehicles to use the area, which will be part of the traffic plan.  Whether one excludes cars, the priority is to facilitate business and commuters and encourage them onto busses.  This is linked to the matter we discussed earlier.  Much planning is taking place.  This was discussed in the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, where an amendment was tabled to allow work to take place under the Saint Stephen&rsquo;s Green (Dublin) Act 1877.  Whatever disruption takes place, it is planned to restore the green to its full glory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a ministerial guarantee that St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green will be restored to its former state?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be outlined in the environmental impact statement.</P>

The remit of the groups planning this is to put back everything the way it is now.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his reappointment.  </P>
        <P>I am pleased to raise the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the action the Government intends to take as a result of the information that has come to light that Irish consumers are paying up to 50% more than consumers in the United Kingdom for similar goods.  It seems ridiculous and unfair that an Irish consumer is expected to pay up to 50% more than a British consumer for a similar item sold in British owned stores based in this country.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say.  If there were to <Col N="932"/>be a noticeable discrepancy between the two prices, one would expect the increase in the value of the euro to result in cheaper goods imported from sterling areas to this country.  That has not happened.  Does the Minister of State have information on whether sufficient account has been taken of the increased value of the euro by the various stores?  It appears there has been a continuous rise in the cost of goods imported from the UK.  Can the Government, and does it intend to, take action to address this inequity, which appears to penalise Irish consumers?  Does current consumer protection afford enough protection from exploitation to the public?  What is the role of the National Consumer Agency in tackling this issue?  Has the Minister of State liaised with the National Consumer Agency on the issue?  What is the reaction of the Minister of State in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising this important topic. </P>
        <P>In examining the differential between the price of goods in Ireland and the price of similar goods in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, we need to separate two related aspects of the issue.  The first is the fact that prices here for a wide range of goods have been higher than those in the United Kingdom and other EU member states for a number of years.  A survey undertaken by the consumer strategy group in 2004 found that, even after adjustments to take account of different rates of VAT, a basket of internationally branded goods cost 22% more here than in the eurozone.</P>
        <P>The second aspect is the recent widening of the gap between the price of goods here and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland which has resulted from the failure of retailers to lower the price of goods imported from the UK in response to the sharp appreciation since November 2007 of the euro against sterling.  In 2007, &euro;1 was worth on average Stg&pound;0.68.  Yesterday, it was worth almost Stg&pound;0.80, representing a rise of more than 16% in the value of the euro against sterling.  The combined effect of these factors has been to bring about the situation referred to by Senator Fitzgerald whereby consumers in the Republic are in some cases paying up to 50% more for the same goods than their counterparts in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>Regardless of what arguments retailers make price differentials of this magnitude are unjustified and indefensible.  Though the focus of recent commentary has been on British-based retailers with operations here it is fair to say that there has been little or no sign that Irish-owned retailers have reduced the price of goods imported from Britain in response to the fall in the value of sterling.  The main argument put forward by retailers for the longstanding gap between the price of goods here and in Britain and elsewhere in the EU is the alleged higher cost of doing business in this country.  Ireland is not a low-cost economy but there are justifiable grounds for scepticism about the claim that higher prices here are attributable solely to higher costs.</P>
        <P>As the consumer strategy group pointed out, while we do not rank highest in the eurozone for many business costs, we do rank highest for many consumer prices.  The recent survey of prices in ten British retailers with stores in Ireland conducted by a national Sunday newspaper found that one retailer charged the same prices as in Britain while the mark-up on UK prices in other stores ranged from 20% to more than 50%.  The wide variation in this mark-up among stores with a broadly similar cost base suggests that the cost argument is far from being a complete or satisfactory explanation for the higher prices that Irish consumers are forced to pay.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>It is also fair to say that retailers have not to date been very forthcoming about the reasons for their failure to reflect the fall in the value of sterling in the price of goods sourced from the UK.  Reference has been made to the fact that products currently on sale may have been bought by the retailers prior to the appreciation of the euro or that retailers hedge, or forward buy, currency in order to protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations.  While these explanations may have some validity, they are now wearing increasingly thin given that the sustained rise of the euro against sterling commenced six months ago in mid-November 2007.  At the very least, there is an onus on retailers to provide fuller information about their forward purchases of products or currency.  While no one is asking retailers to disclose commercially sensitive information, we are entitled at this stage to be told more about how long such arrangements last, what proportion of products or currency exposure they cover and when consumers will finally see the benefit of the stronger euro in the prices they pay in the shops.</P>
        <P>We imported &euro;20 billion worth of goods from the United Kingdom in 2007, almost one-third of our total imports.  Our annual imports of foods and beverages from the UK are approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  A 16% rise in the value of the euro against sterling should, in the context of purchases of this scale from the UK, result in a significant benefit flowing to every household in the country as well as to the national economy.  The need to ensure that this benefit is fully passed on to Irish consumers is all the more important in view of the sharp rise in the price of foodstuffs in recent months.  Retailers cannot trumpet their commitment to lower prices and better value for consumers while failing to pass on the sizeable price reductions that should stem from the appreciation of the euro in recent months.</P>
        <P>The Government is in no doubt about the importance of this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment met this afternoon with the chief executive of the National Consumer Agency and a series of follow-up actions will result from this meeting.  We are not going to take any rash or ill-judged steps.  This is not a command economy where Government tell business enterprises what goods to sell or at what price to sell them.  However, we are entitled to assume that responsible business enterprises will deal fairly with consumers and will pass on in full gains resulting from currency movements and not seek to profit from them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his strong and forthright response to the issue raised.  The Minister of State said that Ireland is not a command economy and that customers should be dealt with fairly given the change in the euro.  What actions will follow from the meeting with the National Consumer Agency?  In what areas can the Government take action?  </P>
        <P>The Minister of State is effectively agreeing there has been a rip-off of consumers.  What action can the Government take in conjunction with the National Consumer Agency to try to change the situation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Deputy John McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not to wish to outline in detail what actions can be taken.  A range of issues and possible actions were discussed at the meeting today.  The National Consumer Agency will meet with Retail Ireland to discuss the issue further.  Arising from this, the T&aacute;naiste will set out a course of action to deal with some of the aspects raised. </P>
        <P>My background is in the retail sector.  There is an increased awareness on the part of consumers in regard to the cost of goods.  Some 17% of consumers recently surveyed indicated they are aware of what is happening and would change their shopping habits.  A further 18% of those surveyed are considering doing that.  There is a public awareness of the issue.  Consumers have a responsibility in this regard and they also have power.  They should be exercising <Col N="934"/>that power and ensuring they get value for money.  The Government can only do so much.  We need to look to the consumer to assist us in this.</P>

I know also that the T&aacute;naiste following her meeting today will also assist in doing whatever can be done.  There will be action in this area.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking the time to come to the House for this Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P>Following the publication of the first comprehensive assessment of the status of protected species and their habitats the Grim report detailed that many of these species are in danger.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, rightly plans to take serious action to protect these rare species.  He must be concerned about our environment and take appropriate action in this regard.  However, it is wrong to link blame for the desecration of our flora and fauna to rural people who have being cutting turf for their own use for generations and in so doing caring for and respecting our heritage.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State and the Cathaoirleach are from rural areas.  Cutting turf is part of the culture of every small town and village on this island.  Long summer days are spent saving and bringing home turf.  I am one of those lucky youngsters who spent many happy idyllic days in the bog jumping drains while the adults did the work.  Sentiment aside, rural people feel very aggrieved by the ending of the ten year derogation that allowed the continued cutting of turf for personal use.</P>
        <P>The scourge and threat to rare species of wildlife in the years of economic boom is the lack of Government investment in the required infrastructure to support the intense development of sewage systems.  According to the report habitats associated with water were considered to be in bad condition.  This does not surprise me and reinforces my point that the simple respectful cutting of turf by the local people who take only what they need is not to blame for the destruction of our flora and fauna.</P>
        <P>The people who have cut and used turf for generations, those who have preserved and saved our bogs, are now being punished.  Large-scale peat abstraction by developers has destroyed most of our bogs.  Some developers have exported millions of tonnes of peat to the EU.  Surely this is the reason the rare species are being destroyed.  Ordinary people feel disenfranchised by this Government and by EU law.  Worthy and worried people are unable to get a fair hearing or, indeed, representation of any sort.</P>
        <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment, as I did on the Order of Business yesterday, to get clarification for ordinary people, first, that they might have clarification concerning their fundamental right to continue to cut turf for their own use, by sle&aacute;n or otherwise, and second, to hear that turf cutting will continue and that the Government will honour the 2004 agreement negotiated and agreed with the farming pillar.</P><Col N="935"/>
        <P>I refer to fuel poverty and to the Energy Conservation Bill 2008.  I remind the Minister of State that many low income families in rural Ireland will be living in cold, damp homes because they rely on turf as their main source of fuel.  The practice of cutting turf for personal use is not to blame for the endangerment of rare species of flora and fauna.  The turf cutters of rural Ireland will not be railroaded and ignored, and they must be allowed to continue to exercise their turbary rights.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for raising this important issue.  I welcome the opportunity to clarify a number of issues regarding the future of turf cutting in Ireland and to confirm that turf cutting can continue as normal on most bogs.  It is only on the relatively small area of designated peatlands that cutting must cease to preserve what remains of our best bogland for future generations.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s raised bogs are of European importance.  Almost all of western Europe&rsquo;s bogs have disappeared or have been severely damaged.  Ireland has approximately 60% of the remaining uncut areas.  Here too, however, most areas of bog have been severely damaged, mainly by turf cutting but, in more recent times, by afforestation and overgrazing.  Less than 1% remains of Ireland&rsquo;s active raised bogs, bog on which the indigenous flora are still growing and forming peat.</P>
        <P>This bogland is a priority habitat under the EU habitats directive, and, in accordance with Articles 2 and 4 of the directive, must be protected and, where possible, restored.  Under the directive, Ireland nominated certain raised and blanket bogs which are priority natural habitats as candidate special areas of conservation, SACs.  Ireland also designated other raised and blanket bogs as natural heritage areas, NHAs, under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</P>
        <P>When arrangements were announced in 1999 for cessation of turf cutting on bogs designated for conservation, a ten-year derogation was granted to domestic turf cutters.  This period is now coming to an end on 32 designated raised bogs.  A similar ten-year derogation applies to bogs designated after 1999.  When NHAs were designated in 2004, under an agreement with the farming organisations, a similar ten-year derogation was put in place allowing cutting on NHAs until 2014.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, a review of the state of our bogs has revealed severe and continuing damage by domestic turf cutting.  In the ten years since commercial cutting was ended in designated areas, 35% of the remaining area of this priority EU habitat has been lost through domestic cutting.  Damage is continuing at a rate of 2% to 4% per annum.  The overall scientific assessment of this habitat is described as &ldquo;unfavourable&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, the worst of three standard categories applied at European level.  It is clear that we must now take measures to ensure improvement, and in the light of the scientific evidence, it would not be appropriate to extend the ten-year derogation.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, the Government has actively encouraged the cessation of domestic cutting by buying traditional turf cutting rights through a voluntary scheme of compensation.  This covers both SACs and NHAs.  It will be necessary, however, to bring forward proposals in the short term to ensure Ireland meets its obligations regarding the protection of at least a key portion of what remains of this important natural heritage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply although I am not happy with it.  There are two issues.  The priority of protection and of complying with the EU habitats directive is a separate issue in my opinion.  That is why I highlighted the issues of over-develop<Col N="936"/>ment and desecration of our peatlands by developers.  Sadly, the Minister of State did not address those issues which are the fundamental reasons our bogs are being damaged and the habitats along with them.</P>
        <P>While the Minister of State said that only a small number of bogs are affected, 32 bogs in a small country is a considerable number.  Since 1999, further bogs have been listed so this means essentially that all bogs are affected and according to what the Minister of State said, eventually all bogs will be included.  The people will not accept this and that is the bottom line.  I am very disappointed to hear the Minister of State say that the derogation will not be extended.  I believe this is wrong. The issue will not go away as people feel very strongly about it.</P>
