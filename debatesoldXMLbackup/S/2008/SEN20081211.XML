	<P Just="Left">I have notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement on any planned consolidation of national art galleries and the implications of such plans on the individual galleries.</P>

        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport to take the appropriate steps to recognise the remembrance day for victims of road traffic accidents.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re meeting of Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Friday, 12 December 2008; and No. 2, the Charities Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages.  It is proposed that No. 1 shall be taken without debate; and on No. 2, the business of the House is to be interrupted between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is in Brussels to hammer out a deal with his European counterparts today which, it appears, will almost certainly result in another referendum in this country in less than 12 months.  The Government failed to convince the people previously.  It is extremely important, if the Taoiseach gets the clarification in Brussels and if the concerns of the people are met, that we have a campaign that convinces the Irish people of the benefits of a treaty, with different and expanded explanations, and meets the concerns which were so clearly articulated.  We need to have clear guarantees and messages about a Commissioner and about the range of other social and worker rights issues that were of concern to the people.  We are aware, from research, of those concerns.  It is important that we have a campaign that convinces the people and that we see leadership on this issue at this critical point for our future in Europe.  That has been lacking to date.  I hope that we will see the leadership that is needed over the coming months.</P>
        <P>I welcome the deal that the Government has done with the food industry, with producers and processors.  I am concerned that the industry has been put into crisis unnecessarily, given the kind of information that is coming from the European Food Safety Authority today.  However, as I stated yesterday, I hope that the industry can recover quickly and that we will have the sort of international campaign that is necessary to save the industry.</P>
        <P>I wish to briefly return to the case of Pamela Izevbekhai, which has been raised in this House by Senator Leyden and others on a number of occasions.  Ms Izevbekhai has been granted leave to remain but I hope she will not be deported in the dead of night.  This House should agree an all-party motion that would help ensure she is not deported when her hearing is over.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of meetings were held with the Leader yesterday regarding No. 1 on the Order of Business.  He outlined the difficulties that had arisen for him in respect of last Friday, tomorrow and next Friday and we indicated our difficulties regarding the principle of the proposal.  We have managed to reach an honourable compromise or a Chinese bargain, whereby everybody is happy with the outcome.  We have conceded the proposal to deal with tomorrow&rsquo;s business but we will have an Order of Business next Friday.  We have agreed to the Leader&rsquo;s request that it be restricted and he has agreed to restrict his own response.  It is his view that this issue will not arise in the future.  I am glad this issue has been resolved</P>
        <P>It is time that we held a calm debate on the operations of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Issues arise on both sides in regard to topics and the length of the Order of Business.  It is important that we deal with issues pertaining to how we do our business.  I ask the Leader to arrange a half-day debate soon after our return from the Christmas break.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald on the Lisbon treaty.  It is a further example of the Oireachtas being left aside.  These issues should be discussed by both Houses today.  I would like a Minister &mdash; I do not care which one &mdash; to set out for us what the Government is washing through Europe, what it is bringing forward and the issues it wants addressed.  I want to know what is being sought in the areas of sovereignty, neutrality, taxation, conscription and the right to life. <Col N="1031"/> I ask the Leader to bring our comments to the attention of the Government.  It is welcome that the Government wants to take ownership of this issue but it also needs the participation of others, irrespective of whether they are for or against the treaty.  We need to show leadership by holding a debate in these Houses prior to Christmas.  Surely, whatever the Taoiseach discusses with European leaders today should be considered by political representatives in this country.</P>
        <P>I support the Government in its actions on the pork issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald correctly pointed out that questions have arisen as a result of the statement by the European Food Safety Authority.  However, even with the benefit of hindsight, I think the Government did the right thing.  It was necessary to act in the way it did to put us beyond suspicion.  While I think the market in Ireland will recover immediately, we will face difficulties abroad.  We will need to start eating sausages and ham for Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, wish to express my satisfaction with the resolution of our difficulties with the Order of Business on Fridays.  I thank the Leader for meeting us on the issue.</P>
        <P>I concur with what has been said on the Lisbon treaty and the involvement of this House.  We held a reasonably good debate on Tuesday but I note that some of my colleagues felt their contributions were curtailed towards the end.  I refer in particular to Senator Donohoe, who has made a significant input into this issue.  That was the agreed arrangement for the debate and I am not quibbling with it but I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the need to revisit the matter regularly.  Apparently a resolution will be considered by the summit of EU leaders over the next couple of days.  That resolution certainly should be debated in this House.  I call on the Leader to arrange a debate next week on the outcome of the summit because we need to ask whether the resolution answers the genuine concerns of the Irish people.  On a first reading, it appears to address all the areas of concern to people.  However, while it ticks the boxes of taxation, so-called ethical issues and neutrality, we need more detail on how it is proposed to address these issues.</P>
        <P>I raised the issue of workers&rsquo; rights with the Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs during Tuesday&rsquo;s debate.  I was surprised that he did not mention the issue in his statement given that it was near the top of the list of concerns of those who were surveyed in the aftermath of the referendum as to why they voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That is a central concern to many people.  I agreed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s assertion that the charter is a great achievement in that regard but many people are wondering whether the Government would produce the domestic legislation needed to implement it.  The Taoiseach will have to address that issue and not merely because he was asked to do so by the leader of SIPTU.  I remind those Senators who wonder about the relevance of this issue and whose eyes glaze over at the mention of the right to collective bargaining and trade union recognition that President-elect Obama is addressing the issue.  Robust legislation is planned in the United States, the citadel of capitalism, to allow for a genuine system of trade union recognition so that people can have their voices heard.  That is what people in this country are seeking.  The charter appears to provide for this goal but it needs to be addressed in this State in the context of our debate on Lisbon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a lot of talk about respect for those on the other side of the Lisbon debate but those of us who supported a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote also deserve respect.  We should not be told we are part of a conspiracy to push through a treaty without proper debate or to have our way by way of a second referendum.  This accusation was made by some contributors to Tuesday&rsquo;s <Col N="1032"/>debate.  All of us want a genuine and open debate.  Let us start that debate now with a campaign that lasts a year so that the issues can be properly addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will now call Members who did not get an opportunity to speak on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  The first of these is Senator Bacik.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the representation of women in politics.  It is appropriate that I renew my call this week given that we are celebrating the 90th anniversary of the first election in which women in Ireland had a vote.  It is also the anniversary of the election of Constance Markiewicz as the first woman Deputy or Member of Parliament.  It would be appropriate to hold a debate on this issue early in the new year.  I thank all my colleagues who participated in Tuesday&rsquo;s event, which was a wonderful celebration of women&rsquo;s achievement and the Oireachtas.  I also wish to express my gratitude to the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle for their support.  However, we should also note the low level of representation of women in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Only 13% of Deputies are women, although the Seanad has a better representation at almost 22%, or 13 women out of 60 Senators.  It would be appropriate, therefore, to hold this debate in the Seanad.  I acknowledge that the Leader has previously expressed support for this proposal.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate on education cutbacks and the effect they will have on the sort of activities we have seen this week in the schools which participated in the celebration of this important anniversary.  I spoke to a class of girls from St. Laurence O&rsquo;Toole girls&rsquo; national school on Sheriff Street in the north inner city, an area which has been in the headlines this week for all the wrong reasons.  It was wonderful to see the enormous spirit of contribution and public service that the teachers demonstrated in hosting a week of events to commemorate Constance Markiewicz&rsquo;s election.  They invited women politicians from all parties to address the students.  We were given an enthusiastic reception and asked great questions by the girls.  Teachers are often not given sufficient credit for this sort of extra-curricular activity.  Unfortunately, these activities will diminish if the cuts in education are implemented.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Fitzgerald in seeking a cross-party motion in support of Pamela Izevbekhai, who might be deported from Ireland.  I hope she and her daughters will be able to stay in Ireland and most of us, from both sides of the House, have expressed support for her personally.  It would be appropriate for us to have a cross-party motion of support for her in the Seanad and this would be a nice time to do it, given that we are commemorating this important anniversary for women this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>As with the other Members, I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Taoiseach on the way in which they dealt with the crisis over the past week.  They proved they would not stand idly by and probably went past what was necessary, but when dealing with people&rsquo;s food and health, one must err on the side of caution rather than take risks.</P>
        <P>The incident poses a question on the future of how our food is developed, which I indicated in the debate yesterday evening.  I ask the Leader to consider having a debate as soon as we return after Christmas on why primary producers are being forced to produce food at uneconomic prices.  The net result is what we saw last week.  There is an economic level in the production process.</P>
        <P>The margins being taken by some of the multinational retailers in this country are completely out of line with what is going to the primary producer.  Something must be done if we are to ensure we have people producing food.  We all know the biggest scare facing the world over the next ten years will be a food shortage.  This must be considered constructively rather than <Col N="1033"/>in the way it is being considered currently by the multinationals, who seem to have taken over the bulk of the retail trade in this country to the detriment of producers.  We have seen it happen in the UK and it is now spreading to here.</P>
        <P>On Tuesday&rsquo;s Order of Business I raised the question of roads being gritted around the country.  I compliment the Minister for Transport who wrote to all local authorities yesterday, instructing them that they had a responsibility to carry out this work as they are being funded for it by the NRA.  I appreciate the action taken by the Minister.  Is it possible, following the Christmas recess, to have a debate on the road infrastructure, its development and the need for continued investment in our national road and rail network to allow us emerge from the current economic recession in a better position with regard to infrastructure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I missed out on Senator Hanafin yesterday and I will call on him next.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Leader to make inquiries of the Standards in Public Office Commission in connection with the ongoing investigations of Libertas.  The last referendum on the Lisbon treaty was lost but there is still some outstanding business from it.  I have knowledge of fund-raising and know how difficult it is to bring in &euro;500,000 to fight a referendum.  This new group was able to spend &euro;1.3 million, or to take the lower figure it claims of &euro;800,000, including a &euro;200,000 loan that came to light only after the event.  This group has been looking for transparency from Brussels but once the question was raised by the Standards in Public Office Commission, a solicitor&rsquo;s letter was immediately sent to ensure no answers could be given.  It is a simple question of whether any outside money was sent to fight the campaign here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the source of that outside funding?  With the right-wing links that the group apparently has, we need to have this information.  It is incredible that the very people who are fighting the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign and looking for transparency are not now turning to Libertas to ask it to explain itself, as it is doing the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign no benefit by not explaining itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I also raise the issue of the inappropriate cartoon which appeared in the <i>Daily Mail</i> this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator reads it, that is what he will get.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not published in the Irish edition; it appeared only in England, which indicates the staff were not prepared to stand over the cartoon.  It is a relic from past times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When one looks back at those past times, they were totally inappropriate.   Should such newspapers have to declare their agendas?  The <i>Daily Mail </i>appears to have an agenda and one of the few redeeming factors of the newspaper is that Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen writes for it and gives some balance in that area.  Other than that, there is very little to redeem the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>.  It is a partisan paper and should perhaps be obliged to register as such.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1034"/>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Decisions will be made in the European Council in Brussels today which are outlined in the <i>The Irish Times</i> article by Jamie Smyth, the correspondent in Brussels, who refers to the draft conclusions of the European Council.  It sets out the date committed to by Government &mdash; a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty will be held before 31 October next year.  The article also outlines the assurances the Irish Government will receive on neutrality, social rights, ethical issues, taxation etc.</P>
        <P>We had the Minister of State responsible for European affairs in the House this week.  Mere days before the European Council meeting he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It would not be possible for me to describe in detail the shape of the agreement that might be reached at the end of this week.  In fact, I would venture to say no-one could.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He also stated, &ldquo;It is likely to take some months of very detailed discussion before we reach this point.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>That is misleading.  If the referendum on Lisbon II is to succeed, there must be co-operation between Government and Opposition parties in support of our place in Europe.  It seems the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, does not learn from his mistakes &mdash; on the first referendums on the Nice and Lisbon treaties &mdash; and he in going alone on this issue and not informing this or the Lower House of what was planned for this European Council meeting.</P>
        <P>The draft conclusions and, essentially, the negotiations on these issues which are reflected in the draft conclusions of the European Council, are prepared quite some time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point has been made and we cannot have a debate on it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is an important question for the Leader.  These were prepared quite some time before the meeting of the European Heads of State, as they do not go into that minutiae.  That is agreed before the European Council, and the Government has clearly agreed and given a commitment on these areas.  It has sought and got assurances.  I welcome the result but the Government is failing in not informing this House and the Oireachtas in general as to what it is doing on the Lisbon treaty.  A price will be paid for that when the Lisbon referendum process gets under way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the U-turn by the Leader in allowing debate on the Order of Business where there is an extension of sittings.  I make reference to the Bill put forward by Fine Gael regarding admissibility of evidence and the exclusion rule that applies, particularly in criminal law cases.  I know it is the practice of the Government to reject any Bill that comes from this side of the House.  The Labour Party put forward a Bill seeking to have a witness protection programme put on a statutory footing.  What is unique in this case is that the issue of dealing with this exclusionary rule was part of the programme for Government, yet it chose to reject the Bill.  In his statement, the Minister outlined why there is a need for change in the rule.</P>
        <P>I appreciate there are issues and concerns expressed from all sides of the House, which could have been addressed if the debate had been extended.  I have no friends in Government, but it is rather perverse that it seeks to reject out of hand further debate on an issue that is part of its own programme for Government.  Will the Leader comment on that?</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The outcome of the deliberations in Brussels on the pork industry is very welcome.  The Cathaoirleach will be glad to know the Rosderra plant in his home constituency of Edenderry will re-open within the next three hours.  The &euro;180 million rescue plan is very welcome indeed.  Decisive action by a decisive Government is welcome too.  I also wish to commend the work of the Green Party Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, in this regard. <Col N="1035"/> It is good to have the support of the Green Party, which has been a great help.  Following yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, I met with the Oireachtas restaurant manager, Mr. Don Rice, to discuss the matter.  I want to see the big breakfast on the menu tomorrow morning, including bacon, sausages and black and white pudding.  I want to see everybody there and I hope they will come.</P>

I know there are two sides to the story but there is black propaganda going on about her.  They are trying to undermine her case.  If she is deported now, after the publicity she has received here, her children will be in jeopardy in Nigeria.  That is a fact.  </P>

It is our responsibility now, so I ask the Leader to call on the Minister to act in the spirit of Christmas and as a gesture to the 60th anniversary of the UN universal declaration of human rights, which we marked yesterday.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already spoken extensively on the Lisbon treaty issue and I do not intend to rehash the arguments as it would be inappropriate to do so.  However, the reason I will oppose the second referendum is the inclusion for the first time in the architecture of the Union of the European armaments group, which is committed to the development of a massive munitions industry in Europe, centralised and for export.  If people wonder why Mr. Ganley is interested, they might look at his apparent links to the American military-industrial complex.  I was unaware of this before the matter arose.  Of course these manufacturers of bombs, tanks and war planes in the United States do not want us to go into competition with them.  I would have thought that was perfectly obvious.  A disengagement from the European defence agency could be secured by being included in the treaty incorporating Croatia, which would be legally binding.  </P>
        <P>Yesterday, I spoke to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the case of Ms Pamela Izevbekhai.  I was accompanied by Senator Leyden who initiated that meeting.  I have placed a motion about this matter on the Order Paper and some weeks ago I offered to substitute an agreed motion for the Leader.  I would be happy if this could be done, and I think it should be.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Government on acting quickly, effectively and decisively on the pigmeat issue.  Had it not done so, the critical Opposition voices would be slaughtering the Government for not acting appropriately.  I commend the Government on having done so.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, Senator Hannigan sought a debate on planning, which I strongly support.  We should examine planning issues.  One matter has been drawn to my attention concerning the Frawley site at 32-36, Thomas Street in central Dublin.  The developers of the site, which contains one of only five remaining twin Dutch Billy houses &mdash; an early 18th century architectural phenomenon &mdash; have been granted planning permission for a completely unsympathetic development.</P>
        <P>To return to Europe, I am delighted that the Government was robust there yesterday.  Its proposals on changing the question of freedom of movement were firmly rejected by the Union. The Government wanted to amend a key part of the directive that gives non-EU spouses of European citizens the right to live in Ireland.  What an extraordinarily inhumane attitude.  I am glad the Government was quashed on that.</P><Col N="1037"/>
        <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> reports that Ireland is one of 14 European states that restricts the rights of gay partners, so the Government is pretty inflexible in that regard.  Another article in that newspaper is the most regrettable item of all.</P>

	<P>I want to quote directly from the article and ask people to reflect on this as an appropriate Christmas message.  It states that &ldquo;the Vatican attacked an EU proposal for the UN formally to condemn discrimination against gay people&rdquo;.  So the Vatican is openly advocating discrimination and is frustrating attempts by the European Union to resolve situations of discrimination and condemn them.  The largest Christian church wants to discriminate against some of their fellow human beings.  What a Christmas message from the Vatican. </P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I note there is a proposal to make gift vouchers compulsorily valid for five years.  This follows concerns that such vouchers, which are offered as Christmas gifts, can expire if left unused.  The Leader should ask the relevant Minister to move with the same speed on party pills, which is an issue that Senator Wilson and I have raised in recent months.  Coming up to Christmas, party pills constitute a potential life and death matter.  It is as serious as the problem concerning pork products.  By March 2009, we must introduce a compulsory ban, so those steps should be taken now.  Following an Adjournment debate on this matter last week, there was an indication that such a move could be made by ministerial order or regulation, rather than by legislation.  Therefore, I ask the Leader to seek clarification on whether it is possible to do so before Christmas.  In that way party pills can be banned, thus averting a danger to young and old alike.</P>
        <P>I welcome the agreement on pork products that has been reached in recent hours.  Will the Leader ask the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to confirm that this will be an all-Ireland agreement?  The Minister and Minister of State should examine the all-Ireland dimension which is relevant for pig producers, processors and markets in Donegal and other Border counties.  Whatever success we may have achieved in this regard, we also want to have it on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
        <P>While supporting the resumption of consumers eating pork and bacon products, and following Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s request to examine how our days are structured, if we all eat a big breakfast, as Senator Leyden wants us to, will the Leader look at one or two options?  The Oireachtas gym is open from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m.  If, like yesterday, our sos is from 2.30 p.m. until 3.30 p.m., we will miss the opportunity to run off our big breakfasts.  Will the Leader ensure that the sos coincides with the gym&rsquo;s opening hours or that those hours are extended?  In that way we could have the benefit of the big breakfast with pork products while retaining the option of running it off afterwards.</P>

	<P>I welcome the agreement reached concerning the Order of Business on Fridays.  I support the comments of Senator Fitzgerald and others regarding the Lisbon treaty.  It is important that the Taoiseach and the Government bring their plans to both Houses.  The declarations or protocols on abortion, euthanasia, neutrality, military alliances and so on <Col N="1038"/>were more important than the Commissioner issue, but everyone has a view on that.  We look forward to the Leader&rsquo;s response to this issue.</P>
        <P>What is the Government prepared to do to bring about a level playing pitch between the North and the South, particularly in Border areas in terms of the VAT differential of 21.5% and 15%.  This large differential has saved consumers going to the North approximately 30%, notably in terms of clothes, groceries, alcohol and other goods.  These recessionary times are difficult, but we do not want to put more small businesses to the wall.  Given that they have been badly hit, what we are doing is unfair.  I urge the Leader to ask the Government to do something and I look forward to his response.  If the situation is allowed to continue, the people in question will be levelled.</P>

	<P>After 5 p.m. yesterday, the Revenue Commissioners published directions on their website regarding how companies should handle the 1% income surcharge after 1 January.  It is eight weeks since the budget&rsquo;s announcement  in that regard and only about two working weeks are left to implementation of that measure.  The instructions are directed at the payroll sections of software manufacturers.  As most companies use software to organise their payrolls, they have little time in which to put this into operation.  Is it possible for the Revenue Commissioners to consider the difficulties that will be created in this regard?</P>
        <P>I am concerned we have not held a debate on Ryanair&rsquo;s takeover bid for Aer Lingus.  While they are private companies, the State has a substantial stake in Aer Lingus.  I imagine that this matter has been debated by the Joint Committee on Transport, but I am not sure.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, many issues need to be debated here that we have not had an opportunity to debate.  Although we referred to Europe and other matters today, we should take the opportunity to debate matters such as that.  We all have views on whether the country would benefit more from a single large airline, whether it is called Ryanair or whatever, or from having greater competition.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday, the Government acted very well in regard to the pork issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, we held a short but good debate on that matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  Considerable harm has been done to our export market, although not to a great extent to our home market.  The majority of Irish people will have full confidence in the market.  Some 33% of our pork products are exported.  When I visited Brussels on Tuesday, it was clear that our pigmeat competitors would use every opportunity to ensure that we do not regain our business.</P>
        <P>Approximately 15 years ago, the Austrians experienced a significant problem in the form of de-icer used in wine and they have not recovered from that.  A couple of years ago, the Belgians faced the problem of dioxins in meat and they have not recovered either, so let us not relax.  We need to have a blitz on the marketplace and our customers, be they hoteliers, supermarkets, <Col N="1039"/>processors or consumers, because regaining our market will not be easy.  Let us take out all the stops.  It will not be enough for the Minister to convince someone in Europe.  Bord Bia is the appropriate body to deal with this, but it needs everyone&rsquo;s support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the European Food Safety Authority&rsquo;s endorsement of the quality of Irish meat produce, particularly pork and bacon.  I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s views.  Like him, I understand the importance of shelf space, particularly in our export markets, and the difficulties that we will encounter in trying to win back that space.  I have raised this matter with the Leader. While I appreciate that we all have lessons to learn from last weekend&rsquo;s recall, will the Leader determine what protocols are in place for a recall of product?  I congratulate everyone involved in putting the produce back on the market.  The work of the IFA president, Mr. Padraig Walshe, and the producers must be acknowledged.  Everyone has made an effort in this regard.</P>
        <P>Has the Leader made any progress regarding another matter that I raised with him?  Dublin city business houses are under pressure in that footfall has decreased, commercial rates have increased and so on.  What supports and options are under consideration to assist the Dublin city business associations and commercial entities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision to reintroduce pork.  As Senator Quinn stated, it is important that we show confidence not just in Ireland but abroad.  Therefore, the Government and Bord Bia have an obligation to market pork aggressively and to show leadership.</P>
        <P>It appears that three Ministers are fugitives from this Chamber.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on unemployment?  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been absent from any such debate in this House.  Given the record levels of unemployment, why has she not attended the House?  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, refused to attend this House following my request on a number of occasions to discuss the separation of Cork and Dublin airports.  Yesterday and today&rsquo;s newspapers carry reports to the effect that the Minister is to abandon that plan.  Why has he not attended the House?</P>
        <P>Eight weeks have passed since budget day.  The Minister for Education and Science presided over cuts in respect of the most vulnerable people.  Applied leaving certificate, Youthreach and learning support programmes are being cut. What does it tell us about the value the Government places on education when those who are in need of education and support are being deprived of them?  Why has the Minister for Education and Science not come before the House to answer questions from Senators on this side?</P>
        <P>The budget was introduced eight weeks ago and the three Ministers to whom I refer have failed to come before the House in the interim.  The Leader should be held personally accountable for their failure to appear in the Seanad.  The three issues to which I refer affect all sectors of society.  More importantly, however, that which relates to the workers at Cork Airport is of fundamental importance to the people of Cork and the economic well-being of the entire region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am particularly interested in the Lisbon treaty.  There is a need for an ongoing debate on this matter.  Last week we engaged in a worthwhile discussion on the recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union.  I welcome the way the Government is dealing with this matter in Europe.  We should not play politics to any great degree on this extremely serious issue and everyone should sing from the same hymn sheet in respect of it.  This matter is too important for people to split hairs and <Col N="1040"/>argue as to whether we should be informed, before or afterwards, with regard to what is happening.  The debate on this matter should remain on the agenda for the foreseeable future.  If we cannot discuss it next week, we should do so immediately after the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Another issue about which I am concerned is that relating to the reform of the planning legislation.  I requested a debate on this matter on many previous occasions and I suggest that it be placed on the agenda and taken during the next session.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I complimented Senator Bacik on her efforts regarding the 90th anniversary celebrations.  This morning, the Senator highlighted the fact that only 13% of Members of the D&aacute;il are women, while 22% of the those in the Seanad are women.  It is important we should discuss why there is such volatility in respect of these percentages.  If we engage in a debate on this matter, we may highlight issues relating to why women should want to become engaged in politics and why they cannot follow their ambitions in this regard.  Will the Leader make time available for a debate on this matter in the new year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, the credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s downgraded its risk assessment in respect of Irish banks.  The agency is particularly concerned with regard to economic conditions for small businesses and stated that, while our guarantee in respect of the banks addressed short-term liquidity problems in the Irish market, it failed to take account of long-term issues.  Will the Leader request that the Minister for Finance update the House on the current position in respect of the bank guarantee?</P>
        <P>On the pigmeat crisis, it is great that a resolution was arrived at in the early hours of this morning.  I wish to compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, on being so quick off the mark.  I understand he will be visiting France and Spain and spreading the good news that the crisis has been resolved.  There has been a great deal of negative press coverage in respect of this matter.  For example, certain UK newspapers indicated that Irish farmers had been feeding pigs with plastic bags.  Everyone will recall the stories relating to the Austrian wine scandal and difficulties with olive oil in Spain.  It is important to ensure that confidence in Irish meat products be restored.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the swift action he has taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>As the debate on the possibility of a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty gathers momentum, we must remind ourselves that the people decisively and overwhelmingly rejected the treaty in the previous referendum.  It is important to recall that we are not dealing with some form of eccentric fringe group.  Having listened to the debate on the treaty, the majority of the people made a decision.  The question of whether the debate was properly informed is a different issue.</P>
        <P>People have many concerns about this matter and we will be obliged to consider them.  One of these concerns relates to the high level of bureaucracy we have experienced as a result of our membership of the EU.  The bureaucracy to which I refer has not been spread evenly across the other member states.</P>
        <P>Other concerns such as those relating to conscription and similar issues also arose during the referendum campaign.  Those of us who canvassed on behalf of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote discovered that young people fear that at some point in the future their children would be conscripted into some form of European military alliance.  The position was similar in respect of pro-life issues.  Many people genuinely felt that Ireland&rsquo;s stance on abortion would not be protected under the Lisbon treaty.  There are other social issues about which, in the context of the treaty, people are concerned.</P><Col N="1041"/>
        <P>It would be wrong to believe that we must focus on persuading a small group.  We are dealing with the majority of the people and, in that context, we must be open and transparent with them.  The Government is approaching this matter in the correct way.  However, what we obtain in addition to the provisions of the treaty must be legally binding.  It will not be possible to consult the people again unless we can show that what we have to offer has a legal basis.</P>
        <P>I agree with the approach taken in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s Commissioner.  This is a major issue, particularly when one considers that we need representation in order to protect our national interests.  I urge caution in respect of this matter and suggest that people not fall into the trap of believing that we are dealing with a small group of people.  We are dealing with a majority of the population and we must convince these individuals that being at the heart of Europe is vital to our future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support previous speakers who expressed satisfaction at the progress made in respect of the Irish pork industry.  However, I concur with those who intimated that it is a case that the battle has been won but that the war is far from over.  We must focus our efforts on ensuring, not just domestically but internationally, that Irish meat can be returned to supermarket shelves as the greenest, cleanest, best quality food in Europe.  The Government, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Bord Bia will be obliged to do a great deal of work in respect of this matter.  It is important that the House, in the form of regular motions and debates, champion the cause of Irish food and highlight that it always will be the best quality food available on supermarket shelves worldwide.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Government appears to be in a position to make some degree of progress in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  Previous speakers referred to the issues that arose during the referendum campaign that took place in the summer.  However, Ireland and the world have changed in economic, social and political terms in the intervening period.  Six to 12 months ago, people harboured a great many concerns.  Now, however, our greatest concern must be for the state of the Irish economy and the position with regard to job creation, job losses and unemployment.</P>
        <P>We can argue, without fear of contradiction, that if this country is to survive, thrive and succeed in economic and social terms, it must remain at the very heart of Europe.  That is why it is important that a reasonable and rational debate takes place in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  Members of the House should state that the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty will be of fundamental importance in the context of the economy and all the people who live on this island.  We must champion that argument and not allow any sideshows or irrelevant views to cloud people&rsquo;s perspective.  The new debate on the Lisbon treaty must focus on Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe, the strength and growth of our economy and the creation of jobs for our young people.</P>

	<P>There are some 56,000 people on the social housing list.  The House engaged in a good debate on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Finneran, is particularly good at his job.  However, the bottom line appears to be the level of funding available for social housing.  During the past year, the public-private partnership model has not worked.  Clear outlines must be put in place with regard to how we intend to house people.  In view of the number of houses being repossessed, I am seriously concerned about the poor unfortunate people who are on the housing list.  We must address the scandal whereby 9,000 houses have been boarded up.  Will <Col N="1042"/>the Leader, who is familiar with the position in this regard in Westmeath, indicate where we stand in respect of this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I concur with my colleagues in calling for a debate on the Lisbon treaty, on which I would like to make two points.  There is an obligation on people when speaking about the Lisbon treaty and its impact on Ireland to be open and honest in respect of its implications.  I am not suggesting Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was being anything less than honest in his contribution but we need to be clear that the high levels of bureaucracy from Europe result from decisions made in Ireland.  Domestic politicians decide how European law is to be implemented and they are responsible for our experience of Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Regan touched on the following issue, on which I have strong views.  On Tuesday, the Minister with responsibility for European affairs stated he could not tell us the content of the negotiating plan or agreement being sought from our European colleagues.

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Ellis, Regan, Norris, Coghlan, Quinn, Callely, Ormonde, Hannigan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Bradford and Donohoe expressed serious concern in respect of a second Lisbon referendum.  We should wish well the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs at the summit this week, which is an important, and possibly one of the most crucial, meetings since before 1973.  Ireland is facing a serious challenge.  As Senator Bradford stated, we are and want to remain at the heart of Europe.  It is the place where our nation has shown its mettle during the past 30 years in terms of what we can do and achieve when given an even chance.  I wish the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs well.  I assure Members that at the earliest possible opportunity if at all possible I will arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to return to this House to update us on the outcome of the summit.</P>
        <P>I join Members in welcoming the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the Government and Irish pig processing sector.  The pigmeat industry, which is worth &euro;1.1 billion to the Exchequer and employs 6,500 people, is of great importance to our economy.  As <Col N="1043"/>Senators Ellis and Carty stated yesterday in the House, agriculture was our number one industry before 1973 and for many years after that.  At a time of economic downturn and global recession it is probably the one industry on which we can continue to rely in terms of keeping our economy going.  It is currently the foundation and bedrock of our economy.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, who, along with the Ministers of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent and Deputy Mary Wallace, have been exemplary in conducting the affairs of our nation.</P>
        <P>The objective of Government and everyone in the nation, from the time the test results were confirmed last Saturday, has been to protect public health, restore consumer confidence and return the sector to full capacity.  This happened within four days.  The decision taken on Saturday to recall Irish pork and bacon produce was the correct decision.  It was the only responsible course of action open to Government.  I agree with its decision in that regard.</P>
        <P>I look forward to us playing our part in promoting once again our Irish produce.  I agree that Bord Bia in this regard will require an increase in its marketing budget.  We have an opportunity to market our produce throughout Europe through the medium of Sky television which broadcasts to many European countries.  Those of us who have visited Spain and Portugal will have seen broadcast on television there the same advertisements as are shown in many areas of the UK and Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White informed the House that the leaders met yesterday and that tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business is as outlined.  On Friday week, 30 minutes will be allowed for the Order of Business, with the Leader having a further five minutes to respond.  The Minister will then commence business at 10.35 a.m.  I thank the leaders for their co-operation in ensuring business on Friday mornings &mdash; which may only happen four or five times during the year &mdash; commences at 10.35 a.m.  I thank the leaders for their help and assistance in trying to ensure the House is more productive.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, I have no difficulty in allocating time following the Christmas recess to listen to the views and proposals of all Senators following which, if any changes are necessary in terms of Members&rsquo; needs and the people we represent, the matters can be discussed by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  I have an open mind on this matter and, under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, we can discuss what can be done to ensure this House is more relevant in terms of its proceedings.</P>
        <P>TG4 broadcasts the proceedings of the D&aacute;il on Thursday mornings.  If the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and Members believe the proceedings in respect of the Order of Business could be changed in such a manner as to make it more efficient, as is the case in other parliaments where each Member has only one minute to put his or her question, we could, perhaps, seek to have TG4 broadcast one hour of the proceedings of the Seanad, perhaps 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. or 11.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. on Thursdays.

	<P>Some 50 years ago the late great Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was Minister for Education and at that time class sizes, on average, were 47.  We have come a long way since then in reducing class sizes to 27 today.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis welcomed the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s intervention to notify all county and city managers of the need to grit the roads, particularly those in the midlands that were seriously affected by weather conditions during the past four or five days.  The condition of the roads there made it extremely difficult for motorists, with 5 mph being the speed at which they could travel.  I had experience of that on some mornings this week.  I thank the Minister for his intervention in this respect.  The Senator also called for debate on transport and infrastructure, for which I have no difficulty in setting aside time.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin requested that inquiries be made of the Standards in Public Office Commission in regard to its work, particularly on whether any funding from outside the State was <Col N="1045"/>made available to Libertas to fight its campaign in the referendum.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Standards in Public Office Commission after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the publication of articles in newspapers that are not in good taste for their readers and do not show respect for the people of Ireland.  I share his view on that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan spoke about his Bill that failed to pass Second Stage in the House last night when it was defeated by 33 votes to 12.  The Minister pointed out here last night, and I was present when he spoke, that while he welcomed the Bill, there were aspects of it that were flawed.  The principle underpinning it was welcomed in general by all Members, but in its current form, it could not have been accepted and neither was it.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik, Leyden and Norris expressed serious concerns about the welfare of Ms Pamela Izevbekhai and her children.  I have made known my views concerning them to the House.  I hope that please God everything will work out okay for them.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney raised the issue &mdash; she included Senator Wilson in her remarks as he has previously raised it &mdash; of the ban on party pills that is to be introduced by March and called for the Minister responsible to ensure this is done, if possible, prior to Christmas.  We would all support the Senator&rsquo;s call for that to happen.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the VAT differential between the North and South.   I believe the Senator was incorrect in the differential rate he gave, the VAT differential is<?oasys _jy ?>6.5%, given that the rate is 15% in the North and 21.5% here</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is 21.5% here as against 15% in the North, which is a difference of 6.5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The higher VAT rate here is a disadvantage but, as I have heard people say, people must take account of the time it takes to travel to the North and the cost of getting there.  In the interests of everybody, we all hope that people, whether they shop North or South, will buy Irish.  That is what I encourage them to do.  At this Christmas time we all want to keep jobs at home on the island of Ireland, North or South.  We have been looking forward to the day that the North and South would prosper and together our people would achieve their goals and see a future generation with a better standard of  living and better opportunities than the current or previous one.</P>

        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on community policing and the county policing boards that are currently being set up, which I have no difficulty accommodating.  It is timely for the Senator to have called for this issue to be discussed in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn correctly made known his views on the announcement by the Revenue Commissioners of instructions for companies on the management of the 1% levy.  They have to ensure the compatibility of software to facilitate this change and industries are also facing various challenges.  The Senator&rsquo;s proposal that the Revenue extend to companies some time to accommodate this change is worthwhile.  The time allowed for this change to be made is tight as Christmas draws near and having regard to the ten-day closure of companies that usually takes place over Christmas every year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator called for a debate on Ryanair&rsquo;s takeover bid of Aer Lingus.  I must say I was very impressed with Mr. Dermot Mannion&rsquo;s interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday morn<Col N="1046"/>ing.  Of course, we are also very impressed by the achievements of my good friend, Michael O&rsquo;Leary.  As I have often said, he has done more for tourism in Ireland than any other person I know in overcoming the challenges to reduce air travel to such an affordable level.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time after the Christmas recess for hearing the views of Members on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised again the issue of the supports that will be put in place by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to support Dublin city traders, particularly at this difficult time when commercial rates have increased and increases in various charges are being levied on them.  This makes it extremely more difficult for these traders, not least with parking costing &euro;3 per hour in the city centre.  I agree with the Senator and will pass on his views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on unemployment.  I have already given a commitment to have a debate on unemployment and on the IDA and I have no difficulty in arranging for such a debate to take place.</P>
        <P>The Senator also called for the Minister for Transport to come to the House to update us on the separation of the three major airports, Cork, Dublin and Shannon.  I saw the newspaper article to which the Senator referred, but this change will not take place for at least three years.</P>

	<P>Senator Hannigan expressed concern regarding the banks facilitating the small and medium sized enterprises.  The ten day period during which the banks were to inform the Minister for Finance in this respect will be up on Friday.  The businesses of one of two colleagues have been under serious threat during the past 24 hours.  I am pleased to inform the House that the banks have been forthcoming in understanding and facilitating businesses.  It is good to hear such is the case from the SMEs.  The priority in this period of economic downturn is that the banks and the Government must back the SMEs to the fullest possible extent.  I look forward to this taking place.</P>

	<P>Some of the amendments are welcome but there is an astonishing number of them.  Will the Minister of State provide an explanation for why no less than 65 of the 80 amendments, that is, well in excess of 70% or three quarters of them, are Government amendments?  I accept it is the function of the House to amend but it is astonishing that 65 amendments out of 80 are Government amendments given that the Bill was already before the Houses and lapsed prior to the previous general election and there has been plenty of time to consider it.  Since there is such a plethora of amendments, it encourages one to hope the debate we had earlier will lead the Minister of State to address the most significant omissions.  I will continue to press the human rights amendment with strong support from academic and other organisations involved, especially given that it is so close to international Human Rights Day.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris is correct that there are a number of Government amendments.  Report and Final Stages of the Bill were concluded in the D&aacute;il recently.  I am anxious that before the Bill is finalised it would be reviewed by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I think that is an appropriate exercise.  Accordingly, some amendments are drafting ones for the sake of clarity.  I have no problem accepting suitable amendments.  The amendments have been introduced on purely technical and drafting grounds in recognition of previous amendments and to tidy up the Bill in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I introduced an amendment that excluded certain educational organisations from particular provisions of the Bill.  Having reflected further on the matter and following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, I table these two amendments today to have the following effect.  Having consulted the Department of Education and Science, I am adding third level educational fund-raising foundations to the definition of education body.  In the amendment I introduced last week, <i>inter alia</i>, I exempted education bodies from the requirement to keep books of accounts under section 47.  On further consideration, having taken advice on the matter, I believe it is essential that the financial position of a charity should be verifiable at any given time and in this regard I am removing the previous exemption under section 47.  It is not unreasonable to expect an organisation to maintain financial records, especially where it enjoys an exemption from having to file a statement of accounts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a welcome amendment.  I have had an opportunity to work, for example, with vocational education committees and they provide a very good service.  I note the wording of the final part of the amendment, &ldquo;a body established solely for the purpose of funding not more than one such institution of higher education&rdquo;.  A number of bodies, especially VECs, receive central funding, in other words, funding from citizens.  They are not necessarily just voluntary contributions.  They receive also voluntary contributions through their charitable status and the public is entitled to an account for those.  We have had a number of recent scandals that were rather surprising and regrettable.  They occurred in institutions that the majority of people in this country respect, admire, and which many have used.  The same is true of VECs.  This is a question of accountability and I welcome it.  The Minister of State has done a good job by introducing these paired amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the amendment.  By removing the exemption, one removes also a question mark over a particular body.  In any case, such a body would keep proper accounts, and it is vital it would do so.  Educational bodies should have the same status as any other charity in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendment.  This is a welcome removal.  I hope it will augment the work already being done in the keeping of accounts.  However, it is important we do not place an unnecessary burden on educational establishments in particular in respect to audited accounts.  I am concerned we may be allowing a level of carelessness to creep in here. <Col N="1050"/> The amendment is welcome.  In revoking reference to education we are making a positive statement.  There is a growth of educational trusts in the third level area and fund-raising is an important part of the primary and second level education sectors.</P>

        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) an approved body of persons within the meaning of section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997,&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to reinsert the provision excluding an approved body of persons within the meaning of section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which was removed last week on Committee Stage.  The Bill seeks to retain the <i>status quo</i> as regards charitable purposes.  Sport is not regarded as a charitable purpose.  Therefore bodies of persons under section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 cannot become charitable organisations.  I do not believe that considering the inclusion of sporting bodies as charities on the principled basis that a particular advantage might accrue to them under the taxation system is a sound approach.  Revenue will still retain the absolute right to make its own determination on eligibility for tax exemptions for any body on or not on the register of charities.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Opposition amendments before the House on this matter as they are directly contrary to the intent of the Bill and they also involve amendments to tax law, which is not within my remit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Minister of State intends to reverse the excellent decision we took in this House last week.  I commend the House on its support of the amendments we tabled.  There is broad consensus on the Bill.  The Minister of State has support across the board for the main rubrics of the Bill.  I cannot comprehend why the Government has introduced amendments that do not allow for the advancement of sport or the promotion of human rights.  We need to address the concerns of many sporting organisations and of the umbrella organisation, the Federation of Irish Sports.  The Government amendment does not address those concerns.</P>
        <P>I appeal to Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and his colleagues to recognise the importance of sport and the importance of the promotion of human rights as a positive benefit to the advancement of communities.  I appeal also to the Minister of State not to reverse the decision of last week.  The purpose of the previous amendment was to broaden the scope of the definition of charitable purpose outlined in the legislation.  As it stands, the purpose and the goals of some worthwhile organisations that contribute great benefits to the community are not recognised in the section of the Bill outlining charitable purposes.</P>
      
        <P>I thank the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials for their briefing.  They have been very upfront and honourable and I pay tribute to them.  However, I do not see the logic of the restrictions the Minister of State is putting in place.  He has not convinced me, nor has he convinced other Senators.</P><Col N="1051"/>
        <P>At this eleventh hour, the scope of the definition should be broadened to ensure sports organisations qualify automatically under the definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;.  There can be no doubt that sports organisations contribute greatly to communities.  They benefit them and people prosper.  If one considers the society in which we live, one will note that a young boy is before the courts this morning.  There is, therefore, a gaping hole in the Government&rsquo;s policy for providing sports, community and recreational facilities.  Sports clubs and organisations are filling that void.  Government policy should be to deliver what is required to tackle problems associated with health, education and all other sectors of society.  This side of the House will oppose amendment No. 4.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is true the majority of sports organisations would qualify under the definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; based on the criteria outlined in that they are of benefit to the community.  However, it makes no sense to refer to their purpose within the relevant section of the Bill to ensure there is no ambiguity involved.  I am at pains to understand why the definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; should not be broadened, especially given that sports organisations have contributed to communities&rsquo; well-being.  The Government talks about the promotion of health but the most important vehicle for doing so is sport.  It promotes social inclusion and enhances the community spirit among all strata of society.  Sport transcends gender and all age groups.  Surely the legislation should reflect sport&rsquo;s charitable contribution to society.  We will oppose the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt the decision Senator Buttimer referred to last week has certainly become part of the folklore of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It will probably be debated and discussed for a long time to come.  We will not make any progress in that regard this morning and we will deal, therefore, with the actual amendments before us.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer is quite right that sport is vital to the well-being of a community.  Of this there is no doubt.  &ldquo;Sport&rdquo; is a very broad term and many of us realise that it is very much a commercial business.  I sometimes regret this because I am often very dissatisfied that, if a team at a certain level does not do well, we call for the head of the manager straight away.  This is a side to sport that unfortunately has come to the fore.  There is also pressure put on those who represent us in the Olympic Games.</P>
        <P>At Oireachtas committees, I have often stated there is much to be said for the old-fashioned approach to sport, which involves doing one&rsquo;s very best, for the honour of the little village if that is what one is representing.  I genuinely hope we will return to this approach because I have seen people who have been made absolute wrecks as a result of the pressure put on them by the media and others.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has made it quite clear that a tax law has an implication in respect of these amendments.  That is ultimately a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  If there is a tax law implication and we proceed along the lines proposed, we will have to revisit the legislation.  The Minster of State said from day one that it was not a matter of expanding out of all recognition what is already in place regarding charities but that it was a matter of copperfastening the legislation already in place.  Organisations with charitable status will continue to have such status under the new regulatory authority.  We all welcome this because it immediately does away with a whole line of applicants.  It also takes the pressure off the many existing charities in terms of their having to comply with whatever is necessary in the application process.</P>
        <P>The advice the Minister of State has given on tax law implications is important.  It would be wrong of us to detract and distract from existing charities by including large commercial bodies as if they, too, were charities.</P>

	<P>I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister of State is not taking on board the amendment that was considered in the House last week.  Amendment No. 9, which concerns the advancement of sport, was suggested by the Federation of Irish Sports, which represents 60 different sports organisations.  The amendment seeks to ensure that bodies whose primary purpose is the advancement of sport will be included in the legislation.</P>
        <P>Last week we had a very full debate on this issue and I do not want to rehash the same arguments.  Suffice it to say the amendment was supported by Members on the other side of the House.  Independent Members, such as Senator Mullen, voted in favour of it, the Green Party decided not to oppose it and Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted in favour of it.  I am a little disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il will not take it on board.  The opinion of the House was clear and, if the amendment is pressed, I will vote in favour of it again today.</P>

	<P>I agree with much of what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said.  The amateur element in sport is very important.  When sport becomes a business, it loses many of its values, which, tragically, has happened in the United States.</P>
        <P>I remember saying quite a number of years ago in the Houses of the Oireachtas that I used to watch wrestling from Manchester with Kent Walton.</P>

	<P>Big Daddy, Giant Haystacks and the wonderful Mick McManus, who was a savage in the ring but who collected Ming porcelain.  He could be very delicate in his aesthetic appreciation.  The interesting thing about wrestling then was that it was fun, theatre and sport.  Then it moved to the World Wrestling Federation and it became utterly unscrupulous.  The values were different and it was a matter of winning at all costs by cheating, smashing and using outlawed weaponry, the very values that led the United States, tragically, into the Gulf War.</P>
        <P>Whatever about the Battle of Waterloo being won on the playing fields of Eton, I believe a moral is to be learned from sport.  We certainly learned one during the Special Olympics World Games.  When one participant fell, that person&rsquo;s colleagues, instead of saying, &ldquo;Great, this is my opportunity, I will really rub their nose in it.&rdquo;, actually went back to help the fallen participant and all crossed the line together.  Everyone felt this was heartening.  I therefore agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the amateur element in sport.</P>
        <P>I do not agree, however, that the proposed provision will facilitate just, or even principally, the large organisations such as the IRFU and the GAA.  These organisations already receive enormous sums of money and seem to be able to tap into any fund.  One need only consider the dispersal of lottery funding.  The IRFU and the GAA receive enormous and disproportionate sums of lottery funding.  The bodies being excluded from benefit by the legislation are the very amateur bodies about which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is so passionate.  They are the ones that will suffer because one can only obtain tax relief on money spent on capital projects.  One cannot claim tax back for hiring boxing instructors or coaches of various kinds.  These are very necessary, particularly for the amateur groups.</P>
        <P>On the business of copperfastening, to which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred, the Minister of State made the point that the legislation is really a tidying up exercise and that it is intended to confirm the <i>status quo</i>.  Confirming the <i>status quo</i> is not terribly adventurous government.  If it was a question of copperfastening and tidying up, a better job could have been done.</P>

      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I asked my initial question about the number of amendments.  I accept that many of these amendments may well strengthen the Bill.  This is not the first time the Bill has made the rounds because it was proposed before the last election so there was that period to look at it.  There was the period between the two Administrations and the period when the Bill was being prepared before it was presented to this House, yet 75% of the amendments are Government amendments. </P>
        <P>That leads me to the Minister of State&rsquo;s argument that it is all about technical difficulties with tax.  It is an argument I can understand, that in order for this amendment to be sustained, it would necessitate changes in tax law, which is not under the remit of the Minister of State, but rather that of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  That should have been explored with the Minister for Finance and the appropriate assurances should have been given by the two Departments.</P>
        <P>It is very welcome that this House is absolutely pulsating at present with young blood, in the corridors and in the Public Gallery.  While I am not inviting our guests to make a contribution, I wonder what they think of a Government that is turning its face against allowing sport to be considered, particularly the type of amateur sport that many of them may be engaged in, and preventing that from being recognised as a legitimate charitable purpose.  I would not like to shock them too much, but I reveal at this point that later we will be looking at the question of excluding human rights.  What a celebration of Human Rights Day, which was yesterday.</P>
        <P>We very often look to our United Kingdom colleagues for models of legislation.  Very often this is a form of legislative laziness.  We just take down the UK Bill and stick it in here with a few harps and things around it to make it Irish.  However, in the Northern Ireland legislation, this matter is addressed.  The proposed definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo;, to be found in clause 2 of the Northern Ireland Bill follows closely the broad definition of the English Charities Act 2006, with new references included to the advancement of amateur sport.  That, I believe, addresses all the matters raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and should assuage his doubts because it clearly points in the direction of amateur sport.  If they can do it 90 miles up the road, I do not see why we cannot do so, particularly given that we are so anxious to have a united Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I notice that every day we are widening the gap in legislation between the two jurisdictions in Ireland.  I wonder when I hear people talking about boycotting Newry whether they are committed to a Thirty-two County Ireland.  It does not sound to me like an all-Ireland republic, unless they propose to isolate Newry as some type of curious principality, such as Andorra or, indeed, that oddest of all states, the Vatican.  I am sorry, but I could not resist the dig.</P>

	<P>I will not spend time on this matter.  We debated it last week and we are debating it again today.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed very well his interest in and concerns about it.  We are talking about amateur and recreational sports.  Senator Norris pointed out very well that north of the Border, in the United Kingdom, they have found a formula that enables us to do this.  We are also talking about the tax implications in this area.  There is an enormous need to solve this problem so that sport can be regarded as a charity.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending in the National Concert Hall the return home of the Down&rsquo;s syndrome team from Portugal.  This is a beautiful group of people &mdash; 15, I believe &mdash; and they came fifth in the world.  They were ahead of the United States and I believe Australia won.  It was great to see the joy and the benefit that sport can bring, in that case to Down&rsquo;s syndrome people.</P>
        <P>I also met Katie Taylor yesterday, who won the world boxing championship in China last week, a very bright young woman from Bray.  Developments such as hers come initially from amateur and recreational sport, and that is what we are hoping to achieve and succeed in.  I <Col N="1054"/>hope the Minister of State will reconsider what we are talking about here.  Baron de Coubertin, when he started the Olympic Games, said it was not the winning that mattered but the taking part.  It is the taking part that we should encourage because we see the benefits of that in so many areas, and nowhere more than in the Special Olympics, which were held in Ireland in 2003.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this amendment.  The attention paid to it last week was such that there is an understanding of what is involved.  There may be tax implications that can be solved through the Finance Bill, but on the basis that this is worthy of consideration, I urge the Minister of State to reconsider his stance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators.  I want to put on record that I appreciate and acknowledge the role that sport plays in society.  I have known that from long before I entered politics and I have certainly seen it in practice.  To be fair, the Government recognises it, too, in its support for sporting agencies and bodies throughout the country.  If one looks at sporting facilities, they have advanced radically throughout the country in the past ten or 15 years.  When I played sports, virtually every time we went to a football match, we changed at the side of the field.  That was common practice and it is very rare to see now.  It is indicative of how things have changed. </P>
        <P>As regards this legislation, it is primarily to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and define what bodies get charitable status.  Sporting bodies are not regarded as charities and the whole emphasis is to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  The argument has been put forward time and again that they should be recognised from a tax viewpoint.  The legislation we are introducing is quite specific in that regard in that the Revenue Commissioners will be absolutely independent in their judgments.  Therefore, we will not be advancing sport from a tax viewpoint by including it in this legislation.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, bodies would be subjected to a considerable amount of additional regulatory scrutiny and would have reporting requirements, but they would not have the benefits the Senators are asking for.  By not being included in the legislation they are not precluded from lobbying and entering into negotiations with Revenue in any event.  They would not be entitled to an automatic change in their revenue status by being included in the legislation, and that was the fundamental reason sporting bodies wanted to be included.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer said there was a gaping hole in terms of Government policy.  The Government very definitely and positively supports sport, but to include sporting bodies here would bring about a fundamental change when the whole purpose of the legislation is to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  In that regard I am pressing amendment No. 4.</P>

	<P>One of my basic aims in respect of this legislation is to make charities secure against takeover or against being undermined or misused by criminal or terrorist groups.   It is vital this does not happen.  Members may remember that during my opening remarks on Committee Stage last week, I signalled that I was examining the references to terrorism in the Bill.  In this regard, I have consulted the Office of the Attorney General in respect of a possible concern that the existing wording in the Bill relating to terrorism might be interpreted as referring only to terrorism in this jurisdiction.  While my advice is that the existing wording applies to terrorism in any jurisdiction, I am introducing an amendment for the avoidance of doubt in this regard.  I thank Members for their input on this matter.</P>

        <P FLI="0">While the Labour Party tabled this amendment on Committee Stage, it withdrew it because there also was a reference to cults.  I have resubmitted it to state &ldquo;This Act applies to humanism as it applies to religion.&rdquo;  The Minister of State will be aware that the US Supreme Court has recognised that humanism is a religion for the purposes of the religious charitable exemption there.  Consequently, this exemption is in line with what has been done elsewhere.  The Humanist Association of Ireland met the Taoiseach and other Ministers to discuss humanism in Ireland and at the time its representatives were assured there would be parity of esteem between humanists and religious groups.  This is the first opportunity for the Government to deliver on that commitment and, unfortunately, by excluding humanism, it has flunked it.  It has not met the commitment it gave to the Humanist Association of Ireland.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this new amendment and I hope he will see fit to include it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>While Members have rehearsed this issue on a previous Stage of the Bill, I wish to introduce a new element.  I received a very brilliant paper by Dr. Oonagh B. Breen of the school of law at University College Dublin, Belfield, in which she comments on the manner in which this matter is addressed in Northern Ireland legislation.  My eyesight is not great and I am prepared to be corrected by the Minister of State, but I have looked without success for a definition of religion in the Bill.  The Minister should inform me whether it contains such a definition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an extraordinary omission that the Minister of State should consider because practically everything else has been defined, down to the hairpins.  For example, it defines &ldquo;church&rdquo; as the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church, albeit not, I am glad to say, exclusively, as there is permission for other churches to survive.  However, there is no definition of religion although there are definitions of all kinds of other matters.  If one is <Col N="1057"/>dealing with religion and if one intends to exclude humanism, the least one should do is to provide a definition of religion.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State, as a good sportsman, can take an amendment on the hop as he would a ball, but to be helpful, the Northern Ireland Bill provides for a statutory definition of religion that includes express references to faiths that do not profess belief in a god, as well as to polytheistic religions.  This statutory definition, which was first seen in the English Charities Act 2006, is cognisant of the multicultural make-up of Northern Irish society.  This recognition of religious difference goes beyond the law in Ireland, where the definition of religion remains a matter of common law interpretation based primarily on belief in, and worship of, a supreme being.  The proposed statutory definition in Northern Ireland should facilitate the registration of nontheistic organisations, including, for example, humanist, Confucian and even Buddhist organisations as religious charities if they otherwise satisfy the public benefit test in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>While I am unsure whether it is possible to take this on board, this Bill deals with a matter in which religion is central to at least one section.  However, no definition has been provided.  I do not make this point with an intention to carp or to water down the beliefs of any particular church.  I am a regular churchgoer, but I do not approve of the current practice whereby everyone, when reciting the Nicene Creed, is obliged to say &ldquo;We believe&rdquo;.  I know what I believe but I have not the slightest idea of what the people in the next pew believe and I will not say anything on their behalf.  Their religious views and values probably alter in respect of the state of their digestion, the time of day and so on.  Moreover, there are certain things I simply do not say.  As I do not believe in the resurrection of the body, I will not say it.  I am happy to believe in the resurrection of the dead.</P>
        <P>Members should try to provide a definition of religion and, in its absence, they must go in the direction of Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s amendment.  I am neither a humanist nor an atheist, but people of very high ethical standards who promote values such as this should be afforded a space within Ireland&rsquo;s charities legislation.</P>

	<P>The growth of humanism needs to be looked at in the context of the Bill.  We have not included a definition of religion, which, I suppose, is an omission that perhaps should be looked at.</P>
        <P>In the context of where we are at in this Bill, we need to recognise the importance of people who, as Senator Norris stated, are of high ethical standards and who do promote values.  Therefore, we would not have any difficulty with the amendment before us.  However, I would like to hear a definition of humanism.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I could certainly do with a make-over.  I am very much inclined to support Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s amendment.  I like the look of it.  It proceeds from a generosity of spirit in including groups who have ethical values in our society.  The way it is worded, that it would apply to humanism as it applies to religion, does not proceed from any intention to water down religion or the value society places on religion.</P>
        <P>It might be worth saying at this point that what Senator Norris is proposing would not pass constitutional muster.  We are in a different constitutional set-up south of the Border.  It is interesting to note that Article 44 of the Constitution, for example, pledges the State specifically to acknowledge the importance of &ldquo;the homage ... due to Almighty God.&rdquo;  It is not often reflected on, but the State is not neutral on the issue of religion.  The Constitution values the religious experience very highly.  It refers in explicit terms to the value of acknowledging the role of religious faith in society.  However, that need not necessarily have negative implications for people who do not have religious faith.  That is why I say I would be inclined to support what Senator Hannigan has proposed.</P>
        <P>I would not go with the approach of the US Supreme Court which would try, as I think Senator Norris is suggesting in the Northern Irish context, to lump in humanism as a form of religion.  That would be to deprive what I like to call authentic religion of its unique and positive character in society.</P>
        <P>In the spirit of the new era, which I hope we are approaching, which is one where we take a generous approach to the different convictions of others and also to the absence of conviction on the part of certain people on the meaning of life or the origin of our existence and, indeed, our ultimate destiny as persons, it is good that there are people in society who, while not professing religious faith, express a desire to be associated with strong ethical values that are communitarian in nature.</P>
        <P>I certainly hear that from time to time from people who do not share my faith or any religious faith.  I have come across it recently, for example, on the pro-life issue in the context of my Stem-Cell Research (Protection of Human Embryos) Bill where several people told me they did not really share what they thought were my religious convictions but they were with me on the issue covered by the legislation.  I do not wish to single out that issue unduly.  There may well be other humanists who would not be with me on that but who would none the less walk the road in terms of a vision of society that is inclusive, communitarian, etc.</P>
        <P>For that reason, it would be good if we were to find a way to include the aspirations of groups who come together, do not profess religious faith but, like religious faith communities, none the less seek to advance values in our society which, as I have stated, are communitarian and promote altruistic behaviour, if one wants to call it that, in various ways.</P>
        <P>It surprises me that one point on which I agree with Senator Norris, and on which he is absolutely right, is &ldquo;We believe&rdquo;, because in Latin it is &ldquo;Credo&rdquo;, in the first person singular.  That is probably the more correct approach to take in the Profession of Faith.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

	<P>We could have an animated discussion on religion but my better judgment tells me to stay clear of the theological minefield presented by Senator Norris.  Perhaps some other day we can have a full debate on that.</P>
        <P>I must admit I am fairly ignorant about humanism.  I always thought it was an antidote to religion.  Perhaps that is misinformed in its own way.</P>

        <P>Religion in many ways is community and in other ways it is individual.  We need to be very careful when it is community and when it is individual.  I will focus on individual for the moment.  There is a slight danger here &mdash; I do not attribute this to anyone who has promoted the idea here or elsewhere &mdash; that often when someone wants to become part of someone else&rsquo;s party, so to speak, it is intended to distract or dilute from that.  I would be a little worried that to put humanism in the same context as religious is precisely what it could do.  In fairness, it is not prescriptive enough when it comes to legislation.  I do not know what will be the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to it, but my first reaction is that it is not the category for humanism.</P>

	<P>As Senators will be aware, the Charities Bill 2007 provides that the advancement of religion shall have a charitable purpose with a rebuttable provision to deal with those organisations whose religious credentials are doubtful or whose methods are suspect.  The Bill does not attempt to define religion, nor would it be wise to do so as religion has a much wider context than merely charity law.  The other principal charitable purposes such as poverty and education have similarly not been defined in the Bill.  It will be a matter then for the charities regulatory authority to determine, in a case-by-case basis utilising common law and precedent as well as its own expertise, whether an applicant body has a charitable purpose and serves a public benefit.  In addition, it will be open to all applicants for charitable status to appeal decisions to the authority, to the charity appeals board and, in turn, to the High Court.  In that regard, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) the promotion of human rights,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This relates to the promotion of human rights.  It is a slightly different wording than that of my party&rsquo;s amendment last week.  This would give the same definition that is included in other jurisdictions such as England and Wales where, in both cases, the protection and promotion of human rights is included within their Acts.  That is all we seek to do.  We are concerned the consequences of excluding them mean some organisations may lose their charitable status because of some of the sections in the Act.  We encourage the Minister of State to include the amendment in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have indicated that I very much regret this Government clearly has committed itself to a policy that is deeply antagonistic to the entire area of human rights.  There cannot be any doubt about that.  I know from speaking to my Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party colleagues that Members on the opposite side of the House have equally little doubt about the matter.  I commend the Green Party and Deputy Cuffe in particular, for bravely standing up to oppose the Government&rsquo;s swingeing attacks on human rights.  This Bill comprises a small part of an attack being made across all Departments.  This is a shameful campaign and it renders valueless the speeches made by Government Members on human rights day.</P>
        <P>I will not rehearse the comments I made earlier but will, if the House permits me, quote from a learned paper by Dr. Oonagh Breen because it is important to flesh out the political views of people such as me with the opinion of somebody with an extensive academic acquaintance of this area.  Dr. Breen states: &ldquo;No reasons have been publicly offered for the subsequent deletion of the advancement of human rights from the published Bill.&rdquo;  This comes on foot of the fact that the initial consultation paper on charity law reform did not originally include human rights in the proposed list of charitable purposes but the public&rsquo;s disagreement with this policy decision led the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs to remedy this omission in its 2006 general scheme of the bill with express reference to the charitable nature of the advancement of human rights.  Human rights were specifically removed, therefore.  Nobody can tell me that is not sinister.  Dr. Breen continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Minister of State for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, although promising to return to the issue at report stage, declined to speculate on the possibility ultimately making the list other than to say the matter was being considered by the relevant departments and the Attorney General.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I want the Minister of State to specifically state whether he has received advice from the Attorney General on this issue and, if so, whether it was negative and what it contained.  Is this a political decision rather than one with a firm legal basis?</P>
        <P>Dr. Breen states:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is trite but true to say that the issue will turn upon politics or, at least, a conception of what is &ldquo;political&rdquo; and whether political acts, even if not for political purposes, should qualify as charitable.  In the absence of an express charitable purpose in favour of human rights, human rights organisations may find no natural home for themselves in the statute other than the broad heading of organisations supportive of &ldquo;political causes&rdquo;.  From a legal perspective, given the existence of so many human rights organisations that pursue charitable purposes, this default labelling &mdash; or even the potential for such default classification &mdash; is <Col N="1061"/>an altogether insufficient categorisation of the promotion of human rights in the context of charity law.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These comments do not come from the alliance of charities, which could be said to have an axe to grind.  This is the dispassionate view of a professional whose legal expertise has been brought to bear on the problem.  Dr. Breen further states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The problem with s. 2, as it stands, is twofold.  First, it offers no insight into what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;political cause&rdquo; that, if found to be a body&rsquo;s principal object, results in its non-eligibility for charitable status.  Ultimately, human rights organisations stand to lose the most from this.  There is no direct judicial authority on the meaning or scope of the phrase &ldquo;political cause&rdquo; to assist the regulator in applying this concept.  In a non-charity context, the High Court has interpreted the phrase &ldquo;political end&rdquo;, drawing upon English charity case law in its exegesis, but it is unclear whether the terms are synonymous.  If promotion of human rights is ultimately excluded from the statutory list of charitable purposes (putting the Irish definition at odds with that of its neighbours, all of which expressly recognise the charitable status of human rights bodies), organisations in this field would be well advised to set out their objects as precisely as possible in the governing instrument, relating them back to the other established heads of charity and demonstrating the non-political ways in which human rights will be promoted.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">A second problem with s. 2 relates to its limits.  As discussed above, s. 2 is concerned solely with the purposes for which an organisation is established.  It is silent on the extent to which legitimate charities may employ political means to achieve their ends.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I apologise for quoting more extensively than I normally do.  I usually speak off the cuff rather than refer to documents but these points are so convincing and irrefutable from an independent and dispassionate perspective that if the Government refuses to address them, it will be clear that the Bill represents another attack on human rights.  Particularly due to its actions over the past year, this hypocritical Government has the worst human rights record of any I can recall in my 21 years in this House.  It is mounting a sustained attack on the Combat Poverty Agency, the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  They are irritants but that is the reason they should be supported.  Otherwise, we might as well abolish the Opposition, pestilent Independent Members and turbulent priests of a non-Roman Catholic variety.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I received correspondence from FLAC, Amnesty, Front Line and ICCL which referred to a report by the Charities Commission for England and Wales entitled Charities Working in the Field of Human Rights.  This report points out that human rights charities are more likely to have complaints made against them because of the high profile of their work.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Broadly speaking we found that these charities&rsquo; performance and governance arrangements were in line with other charities.  We did, though, find evidence of more complaints about their work than other types of charities.  This is perhaps unsurprising given the generally high profile and contentious nature of the fields in which they work.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">With human rights consistently under the media spotlight, and the recent recognition of the promotion of human rights as a description of a charitable purpose in its own right in the Charities Act 2006, we hope this short overview illustrates some of the diverse ways charities seek to promote and safeguard human rights...</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Human rights are seen as fundamental to the healthy functioning of society and respect for human rights is generally seen as a moral imperative.  In [Britain], the implementation in 2000 of the Human Rights Act 1998 reinforces the legal imperative.</P><Col N="1062"/>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In 2002, the Government&rsquo;s Strategy Unit report Private Action, Public Benefit recommended the inclusion, in the proposed new Charities Act, of the promotion of human rights as a charitable purpose in its own right.  Its reasoning was that this would<i> &ldquo;allow charities to play their full part in the vital tasks of protecting human rights both in the UK and overseas</i>&rdquo; In the same year, the Charity Commission recognised the promotion of human rights as a charitable purpose in its own right . . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Our findings were that human rights charities are broadly very similar to other charities on the Register in terms of their structure and governance.  They have very similar concerns and issues to other types of charity.  However, in some areas, while the concerns are similar, they are magnified for human rights charities.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0">That is an unanswerable case and the Minister of State will commit an act of moral cowardice if he evades it.  All the charities have made this case.  Why are they being spurned?  I understand that independent reports submitted to the Government on this area made similar recommendations.  It will be a black day for this House and for the Minister of State if he refuses, even at this late stage, to include human rights as part of the definition.  It puts into context the public statements yesterday from members of the Government parties.  I honour the Green Party and its representatives for taking a strong line on this issue and I urge them to continue to do so.</P>

	<P>Why are we in the current position if the social conscience of the Government is Senator Boyle and his cabal?</P>
        <P>All this week we are, rightly, celebrating the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Today in Ireland we are restricting the inclusion of the promotion of human rights in consensus-oriented legislation for no apparent reason.  Senator Norris is right in that we have received extensive consultation with human rights organisations, all of which are united in their views.</P>
        <P>We have not heard a cogent explanation as to why this measure is being rejected, especially when it was contained in the original heads of the Bill.  Why has it been removed?  There is a need to look at the model in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where the legislation Senator Norris read to the House has been effectively introduced.  Why can it not be introduced here and what is the issue?  What are we afraid of?</P>
        <P>The concept of this amendment is to promote human rights.  Yesterday, Amnesty International published a document outlining ten actions for every Deputy and Senator.  If we are to be serious about the advancement and promotion of human rights, the amendments put forward by us on this side of the House should be accepted.  Unfortunately, the Government has ignored, in every step of the legislative process so far, attempts to include them and that is regrettable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not go back over the debate we had last week on Committee Stage.  The joint correspondence we got from Amnesty International, FLAC, the ICCL and Front Line asks a number of questions which should be answered by the Minister of State today.  Is it purely about tax and revenue in the Department of Finance?  Perhaps in his reply the Minister of State will address some of the concerns of the organisations, the representatives of which I know the Minister of State has spoken to.  We must get an answer.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that we will again divide the House today on important legislation dealing with the promotion and advancement of human rights when we have not had a cogent message from Government as to why it has acted in such a way and the thinking behind this exclusion from the Bill.  The Minister of State may indicate there is a five-year review but why not start today and include the bodies, as I argued last week?  If the Department finds the practice is not working in five years, it could be reviewed then.  Why are they being excluded today?  We have not had answers from Government and we need them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I attended an event hosted by Amnesty International to mark the 60th anniversary of the publication of the agreement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  I spoke candidly at that event, probably too candidly, but I would like to use the opportunity of Report Stage to repeat much of what I said there because I stand by it.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why the original reference to human rights in the scheme of the Bill has been removed.  I do not agree with that, although I am involved in a Government process that obliges me to accept it because it has gone through Government procedures.  I already stated in my speech on Second Stage that I believe this is good legislation which is flawed as a result of that omission.  This has not come about through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As a result of general Government processes, concerns have been raised, not specifically political concerns, in other Departments.</P>
        <P>There is a view that human rights in their widest aspect are not considered with unanimity as they should be.  Human rights exist in different contexts as there are civic and political human rights, on which there is a broad degree of consensus.  These include democratic principles and the involvement of people in civic life.  There are other human rights, such as social and economic, which engender ongoing political debate.</P><Col N="1064"/>
        <P>As far as I and my party are concerned, these are also inalienable human rights, and seeking to afford those rights is part of the democratic role of any citizen.  No political process should stand aside, whether informed by administrators or elective political representatives, from seeking that such rights be attained.</P>
        <P>If the Minister is not prepared to address the issue, the existing operations under a human rights banner could find themselves with spurious and political challenges for existing or being seen to affect charitable operations in their status.  One of the major bodies in the form of Amnesty International has special tax status only because of a particular Irish solution to the Irish problem of failing to recognise human rights in the widest sense.  A former Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, chose to grant the body that status in a Finance Bill.  We should no longer have such machinations.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not have the validity of well recognised organisations being questioned and uncertainty over their future because of a Bill that is 90% excellent in what it proposes to achieve.  The Bill aimed to achieve that at its inception, when it was presented as a scheme by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The fact that it cannot do so now means that either spurious challenges will be made against these organisations or bodies will be formed that will have their validity questioned in future.  There will be a need for future legislation to amend this prior to the review mentioned in this legislation.  I am stating that while acknowledging that I will be voting for the Government and against the amendments.  The least the Minister can do is bring out regulations, at the earliest opportunity, to define and protect the role of organisations that currently find themselves in this position.  The regulations should also define how other organisations, that may come into being under similar circumstances, can be afforded similar protection.  If our legislation is not complete, we could find ourselves in difficulties in future because the valuable work of well recognised and publicly accepted organisations is being challenged by someone who disagrees with them politically.  The political system should not adopt that approach.</P>
        <P>I reluctantly accept that because unelected influences may have had an effect on the Bill and they have been given a weight that is disproportionate to what their individual concerns should be, it will result in a Bill that is missing an important element.  How does the Minister of State intend to allay the concerns that will remain until the legislation is eventually completed under the five-year review or, hopefully, though amending legislation?  We may feel obliged to propose such amendments because others have been successful in arguing against the issue.</P>
        <P>Coalition Government is about give and take, and winning and losing arguments.  The most important argument that has been won concerning this Bill, given what was absent from the original draft legislation, is the issue of advocacy.  Advocacy is essential in civic society, including all voluntary and charitable organisations, in order to hold a mirror up to the type of society in which we live.  The fact that advocacy is now very much part of the Bill will allay some of the ongoing concerns about human rights organisations.  It is more important to have a Bill that recognises the charitable intent and purpose of organisations, whatever their historical background.  In that way we can hold up a mirror to reflect society and force Governments and the political system generally to account for that.  The inclusion of advocacy in the Bill makes it somewhat easier for me to support it, but it will not totally allay my unhappiness that there is a lacuna in the legislation that will eventually have to be filled.</P>

	<P>On Second Stage we all had an opportunity to express our views on human rights issues.  I put my position on the record at that time because I felt uncomfort<Col N="1065"/>able.  I must also put on the record that Senator Norris in particular has been one of the foremost advocates for human rights in this House.  On many occasions, particularly on the Order of Business, I have been on the same wavelength as him.  There is no doubt but that the organisations which have been mentioned here have done exemplary work.  At times, many of us have felt particularly comfortable that such organisations exist, including Amnesty International in particular.  On many occasions throughout the world, it has been necessary for Amnesty to put its head above the parapet.  When it comes to what we might almost regard as state violence and terrorism, we are lucky to have Amnesty International&rsquo;s reports.  The organisation has suffered for its views.  It has gone into areas to investigate state terrorism, thus putting the lives of its representatives on the line.  For that reason, in the debate on Second Stage, we all expressed our feelings and emotions on that issue.  </P>
        <P>It is important to send a message to those organisations that their work should be acknowledged with the stand they have taken.  Obviously, I do not agree with Senator Norris when he says we have the worst record on human rights.  I do not know whether he meant in Europe or in the world generally.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>When opportunities arise, we often ask the Government to take an independent stand.  Just because one is a member of a particular forum, whether it is the European Union or the United Nations, one does not have to toe the line completely.  We saw that during the invasion of Iraq.  I can still recall watching that invasion on television as if we were watching a movie, forgetting that people on the receiving end of that indiscriminate bombing were being killed in their thousands.  From day one, I made the point on the Order of Business that, first, I did not accept that the invasion of Iraq was justified because certain countries went against the will and procedure of the United Nations and, second, there was absolutely no respect whatsoever for human life.  We were able to see the embedded journalists in Iraq telling us what suited the powers that be, but we were never told about the suffering of men, women and children.  The number of people who have been indiscriminately killed has run into hundreds of thousands. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>We have also seen what some of the major powers did in laying their mines in countries they invaded.  When they withdraw, however, they leave the mines and it is left to private organisations and spirited people to engage in clearing them.  We also saw what mines do to people, not just killing them but also maiming them by blowing off limbs and destroying their lives.  There is so much of that going on that an independent voice is needed.  </P>
        <P>Ireland was the only Government in Europe that took an individual stand against the invasion of the Malvinas or the Falklands war.  People said we would suffer for doing so but we did not and, subsequently, our stature improved because we were prepared to stand up.  We were not prepared to accept the soccer lingo concerning what they did to the Belgrano.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It was totally against all the existing conventions on war.  We should bear in mind that there are thousands of examples where we must stand up.  On the other hand, while it may not be the strongest argument, I do not contribute to the notion that the organisations I have mentioned are the only custodians of human rights.  I would regard that as a weakness in the protection of human rights, which are a matter for each individual and every organisation also.  I am a member of several organisations for which human rights are high on the agenda.  For that reason, I am making the case for the charities listed in this Bill.</P>
        <P>I have always been a supporter of Amnesty International and contribute fairly generously each year.  I was unhappy, however, with the position taken by Amnesty on abortion.</P>

	<P>The work done by these organisations has been mentioned, therefore we are entitled to put the other side of the argument.  I do not agree with the position taken by Amnesty International on abortion.  If one supports human rights, one must support them in all forms, including for the born and the unborn.  We cannot genuinely say that Amnesty should have taken that position. </P>

	<P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Obviously I will be voting with the Government.  I have stated what position individual organisations should take on human rights.  If there is a further discussion, we might also respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on human rights.  Our human rights aspirations should be reflected in legislation.  In recent months, organisations that promote human rights in Ireland have been attacked.  This is clear from the reduced funding and budgetary changes in respect of the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, which falls under the Good Friday Agreement, the Equality Authority and the abandonment of the Combat Poverty Agency.  Given that people experiencing poverty is a human rights issue, any body that voices the concerns of the most vulnerable is a human rights organisation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Green Party&rsquo;s comments, but Senator Boyle&rsquo;s view of coalition government is questionable, given his support for the Bill and despite his statement to the effect that it is empty of an important element.  Would a coalition partner not want to express its values?  The Senator has spoken strongly on the value of human rights and his wish to change the legislation, but he is accepting a Bill devoid of an important element, namely, human rights.</P>
        <P>Why is there such intransigence?  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has referred to his discomfort and the Green Party has asked the Government to change the Bill.  The Minister of State has been contacted by a range of credible organisations with a long record of quality work in the protection of human rights in Ireland, including the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, Amnesty International, Front Line and others.  Why will the Government not accept their comments on including human rights in the Bill?</P>
        <P>This week is the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  After recent actions, the Government is missing a critical opportunity to restore the credibility of its approach to human rights.  The arguments are spelled out by those working in this area.  Why did the Government remove the advancement of human rights from the Bill?  If it had to do with tax concerns or Front Line&rsquo;s arguments, they can be addressed easily.  Its exclusion and <Col N="1067"/>the consequential impact on the work of human rights organisations give rise to a range of concerns.  They will be undermined and presented with further difficulties.  They are concerned that they will be excluded if human rights are not included in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to place on record some of the concerns of Front Line, Amnesty International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and FLAC.  If the advancement of human rights is not reinstated in the Bill, problems may arise.  Since human rights will not constitute a charitable objective, organisations engaging in its advancement will find accessing funding more difficult, given that foundations and donors require clarity regarding charitable status.  Will the Minister of State inform the House about how organisations will be able to address this matter?</P>
        <P>Like my colleague, Senator Buttimer, the organisations pointed out that the advancement of human rights is a recognised charitable objective in the UK, including Northern Ireland.  According to them, the Bill will undermine the principle of equivalence in the Good Friday Agreement.  Will the Minister of State respond to this serious issue?  United Kingdom organisations that advance human rights will be able to promote their aims in Ireland, but Irish organisations will not be able to benefit from such promotion.  That they will be placed at a disadvantage is immediately evident.</P>
        <P>Many Senators will have received the organisations&rsquo; document which states that organisations have a charitable exemption for education, religious or humanitarian work.  However, were they to frame their work in human rights terms, the regulator would be able to remove their charitable status.  If non-governmental organisations are to retain their status, they will be in the bizarre position of trying to deny that their work includes the advancement of human rights.  This is a serious problem.  The organisations also claim that they could be subject to malicious complaints to the charities regulator to the effect that they are not working to advance human rights.  While I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with these concerns, will he explain how the organisations will deal with them if changes to the Bill are not made?</P>
        <P>The organisations estimate that an amazing array of Irish charities, 60 to 200 in total, may have their work with the vulnerable affected by the exclusion of human rights as a charitable purpose.  Reviewing the legislation in five years is not good enough as damage could be done in the meantime.  Given the week that is in it, the Government has an opportunity to begin making amends for the damage it has done to human rights in recent weeks, as eloquently referred to by Senator Norris.  Will the Minister of State review the decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on my amendment No. 14 and related amendments, which seek to include the protection of human rights as a charitable purpose.  I am disappointed because, when we debated the matter on Committee Stage, a number of points were strongly made.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
        <P>As others have stated, the Bill in its original form as the 2006 charities regulation Bill included the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.  We do not know what has changed since then that would lead to that goal&rsquo;s removal.  From our Committee Stage debate, it appears that no legal objection was made by the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>As I stated then, it is the opinion of the human rights committee of the Law Society that the advancement of human rights should be included as a charitable purpose.  Subsequently, I provided a copy of that submission to the Minister of State&rsquo;s office, as requested.  Given these facts, that the opportunity to reinsert the provision was not taken is disappointing.  I hope the Minister of State might accept one of the amendments.</P>
        <P>As Senators have stated, this week is the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Given this, including the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose would be fitting.  It is unfortunate the Government has seen fit to attack human rights bodies <Col N="1068"/>by undermining the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority and underfunding them next year.  As pointed out by the charities that have briefed us &mdash; Front Line, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and FLAC &mdash; the charitable status of between 60 and 200 organisations could come under threat unless the protection of human rights is included as a charitable purpose.</P>
        <P>While others have referred to this, it is important to note some of the difficulties those organisations will face.  According to the Minister of State, current charities will retain their status, but this is subject to change and potential challenge.  This is of concern to many groups that view their primary purpose as the advancement or protection of human rights.  Even if they have charitable status, they may find it difficult to access funding because the advancement of human rights is not explicitly recognised in our legislation on charities.  They may also find themselves open to malicious complaints to the charities regulator.  Previous speakers referred to certain charities and took issue with particular views they expressed.  I do not believe it is appropriate, in this debate, to take issue with different charities and stances they may have adopted.  However, this shows the dangers involved and highlights that human rights-based charities may be the subject of complaints.</P>
        <P>I thank the free legal advice centres, FLAC, for recommending to me the 2007 annual report of the Charities Commission for England and Wales which makes the point that human rights charities are more likely to have complaints made against them because of the high profile nature of their work.  The commission also pointed out that human rights are seen as fundamental to the healthy functioning of society and that respect for such rights is generally seen as a moral imperative.  That is a strong statement.  It is also a strong premise on which one could base a list of charitable purposes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not provide an adequate explanation in respect of this matter on Committee Stage.  He must indicate why he does not propose to reinsert a provision relating to the advancement of human rights in the Bill.  He must also indicate why he is not following the legislative models adopted in other jurisdictions to which reference was made on Committee Stage.  It is clear that we will be out of line with neighbouring jurisdictions when the legislation is passed.  The principle of equivalence of protection of human rights under the British-Irish Agreement will be undermined if we do not include the advancement of human rights as a recognised charitable objective, particularly as it is so recognised in the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The charities have pointed out that resources, including funds and volunteers, for human rights objectives may be diverted to neighbouring jurisdictions, particularly as they see those as having stronger protection for the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.</P>
        <P>A great deal more could be said in respect of this matter.  However, I do not propose to belabour the point.  As a result of the Committee Stage debate, we know of no legal obstacle to the inclusion of the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.  There is no indication that the Attorney General has objected in any way.  We are aware that the advancement of human rights is included as a charitable purpose in neighbouring jurisdictions and that difficulties will arise under the British-Irish Agreement if it is excluded.  The charities &mdash; those most affected &mdash; have pointed out the many problems they will encounter if the advancement of human rights is not included as a charitable purpose.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to take on board the sentiments we have expressed, and those put forward so strongly by the Incorporated Law Society&rsquo;s human rights committee and others, and include the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to that point in a moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State deserves to be interrupted.  What he is saying is a disgrace.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the charitable purposes in the Bill are very closely linked with human rights.  My understanding is that no charity has been granted a CHY number by Revenue on the basis that it is a human rights organisation <i>per se</i>.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not change the charitable purposes that have developed in common law, nor is it within its gift to do so.  As I made clear to the House, it is not the intention of the Bill to widen or to narrow the range of purposes that have become accepted as charitable over time.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is substantially different in many respects from the general scheme that was originally published.  Much of what was contained in the general scheme was based on examples from other common law jurisdictions.  Much of the legal guidance received during the drafting reflected that it is not always possible to transfer into Irish law what was in other legislative codes.</P>
        <P>As regards human rights and social justice, during the drafting of the Bill and the detailed consultations that were undertaken at that time with other Departments and statutory agencies it emerged that the advancement of human rights and social justice was not a charitable purpose in Ireland.  That is why it was removed.  As stated on many occasions, the purpose of the Bill is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and regulate the current system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A very noble ambition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Boyle referred to charities and advocacy.  The general scheme was quite restrictive in respect of political advocacy on the part of charities.  When drafting the Bill, however, in the context of addressing the question of advocacy towards a political objective by charitable organisations, practical issues arose concerning the protection of charitable status for certain bodies which do good work on the ground, such as those dealing with families of victims of homicide, abuse etc.  It has been argued that many charitable organisations legitimately engage in advocacy as a means to achieve their charitable purpose, although advocacy in itself is not their principal objective.  Accordingly, it was decided not to include a specific provision in the Bill restricting advocacy by charities.</P>
        <P>The question of deemed versus non-deemed charities has arisen on a couple of occasions.  There seems to be some misinterpretation to the effect that charities which are deemed under section 40 are to be perceived differently from those which apply for registration under section 39.  I wish to put the record straight in respect of this matter.  I received legal advice to the effect that deemed and non-deemed charities are exactly the same for the purposes of the Bill. <Col N="1070"/> The most critical provision in the Bill in this context is the definition of &ldquo;registered charitable organisation&rdquo; in section 2.  Deeming is not to be regarded as a temporary measure pending registration proper.  Deemed organisations will have had their charitable credentials assessed to the satisfaction of Revenue in the first instance.  In addition, they will be no more likely to be removed from the register than their section 39 counterparts.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that while human rights and social justice are not specifically mentioned in the legislation, the acts to which they relate, namely, the prevention and relief of poverty, the advancement of education and the prevention of human suffering, are so specifically mentioned.  As stated previously, my purpose has always been to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and draw up legislation that is in line with established practices.  On those grounds, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

Senators on this side have posed questions, as has Senator Boyle on the Government side.  I agree with the latter in that there is a large hole in the Bill.  Senator Buttimer suggested a way to circumvent difficulties in this regard by the inclusion of this measure for a period of five years.  That is a sensible proposal and I do not know why such an approach could not be taken.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that there is no specific reference to human rights in the Bill.  However, such reference is made to &ldquo;the prevention or relief of suffering of animals&rdquo;.  I fail to understand why human rights have not been referred to in this way.  I encourage the Minister of State to reconsider the position in this regard because nothing he has stated will dissuade us from pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P>We are not opposing amendment No. 10.  Senator Boyle in his earlier remarks on human rights referred to forces being at work outside the control of certain sections.  In the context of this section, which is of benefit to the public, I ask the Minister what the Senator means in terms of what forces are at work.  Is there manipulation of the Government at work?  Is Fianna F&aacute;il refusing to accept the involvement of other parties in government in the drawing up of this Bill?  Is the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; dog wagging the Government tail or are there other agencies trying to influence and infiltrate proceedings?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the sos Senator Boyle referred to &ldquo;outside forces&rdquo; and I am concerned by those remarks.  I seek clarification on what he said.  Prior to the sos we took a vote to exclude sporting and human rights organisations from being considered as charitable organisations.  A member of a Government party has referred to &ldquo;outside forces&rdquo;.  The section with which we are dealing refers to &ldquo;a public benefit&rdquo;.  Are the outside forces at work of public benefit to the wider community and the organisations we represent?  I seek clarification from Government on what are the outside forces.  Who are these mystical people?</P>
        <P>Is pressure being put in regard to human rights, as so eloquently outlined by Senator Norris, and is Fianna F&aacute;il wielding a big axe and a big stick?  If that is the case, we deserve to know.  Let us have the debate now.  If the Green Party is not happy to support the Bill, let us park it.  We have already seen a major tome of amendments, which shows that the Bill is a work in progress, a bit like the Government budgetary policies.  A member of the Government parties came to the House and made a speech like a Member of the Opposition and then voted against the Bill.</P>
        <P>Is a sinister plot involved?  We have not raised the matter on this side of the House.  We have been consensual in our approach to the Bill but a member of the Government parties has made an astonishing revelation to the House.  I would like to know who are the outside forces and what Senator Boyle is talking about.  If the matter is of concern to groups that promote human rights and the advancement of sport and it has a negative impact on the Irish charities sector then we need to park the legislation.  We need honesty in this matter.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State is probably none the wiser than I, but we need clarification.  It is disingenuous of Government to come to the House with a vast tome of amendments when a member of the Government parties has castigated his colleagues and voted against them.  That beggars belief on a Bill that is of such importance to the regulation of the charity sector.  Are we justified at this eleventh hour to deny the inclusion of human rights bodies or sporting organisations in the Bill?  We deserve answers.  It was appalling for a member of the Government parties to make such comments in the House and then vote against the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to go along the line Senator Buttimer has so effectively promoted but I do not believe that is the case.  I do not think that it is outside, sinister forces who are pushing a particular political agenda on behalf of the forces of reaction.  This is weak Government.  Senior civil servants in Departments are driving Government policy.  I am sure that is the case.  It is inappropriate to name the particular senior civil servant in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but the Minister will know exactly who is involved.  It is treating the House with contempt that those kind of pathetic non-answers should be read into the record, prepared by other people, and not to answer the questions that were asked.</P>
        <P>I do not follow the conspiracy theory.  I do not think all kinds of mad pro-lifers, George Bush neo-cons and doodahs are behind the Bill.  I do not suggest that my balanced friend, Senator Buttimer, was suggesting that, but that might be an implication that could be taken from it by more hysterical people.  I do not believe that for a minute, but it is up to Government to govern or listen to the advice of its civil servants.  I emphasise the second word, because they, like the Ministers, are servants of the people, and if the Government does not listen to the advice and then makes a decision on policy, it is in difficulty.</P><Col N="1074"/>
        <P>The reason the matter that has been raised by Senator Buttimer is so important is not that these sinister agents were involved but that the door has been left open for them to walk right through it.  That is the problem.  That is why I put on record the vulnerability in these cases that was found by the British Charity Commission&rsquo;s report.  Senator Bacik did the same.  The danger is that one is leaving it wide open.</P>
        <P>Turning to the specific amendment, which relates to charitable purpose and public benefit, I am interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  Since I am not the proposer of the amendment I will not be able to speak again.  I am reminded of those rather innocently sectarian days when one had collections for the Catholic boy scouts or the Protestant orphans.  I always thought it was rather unchristian, whatever about the skirts, I beg your pardon, the shirts.  I have a slight verbal confusion &mdash; the scouts.  Skirts, shirts, I eventually got scouts right.  Whatever about the scouts, is the idea of public benefit intended to make sure that if any of those groups who make collections have survived, that they widen their focus so that they take in the full public within the remit of their benevolence rather than narrowly collecting for the charitable purposes of assisting, for example, the Protestant orphans.</P>
        <P>Thinking back on it, I remember there were Protestant gentlewomen also, and even Protestant lepers in India.  I thought that was a little bit discriminatory.  My heart went out to the poor Catholic, Muslim or even Hindu lepers who were deprived of that munificence.  I am curious about that point.  What is the effect of this measure and why was it necessary technically to change it because the change is not substantial?  I do not have the original wording in front of me but the Minister is now saying, &ldquo;A purpose shall not be a charitable purpose unless it is of public benefit&rdquo;.  I think there was a phrase after that saying &ldquo;within the meaning of this Act&rdquo;.  What is the point of removing that?  I seek to be informed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I am beginning to wonder if I am an innocent abroad when it comes to the operation of democracy.  My understanding of democracy is that one expresses one&rsquo;s point of view and then accepts the will of the majority.  I am not a Trappist monk when it comes to that, I am entitled to express a view and still vote with the Government.  I would be very disappointed if this process were diluted in any way.  What we are trying to do is get to the essence of any given matter, be it an amendment, report or otherwise.  It is through this cut-and-thrust process that we have had some of the best debates in the Seanad over the years.  We do not all necessarily sing from the same hymn sheet at any given time but we all have the opportunity, as members of political parties, to attend the parliamentary party meeting and have an input.  We have an opportunity to approach a Minister, etc.  This is how democracy operates and I hope we do not suggest this should not be the case.</P>
        <P>One would hope that every charity would fall into the category of having a wider public benefit.  One of the difficulties associated with trying to legislate for such a diverse group of bodies is that one must be very careful that one&rsquo;s legislation is implementable and does not have any loopholes or inadequacies.  I look forward to what the Minister of State has to say but I hope that, in our debate on amendments, we can express our views and await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are technical.  Senator Buttimer referred to the &ldquo;forces&rdquo; but I have no idea what forces he is referring to.  In the preparation of this legislation, there has been extensive consultation with various Departments, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, political parties and the charities sector.  The reason for the substantial number of amendments on Committee and Report Stages is that we accepted amendments or redrafted amendments on advice we took, where possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the earlier debates on the Bill in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I have been reflecting on the issue of those organisations that purport to be religious in nature but whose principal interest is in profit or whose methods may be harmful to their followers.  As I stated last week, this issue arose from an Opposition amendment originally developed by Deputies Wall and Higgins. It was reintroduced today by the Senators.  I have concluded that there is merit in the principle of the original amendment in that religious organisations that in reality have scant regard for the spiritual, psychological or financial well-being of their members or potential members should not be granted the privilege of charitable status.  Accordingly, I am proposing an amendment, developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney <Col N="1076"/>General, that will ensure dubious organisations that pose as religious but whose motive is making money or which use inappropriate psychological techniques in recruiting or retaining members will not attain charitable status.  The Opposition amendment has not been moved but mine serves the same purpose.</P>

	<P>It is very welcome that the Minister of State has clearly used phraseology from the original amendment of Senator Hannigan.  It is very interesting that it has been considered properly by the Minister of State and carefully referred to the legal authorities.  The Minister of State has come up with a very good amendment that takes the essential elements of what was proposed from the back benches of the Seanad.  It is very good that he has done so.  Praise is due where it is merited but, unfortunately, such instances are becoming scarcer.</P>

	<P>I concur with Senator Norris.  In this amendment we are taking cognisance of the role of the church and religion, yet the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, by banning the Veritas advertisement, has done the exact opposite.  There is no joined-up thinking by the Government and its agencies.  In praising this amendment, one must seek consistency in terms of Government policy.  I ask the Minister of State to raise the banning of the Veritas advertisement with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The ban was a completely crazy decision.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 17 arises from Committee proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 17, 41, 56 and 62 are related and will be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 14, to delete lines 22 to 29 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) Any default in the relationship/agreement between the Charity and the State Agency/Public body whereby the Charity would be at a loss, would not be counted as such where the Charity has little or no option but to comply with standards/practices set out by the particular body.  In such a case, the individual trustees/Directors of the Charity cannot be held liable.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a question of liability.  On Second Stage, I put on the record of the House extensive information on the brief I received, particularly from the Respond Housing Association, and it would be tedious for me to repeat that now.  The Minister of State understands the points that were made.  As I recall, he said he would reconsider the matter to see if there was room for movement on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I echo the words of Senator Norris.  This is an issue of great importance for voluntary directors of charities.  I have also received communications from the Respond Housing Association, which has been very supportive of this amendment.  It is supportive of the Bill as whole, as we all are, and believes that it is important to regulate the charities sector.  However, the association is concerned about the problem of liability for individual voluntary directors and trustees of charities.  It is concerned that it will be difficult to get indemnity insurance without an amendment such as this.  It is also concerned the Minister of State may have misunderstood the purpose behind the amendment.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support the amendment and compliment Respond Housing Association on its representation on this matter.  It is important that we protect voluntary directors, especially in the current economic situation where commitments made have been pared back, frozen or cancelled.  It is incumbent on the Government to protect voluntary directors.  Sometimes, in the rush to legislate and regulate, we forget voluntary directors.  Therefore, <Col N="1079"/>it is important to protect them.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I will just add a few words because the issue was debated on Committee Stage.  Some years ago a Bill went through the House with regard to directors of private and public companies.  The point was made very clearly that sometimes there is great difficulty in getting someone to become a director of a company because of the inherent liability he or she could suffer.  Whatever about commercial companies, in the case of charitable organisations this should never inhibit a person from becoming a director or becoming involved in a charitable organisation.  This amendment seems logical.  On Committee Stage, the Minister of State  undertook to give serious attention to this issue and I look forward to hearing he has found a solution in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear from the amendments tabled that there is a great appreciation throughout this House of the vital role trustees play in the operation of charities.  I am aware of the need to protect the interests of trustees of charities and I wish to ensure they are not made unfairly liable for commitments into which they enter on behalf of charities in all good faith.  I wish to ensure that those engaged in charity work can undertake the role of trustee without being worried that such a role might have negative financial implications for them.</P>
        <P>I already have amended the Bill to enable charities to use charitable funds to indemnify trustees against personal losses arising where they have acted in good faith.  Even though Opposition Members welcomed the insurance provision, it was considered that there may be a high cost involved in taking out such a policy, particularly when potential liabilities might be considerable.  Accordingly, Opposition Members have tabled amendments on Report Stage, as they did last week, in respect of trustee liability.  I agreed to reflect on this matter and have done so in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  My advice is that a trustee could be liable only where there is a breach of fiduciary relationship by the trustee with the content of the trust deed.  Where a trustee acts in good faith in carrying out its business with a body such as a statutory body, I understand there is no way the trustee would be personally liable.  Nonetheless, for the removal of doubt, Government amendment No. 62 will introduce a new section 89 to deal with the issue raised by the Opposition amendments.  By allowing the court to grant relief to charity trustees from personal liability for a breach of trust where the trustee has acted honestly, reasonably and in good faith, I am confident that this will offer reassurance to those who act as trustees to charities or who are contemplating such a role.  Although I cannot accept the Opposition&rsquo;s amendments as worded, I thank Members for raising the issue.  I hope the Government amendment, which has been tabled on the advice of the Attorney General, will address the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I thank the Minister of State for his clear statement.  I will pass on a copy of the Official Report to Respond!, because it would assuage its problems and anxieties to an extent.  The Minister of State has stated clearly that in situations in which trustees were acting in good faith and in concert with the intentions of the trust and so on, they would not be held liable.  Moreover, he has tabled an amendment to this effect.  As he has honoured his commitment to reconsider this issue and to introduce an amendment, I am happy to withdraw my amendment.  It would be foolish to put this to a vote in any case as it would be just another lost vote.  The Minister of State has moved on this issue and I will revert to those who briefed me on this matter.  I thank the Minister of State for accepting the sense of the points raised in the House.  While there may be further difficulties because the exact wording sought by the various organisations has not been included, significant movement has taken place, which I welcome.</P>

	<P>These amendments are presentational and corrective in nature.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are similar in that they clarify subsections 2 and 4, respectively, applying to consultative panels established on the direction of the Minister under section 37.  Amendment No. 20 is a technical amendment clarifying that section 39(4) applies only to applicants under the section and not to charitable organisations so deemed under section 40.  Amendment No. 21 is a presentational amendment to the provision introduced on Committee Stage allowing for the authority to exempt certain applicants from being obliged to provide each and every document listed in section 39.  However, there is no substantive change to the provision.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 both correct cross-references to other sections of the Bill that should have been made following previous amendments and amendment No. 24 simply clarifies that the subsection refers to a requirement under section 43.</P>

	<P>Although at face value this amendment, which replaces the original section 43, is substantial, essentially it is a presentational amendment proposed on the basis of legal advice.  It provides for the circumstances under which a charitable organisation, which had applied successfully for entry onto the register of charities may be removed from the register by the authority.  It ensures that the circumstances reflect those applicable to those charities deemed to be registered under section 40.  This underlines the principle that charities that are deemed to be registered and charities that actually applied for registration should be regarded equally under the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for clarifying the purpose of the amendment.  I apologise that I did not have an opportunity to speak on this matter on Committee Stage because I wish to express a concern about the wide-ranging powers that are given to the authority after consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What causes me alarm is the exclusion of any reference to the advancement of human rights as a recognised charitable purpose, despite the numerous Opposition amendments tabled to that effect.  Given such an exclusion, an organisation that is deemed to be a charity because it currently exists, although its primary purpose is the advancement of human rights, may be deregistered under the new section 43.  It may be deregistered where the authority, after consulting with the Garda, considers that its promoting purposes are contrary to public morality or contrary to public policy.</P>
        <P>My general concern about both the existing section 43 and the Government amendment under discussion is that the powers bestowed are too broad and the criteria too vague.  In particular the reference to public morality and public policy could easily be used effectively to deregister a charitable organisation that is in existence at present and is deemed registered but the primary purpose of which is the advancement or protection of human rights.  If such an organisation in such a capacity is critical of the Government in some way, it could at some point be deemed, therefore, to be acting contrary to public policy or public morality.  Those terms are too vague and the power is too broad.  I have a concern about it, especially in the context of the amendments that were defeated earlier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, there was considerable interest from the sector that charities currently registered could be deemed under the new Act.  We have regulated the existing practices in the legislation.  In other words, the charitable purposes in the Bill would be similar to those that are seen as such by Revenue.  There no reason a charity currently registered with Revenue would lose that status.</P><Col N="1084"/>
        <P>More importantly, there is an appeals mechanism and the courts system.  If the purposes currently applying continue to apply, there is nothing to fear.  We have been very conscious in sections 39 and 40 that those deemed and those who apply would be treated exactly the same.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 33 is a presentational amendment that, rather than showing a lengthy list of subsections to which provision does not apply, shows a much shorter list of subsections to which it does apply.  Amendment No. 34 is a presentational amendment on a similar basis to the previous amendment.  It broadens the list of subsections to section 44 to which the subsection in question applies.  Amendment No. 35 is consequential on amendment No. 34.  Amendment No. 36 is purely a drafting amendment.  Amendment No. 37 clarifies that the tribunal may impose conditions upon an appellant.</P>

	<P>It is important when moving into regulation, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, that we provide supports for charities in submitting reports and in the auditing process.  I am a little concerned at the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks on the context of different types of reporting.  I hope he will be prescriptive in his reports to the charities on what they can and cannot do.  It is important there is uniformity of reporting.  Otherwise, there will be confusion and there will be a return to the old way where there was no regulation.  The amendment is a worthwhile one and my party will not oppose it, but it is important we provide supports and that reporting mechanisms are consistent and uniform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it is important we have reporting and I suppose it is important the reporting is proportionate to the type and scale of the operation of the charity.  It is a point Senator Buttimer made previously and I want to reiterate it because it is very important.  We are regulating an area that has been largely unregulated.  The role of the new authority, apart from being a regulatory authority, is also to be supportive and helpful in that regard.  That is key.  Passing the legislation is only the first hurdle, but the role of the authority most definitely must be a supportive as well as a regulatory role.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I consider it key to this legislation that organisations which are not charitable in nature should be prevented from presenting themselves to the public as charitable.  I want to be sure that donors to charity can be confident that the money they intend to go for the benefit of good causes is not diverted into commercial businesses or worse.  In this context, I am aware of the concern expressed by Members about the sale in shops of pre-signed mass cards which are not obtained directly from or with the consent of the Catholic church.  There is no doubt that pre-signed mass cards are widely sold in shops and this practice has given rise to concerns that mass cards are sold on a for-profit basis, with only a small proportion of the purchase price used for the benefit of the church, and that no mass is ever offered in respect of the intentions specified on the cards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators will be glad to know that I have taken on board the concerns expressed to me on this issue and, following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, I have proposed an amendment to the effect that anyone who sells mass cards will have to able to show that he or she has entered into an agreement with the Catholic church to do so.  I hope this will set people&rsquo;s minds at rest in regard to the validity and authenticity of such cards.  This measure, combined with the authority&rsquo;s power to provide information to the public through public information campaigns or guidelines and the provisions in the Bill that prevent non-charities from portraying themselves as charities, will help people to discern genuine charities from organisations which are not charitable in nature.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Catholic church will play an important role in ensuring the success of this approach.  I understand it is committed to playing its part.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s intentions but I wish to express my concerns about this provision.  As a criminal lawyer, I am concerned that we are creating a new <Col N="1092"/>criminal offence which will be difficult to defend.  I am particularly concerned that no provision is made for the defence of good faith.  We are far too quick to create new criminal offences that purport to impose liability in the absence of any requirement of <i>mens rea</i>.  Constitutional difficulties have arisen in this regard, although I do not want to say too much on this subject because I am involved as a practising barrister in cases which involve <i>mens rea</i>.  Has the Minister of State received advice that the proposed measure sufficiently safeguards the rights of the accused?</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about a very different constitutional issue.  The proposed section will create the offence of selling a mass card.  The definitions by which the parameters of the offence are outlined pertain to matters which are internal to a particular church.  The Constitution does not grant a special position to any church and this Republic observes the principle of the separation of church and State.  I am not sure from a constitutional point of view that we should be creating an offence which relies on definitions pertaining to internal matters of a particular church in this country.</P>
        <P>I recognise the problem which the Minister of State is seeking to address and agree that people should not be defrauded.  However, I am concerned about the way in which the proposed section is framed.  Has the Minister of State received advice on the matters I have raised and is he confident they will not cause a problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this amendment and acknowledge Senator Bacik&rsquo;s eloquent exposition of the difficulties that arise in resolving this matter.  However, Fr. Matt Moran of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart and the Irish Missionary Union have made significant efforts in this regard.  I understand they have met the Minister of State to discuss the matter.  It is important that we consider this amendment from a number of angles.  The issuance of mass cards is an internal matter for the Catholic Church and we must recognise that the offering of masses for the deceased is an important part of the church&rsquo;s traditions.  We should acknowledge this and not take away from it.</P>
        <P>As Senator Bacik indicated, there is the issue of people being defrauded or losing revenue.  The purpose of the amendment is to bring greater clarity to the issue surrounding bogus mass cards being issued and introduce accountability.  I am amused on one level that bishops and priests are being defined in the legislation, which is probably unique in this context.  Without getting into trouble, the Minister of State will have plenary indulgences in heaven and masses said for him as a consequence of that.</P>
        <P>We had a great debate on humanism this morning and we are now discussing mass cards.  It is important we consider the context of the amendment and where we began.  It is a reserved function of the Catholic clergy and the church in the issuing of mass cards.  We should never take that away.  We will support the amendment because the Government has an obligation in the context of this legislation and other legislation regarding fraud, deception and financial matters to protect the church in question and the citizens from being defrauded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many religious charities that are compliant and genuine in their approach, and that have been very forthcoming in their operations.  To allow a deception to continue would be wrong.  As Fr. Matt Moran said to us, there will now be transparency and accountability, as introduced in this legislation.  Whether we agree with mass cards being pre-signed and sold is a different issue but in the context of this legislation, we will support the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing forward a very thoughtful and comprehensive amendment.  I apologise that I was not here in person to withdraw my amendment No. 29, as I intended to do.  I have not had much time to consider the <Col N="1093"/>amendment but I can find no flaw in it in terms of the rights of an accused person or the attempt to address a particular mischief.</P>
        <P>I do not know if Senator Bacik was here when we discussed a Labour Party amendment this morning dealing with humanism.  I was inclined to support it as it provided that the Act in question would apply to humanism, as it does to religion.  I spoke about a new generosity.  To take as a starting point what the Constitution states, it is not neutral on religion because it acknowledges, as I stated earlier, the homage due to almighty God.  It is a specifically Christian document, and although not everybody likes that, that is how it stands.</P>
        <P>I spoke about a new generosity in which all of us in society, whether as people of a particular faith or not, would recognise the bona fide communitarian vision of people of faith and of groups that do not profess particular religious faith but have altruistic motives.  It was in that regard that I felt there could well be scope, while not categorising humanism as a branch of religion, for seeing agencies of humanism which are almost by definition not theistic as nonetheless agencies or groups of people who have altruistic motives qualifying for charitable status.</P>
        <P>I appeal to Senator Bacik and others to adopt that same vision of a generous and inclusive future as they look at an amendment like this.  I worry there is something of a Pavlovian response in certain quarters that if anything that appears to go to the benefit of religion or a religious organisation is proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On a point of order, I raised two constitutional concerns about a provision and I am entitled to raise them on the record.  I am also entitled to have the Minister of State answer them.  I did not engage in any criticism of the drafters but simply raised these points.  In the spirit of fairness, it is appropriate in the Seanad that we raise points such as this.  I do not intend to have a debate about the merits of religion and so on, although I am delighted we had the debate on humanism etc. on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage.  That was a different debate.  The issues I raised are very specific to this amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from the fact that her comments were not on a point of order, as Senator Bacik well knows, I am not taking issue with her right to express certain concerns from a constitutional perspective or otherwise about the Bill.  I am about to address some of those concerns.  I will restate what I fear is present in some quarters, namely, a Pavlovian response.  That is where people automatically react against measures that may act in the interests of people or groups of faith.  One can then produce arguments against it.</P>
        <P>To take the core of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s two arguments, her first dealt with the question of the rights of the accused.  I can best address that by referring to my own personal experience.  I raised this issue long ago in consultation with religious bodies and I wrote about it in a journalistic capacity.  It would be useful and of assistance to Members to make a few points on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I understand it, the Catholic church does not believe in the sale of masses as it is regarded as simony in canon law.  It would certainly not be the business of the State to inquire into that.  The practice within the Catholic &mdash; Roman Catholic as some call it &mdash; tradition is that people ask for the saying of masses, as is their entitlement as members of the Catholic faith.  In that context they offer a donation or stipend to the priest in question on the basis that the labourer deserves his wages and it is a contribution.</P><Col N="1094"/>
        <P>If a person has no money to offer, her or she is entitled to have a mass said, be it for the repose of a loved one&rsquo;s soul or any other mass intention.  Most politicians in this House send out mass cards very frequently to the bereaved or mass bouquets to those who are ill or for all sorts of other reasons.  I suspect it is not just practising Catholics who engage in this as it is seen as a gesture of solidarity and as such it is very noble.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the rules of the Catholic church, which again are not necessarily any business of the State, a priest is entitled to accept one stipend per mass per day.  It may be of particular interest to Senator Bacik that the common practice is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In speaking to the amendment, I am reminded of the exchange between the barrister, F. E. Smith, and the judge where Smith gave a long exposition.  The judge said he was none the wiser having heard the comments, to which the barrister responded that perhaps the judge was none the wiser but certainly was better informed.  The subsequent response of the judge was to ask if the barrister in question was trying to show contempt for the court and the barrister responded that he was trying to conceal contempt for the court.</P>
        <P>Where priests or clergy receive in excess of one stipend per day, it is their practice to pass it on to people in missionary lands and clergy who very much depend on these stipends.  It supports them in positions of extreme financial difficulty.  I have worked with a charity in Argentina and have been asked on a number of occasions to facilitate this very good and laudable practice of transferring excess mass stipends to missionaries who need it.  They are not necessarily Irish people and are in foreign lands.</P>
        <P>As is well known to people in the church, one can see mass cards on sale in many shops and post offices in the country.  If Senator Buttimer has a comment, he might address it to the Chair because I cannot lip-read.  There has been a purported sale of mass cards and very often what one sees on them is a name that is hardly legible.  The name is of a priest who may or may not exist.  Certain commercial interests have been selling these mass cards, but it is a scam.  People purchase these cards in good faith and believe they are making an offering in respect of a particular mass, which is not the case.  Very often the signature on the card is that of a defrocked priest or a non-existent person.  People who buy such cards are transferring money not to the church, as is their intention, but to a commercial interest that is acting quite cynically and not in the common good.</P>
        <P>It is in this context that I am addressing Senator Bacik&rsquo;s second concern.  Just because the church is a private interest into whose business the State may not necessarily inquire, people in the church are citizens of this country.  On countless occasions, President McAleese has <Col N="1095"/>extolled the good works done by our missionaries abroad.  It is entirely appropriate to act in the interests of a certain group in society, whose business primarily should be to alert shops and post offices that these are bogus mass cards.  It is also a legitimate activity of the State to spot the scam and seek to inhibit its perpetrators by introducing a rule or regulation that will operate to the specific benefit of a certain group in society.  We all agree that that group is doing good pastoral and humanitarian work here and abroad.</P>
        <P>To address Senator Bacik&rsquo;s first concern about the rights of the accused, given what I have explained about the practice, there can be no doubt about the desirability of putting the onus of proof on the person selling these cards.  It will be a burden on them that will be easy to discharge if they are operating in conjunction with recognised bodies associated with the Catholic faith in parishes or diocese, including religious orders.  It is clear that people who sell mass cards in post offices or shops are doing so through an arrangement with a commercial interest.  There are cases where it is done by arrangement with a local priest or missionary to collect money for the missions.  Such people have nothing to fear from the Bill, notwithstanding Senator Bacik&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
        <P>I ask for a greater degree of generosity when it comes to addressing the interests of specific groups in our society, including, heavens above, faith groups.  I compliment the Minister on tabling a comprehensive amendment that deals with a problem that has emerged.  I accept that it is primarily the responsibility of the church to deal with this, and it could be doing a lot more.  The church needs to be more active locally in advising shopkeepers and post offices that they are helping to perpetrate a scam, albeit unwittingly.  In many cases, they are depriving missionaries in developing countries of much needed funds.  It is good that the State is intervening in this regard.  I compliment the Minister in coming up with a comprehensive wording that is far superior to my own.  Perhaps I lacked faith in the process in thinking that something as specific as the Minister&rsquo;s proposal would not get through.  He is addressing a problem and it will benefit people here who will not be subject to such scams.  In addition, he will be benefiting the work of Irish missionaries abroad, as well as their religious colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It has come home to me again today how alive and well religion is in Ireland.  It is evident because two of the most animated discussions we have had here dealt with religion.  The main issue, however, was the sale of mass cards in shops.  We were all approached by several people about this practice and many Senators have raised the matter in the House.  We also discussed misrepresentation whereby an individual or group dishonestly claims to represent a charity, and obviously something had to be done about that.  One of the most blatant cases concerns clothes, and we have seen that happening throughout the country.  A leaflet may be dropped through the letter-box indicating that clothes will be collected for a charity.  Subsequently, however, we discovered that this was not the case.  In some cases that representation is given but only a small proportion of the money collected goes to a charity, while the main proportion is for commercial purposes.  It is one of the reasons this Bill is focused on ensuring that we are dealing with genuine charities.</P>
        <P>Since Senator Bacik&rsquo;s election to the House, I have found the discussions to be exceptionally good.  It is good to hear other views being put forward.  Perhaps I am not supposed to refer to another Member, but I only knew of Senator Bacik through the media prior to her election.  When she makes a point here, however, it gives the Government side an opportunity to respond and that is what parliamentary debate is all about.  We have had that on the Order of Business nearly every day and I would like to see it continue because we must all be open to learning.  On the other hand, Senator Mullen has given us an exceptionally good background on the issue.</P>
        <P>Let us come down to the facts.  We accept that masses relate to the Catholic church, which is the starting point.  Given that that is the case, if one is looking for a governing or representa<Col N="1096"/>tive group, it must be the Catholic church in this case.  I am not sure whether this issue comes under the heading of charity, but it does not relate to money alone.  Nonetheless, we should never underestimate the importance of a mass card in helping bereaved people to grieve for a loved one.  I have repeatedly heard people say that they never realised they had so many friends until the mass cards arrived.  There may be a theological weakness in that argument, but it does not take away from the positive effect of mass cards.  It is important to maintain the status of such cards, which cannot be the case if it is the same as buying a lollipop.  Generally, there is an unusual signature on bogus mass cards, which seems like Arabic, and therefore when people receive them they know that the same sentiment and concern were not involved.  They will also know that one did not go to the same trouble to have a mass said for the deceased person.</P>
        <P>Knowing that a scam was involved, the Minister could have outlawed that practice completely.  If he had done so, we would have had a wider debate here because we would have read all kinds of connotations into such an extreme measure.  The balance that he has introduced in the legislation is like the wisdom of Solomon.  On the one hand, the law does not come down like a ton of bricks on a &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; purveyor of these mass cards.  Second, the Bill places a responsibility on that person to prove the cards are legitimate because we know there are scams.</P>
        <P>One could not possibly take the Catholic church out of the equation.  The mass relates solely to the Catholic church so surely it is entitled to maintain its credibility.  Senator Mullen put his finger on it when he said that members of the church are citizens of this country as well.  They have a representative group called the Catholic church.  Would we treat a trade union any differently, for instance?  Would we have dealt any differently with the representative organisations concerning this Bill?  We would not have done so.  Incidentally, the Catholic church still represents a majority in this country.  One can become over politically correct on these issues and think one is helping some minority, but, in the main I do not always see those minorities.</P>
        <P>I have cited an example, which is going slightly away from the amendment, that when people were demanding that the Angelus should be taken off RTE, it was a Church of Ireland bishop who defended it, not a Catholic one.  He asked, quite rightly, what was wrong with reflecting for a couple of minutes each day in a spiritual context.  The same applies here because there is so much badness, violence, division and acrimony out there.  If religion can help people to focus, cultivate a conscience, help others, be neighbourly and promote peace, surely to God that is vital, and if the mass card is an instrument of that process, we should ensure that it is not undermined, misrepresented or fraudulent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  While I did not contribute on Second Stage, I remember some of the discussion, including the lengthy contribution of my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, on this issue.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment is reasonable, practical and sensible.</P>
        <P>I have had occasion to send a significant number of mass cards, although I do not want to cross theology and politics.  The signatures and stamps on pre-signed cards for sale in supermarkets and shops generally looked suspicious.  One would be fearful that the card&rsquo;s recipient would believe that one&rsquo;s sentiments were less than genuine.  The amendment will address this concern which has been raised a number of times in recent years and in which the media took a degree of interest.  Where concerns about legislation are highlighted from a non-partisan perspective, be it by political sources or those outside the Houses, it is good that certain Departments and civil servants are willing to listen and produce a reasonable response.</P><Col N="1097"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.3- ?><P>In this regard, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s initiative.

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  Senator Mullen outlined the nature of the problem adequately.  As Senator Bradford stated, the problem has been identified for a long time and I have been conscious of it since assuming my position.  That we have only been able to introduce a provision at a late stage despite my willingness to address it shows the complexity of the problem.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to delay the debate, I will respond to Senator Bacik directly.  The drafting of the wording was a complex matter.  The provision was drawn up by the Office of the Attorney General and drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel.  In light of this, I have confidence in its constitutionality.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The new charities regulatory authority will face a significant challenge.  In addition to its wide-ranging regulatory and supportive role, the new authority will be taking on also the complex functions of the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland, which is to be dissolved.  For this reason, the new authority will need to be able to draw on a wide range of expertise and experience.  In light of this complex work and on the basis of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, it is proposed to increase the maximum membership permitted to 20.  The amendment is intended to ensure the authority will be able to call on an extensive range of skills which will enable it to undertake its broad remit efficiently and effectively.  It will also facilitate the authority in forming committees to which specified decision making can be delegated as the Bill provides.</P>
        <P>In the context of the authority&rsquo;s membership, Senators may recall that the exclusion of public representatives from the board was raised in previous Seanad debates.  After reflecting on the issue, I can appreciate the argument that people who serve as local authority representatives may have skills and experience that could enhance the board&rsquo;s work.  On Committee Stage, I signalled that I would propose a relevant Government amendment on Report Stage.  Accordingly, this amendment removes the provision excluding members of a local authority from membership of the new authority in paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 and in consequential paragraphs.  This does not mean councillors will be appointed to the board automatically, but it will make those with relevant experience and interests who may have a great deal to offer the new authority eligible for appointment.  I commend the amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision to allow members of local authorities to be board members.  The Government trend has been to exclude them from boards.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s hypocrisy was evident when it voted to preclude local authority members in the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008.  The Government should reverse its decision and redress the imbalance.</P><Col N="1098"/>
        <P>On a non-political level, it is important we recognise that councillors involved in charities often bring with them a set of skills and experiences.  We must learn from the F&Aacute;S situation.  The authority should not be a political cumann for Fianna F&aacute;il.  We must use it wisely.  Some people in the charitable sector have vast experience that should be availed of by the new authority.  I hope the Minister of State will not use the board as a reward for people who donate to or support Fianna F&aacute;il.  A wrong decision, it would detract from the consensual approach of the Bill.  I welcome the decision to include local authority members and I hope other Ministers and Ministers of State will decide likewise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State.  The removal of the exclusion cause has given the Bill greater credibility.  It would not have been good to exclude by title alone a particular group that is central to communities and, often, the work of charities.  It would have detracted from the Bill.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, councillors are drawn into close co-operation with and involvement in many charities at local level.  Judging from the various local authority debates that are covered by local newspapers, councillors are probably the most focused group when it comes to vulnerable people in need.  Whether it is part of councillors&rsquo; remit, they are invariably to the fore.  They are able to create publicity for a good cause by virtue of their positions because local newspapers and radio stations tend to cover their meetings.  To make them feel leprous and hurt would not be right and could create a silence.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s show of strength in responding to the request not to exclude local authority members specifically.</P>

I hope it does not become an exercise in cronyism or jobs for the Fianna F&aacute;il boys, not just members of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I hope for a balanced set of appointments.  As already stated, it is nice to speak in a spirit of consensus.  I unwittingly roused a hornet&rsquo;s nest earlier when I referred to concerns I consider to be valid.  Senator Mullen is no longer present but I must state that I did not intend to provoke what occurred.  I accept that the amendments put forward by the Minister of State are useful and it is good that everyone in the House is in agreement on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s decision in respect of local authority members.  He did not go as far as I suggested on Committee Stage, namely, that it should be specifically stated that a local authority member should be included on the board.  However, I welcome the fact that local authority members will not be excluded from the board.</P>
        <P>I am concerned with regard to the composition of the board and the fact that there can be up to 20 members thereof.  Various items of legislation that are supposed to represent Government policy have been dealt with by the House in recent months.  In the Harbours (Amendment) Bill, for example, the number of directors on a commercial port company is being reduced from 12 to eight because it is considered that a board comprising 12 members is too unwieldy. There are 17 members on the board of F&Aacute;S and we are now suggesting that there can be a maximum of 20 on the board of the charities regulatory authority.</P>
        <P>Does the Government have a policy regarding the membership of boards of this nature or does it just make it up as it goes?  It appears that 20 is a large number of members for any board.  I stated in respect of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill that reducing the number of members from 12 to eight was a step too far because it will be local authority members who will suffer.</P>
        <P>We should take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland because they have provided a wonderful service and carried out their duties in an exemplary manner for many years.  I am a trustee of the Holy <Col N="1099"/>Ghost Hospital in Waterford.  Whenever we had to engage in financial dealings or sell any of our properties, we were obliged to obtain permission for doing so from the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  They always dealt with us properly and in the best interests of the trust when approached.  It would be remiss of us not to pay tribute to the commissioners and thank them for the service they provided over the years.  I hope some of them will be appointed as members of the new board when it is established because they have built up a vast store of knowledge in this area.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that a board with 20 members is probably too large.  If fewer members were appointed, it would be possible to appoint sub-committees.  In addition, such sub-committees could be made up of professionals from outside the board.  However, appointing boards with 20 members is taking matters too far and smacks of a &ldquo;there is one for everyone in the audience&rdquo; approach.  I am somewhat concerned with regard to this matter.</P>

	<P>I must inform Senator Buttimer that what other Ministers do in respect of legislation relating to this matter in the future will be their responsibility.  I dealt with the matter before us because it was raised by him and Senator Leyden.  When I considered the position, I could find no good reason as to why public representatives should be excluded.</P>
        <P>It was suggested that there should be an automatic inclusion.  However, I felt that this would be inappropriate because we had already set down the criteria &mdash; such as legal background, charitable experience, etc. &mdash; people serving on the board would be obliged to meet.  Rather than councillors being automatically appointed to the board, I am of the view that it should be councillors with a range of experience who should be considered for membership.</P>
        <P>The provision relating to the appointment of 20 members to the board is enabling in nature.  There is no specific intention to have a board comprised of 20 members.  A minimum of nine members will be appointed, but we will have scope to appoint up to 20 members.  Senator Buttimer is correct that, like the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland, the authority will be extremely supportive in performing it duties and will not be just a regulatory body.  The number of members appointed will depend on the level of expertise that will be required in order to allow the board to work effectively and efficiently.  However, it is not the intention to establish a board with 20 members from the outset.  It is merely an enabling provision.</P>

	<P>The House has spent two long days dealing with the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill.  I thank Senators for their contributions, both in the House and outside &mdash; where they might advise others &mdash; in respect of it.  Our remit was to develop legislation to reflect what is going on in the charities sector and to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  We have a come a long way in this regard.  I have, as far as possible, taken on board suggestions that were practical in terms of what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank my officials and the staff of the Office of the Attorney General for their advice which allowed us to proceed this far.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the passing of the Bill.  I pay tribute to all involved, in particular the groups in the sector who were instrumental in framing amendments and who made representations in regard to anomalies in the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy and, in particular, his officials who were helpful, courteous and professional in their dealings with us.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s openness was reflected in the consensual approach taken on this Bill.  Often public servants receive bad press.  I pay tribute today to the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials in respect of the briefing they provided, which was very good.  Also, I thank the Fine Gael staff, &Aacute;ine Kilroy and Jennifer Carroll for their help and co-operation.  </P>
        <P>The Charities Bill 2007 will be remembered as the legislation on which we almost brought the Government down &mdash; a slight exaggeration.  It was nice to get a win last week despite Senator Wilson&rsquo;s discomfort in that regard.  It is important charities are regulated.  There is a <Col N="1102"/>broad welcome in the sector for this legislation.  I welcome the five year review.  I implore the Minister of State to assist and augment the work of charities rather than hinder them in terms of compliance with this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the passing of the Bill which will provide for the better regulation of charitable organisations, its primary purpose.  We all accept it is generally a positive Bill.  Putting in place a proper framework, in statutory form, for the regulation of charitable organisations is long overdue and in that regard the Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some regrets, including that the Bill as passed is not somewhat more inclusive in terms of definitions and, in particular, that the advancement of human rights, sports bodies and humanism is not included.  The Bill could have gone further than simply maintaining the <i>status quo</i> on those issues.  I welcome the Bill which will provide for a much greater, efficient, effective and better regulated charitable sector, for which all of us are grateful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the passing of the Bill, which is timely and helps to put matters on a statutory footing.  Also, it helps to improve the whole process of better regulation in the sector.  I am particularly pleased the Minister of State has taken on board so many of my party&rsquo;s amendments and compliment him on doing so.  While we were less fortunate in regard to our amendments on issues such as humanism and human rights, perhaps these are subjects that can be reviewed in the future.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the work done behind the scenes on this Bill by members of the Labour Party and by external organisations who have been helpful and forthcoming with their advice.  I thank the Minister of State and his staff for the work and effort they put into this Bill, which we all wish well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The passing of this Bill is exceptionally good news.  It will be welcomed by the charities sector.  The widespread consultation on this legislation has played an important role in respect of the consensus generated in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  This is the first Bill the Minister of State has steered through the Houses of the Oireachtas and he has done so astutely.  We are all in agreement that he listened to our viewpoints in respect of many of aspects of the legislation, which is good.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials for their work on this Bill over a long time given the many archaic aspects to it.  At long last, we have what most people in the sector require.  While some amendments did not make it over the final hurdle, we all look forward to the five year review, which is the correct road to go.</P>

The legislation reflects the commitment of the people of Ireland to charity, <i>per se</i>.  I have said many times that Irish people when asked to respond to a good cause always do.

      <sTitle>National Gallery.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to discuss with the Minister of State this evening the planned consolidation of many of our national galleries.  This is a matter that has been discussed, albeit briefly, within the media.  To the best of my knowledge, it has not been the subject of much discussion within the Oireachtas.  </P>
        <P>My understanding is that the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department is poised to consolidate and amalgamate many of our major national galleries, in particular the Crawford Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham and the National Gallery.  In raising this matter for discussion, I stress that I am approaching this with an open mind.  I am a huge fan of the galleries mentioned and spend my spare time in the Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham, which is a magnificent institution within our city.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am trying to flesh out and better understand the Government&rsquo;s plans in this regard.  My first concern is that the Government, in any moves it might make, ensures that opportunities for young Irish artists, in particular, are not reduced.  The Museum of Modern Art in Kilmainham has a magnificent residential programme which allows young children to view artists&rsquo; work and to engage with them on it, which is wonderful.  My second concern relates to the funding arrangement that might pertain in the future.  As I understand it &mdash; I must stress again there has not been much discussion of this issue in public &mdash; the funding arrangements for each of the galleries in question will be consolidated and the galleries in question will then draw from a central fund as opposed to managing their own budgets.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>My third concern relates to the make-up of the board and composition of the different institutions and galleries as they stand.  To what degree, in terms of any future arrangement, will the autonomy of the galleries need to be changed or reduced?  This is an important point.  Each of the three galleries referred to, all of which I am aware will be affected by this change, have their own unique identities and culture.  I would be disappointed if, in the future, they were to be homogenised or reduced as a result of any changes that might take place.  I have one question in addition to the concerns outlined.  What savings, if any, will the Department recoup as a result of this move?</P>
        <P>In raising this issue with the Minister of State, I have an open mind on it.  This issue has not received the kind of debate it merits.  I look forward to the Minister of State outlining the position and responding to the individual points I raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue because I am sure the questions in his mind are also in the minds of other people.  I am happy to set out where we have got to in this process up to now.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s view and his fondness and affection for the three galleries in question.  In the National Gallery, I recently opened the Hugh Douglas Hamilton exhibition, which I recom<Col N="1104"/>mend.  There is also a fine Finnish exhibition there.  The Crawford Gallery in Cork has an excellent exhibition of the work of Daniel Maclise.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided to combine the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland, while retaining their separate brand identities and integrity.  This decision, which was announced in budget 2009, arose from the scrutiny by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism of administrative costs, which was undertaken earlier this year as part of the Government&rsquo;s efficiency review, with a particular focus on the number of State agencies and other bodies and in the context of the ongoing oversight exercised by that Department of these institutions against the backdrop of the 2009 Estimates process.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure our national cultural institutions function through, and are supported by, administrative and other structures which are efficient, effective and reflect the principles of modernisation and flexibility set out in Towards 2016.  As the continuing pressure on the public purse will not be matched by any decline in expectation or demand for quality customer services, the rationalisation of the support or back office functions, within complementary national cultural institutions, is not an optional consideration at this time and must be undertaken.  Some of the institutions have reasonably good numbers of support staff.  However, the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork. which recently came under the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as a national cultural institution, did not have in-house administrative support.  Institutions such as this cannot be expected to function efficiently without the normal level of human resources, finance and other back-up.</P>
        <P>A consultative process with the directors of the National Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery has been initiated.  The directors have been requested to consider the future arrangements necessary to give effect to the decision and bring forward any issues they perceive will need to be specifically addressed under various headings such as legislation, governance, unified management structures, unified support services and resources.  A consultative committee will be established in respect of this project.  It will be led by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and will include representatives of the three national cultural institutions concerned.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process, the corporate and legislative positions of each of the institutions is being examined with a view to drawing up heads of a Bill to give effect to the required legislative changes.  These changes will include amendment of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 and the National Gallery of Ireland Acts 1854 to 1963 and the creation of new legislation.  The objective in this development is to seek the best structures for the three institutions so that, in facing into times of stringency, they can continue to deliver core services to their respective customers to their normal and superlative standards.</P>
        <P>The status of the Irish Museum of Modern Art was already scheduled to undergo change, arising from a commitment in the programme for Government to put it on a statutory footing.  The recent Government decision provides for further change.  It is important to emphasise that it is intended in the Government decision that each institution will retain its own identity.  There is an opportunity now for the three institutions to focus on how their individual identities are not only retained but enhanced by the process.  It will be open to the directors, through the consultative process, to put forward ideas as to how the combining of the three institutions can be effected in such a way as to ensure that each of the three institutions has an even greater impact in its own area of expertise.  We need a dynamic, vibrant visual arts sector and it is in our interest that the three institutions continue to cater for their different customer groups.</P>
        <P>In more discerning markets internationally, the national cultural institutions differentiate us as a destination of distinction and value.  This summer, a visitor to Dublin could have viewed works by Bacon, Monet, Gauguin, Freud, Scully and Rembrandt and read original Yeats and Joyce manuscripts before enjoying the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and catching a glimpse <Col N="1105"/>of an Oscar winning songwriter.  This is the kind of cultural immersion and variety that few cities in Europe can offer.  It is entirely appropriate that we continue to invest financially and legislatively in these internationally important institutions so that they continue to flourish in the new economic environment.  It is not possible at this stage to identify what savings, if any, will be realised through this process.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the Government is fully committed to all three institutions and envisages them working closer together for mutual benefit, in particular in terms of pooling some back-up systems.  I fully appreciate what the Senator said about opportunities for young artists.  I mention in passing that the Office of Public Works buys a significant quantity of new art for public offices around the country and each year it holds an art of the State exhibition, which is currently showing in the atrium of the OPW, 51 St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  The Senator is welcome to come and view it at any time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I congratulate him on the work of his Department, particularly on the new gallery in Farmleigh House and on the exhibitions that have been held there.</P>
        <P>I am struck by the fact that the Minister of State identified that little savings, if any, will be realised through this process, which is not necessarily bad.  If we are entering this process, as it appears we are, we need to focus on how we can put these institutions on a firmer footing and ensure that the identities of the three galleries flourish.  That appears to be a good move.  I look forward to the legislation and the plans the Minister of State will bring forward to make this happen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>

    <Title>World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  There is a need for a national day to remember victims of road traffic accidents.  In 2005 the United Nations designated the third Sunday of November each year as a World Day of Remembrance for Victims of Road Traffic Accidents.  It is important that we have a national day of remembrance, as it would allow us to focus on road safety and best driving practice.  It is important that we recognise the death and injury caused by road traffic accidents.  A national remembrance day could be a focal point for the acknowledgment of the loss and pain of road crash victims and their families.  It would allow people to come together and pay tribute to their loved ones and to highlight road safety.</P>
        <P>We need also to have a national memorial for those involved in road traffic accidents.  Each county has a sign indicating the number of people killed on its roads each year.  That is a chilling reminder of the need for all of us to be careful on the roads.  Parents and siblings of those who have been killed or injured on our roads would welcome a national day of remembrance.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that this year we had prayers at masses and there was a special ceremony of remembrance at Knock.  We have a road safety week in October or November but it is imperative that we have a national day of remembrance, which would have a twin effect.  I do not intend to delay the Minister of State unduly.  I look forward to his reply in the hope that it will be positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment.  It affords me the opportunity to clarify for the House the appropriate steps taken in recognition of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims and the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to improving road safety here.</P><Col N="1106"/>
        <P>Sunday 16 November was World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, which happens every year on the third Sunday in November.  In Ireland, the day was marked by events and services in many parts of the country.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, which comes under the remit of my Department, is the Government&rsquo;s primary agency for co-ordinating road safety measures and was to the forefront on the day of remembrance.  It was joined by local road safety officers, emergency services and the Garda to mark the day, which focused on the victims and on measures to reduce the number of victims of road traffic accidents.  It is their tragic stories that remind us to be conscious of our behaviour on the roads with the aim of reducing the number of road traffic injuries and fatalities.</P>
        <P>The RSA marked the day by distributing more than 300,000 road safety DVDs featuring a series of instructional rules of the road advertisements, including keeping one&rsquo;s distance, cornering, overtaking, making a right-hand turn, motorway driving and using a roundabout.  The authority also distributed more than 300,000 reflective armbands targeting vulnerable road users.</P>
        <P>One purpose of the day of remembrance is to highlight the devastating effect road traffic accidents have on people&rsquo;s lives, whether through the inconsolable loss of a loved one or the fact of living with the consequences of a serious injury.  How this day came about shows us that ordinary people can make a difference and that road safety concerns everyone, not just policy makers.  It began in a small way in 1993 with events in the United Kingdom organised by Road Peace, a national charity for road traffic victims and it went from strength to strength.  Three years ago in 2005 it became the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims endorsed by the United Nations.</P>
        <P>The day is characterised by events and services, often organised by local groups and victims&rsquo; organisations to remind all of us of the dangers of using roads and to show solidarity with those who are or who know road traffic victims.  The day is an opportunity to highlight road safety and the initiatives of the Road Safety Authority demonstrate that, especially in the manner it chose to do so, by trying to make a practical difference through the provision of educational and visibility aids to improve road user behaviour.</P>
        <P>The world day of remembrance, along with other similarly broad and international events, features in the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy for 2007 to 2012.  Action 14 of that strategy recognises the remembrance day and the fact that such events have a part to play in promoting road safety awareness.  The authority is rightly the lead agency for that action and is tasked accordingly.</P>
        <P>Shortly before the world day of remembrance my Department and the Road Safety Authority took part in another action 14 event, the more formal European Road Safety Day, and took the opportunity to launch Irish road safety week on that day.  Experts from Ireland, Europe and the USA joined 200 delegates at an international conference on road safety hosted by the Road Safety Authority on 13 October 2008.  The conference was addressed by top level experts from major Irish and international organisations working in road safety, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, the Health Service Executive, Volvo and the National Roads Authority.  Topics for the conference included alcohol as a factor in road deaths, risk behaviour in young male drivers and advances in in-car technology.</P>
        <P>Overall, Ireland has seen a reduction in fatalities with last year having one of the lowest number of fatality rates in recent years.  Eleven years ago, in 1997, some 472 people died on our roads.  Last year the figure was 339.  The reduction is despite large increases in the number of vehicles on the roads, in the general population and in the number of drivers.  Further reductions have been seen this year.  As of today, there were 269 road deaths this year, down 46 on the same period last year.  According to the European Road Safety Performance Index <Col N="1107"/>programme, which is run by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland is now ranked in the top ten best performing EU countries for road safety performance.</P>
        <P>According to a recent report by the European Transport Safety Council, Dublin has performed particularly well.  It has achieved the best reduction in the number of people killed in the past decade among the 27 European capitals.  A number of factors have contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s falling annual number of road fatalities.  The condition and quality of the road network has improved in the past decade and new thinking and technologies have contributed to the safety of the roads.  The safety features of cars and trucks are improving, which reduces both the risk of collision and the risk of serious injury when collisions occur.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system and the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing of drivers for alcohol, coupled with high visibility enforcement by the Garda, have Ied to significant reductions in fatalities.  The increase in enforcement measures by the Garda has led to a change in attitude, a visible change in behaviour, an improvement in driving habits and a reduction in the number of people who drive senselessly while intoxicated.  There is now a real chance that we can reduce the number of deaths on our roads to under 300 this year.  Even this number is too many.  At the end of the year, there will be 300 families mourning the loss of a loved one as a result of a road traffic accident and the festive season of nearly ten times that number will be ruined because of a family member becoming injured in a road accident.</P>
        <P>The Government has committed itself to road safety and to the road safety strategy for the years 2007 to 2012.  The strategy contains 126 different measures that make reference to what must be done, the agencies responsible and the timescale for each commitment.  The objective is to reduce the number of fatalities to 60 per 1 million, which amounts to 252.  The figure of 300, to which we hope to reduce the number of fatalities this year, will probably be the lowest for 50 or 60 years.  It is extraordinary that 1972, in which year 672 were killed, was the worst year.  There are five times as many cars and motorists today but there is more awareness of road safety in Ireland and abroad.  There is a far greater buy-in to road safety by the general population and there has been a change in culture.  One cannot allow oneself to become complacent, however, because even one death will ruin the lives and Christmas of the victim&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago we visited Cork University Hospital, where the Christmas road safety campaign for this year was launched.  It was very interesting and there was a range of different speakers.  I am used to hearing myself and some of the other speakers but I was very impressed by two of the medical people from the hospital who were speaking from a slightly different perspective.  While I might talk about the number of fatalities, they were talking about the number of injuries.  While fatalities can leave people shocked and saddened, injuries can have life-long consequences.  The medical practitioners were probably speaking to the converted and there is no doubt the talk was very interesting.  Some who might waive some of the tough measures taken in recent years would listen much more if they heard the individuals at Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is one of many reminders to us all that we must not become complacent and must continue to focus our efforts on further reducing the number of victims of road traffic collisions.  The day of remembrance commenced 15 years ago in a small way but has become an international event in recent years.  Many of the road safety groups around the country, which are involved and active, were formed by people who had lost family members.  A group in Donegal, PARC, is very active in promoting road safety in all its facets.  I thank Senator Buttimer for raising the matter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I welcome the fact that the Road Safety Authority is the lead agency.  Can I take it we will have a national remembrance day next November?  The Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution was best when he spoke off <Col N="1108"/>script and I thank him in this regard.  Dr. Chris Luke of Cork University Hospital is probably the leading accident and emergency consultant in the country and he has raised some very interesting points.</P>
        <P>It is important that we keep the issue of road safety to the forefront and recognise the pain and suffering of many affected families, including siblings.  As the Minister stated, the people injured in car crashes can tell a better story than anybody else because, in some cases, they have lingering injuries that affect them for life.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Bhain m&eacute; sult as an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; aige ar an r&uacute;n a d&rsquo;ardaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir Buttimer, mar cheist iontach gar do mo chro&iacute; f&eacute;in &iacute;.   B&iacute;odh sin mar at&aacute;, t&aacute; ceist difri&uacute;l le pl&eacute; agam os comhair an tSeanaid anocht, ceist faoi east&aacute;t tith&iacute;ochta at&aacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il ag Cl&uacute;id in Bundoran i gContae D&uacute;n na nGall.  I wish to refer to the voluntary housing scheme that Cl&uacute;id operates in the Silverhill estate in Bundoran, County Donegal.  Cl&uacute;id provided 46 houses in the estate.  It receives funding of up to 90% of the total value for such developments.  I understand in the region of &euro;5.4 million was allocated for the scheme in Bundoran.  The work Cl&uacute;id has been doing, not only in the north west but throughout the State, is to be welcomed.  The association has provided up to 3,000 units of social housing in estates and is to be commended on this.</P>
        <P>Despite this, the tenants in the estate in Bundoran have serious problems that have been unresolved for many years.  I have seen the estate at first hand and I spoke to people who are suffering because of the difficulties they are experiencing.  The problem is that the ESB bills for heating the houses &mdash; they use a storage heating system &mdash; are excessively high, amounting to up to &euro;600 every two months.  My electricity Bill was posted to me just this week and it was close to the average for a house, that is, just above &euro;100.  These tenants were on the county council waiting list and have become tenants in the voluntary housing estate.  The consequence of the tenants receiving bills of &euro;600 is that they are forced to leave their accommodation.  They are unable to afford to pay such large sums and therefore the houses are not meeting the needs of those on low incomes or the disadvantaged families for which they were designed to cater.  A family left the estate in the past fortnight because of the electricity bills.</P>
        <P>The affected families face problems as they attempt to be rehoused given that they have left their Cl&uacute;id homes voluntarily, as stated by the county council.  In some cases they have left bills unpaid.  Other difficulties arise in addition to the high cost of electricity.  Cl&uacute;id has acknowledged that there is a problem and that the heating system it provided initially has not been the best, to say the least.  It estimates it would cost approximately &euro;250,000 to have the existing system replaced with a more efficient one.  It has applied to the Department for this funding but it is not optimistic it will receive a positive response.  I hope the Minister of State will have a positive response this afternoon.</P>
        <P>Two other relevant issues arise, the first of which is that all the tenants are forced to pay &euro;3 per week as a maintenance levy.  They are questioning what it is for because there are many problems in the estate.  One problem, for example, is that the smoke blows down the chimneys in a number of the houses unless the doors are left open.  This is just making it harder to heat the houses.  The second issue pertaining to the scheme, which is nearly eight years old, is that, under Cl&uacute;id&rsquo;s terms of reference for each unit provided, &euro;7,000 was to be made available to the community fund.  This was to equate to &euro;320,000 for community projects.  There are many community projects such as the playgroup in Bundoran that could avail of this funding.  That funding still has not been made available, and perhaps that could be investigated.  I know I did not ask this in the question I have laid before the Seanad but perhaps those issues might be investigated as well.</P><Col N="1109"/>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will have some positive response to make because this situation is forcing families on the county council waiting list into serious debt and to leave voluntary housing.  It is a unique situation because Cl&uacute;id has a good reputation, and for one reason or another this problem has remained unresolved for many years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Doherty for raising this matter.  I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Michael Finneran, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on issues pertaining to social and voluntary housing and co-operative housing in particular.</P>
        <P>This has been the best year on record in terms of investment in voluntary and co-operative housing.  The overall investment this year will be in the region of &euro;390 million, an increase of &euro;127 million on 2007.  Starts within the sector reached record levels last year and this trend has continued through 2008.  This positions us well to meet the challenging target of 6,000 new starts by the voluntary and co-operative sector for the 2007 to 2009 period, as set out in the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</P>
        <P>The provision of high quality accommodation by approved housing bodies is an integral part of the Department&rsquo;s overall response to delivering on social housing need.  The voluntary and co-operative housing sector is a valued partner in providing homes for low income families and for persons with special housing needs, including the elderly, the homeless and persons with an intellectual or physical disability.</P>
        <P>In the past 25 years the voluntary and co-operative housing sector has delivered 22,000 units of accommodation nationally.  Cl&uacute;id Housing Association is a not-for-profit, approved housing body and has been the second biggest provider of voluntary housing in Ireland over recent years.</P>
        <P>The Cl&uacute;id housing scheme at Magheracar, Bundoran, was completed in 2001 with the aid of a grant of &euro;5.4 million under the Department&rsquo;s capital assistance scheme.  The Magheracar scheme consists of 46 three-bedroom houses.  Tenants were drawn from the Bundoran Town Council social housing list.  The heating in use is the ESB&rsquo;s Goldshield electric storage system.  Storage heaters are provided in the hallway, living room and kitchen with electric wall heaters installed in bedrooms.  In addition, there is an open fire in all living rooms.</P>
        <P>In 2002, residents advised Cl&uacute;id of their concerns in relation to the efficiency of the system and the high energy costs over the winter period.  In response to this, Cl&uacute;id undertook an examination of the system by a qualified professional to ensure it had been properly installed and that it was operating efficiently.  Cl&uacute;id also sought the assistance of the ESB to monitor usage and to advise on operational issues.  The examination concluded that the system was properly installed but, in many cases, it was not being operated in the most cost-effective manner.  The system is designed to give optimum cost efficiency when 80% of electricity is used at the night rate.  The examination showed that night counted for about 50% energy usage on average and this had a major impact on cost.</P>
        <P>I share the Senator&rsquo;s concern that tenants should not be over-burdened in terms of energy and heating costs.  The Department&rsquo;s social housing investment programme is focused on delivering high quality housing that is energy efficient and sustainable.  Housing practitioners have been proactive in incorporating energy efficiency considerations into their housing schemes, well in advance of the new standards set out in the recently revised Part L of the building regulations.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senator Doherty will appreciate that my Department&rsquo;s primary role in relation to voluntary housing is to ensure sufficient funding is provided to meet the ongoing demand for new schemes.  Operation and maintenance costs are, in the first instance, a matter for the individual housing bodies.  The Department will ask Donegal County Council, which is responsible for the administration of the voluntary housing schemes in the county and which nom<Col N="1110"/>inates tenants for schemes, to liaise with the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association on the matter of the energy costs for this estate and advise on how these might be minimised into the future.</P>
        <P>I realise that reply is rather general and does not address what the Senator has asked about whether an application has been submitted for the replacement of the scheme.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I recall that someone was saying at that stage that these were built as summer homes.  However, that might be an urban legend rather than fact.  I hear what the Senator is saying, however.  It might well be that Cl&uacute;id has been talking to Donegal County Council.  It does not appear from this reply that the council has made any submission for replacement yet.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty referred to a maintenance levy, and that is probably to insist the systems are maintained.  I seem to recall a scheme somewhere else a few years ago where there were problems.  It might have been a different type of system, but tenants were not maintaining it and there were some health concerns because of fumes.  It may be that people have to pay a maintenance levy so that this is done.</P>
        <P>On another issue, the Senator mentioned a figure of &euro;7,000 which will be spent on community projects.  When schemes such as this are built, if memory serves me correctly, there is a capital grant per unit for developments such as day care centres or community buildings.  That is always done at the time the development is built.  Sometimes it can be part of the project or might be contributed or joined in with some other project that is taking place.  The money is normally drawn down at the time the building is taking place.  It is for capital building, not operational costs or whatever as mentioned by the Senator.  I have been asked that the records be checked to confirm the situation.  Normally, it would be part of the scheme.  However, sometimes, if some other group was providing other facilities nearby, the money might be transferred from them.  However, it would have been up to the applicants at the time to draw down the 46 times &euro;7,000.  They would have been rather foolish if for some reason they did not draw that down, unless it was parked because there was a greater plan for it.  I am taking this matter for the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, but I can ask him to examine the issue and see what the record showed at the time.  Normally, that money would be spent at the construction stage, unless it was parked because of some adjoining project under consideration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I appreciate that he will raise the issue of the &euro;320,000 with the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and inform him that a representative from Cl&uacute;id addressed Bundoran Town Council earlier this summer and said the money was still available to be drawn down and that the Department was waiting on an application from the community.  This matter has been going on for eight years and I would appreciate if it was referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, because it might just be the push required to get the money drawn down.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for the frankness displayed in his response to the other issues.  The representative of Cl&uacute;id &mdash; as I have been informed by Councillor Michael McMahon in Bundoran, who addressed the meeting in Bundoran &mdash; told those attending that an application had gone to the Department, but a positive response was not expected.  Cl&uacute;id also contacted Donegal County Council, but it does not have funds available to remedy the situation.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to bring to the attention of Deputy Finneran again the fact that an application has been made.  Perhaps he will correspond with me on the matter and see if anything can be done, even in the interim, to help alleviate the problems in which these tenants find themselves.</P>
