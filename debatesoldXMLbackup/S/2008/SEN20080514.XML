	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ivor Callely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the proposal to move the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to confirm that funding will be provided to ensure September placements for those young people with disabilities leaving school in June 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline progress on the Seven Villages sewerage scheme in County Waterford, with particular attention to the Cappoquin sewerage scheme and the reason its progress is being delayed due to the proposed introduction of a new tender procedure that a Department working group is putting together and is not expected to have finalised for the next few months.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline his policy in relation to the possible development of private incinerator facilities which may be developed at Behan&rsquo;s Quarry, Rathcoole, County Dublin and his overall approach and policy to the development of such facilities by private companies and whether and how they conform to national waste management policy.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to ensure the metro construction works in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Dublin cause minimal damage to the environment and the least possible inconvenience to the public.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Callely, Corrigan and Coffey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken on the conclusion of business.  I regret I have had <Col N="678"/>to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Fitzgerald as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ross as the matter is anticipatory of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 which is currently before the House.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Statements on Rural Development; No. 2, Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 &mdash; Second Stage; and No. 17, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 38 re the economic outlook.  It is proposed that No.1, Statements on Rural Development, will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and will conclude not later than 1.45 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time by leave of the House, with the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from leaders.  No. 2, Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007 &mdash; Second Stage, will be taken on the conclusion of No. 1.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes, all other Senators for seven minutes and Senators may share time by agreement of the House.  No. 17, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 38 re the economic outlook, will be taken on the conclusion of No. 2.  The business of the House will be interrupted from 1.45 p.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Deas&uacute;n Mac an Easpaig at&aacute; anseo linn inniu.  I congratulate Senator Mark Daly on asking Mr. Des Bishop to meet Members of the Oireachtas who are attending Irish classes and trying to improve their fluency.  The initiative Mr. Bishop has undertaken has been great and it will be very encouraging to many who would like to improve their fluency.  Having spent so many years in the classroom, we are all disappointed that we do not have the fluency we desire.  I hope Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s going to live in the Gaeltacht and developing fluency will be of great encouragement to a new generation in becoming fluent.  I am sure Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who has done so much in this area, will join me in saying this.</P>
        <P>I want to discuss aid for Burma and the circumstances in that country.  The French foreign minister called on the world yesterday to deliver aid without the agreement of the junta leaders who are proving very resistant to the sending of aid to Burma.  We await an all-party motion on Burma in the House.  Perhaps the Leader will clarify the position of the Irish Government on Burma.  I hope we will be able to use our credibility at European level.  We have such credibility because of the amount of money we donate in aid.  I hope our Minister for Foreign Affairs can intercede or do some work on this issue to ensure aid is received by the people who need it most.  Perhaps the new Minister of State responsible for overseas aid, Deputy Peter Power, can come to the House to discuss this early next week when we are considering the motion on Burma, which I hope will be agreed by every Member of the House.</P>
        <P>Yet again, a very small number of women &mdash; two out of 20 &mdash; have been appointed as Ministers of State.  This is a stark reflection of the small number of women in the Oireachtas overall.  We have one of the smallest numbers in Europe.  Even on a worldwide scale, our figure of 13% is very low.  It behoves all political parties in the run-up to the local and European elections to take positive action on the issue of gender in politics because there is such an imbalance.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of the appointments requires clarification by the Leader.  Why has the portfolio of arts been given to a Minister of State?  Reports state that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will now deal with sport and tourism while the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, will be responsible for the Office of Public Works and arts.  The arts community will <Col N="679"/>be very concerned about this development and it needs clarification in the days to come.  Has responsibility been given totally to a Minister of State, as has been reported, or will the Minister still have some function in this area?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Frances Fitzgerald, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r mar gheall ar an Ghaelainn.  Gan amhras, d&rsquo;iarr m&eacute; go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an Ghaelainn c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin.  At that stage the Leader indicated he would be happy to have a debate on Irish language development.  Ba mhaith liom go m&oacute;r go nd&eacute;anf&aacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach ag an bpointe seo.  &Oacute; thaobh na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Frances Fitzgerald agus ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute;, ba mhaith an rud &eacute; go mbeadh an t&aacute;bhar sin pl&eacute;ite againn.  Gn&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach den &aacute;bhar seo n&aacute; an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l mar gheall ar thumoideachas sna gaelscoileanna, modh m&uacute;inte lena bhfuil m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, tuismitheoir&iacute; agus boird bainist&iacute;ochta na scoileanna an-s&aacute;sta.  Mar sin f&eacute;in, t&aacute; an Rialtas ag cur ina choinne.  Bh&iacute; an tAire go dt&iacute; seo ag cur ina choinne chomh maith.  N&rsquo;fheadar an bhfuil aon athr&uacute; aigne ar an Aire nua.  Ba mhaith liom go bpl&eacute;ifear an t&aacute;bhar seo.</P>
        <P>An Adjournment matter of mine was ruled out of order because it was anticipatory of a Bill before the House.  This ruling is new to me.  I am sure there is a very good reason but I would like it explained.  I believed it could only be ruled out of order if the Minister had no responsibility for the matter.  I am not challenging the ruling but would like it explained, not necessarily now.</P>
        <P>I believed we had an understanding that Private Members&rsquo; time on Wednesday would begin at 5 p.m. rather than on the conclusion of No. 2.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies.  It will be from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is okay.  There was a commitment to have a debate on Burma next Tuesday.  I expected to see the motion on the Order Paper today.  Can we expect to see it tomorrow?</P>
        <P>Some who are against the European treaty might consider an aspect of European foreign policy with which they might agree.  Individuals such as I, who support the treaty, would be very opposed to President Sarkozy and all he stands for, yet I must stand back and admire the stand he has taken recently on China and Burma and on other matters.  We need straight talking in European diplomacy and I look forward to discussing this in more detail next Tuesday when we have a debate on it.  Will the Leader confirm that such a debate will take place, such that we can discuss these issues and related matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Senator&rsquo;s point on the Adjournment matter, Senator Donohoe dealt with it in great detail when considering the Bill yesterday.  It is to be considered again tomorrow.  I can talk to the Senator afterwards about my reason for ruling the matter out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  Is it a matter that could be agreed upon at some stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Certainly, at any time in the future.  The Bill is still being considered in the House at present and will not be completed until tomorrow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Deas&uacute;n Mac an Easpaig freisin.  He spoke to us this morning at the Irish class and made a very inspirational speech about his time in the Gaeltacht and about how much Irish he learned and how quickly.  We <Col N="680"/>can all learn from this and we are all grateful to him for visiting.  I thank Senator Daly for facilitating the visit.</P>
        <P>I was relieved this morning to see the two-yearly report by the ESRI which predicts growth of 27% over the next eight years up to 2015.  This growth will not be achieved by default and will require hard work.  The report is quite clear in stating jobs will be lost in some sectors, such as manufacturing, but there will be job opportunities in other sectors, such as financial services, but only if we plan for them, retrain staff and invest in making it easier for people to go back to school.  We must ensure the availability of faster broadband and deliver new infrastructure on time and within budget.  There is nothing to fear economically over the next eight to ten years provided the Government makes the steps necessary to prepare for the changes in the jobs market.</P>
        <P>The report also expresses concern over certain issues.  It states we will not meet our targets for greenhouse gas emissions and we need to recycle more.  This morning I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government talking on the radio about the environment and I was especially concerned about his comments on waste management.  He did not inspire confidence at all and his contribution was closer to performance art than a serious attempt to tackle the issue.  If the Green Party is to make an impression in Government, it should deliver on waste management.</P>
        <P>As with Senator Fitzgerald, I was disappointed by the composition of the Ministries of State yesterday.  Of 20 appointees, only two are female, Deputies Mary Wallace and M&aacute;ire Hoctor.  This amounts to only 10%.  I cannot believe the Taoiseach could not find good, competent women that would be able to join the ranks of Ministers of State.  In the Leader&rsquo;s constituency there is a Mary who would have done a very good job.  The Taoiseach could have looked inside our own Chamber, where there is a Cecelia and a D&eacute;irdre who would have been admirable candidates.  The Taoiseach took the lazy option.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Although he could have appointed more women he took the lazy option, which does not bode well for the performance of the Government.  This is more of the same but had he taken some courage, he could have helped to change the country for the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the prerogative of the Taoiseach, not of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>My constituency does not have a Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate Mr. Des Bishop on the highly enlightening and inspiring series of programmes he aired recently on television.  I congratulate Senator Daly for inviting him to Leinster House to speak to the Irish class this morning.  The beauty of Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s recent series was that it shows that with a virtually complete immersion in our language and culture, combined with a dedicated effort on the part of people to acquire a language, this can be done in a reasonably short time.  The most inspirational part of the programme was when Mr. Bishop met a Korean in Times Square, New York, who has never set foot in Ireland but who spoke fluent Irish with a beautiful Connemara blas.</P>
        <P>The newly-appointed Minister for Education and Science should come before the House to discuss the manner in which our native language is taught in our schools.  I have an 11 year old son who is of average intelligence.  Up to now he has spent six years in our national system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope he is not listening.</P>

	<P>B&iacute;onn m&eacute; ag iarraidh caint leis i nGaeilge beagnach an t-am go l&eacute;ir, ach beagnach an t-am go l&eacute;ir n&iacute;l s&eacute; in ann m&eacute; a thuiscint.  Members must ask themselves why, after six years in our national school system, I cannot carry out a basic conversation in Irish with my son.  He has reasonable competence, has had excellent teachers and Members must ask how effective is the system whereby our language is taught.  At this point, we must have one aim only, that is, upon departure from the national school system a child could be dropped into the middle of Connemara and would be able to hold a basic conversation with a native speaker.  This is not being achieved and Members must ask the Minister to examine the issue in a new, fresh and innovative manner.  I would greatly welcome the opportunity to speak on that issue, should the Minister choose to appear in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was unable to facilitate a few Senators yesterday and I will take them first.  I call Senator Coghlan.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom freisin f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh Des Bishop.  His efforts to popularise the Irish language are wonderful.  I agree with the comments about him by the other speakers, as he gave a lovely talk this morning.  Hopefully many of us amad&aacute;ns will be much more proficient as Gaeilge when we receive this total immersion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Wonderful teachers have been allocated to this course and all those who intend to participate look forward to joining them in the Gaeltacht in due course.  I wish to compliment Senator Daly, as well as Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Joe O&rsquo;Toole and all Members who have helped over the years without such assistance, both to use our language and to show other Members they can use it too.  I wish Mr. Des Bishop well in his talks with the new Minister for Education and Science because he has some good and interesting ideas about how our language can be better taught.  It reverts to the points made by Senator Cannon and it is to be hoped that some good will flow from this.</P>
        <P>On the appointment of the Ministers of State, whom I congratulate, I have a particular interest in the appointment to the Office of Public Works, of Members&rsquo; former colleague in the Seanad, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  It pertains to an issue already touched on by Senator Fitzgerald, namely, the attachment to the Office of Public Works of the arts, which is highly interesting.  I also seek clarification from the Leader as to whether arts is being separated from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism or whether the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, will continue to have some involvement in arts.  It is long overdue that our built heritage should be entirely within the remit of the Office of Public Works and not scattered between that office and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This is a fallacy and is wrong.  Our magnificent State properties should be together under the aegis of the Office of Public Works.  I have made representations to the former Taoiseach on the matter and I hope to make further representations on the matter to the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen in due course.  However, the Leader should respond in respect of the manner in which responsibility for built heritage is scattered and to clarify the position of arts <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I dtosach, is mian liom aont&uacute; leis na cainteoir&iacute; eile agus an Seanad&oacute;ir Nic Gearailt a d&rsquo;ardaigh ceist na Gaeilge anseo ar maidin.  Th&oacute;g m&eacute; faoi deara le tamall fada anuas go bhfuil borradh nua ann &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de &mdash; n&iacute; amh&aacute;in go bhfuil dea-thoil i gceist, ach go bhfuil daoine ag iarraidh ruda&iacute; praitici&uacute;la a dheanamh chun an Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus a chur chun cinn.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go raibh s&eacute; sin chomh sofheicthe i stair an <Col N="682"/>St&aacute;it is at&aacute; s&eacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach mbeidh an seans seo caillte agus go mbeimid go l&eacute;ir ag obair as l&aacute;mha a ch&eacute;ile.</P>
        <P>I have always believed that it is not the people who are fluent in Irish who will save the language.  Rather, it is those who wish to come forward to take ownership of the language who will do so.  For too long, people have seen Irish as being somewhat elitist when it should be the language of the people.  Paddy McElvaney was one of the founder members of the organisation with which I am connected, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, and he has gone to his eternal reward since then.  However, while he may not have been able to put four or five words together, he challenged the rest of us to do so.  Coming from a person who was not perceived to be an authority on the language or absolutely fluent, I believe he had greater influence and a greater impact than those of us who perhaps had greater knowledge.  This is what I see happening at present.</P>
        <P>I also wish to avail of the opportunity to congratulate all those who have been appointed to the position of Minister of State.  I will be unashamedly parochial in singling out in particular Senator Martin Mansergh on his appointment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I have stated many times that I always have been taken by his integrity at all times.  He is a unique politician in that regard and I do not believe I have ever heard him criticising other people in that context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Certainly, he has a wide knowledge of his portfolio.  He spoke on such issues in this Chamber on many occasions and I look forward to working with him, as well as with all the other Ministers and Ministers of State.  In particular, I take Senator Paul Coghlan&rsquo;s point on our interest in, and commitment to, the built heritage in Ireland.  One could not live in Cashel without saying that, because I look across the Rock of Cashel whenever I am at home.  It reminds me every day of our wonderful heritage.</P>
        <P>I have argued for years that there is something particularly striking in linking the arts, which constitute the living heritage, with our built heritage.  Coming to the Rock of Cashel without having the related living heritage constituted a vacuum and a weakness.  Any Members who visit Cashel are welcome to come to the home of the living heritage at the foot of the rock, Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;, and I look forward to hosting all of them this summer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the welcome given to Mr. Des Bishop by other Members.  I have found him to be an inspiration, particularly to young people.  The programmes he made in the Gaeltacht have been tremendous.  Picking up on Senator Cannon&rsquo;s comments, as education spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in I attended the INTO conference.  The call from the conference was that Des Bishop has done more for the Irish language than has the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>It is important that Members do not only debate and discuss the Irish language when a celebrity such as Des Bishop is present.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="683"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an issue that must be debated.  Moreover, the debate should have happened already.  I have called for such a debate, as have other Members, and it has not taken place.  While Members can say nice things when a celebrity appears on their doorstep, were they sincere about the renewal of the Irish language in the education system and throughout general society, they must stop paying lip service to it.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>A real debate is required and two days or a full week should be set aside in this regard.  If Members feel sufficiently passionate about the Irish language, the House could meet on a Monday or a Friday.  I am a fluent Irish speaker, as are many others in this Chamber.  However, little Irish is spoken here and when it is spoken, no one uses the translation system.  There is a pressure in this regard.  Although many Members wish to make their contributions in their native language, people do not listen to the English version, which is not right.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There must be a proper debate on how we can support the Irish language in this chamber.  There are serious questions about education.  Senator Cannon is right about this.  The reality is that the Minister and the Department of Education and Science are now ending a practice that is successful and has been so for decades.  That is the early Irish language immersion in our Gaelscoileanna.  It is ridiculous that this is happening.  The previous Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was trying to fix something that was not broken.  It is an attack on the Gaelscoileanna which are outside the Gaeltacht.  Students coming out of them have excellent Irish language abilities.  I cannot fathom this approach.  We need a real debate and I hope the Leader will take this on board.</P>
        <P>Yesterday a number of Senators said that there was no connection between the WTO and the Lisbon treaty.  That is nonsense.  Anybody who saw &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday saw the nonsense that Fine Gael and the Government are peddling on this issue.   Both spokespersons talked about a veto.  When challenged by Sinn F&eacute;in and another member of the panel they said that no international trade agreements are by qualified majority voting.  They are repeatedly changing their tune.  The reality is that Article 188 takes international trade agreements away from the principle of unanimity and into the area of qualified majority voting.  The Trade Commissioner, Mr. Peter Mandelson, has a mandate from the Commission to enter into the negotiations but the outcome of these must be agreed by the Council of Ministers after the Lisbon treaty is ratified.  After Lisbon, that veto is removed.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise a second issue, that of the arts.  The appointment of Deputy Mansergh to the position of Minister of State with responsibility for arts means that the arts are in a very safe pair of hands.  The questions that arise concern funding, the battle at budget times and the status of junior versus senior Ministers.  I welcome that the position has been established so that somebody can deal with this area.  When it is under the aegis of Arts, Sports and Tourism, it can get lost among the sectionalism of sport and tourism.  While I accept Deputy Mansergh to be a safe pair of hands, I am anxious that the House should have clarification on matters such as funding and status.</P>
        <P>Through the Leader I ask the Taoiseach to consider consolidation of those involved in the Department of the Marine.  Including junior and senior Ministers, five or six are  involved in different aspects of the marine.  It must be very difficult for them to co-ordinate and it is difficult for Members to know who is in charge of particular aspects.</P>
        <P>I welcome those Ministers who were appointed and I offer my commiseration to my county colleague, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, and also to Deputies John Brown and Michael Ahern, who have been stepped down in this instance.  I wish well to all, to those who have taken up their new positions and to those who remain in their existing positions.</P>

	<P>There is widespread acceptance across both sides of the House of the need for continued investment in public infrastructure and for maintaining focus on how it will be delivered.  It has always been apparent that the cost of making this happen is immense.  We have all acknowledged as much and there has been much discussion about it.  </P>
        <P>It is becoming increasingly apparent that there will be another cost for the delivery of the infrastructure, particularly in Dublin, in terms of the upheaval that will take place in the city when many elements of Transport 21 take place.  The best example of this, and one which is <Col N="685"/>now beginning to cause public debate, concerns what is to happen to St Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  This is the site of the new metro stop, of big works for the inter-connector, and probably also for expansion of the Luas service.  I call again on the Leader to facilitate a debate in this House on Transport 21.</P>
        <P>The Leader has had many requests to organise a debate on the status of Transport 21, to allow Members to discover how the project stands and to put points of view across on these points.  This has not happened.  Two issues are becoming increasingly apparent.  The first is that greater clarity is needed about how these projects are to happen.  There is a growing and worrying perception that the city of Dublin will be closed while these projects are being delivered.   This causes great concern to businesses within the area.  The second point concerns what will occur with the projects in St Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  There must be a much greater focus on the design of the buildings and works.  Everybody will pay a big price when this happens and we must ensure that what will be in place will be genuinely beautiful.</P>
        <P>I lend support to my colleagues who have called for a debate on the Lisbon treaty.  I wish to make it clear, however, that I will not take lectures from Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody else on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.</P>

	<P>I welcome the ESRI report this morning on the very positive economic outlook that lies ahead.  It carries with it a health warning.  We run the risk of becoming transfixed by the present economic difficulties and thus missing out on opportunities.  What the report tells us is that we must plan.  There is no shortage of ideas and plans coming from this House, and from the D&aacute;il.  </P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the question of the number of women involved in politics.   The Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU, recently published a report on gender equality.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, <Col N="686"/>to discuss the implications of the report for Ireland.  The report places this country firmly at the bottom of world ratings concerning involvement of women in politics.  Within the D&aacute;il, the figure is 13%, in Seanad &Eacute;ireann it is 20%.  Overall the percentage is very low and leaves us behind other European countries and countries such as Sierra Leone.  Even in Iraq, a quota system of 25% has been introduced.  We must all get involved.  It is not just about what women are appointed to Government.  As an insufficient number of women are elected in the first instance, it is difficult to appoint them when they are not available.  We have an opportunity through the Oireachtas school programme to do something in this regard.  When we are in local schools we should encourage young girls as well as young boys to take an interest in politics because we need a more balanced approach.</P>
        <P>Since my appointment to the Seanad I have raised the issue of the legislative deficit that exists for people with disabilities with regard to their legal entitlements concerning decision making.  I welcome the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is working on a capacity Bill.  Is there is a timeframe for when that legislation might be ready and introduced in the House?</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na daoine a d'fhreastal ar an rang Gaeilge inniu. I congratulate those who have attended.  At least three Members of this House are attending French classes.  Those who have organised language classes in both French and Irish are to be congratulated on the arrangements that have been made.  I was in France yesterday and I was impressed to see a number of signs in the airport about avian flu.  I read an article by Muiris Houston in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday which drew attention to the fact that there is concern about this issue in America.  The World Health Organisation has said that the threat of an avian flu pandemic has not diminished.  Ireland has a pandemic influenza expert group.  According to the article I mentioned, if there is a pandemic of avian flu, decisions will have to be made in America, and I would imagine they would have to be made here too, about treatment.</P>
        <P>There are not enough facilities to cater for everybody in a pandemic so decisions will be made that those who are least valuable or most likely to contract the disease should not have the benefit of the care that otherwise would be given.  A report published in America, Definitive Care for the Critically Ill During a Disaster, states that people of a certain age would probably have to manage without care.  If such a decision must be made, it is worthy of debate.  It is now being debated in America but not here.  We should consider having a debate on the issue.  It is suggested that people over 60 will have to do without care, so I have a vested interest in this.  The Leader should ensure we have that debate as the subject is worthy of it.  The possibility of avian flu occurring has not gone away.  I did not notice any signs about avian flu in Dublin Airport, although they might have been there, but the signs were dramatically apparent on entering France.  We must keep our attention on this issue.</P>

        <P>I admire Des Bishop for going to the Gaeltacht and giving an example of how one can improve one&rsquo;s Irish.  I intend to improve my Irish so I can have the confidence to participate in more debates in the Seanad through Irish.  I also echo the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others regarding the policy of tomoideachas or total immersion in the Irish language.</P><Col N="687"/>
        <P>The previous Minister for Education and Science indicated that it was the Department&rsquo;s intention to introduce a policy whereby half an hour of English would be taught to children in their second year of education in gaelscoileanna.  This is a break with the established policy of total immersion in the Irish language for the first two years of attending a gaelscoil.  I hope the new Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, will reconsider this ill-thought out policy.  It appears from the public meetings I have attended and the lobbying on this issue that the policy is not based on research or best practice in other countries, which have shown that where a policy of total immersion in the minority language, such as Irish, occurs, it does not interfere with but actually enhances children&rsquo;s ability to acquire the majority language.  I hope the Department&rsquo;s policy will be reconsidered.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators who voiced their concern about the small number of women who have been appointed to the office of Minister of State.  It is a matter of concern, although I congratulate all the Ministers of State who were appointed yesterday by the Taoiseach.  This House should examine the issue of how to promote more women to positions such as Minister of State.  It is true that if there are not enough women in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, it will not be possible to appoint women to those positions when opportunities arise such as the Taoiseach had yesterday.  I ask the Leader to facilitate that debate, perhaps in the context of the IPU report, during which we could examine the issue of women&rsquo;s participation in politics and what the Houses of the Oireachtas can do to promote greater participation.</P>
        <P>There is another issue I wish to raise and I hope you will bear with me, a Chathaoirligh, given that you said you did not want a debate on the Lisbon treaty on the Order of Business.  However, I have heard representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in make the point that if Irish farmers support the Lisbon treaty, Ireland will lose its veto on negotiations within the World Trade Organisation on agriculture.

	<P Just="Left">I listened with interest to my colleague, Senator Donohoe, when he outlined his concerns about the infrastructural development of the city of Dublin.  The Dublin City Business Association made a worthy and fine presentation to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment this morning.  When the representatives of the association expressed concerns about certain issues, they spoke positively about the development and economic growth of the city.  They praised what has happened over recent years.  Much of the progress that has been made can be attributed to the work of the Dublin City Business Association.  I wanted to draw that to Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to contact the relevant authorities to ascertain whether a review of this country&rsquo;s water safety policies is being undertaken.  As we approach the summer, I am reflecting on the death of a friend of my young son, who was tragically killed off the west coast last year.  A number of people suffer tragedy throughout the summer months, which is when we usually try to enjoy water activities.  There has been an increase in the use of motorised equipment, such as jet skis, on the water but we have failed to put appropriate regulations in place.  I am not happy that a person can buy a jet ski or motorboat of any size, jump on it and do whatever they want with it, wherever they want.  The Leader should ask the authorities to outline what they are doing to put in place the recommendations and proposals which are required.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the hundreds of volunteer workers from various aid agencies and non-governmental organisations who undertake tremendous work, particularly in response to disasters like those in Burma and China.  They are tackling huge challenges and obstacles in such areas.  I understand that in Burma, approximately 34,000 people have died, approximately 28,000 people are missing and approximately 1.8 million people are homeless.  Equally, a humanitarian crisis is developing in China as a result of the recent disaster there.  If we allow man-made obstacles to disrupt the work of these tremendous aid agencies, something is radically wrong.  There is a need for some kind of humanitarian rapid response unit.  I propose that the leaders of all parties in the House should agree an all-party motion to allow aid agencies to carry out the humanitarian work that is required.</P>

The problem with the teaching of the Irish language in this country is that one&rsquo;s association with the language ends when one leaves secondary school.  I congratulate Des Bishop for reawakening the debate on Irish.  He has highlighted the usefulness of immersion education, in particular.  Attempts to deny the merits of that method are not worthwhile.  We need to learn lessons from it.  I question the methodology that is used to teach Irish in our schools.  I commend Senators O&rsquo;Toole and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for using their Munster Irish.  Equally, the former Senator, Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; Riain, used a great deal of Irish when he was a Member of this House.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Keaveney that a separate marine Department needs to be established.  That there is no Minister for the marine at Cabinet level is a huge disadvantage, not only for public representatives who have to deal with the many aspects of the marine sector, but also for those who are involved in the industry.  It is not good enough that a sector which should be covered by a full Ministry is dispersed across five or six Departments.  It restricts the ability of the Government to deal with marine issues in a coherent manner.  As the marine sector, which is worth &euro;3 billion per annum, represents a substantial part of the economy, it deserves a full Cabinet Minister, some Ministers of State and a dedicated group of civil servants.</P>

	<P>I join other Senators in asking the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to come to the House to discuss the ongoing World Trade Organisation talks.  Such a debate would be timely in the context of the link that is currently being made by certain groups between the WTO and the Lisbon treaty.  While we have to agree the Lisbon treaty, we do not have to sign a WTO agreement.  In light of the current global food crisis, we may be better off if a world trade agreement is not reached.  We could reach bilateral agreements to ensure there is equity and fairness in global trade.  It would be detrimental &mdash; it would bring the EU into disrepute, as I have previously said &mdash; to ask for a reduction in production at a time when there are food shortages throughout the world.  I suggest that a debate on this matter be arranged at an early stage.  I do not believe a WTO agreement is needed.  However, the Lisbon treaty is an imperative if the EU is to work properly.</P>

As a former educator, I am ashamed to say I have realised for some time that we are not teaching Irish in the right way.  Des Bishop took a great deal of value from the year he spent in the Gaeltacht.  By the time most children sit the leaving certificate, they will have spent 14 years learning Irish.  It does not add up.  The modhanna m&uacute;inte, or methodologies, we are using are incorrect.  We do not compare favourably with other European countries, in which 18 year old students have learned three or four languages.  I invite the new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to come to the House to outline his vision for Gaeilge.  What does he intend to do to change things?  I am not looking for a debate right now.  I know he is a new Minister.  I would like him to make a statement outlining his vision for education in general.  The bishops have led the way by issuing a statement of their vision for education.  It is time for the Government to lead the way by setting out its vision.  We need to examine what is working well in Irish language teaching.  We need to focus on approaches like the tumoideachais model, which is a winner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Chair&rsquo;s decision to allow me to speak.  I congratulate the former Senator, Deputy Mansergh, on being appointed as a Minister of State.  The portfolio that has been allocated to him may appear to have been downgraded, but it is up to him to make it clear that is not the case.  Perhaps he could do that by coming to this House at an early date to discuss some of the motions on the Order Paper, such as No. 4, which relates to the Abbey Theatre.  The redevelopment of the theatre has been held up for a long time by the peculiar selfishness and greed of certain developers and the pusillanimous attitude of the central authorities in not dealing with and confronting the problem.  There was a legal issue at stake, but it has apparently been resolved.  The possibility that the Abbey Theatre, which is a national cultural institution, could be moved to the north end of O&rsquo;Connell Street, which everybody agrees is the best place for it, is starting to open up again.  The authorities gave up on that prospect too soon.  I suggest that the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, should come to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>His appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the arts is an interesting one.  While it may appear that the position has been downgraded, I do not believe that is the case.  This responsibility has been given to an active person who has been a senior advisor to many Taoisigh and carries a great deal of weight at Government level.</P><Col N="691"/>
        <P>While I share Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s concerns about the effect of certain works on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, we should look at the matter in a positive way.  We should ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss this issue.  Perhaps we will get an opportunity to do so in the context of the final section of the transport Bill.  International practice has shown that it is quite possible to take up mature trees, tub them, maintain them and eventually replace them.  We need a commitment that St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, which is loved by Irish people, will be restored as it is.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by speaking about the metro stations.  I feel strongly that we are in danger of doing the usual Irish thing of spoiling the ship for a hap&rsquo;orth of tar.  The Dublin Port tunnel has been a considerable success in diverting articulated trucks away from the city centre.  What have we done with it?  We are not proud of it.  We are ashamed of it.  We have left it there in a hobbledehoy fashion.  As I said in a letter to the newspapers, it looks like a bit of an old hoover that landed from outer space.  If we were to spend approximately &euro;150,000 to dress it up properly, we could make a statement about how proud we are of it.  Let us ensure that we will not have horrible, crude, exposed concrete in the metro stations.  Let us use artefacts from the National Museum in recessed glass cases, like they do in the Louvre m&eacute;tro station in Paris.  For God&rsquo;s sake, let us spend a little bit extra and be proud of our culture and city.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify again that Private Members&rsquo; business will be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. today.  I want to say comhghairdeas to Seanad&oacute;ir Mark Daly and Mr. Des Bishop for what they have been doing concerning the Irish language.  Mr. Bishop&rsquo;s presence at the committee this morning was very uplifting for the language.  I can only agree with the views of various Senators as to what Mr. Bishop has contributed so far.  I also include our new Taoiseach in this regard because he has also lifted the language to a new plane.  He has got the plain people of Ireland interested in the language again because he is a rural representative and a man of the people.  The public are extremely impressed by his contribution to the Irish language so far.</P>
        <P>Over the past 50 years, the situation has never looked better for the Irish language than it does now, as so many people are taking our language seriously.  I congratulate everyone concerned.  Down through the years, many eminent Senators have made an immeasurable contribution to the language, including Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and O&rsquo;Toole in the current Seanad.  In response to Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s request, I will allow an all-day debate on the Irish language with the new Minister.  In fairness, previous Seanaid always held a major debate on the Irish language once a year.  We have not had such a debate in this Seanad but I will try to arrange one before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>As regards the plight of the unfortunate Burmese people, hopefully the all-party motion will be on the Order Paper tomorrow.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be in the House from 3.45 p.m. to 4.45 p.m. for statements next Tuesday.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all the newly appointed Ministers of State.  I thank the former Ministers of State, Deputies Browne, Gallagher and Michael Ahern who have been most helpful in assisting this House in its deliberations during Private Members&rsquo; time, on statements and in dealing with legislation.  They have been of great assistance to the affairs of this House.  They are great colleagues and I look forward to working with them in committees, in their roles as chairpersons, vice-chairpersons or in whatever way the Taoiseach may see fit to use the enormous experience they have gained over the past ten to 15 years in their ministerial portfolios.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the new Ministers of State, Deputy John Moloney, who is a great friend, Deputy Peter Power who has been elevated to the Foreign Affairs portfolio, and Deputy Curran who has been appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for tackling drug abuse, which is a major task.  I wish them well.  Two former Members of this House, Deputies Finneran <Col N="692"/>and Mansergh, were elevated yesterday as Ministers of State.  On my first day as Leader back in 1997, I proposed the then Senator Finneran as spokesperson on Finance.  I wish him well in his new role.  He has vast experience, particularly in the area of local government.  Over the past 25 years, Deputy Mansergh has worked closely with three former Taoisigh.  He was offered the position of special advisor by another Taoiseach but declined to accept it.  He has been held in high regard by all Taoisigh over the past quarter of a century.  He is an eminent person who I am sure will make an immeasurable contribution to his new Department and in particular the arts portfolio.  He is well respected and highly regarded in the areas of heritage and the arts.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris that we would all love to the see the new Abbey Theatre on the Parnell Street end of O&rsquo;Connell Street.  Senator Norris has been championing that part of the city centre, along with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Many of us who have an interest in that area would like to see the Abbey Theatre being relocated there, in proximity to Belvedere College, the Mater Hospital and Croke Park.  It would be lovely to see the national theatre being situated there.  Within the next two weeks, I hope the Minister will attend the House to debate what opportunities there may be in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan and others expressed their views on the ESRI report, which is very uplifting.  The report has come at an opportune time for the Seanad because tonight we will have statements on economic achievements from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Senators will be able to give the Minister the benefit of their advice and experience, as well as debating how they wish to see the country progressing in future.  Today&rsquo;s ESRI report holds out bouquets for former Ministers for Finance, including in particular former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and our present Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  They have presided over the Finance portfolio during the past ten years.  The ESRI report must be a great bonus as it shows that the fundamentals are sound in Ireland, despite the global economic downturn.  We will all be able to contribute to the debate on the Fine Gael motion later today.</P>
        <P>Senators Doherty, Donohoe, de B&uacute;rca, Regan and Hanafin all called for an urgent debate on agriculture and clarification of the Lisbon treaty in particular.  Clarification is urgently needed in that regard.  I am pleased to inform the House that this debate will take place at 11.45 a.m. next Wednesday morning.  All Senators should note that in their diaries.  While not wishing to pre-empt the issue, I understood that one could not put a poster on a pole without identifying the individual, group or political party involved.  The Referendum Commission has a duty to look into this matter.  On the way from Mullingar to Dublin, I saw two types of &ldquo;No&rdquo; poster with no names on them.  I stand open to correction, but I understood that this is illegal.  I will be asking my secretariat today to seek clarification from the Referendum Commission and I will inform the House of the outcome tomorrow morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, when the Leader is seeking that clarification can he also ascertain whether or not the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side&rsquo;s posters, erected before the writ for the referendum was moved, are also illegal?  I want that clarified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Donohoe, Callely and Norris all called for a debate on Transport 21, particularly concerning future developments and the continued large-scale investment which is driving the economy at present.  I will ask the Minister for Transport to attend the House for such debate as soon as possible and definitely before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Frances Fitzgerald, Maria Corrigan and D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca called for a special debate on women in politics, which is opportune.  I congratulate my colleague from County Meath, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Mary Wallace, on her <Col N="693"/>re-appointment as Minister of State yesterday.  She is a neighbour and colleague of Senator Hannigan and of mine.</P>
        <P>We want to encourage as many women as possible to get involved in politics, especially young ladies, but it is not that easy because the electorate decides who is elected.  In the 2002 general election there were seven candidates in County Westmeath; four were ladies and three were men.  However, the three men were elected which shows it is entirely up to the electorate.  Those of us working in the political system should encourage as many ladies as possible to get involved.  It is a tough, hard life, it is not easy and it may not be a very attractive option.</P>
        <P>I thank all those ladies who have made such a great contribution to politics, including all the great standard bearers from Countess Markievicz and Ms Maud Gonne to Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Mary Harney.  We have had tremendous women involved in Irish politics.</P>

	<P>My constituency colleague has made an immeasurable contribution for more than 20 years.  She was the deputy leader of our party for a considerable time too.  I have no difficulty with this debate taking place.</P>
        <P>Senator Maria Corrigan requested the timeframe for the disability legislation.  I understand that the earliest possible timeframe to advance this legislation is by the end of 2008.  I will update the Senator on progress during the year.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn called for a debate on the avian flu epidemic and especially on the consequences for the people most exposed.  This is worthwhile and I will see if this is possible over the next two or three weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Ivor Callely called for a debate on water safety and the dangers of water sports equipment such as jet skis.  Young people have the opportunity to use such equipment now because of the buoyancy in the economy.  I will seek further information from the relevant Minister.  The noise Bill is related legislation and is due to be published before the end of 2008.  As a Senator from the lakes district, I know of the problems that can arise.  It is possible there is an accident or tragedy waiting to happen on some of our lakes, especially this month of May, the month of the mayfly.  The lakes are a significant tourist attraction especially Lough Derravaragh, Lough Sheelin, Lough Glore and Lough Ennell near Mullingar in the midlands.  These lakes represent a significant national resource.  I visited Killaloe, County Clare to see the location of the world water skiing championships many years ago.  It is best that this activity is availed of in a controlled way.  Participants should form a local club in the same way angling clubs have done.  Once local people are in charge, everything can be regulated with the relevant authorities and everyone can work together.  I have no difficulty with a debate on this matter later in the year.</P>
        <P>Senators Michael McCarthy and Cecilia Keaveney called for the new Minister with responsibility for the marine to come to the House to provide an update on the marine sector and hear the views of Senators on the challenges facing the industry.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his reappointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuireann s&eacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith sa Seanad inniu agus deis a bheith agam labhairt faoi fhorbairt na tuaithe in &Eacute;irinn.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach as comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh liom.</P>
        <P>We all realise that there are many challenges to the goal of rural development, both within Ireland itself and coming from outside.  An objective analysis of where Government is placed to meet this challenge shows us having a solid foundation on which to build our plan of work.  To my knowledge I am the only Minister with responsibility for rural development in the European Union who is not also a Minister for agriculture and this shows that the Government believes that rural development, and agriculture, fisheries and forestry are so significant that two separate Cabinet Ministers should have responsibilities for these important issues.  It also shows that rural development, though complementary, is a separate issue from the industry of agriculture.</P>
        <P>Looking at the principal parameters within which Government operates, there is a clear mission to develop rural communities.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on rural development sets out as a key part of its future vision and policy that:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social well-being of rural communities, to providing the conditions for a meaningful and fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas and to striving to achieve a rural Ireland in which there will be vibrant sustainable communities.</P>
        <P FLI="0">According to the programme for Government, &ldquo;Vibrant rural communities are vital to the future of our nation.&rdquo;  This is the clear policy framework within which the Government and I, as Minister, must operate.</P>
        <P>The European Union shares our values on rural development and is committed to rural development in its wider sense, as well as being committed to agriculture.  Commissioner Fischer-Boel has been particularly engaged in preserving and developing rural populations across Europe.  The EU takes a wide view of rural development as total community development.  One of the main objectives in supporting rural development as set out in Article 4.1(c) of the 2005 Rural Development Regulation is &ldquo;...improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of the rural economy.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Within Pillar 2 alone of the European Rural Development Programme, &euro;2.4 billion is set out for a range of rural development measures in Ireland over the period from 2007 to 2013.  I am particularly pleased to announce that next week my Department will proceed with the new rural development programme.  Under this programme, our funding of &euro;425 million, three times what it was before, will see an investment of almost &euro;1 billion in measures to develop rural enterprise and quality of life in the period to 2013, obviously made up of European and national money as well as private investment.  I believe that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the upcoming referendum on the EU reform treaty will strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s position within the European Union, and will support Ireland, as a negotiator and as an ally of other countries with similar concerns, in continuing to pursue our strong rural development policies.</P>
        <P>One of the provisions in the EU reform treaty that is of particular relevance to my work as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and the work of my Department, is <Col N="695"/>the enshrinement of the concept of equality across all regions, urban and rural.  The White Paper states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Among the regions concerned, particular attention should be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and areas which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps, such as the northernmost regions with very low population density, and island, cross-border, and mountain regions.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This mirrors our national commitment, through my Department, in programmes such as CL&Aacute;R, RAPID, the community services programme, the rural social scheme, support for islands communities and so on.</P>
        <P>To explain how my views on rural and agriculture development developed over the years and my journey to the firm belief in the importance of both, I would like to share with Senators my background in this regard.  As many Members will probably know, I was brought up and educated here in Dublin.  Having completed university, and having an interest in the Irish language which is mainly spoken as a community language on the west coast of Ireland, at the age of 23 I became manager of a small community farmers&rsquo; co-operative.  I was the first employee of the co-operative.  It was registered as a farmers&rsquo; co-operative and the initial idea was to develop and improve farming services, particularly through the intensive fattening of hill lambs.</P>
        <P>During its early years, the co-operative focused on agriculture.  However, very quickly two issues changed fundamentally not only the direction of the co-operative but also the direction of the local community.  One was the difficulty in an area of very poor marginal land of an agricultural co-operative becoming viable, which was a challenge that took me a long time to crack.  The other issue was the realisation, very early on, that no matter how much was invested in agriculture, it would in no way sustain the local population, and that what was needed was economic diversification of the rural economy and the creation of off-farm jobs.  I am glad to say that through the efforts of the co-operative, there are now 200 industrial jobs in the region and that the population decline has at last been stemmed.  Agriculture, although still important to the local economy, is no longer its mainstay and the vibrancy of the community is linked around a multifunctional, multidimensional economy.</P>
        <P>Having seen the dramatic effect that such an approach had on a small rural community and seeing this as an incubator or experimental plot, I came to the conclusion that the only possible long-term approach to rural development and halting the rural decline which is pervasive throughout the developed and developing world, was to develop diverse multi-sectoral local rural economies.  Such local rural economies should have a mixture of both local enterprise and access to public jobs.  A sensible and well-delivered policy of decentralisation of public jobs has a key role to play in developing rural life and releasing the congestion strains on our main urban areas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I was in India for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  When I mentioned I was Minister with responsibility for rural development, they were fascinated.  That country has a population of 1.2 billion people, 70% of whom live in rural areas.  The nightmare scenario for them is mega-migration, which is happening already.  If half of the 70%, 800 million people, suddenly descended on the cities, Senators know what would happen.  As we tend to deal with things on such a small scale here, it was very interesting to get some view of the challenge we face in shifting populations as a world community and not our own little community.  The only other answer is the one I am proposing, which is to diversify <i>in situ</i> by leaving the people there and bringing the diversification to the communities.  In that context I saw a headline recently in a newspaper that stated more than half of the world&rsquo;s population lives in cities. <Col N="696"/> It stated that people worldwide continue to flee the countryside into the cities.  We must ask whether that is socially and economically a good thing, or whether the maintenance of balanced population structures and population stability would not be more desirable.  It is not the absolute population of an area that causes problems but rapid shifts of population in terms of the need to build houses and schools.  That is a significant problem.  The Government believes that is the case, as does the European Union, which has been putting an increasing emphasis on spending in the general rural economy.  Some people say that those policies are built on an idealistic view of green fields and frugal living, and that such policies are economic madness.  I have heard that said many times.  I believe, however, that there are cogent arguments that show that the maintenance of rural populations and ensuring the growth of cities is not at the expense of rural communities not only makes economic sense but also makes social sense.  As the Minister with responsibility for urban deprivation as well as rural development, my Department has a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the challenges facing different communities.  From what I can ascertain, the pattern in Ireland is replicated in many developed and developing countries.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that rural development is an important engine to ensure the balanced development of our country.  It makes no sense in economic terms to have rural areas with a wide range of services, including schools, health centres, social facilities etc., which are under-utilised due to population migration, and at the same time have rapidly growing cities that cannot cope in terms of the provision of those same services because of their burgeoning populations.  The second reason, which is a social one, is that examination of deprivation levels in Ireland shows that while the richest communities in the country are urban, it is also the case that the 46 most deprived communities are all urban communities.  No rural area in the country has either the social, economic or quality-of-life deprivation issues that are experienced in the most deprived urban communities.</P>
        <P>An economic commentator recently pooh-poohed the importance of culture and said it is all about economic growth and that culture is an extra.  I puzzle about the huge challenges we face in deprived urban communities &mdash; challenges that break my heart because so many of the young people there have no future.  They do not get education in large numbers and, unfortunately, the most likely place some of them will end up is in prison.  Many of the deprived areas are located in a ring around the M50 in Dublin.  I puzzle as to why that is the case, given the proximity of people to all of the jobs that are located around the M50 and the fact that access to university is no problem.  Universities and jobs are on those people&rsquo;s doorstep, so why do they not avail of all the opportunities?  What is the problem?  In rural areas where the parents have had only a primary education large numbers of their children are getting not only secondary but tertiary and fourth level education.  I ask myself what is the difference.  The conclusion I have come to is that the difference is culture.  I refer to culture in the wide sense where it relates to values.  Rural people believe in education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>So do urban people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes they do but, unfortunately, not in the same numbers.  I do not blame people, but when we examine the statistics, the more rural the area, the greater the number of young people who access higher education, even though the number of parents in those areas who have had third level education is lower.  Belmullet is the lowest of all the Gaeltacht areas in terms of parents with third level education, however, up to 75% of children there receive third level education, despite the geographic challenge of getting from Belmullet to even Galway or Castlebar.  If we are serious about societal issues, that is a major challenge.  I hope I will have another opportunity to come back to the Seanad to debate seriously these issues.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>I am passionately committed to RAPID areas in Dublin and elsewhere and I spend a great deal of time in them.  In some cases the percentage of young people accessing third level education is as low as 1% or 2%.  I ask myself what is the difference.  It is not that they have fewer resources in schools, because in many cases the school buildings are better and they have extra teachers.  Neither is it the case that people are far away from the colleges, because they are near them, nor that they do not have jobs down the road because they are right beside them.  My conclusion is that there is a different culture in those areas.  Culture is hugely important.  In the context of rural Ireland we are lucky that there has been a strong tradition of community, culture and togetherness.  There are much better opportunities <i>per capita</i> for children in rural Ireland.  That is not to blame anybody.  That is to state a fact.</P>
        <P>Let us do something for people who are deprived in urban Ireland.  That is what I am trying to do.  It makes no sense to push everybody out of the place where we are getting the good outcomes.  Ireland is full of contradictions.  One day I am told by the experts that nobody wants to live in rural Ireland and asked why we should push them out there.  The next day I am told too many people are trying to build houses in rural Ireland.  If people are not living there how can that be the case?  I believe in building houses only for people who live permanently in rural Ireland.  I would like to know how to solve that conundrum.  I believe a large number of people want to live in rural Ireland.  What we see constantly is that young people want to migrate to the cities when they reach the age of 18 and have a great time.  However, when they settle down and have children they suddenly realise that rural Ireland was a great place to live when they were young.  The Government should offer people the choice.  We should not try to direct anybody.  I believe in a free country.  If I want to live in the city, I will live in the city and if I want to live in the country, I will live in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the way it is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  My challenge is to create that free choice.  Having decided that is what we have to do, we must decide what policy measures are required to achieve the objective.  Second, we have to question whether the policies are adequate for the purpose.  We have done a number of things.  We have set up the CL&Aacute;R programme and introduced the sustainable rural housing guidelines.  We are involved in decentralisation and rural proofing of Government policy.  Next week we will launch the biggest and best Leader rural development programme worth &euro;425 million.  We introduced the rural transport initiative and the rural social scheme.  We are engaged also in rural recreation and the exploitation of the significant resources Ireland has in terms of rural tourism.</P>
        <P>To achieve the objective of developing rural life we need to recognise that all organs of state have an obligation to recognise Government policy and to be involved in bringing it through to fruition.  I accept that we have not achieved our goal yet because the way I measure how well I am doing is to look at the population statistics and standard of living.  I will not have achieved my goal until the population in the most rural area is growing and the standard of living is rising.  Population is at the core of developing life in rural Ireland.  It is easier to provide services and to stimulate diversification of the rural economy when there is a stable or growing population.  That is something to which our planners will have to face up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not question the integrity of planners, but I question a certain mindset that is evident.  I spoke to every county manager in the country on the matter.  In fairness they all turned up.  I said to them that there is no point in the State investing &euro;425 million in rural development, which means that we will have to build structures, and then find that no matter how sensible, cogent or good for a community it is, one cannot get planning to go ahead with an enterprise.  When I travel around rural Ireland I see some of the major dairy industries located in Ballyragget, in Kilkenny, or in Listowel, marvellous places which were built 30 or 40 years ago.  If they wanted to build them today, I know where they would be told to go.</P>
        <P>The other problem is that planners and the professional people often only see a hierarchy of cities, towns, gateways and hubs and they use that most obnoxious phrase, the rural hinterland.  The national spatial strategy is committed to rural communities.  When we talk about rural communities we mean towns of 1,500 or less and the rural countryside.  We are not talking about regional balance in terms of Galway, Cork and Limerick.  We are talking about rural development.</P>
        <P>I did not understand this growing up because I come from Dublin and was ignorant of the countryside in many ways but it was only when I went to live in rural Ireland that I realised a different geography operated that only those who live there fully understand, that of the townland.  If one organises a canvass, the stations or many of the other activities that take place in rural communities, they are always divided up by townlands.  I know to the last house what is in each townland in my area.  I have learned all of that in my time.</P>
        <P>When I was getting married my wife said to me, &ldquo;Caithfimid cuireadh a thabhairt go muintir Baile-Lugh&rdquo;.  She comes from Spiddal but fortunately for me she only meant the townland.  We live on the edge of County Galway.  Next Sunday or any other Sunday we are Galway, not Mayo, even though I can look out my window and see Mayo.  The townland is real and it means a great deal to people.  It is very much an organisational structure.  It has the parish, and I need not tell anybody here that people would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>There is the county and the province but consistently in our planning we ignore that hierarchy as if it did not exist.  When the Taoiseach went home to Offaly last weekend the people got two messages &mdash; first, that Offaly was very important and, second, that he had to go to Clara.  The end had to be Clara.  It could not be Tullamore.  The county town might be a fine place and he might live there but it did not matter.  It had to be Clara because it is the town from which he comes.  We must ensure we continue to allow those two hierarchies to live in an uneasy equilibrium but we must not ignore the second hierarchy.</P>
        <P>Drawing together the main strands of the clear and rational rural policy objectives and the binding ties of rural Ireland, my main point is that if we want to develop life in rural Ireland, we need people there and if we need people they will need houses, jobs, facilities and a social life.<b>  </b>A large number of rural areas are now in a period of rapid growth but these are mainly the so-called peri-urban areas within 30 or 40 miles of the major cities and towns.  The population in the rural areas outside the influence of major cities and towns remains stagnant and, in many <Col N="699"/>cases, is in decline.  I am willing to admit that until that is reversed and the most rural of our areas are stabilised, we will not have achieved our policy goals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I come from an urban area but I spent my summers in a farming community in the north Cork-Kerry border area.  Listening to the Minister, however, I thought I was living in a parallel world.  While I hope he continues his emphasis on the townland and rural Ireland, and I welcome the fact that, nine months later, a Leader programme will be announced next week about which the Minister will get no argument from this side of the House, an analytical survey of the current position would indicate that despite the vast sums of money being spent, provincial and rural Ireland is in economic crisis.  Every day we read about it in regional newspapers, talk to people, meet our cousins and our neighbours and listen.  Businesses and public houses are closing, small firms are collapsing and post offices are being shut down in rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke eloquently about rural Ireland but what has happened to our local creamery, marts and shops, and the bed and breakfast houses that we saw locally when we were growing up?  They are all gone yet those regions were thrown a hypocritical lifeline in the botched decentralisation plan, to which the Minister referred in his contribution, and the bizarre national spatial strategy.  We are facing a meltdown in that regard.  On a recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; programme Fr. Harry Bohan and other panellists discussed that issue and one got a real sense of what community and rural Ireland means today.</P>
        <P>One of the biggest difficulties the Minister must address is social exclusion.  That refers to the structures and processes that exclude not just people but individuals and groups from their full participation in society.  As we are aware, social exclusion can take many different forms, be they economic, legal, cultural, social or political, with multiple and mutually reinforcing effects.  It is not just about lack of investment but isolation, unemployment, lack of educational and work opportunities and discrimination.</P>
        <P>In 2002, Heanue wrote in a report that the lure of employment opportunities pull people out of rural areas.  The Minister made reference to that in his contribution.  At the same time, the absence of social and cultural amenities in the rural area, which are a direct consequence of low population base, act as a significant push factor out of the area.  The strength of the pushing and pulling forces is amplified by an ever increasing expectation of a better educated and more mobile rural population, to which Heanue referred.</P>
        <P>The Minister spoke about the urban area but as a school teacher I am aware that one of the biggest difficulties being experienced in urban areas is class sizes.  I support his point regarding the issue of rural Ireland and the quality of education but we have a smaller class size and a smaller base.  Despite the vast sums of money being invested in RAPID areas, we are losing the battle in many urban areas.  I would welcome a debate on that also.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Forum reported on a number of distinct social groups which experience social exclusion in rural Ireland.  The report mentioned a number of characteristics associated with rural poverty and social exclusion including high levels of invisibility, out-migration of the post-primary education and working cohorts, which the Minister mentioned in his contribution, sparse population trends, the decline in the relative contribution of agriculture, infrastructural difficulties and physical isolation.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy is a failed plan.  The gateway towns about which the Minister spoke have failed to develop coherently and we continue to see massive development around the eastern hub of Dublin.  A total of 40% of our population is located in and around the Dublin <Col N="700"/>area.  An analysis of the job losses in rural areas suggests that they were older, traditional style companies and not ones based on modern technology.</P>
        <P>Fr. Harry Bohan used a great phrase one time at a conference and it is an important point we should examine.  He stated, &ldquo;The Celtic tiger, wonderful though it is, may have made us lose touch with people, place, roots and soul&rdquo;.  That is a fundamental point because from interacting with people in rural Ireland I am aware there is a sense of isolation from services.  They feel economically isolated.  The sense of community is being eroded and there is an erosion of services.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I believe we are a predominantly rural country and we must preserve, enrich and enhance the village, the townland, our small towns and our large towns, which act as a focal point for many rural communities.  That requires not just investment from Government but leadership.  I would welcome an independent survey on the way we as a nation attach value to our rural communities because if we take out the GAA, the school and the church, which is at their core, what is left?</P>
        <P>I made reference earlier to the fact that our local creamery is gone, as are the local marts.  The Minister spoke about the stations.  Today many people are opting out of the stations in their homes and prefer to have them in the church.  Before, the stations was a time when everybody came together, painted the house, cleaned up the whole place and it was a great celebration.  We have lost that.  In tandem with this the local pubs and post offices are under siege.</P>
        <P>Many businesses are opting not to do business, so that there is a disconnectivity.  In yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> and other newspapers it is reported that key social organisations and other bodies are joining with the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union to lobby for local post offices to be kept open.  What are we at?  Will rural Ireland be dictated to now just by pure economics?  Given the Minister&rsquo;s speech and his passionate views, I do not believe that to be the case.  For once, can we look at the social value of services in rural Ireland?  If we are serious in intent about life in rural Ireland, then we should be advancing connectivity, not isolation.  We educate our young people, and they leave for university and get better paid jobs.  Many of them want to return but cannot for economic reasons.  That means isolation for the people left behind.</P>
        <P>The national development plan speaks of vibrant rural communities being vital to the future of the nation and we all subscribe to that.  I contend, however, that under the last 11 years of the Celtic tiger, rural Ireland has suffered at the hands of a Government which has failed to manage the cost and competitiveness issues.  We have not addressed these and have failed to put sustainable infrastructure into many rural areas, as the recent report published by Agri Aware shows.  Are we serious about the national spatial strategy with its objectives concerning more balanced regional development?  We need infrastructural development for rural Ireland.  I ask the Minister to advocate and promote in Cabinet this emphasis on rural development, so that it has a prime focus.  I look forward to next week&rsquo;s unfurling of the Leader programme, to see what we have in store.  In terms of innovation and economic dynamism, rural Ireland is not at the game in terms of broadband, roads and the cost of doing business.  Other Ministers speak about third and fourth generation broadband.  Many parts of rural Ireland do not have first generation broadband.</P>
        <P>Large towns act as the hub in the gateway, in rural Ireland, and they need investment.  They need oxygen to survive, to be regenerated.  Take the town of Macroom, for example, in the constituency of Cork North West, which badly needs a ring road to help it grow and develop and be a focal point.  We are told it will be 2015 before it is ready.  Then there is the centralisation of medical and health services.  As the Minister knows, the trend now is for the develop<Col N="701"/>ment of centres of excellence, with immense  consequences for individual families and carers.  Then there is the increasing elderly population with the need for care in the home, community based respite beds and places for continuity of care.  How and when will these be provided under present Government policy?</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister that the reform treaty should be passed and I hope that the people in rural Ireland and those involved in agriculture will support it, and not link it to the WTO talks.  There is a tendency to blame Commissioner Mandelson, and rightly so.  However, we need to pass the Lisbon treaty.  I ask the Minister to look at the cost of doing business in rural Ireland so that people in relocating industries may have a more competitive advantage.  Farming has changed, and it has barely been mentioned today.  The average age of people farming today is 55 years and over, with just 8% under 35 years.</P>
        <P>The issue of planning needs to be addressed.  I will support the Minister, as will my party, if we have can have planning reform in rural Ireland, where the growth in some towns and villages has occurred at the expense of others, due to planning restrictions on one-off housing.  Let us have a real debate about planning and tell our planners, who in many cases have no concept of what it means to live in rural Ireland, to listen to those of us who do.  In some cases the planning system is creating a two-tier Ireland.</P>
        <P>My final reference is to pub closures.  I am not advocating drink driving, or anything like that, but the demise of the pub, which was a focal point for many rural communities, has left many people isolated, lonely and vulnerable.  As the former Labour Party Deputy,  Dr. Moosajee Bhamjee, said recently, to some extent this is contributing to suicide among the elderly.  For many older people the pub was a social centre and created a sense of togetherness.  We need integrated transport and social and amenity facilities for people in rural Ireland.  Many people today believe that we are investing a great deal of money, but there is no action.  The reality is that modern rural life is different to what the Minister eloquently described earlier.  I wonder whether it is a better place.  Is the legacy of 11 years of the Celtic tiger about people losing touch with themselves?  I hope it will not be, but I believe it is.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I dtosach is mian liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire agus tr&eacute;asl&uacute; leis de bharr a cheapach&aacute;in ar&iacute;s mar Aire Rialtais.  Is cruth&uacute; ann f&eacute;in &eacute; sin go bhfuil s&aacute;ch jab d&eacute;anta aige, agus t&aacute; an-&aacute;thas ormsa go pearsanta go mbeidh s&eacute; in ann lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh leis an obair a bh&iacute; idir l&aacute;mha aige &mdash; agus go raibh rud &eacute; ar a shaothar i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.</P>
        <P>A famous Irish Fenian and patriot from Tipperary, Charles J. Kickham, had a great understanding of the culture of rural Ireland, which could be found in many of his writings as well.  He used to talk about doing things for the honour of the little village, and this was epitomised in his character, the great hurler, Matt the Thresher in the play, &ldquo;Knocknagow&rdquo;.  We understood what he meant by doing things for the honour of the little village and in no place is that spirit more evident than in rural Ireland.  When I was a young lad I was in a juvenile theatre group and performed in &ldquo;Knocknagow&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, I did not get the part of Matt the Thresher, but rather Beresford Pender, who was the landlord&rsquo;s agent in those times.  I have not been able to get rid of that from my psyche since then.  However, I well recall when those plays were being done in Tipperary and, I am sure, elsewhere, that in many ways they still reflect a spirit that existed right up to the present.</P>
        <P>One thinks of people such as Monsignor Horan, Canon Hayes, Fr. McDyer and all of those who realised the importance of organising the people into doing things for themselves.  I believe that the Minister has a great claim to canonisation, although I am not suggesting this today.  Not only has he the gift of bi-location, but he has the gift of multi-location.  There is not a part of Ireland in his portfolio that he has not touched.  He has been in every townland and village <Col N="702"/>and not just for ceremonial purposes.  He listens very carefully to what people are saying and brings that back to where the powers can look at it and create new policies.</P>
        <P>I was talking last week to a county manager and we made reference to the new relationship or partnership which exists between public institutions and the community.  We both agreed there has been a huge development in this regard.  He finished up by saying, &ldquo;But we need to be careful that we do not over-institutionalise it&rdquo;.  I knew what he was saying, as does the Minister, because he realised that we had too many agencies in our community.  One after the other a new bureaucratic structure is coming into existence and the emphasis is more on the membership of that rather than on what the focus and the policy should be.  With great courage this county manager put his head above the parapet and endeavoured to bring cohesion into the process so that people dealt with one single agency rather than several, some of which were competing for the same funding.  That was a step in the right direction.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister received any word from the European Commission on the matter raised by the Cavan-Monaghan Leader group?  It is an issue in which clarity is needed.</P>
        <P>I am pleased we are discussing diversification into non-agricultural activities in rural Ireland.  It is vital it is done and not left too long.  While farming will always be at the heart of rural Ireland, according to the Irish Rural Dwellers Association one third of the population live in rural areas, a sizeable proportion.  With the status of agriculture being redirected and new priorities coming to the fore, other areas of economic activity must be examined.  Tourism is a vital activity which is important to rural areas because it does not depend on centralised attractions in large urban areas.  A heritage site in the most rural part of the country could be an attraction for discerning tourists, both from home and abroad.  It is important to find the means to develop tourism and ensure there is support for such projects.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has played a major role in rural communities, often in a quiet way.  The State, willingly and rightly, allowed F&Aacute;S to fill the gap in training and providing personnel for many community activities, including running community and cultural centres.  However, there is a dependence on people employed on F&Aacute;S schemes to keep many community activities alive.  Such activities cannot be expected to continue if people working on these schemes are removed.  If there is to be any change to this, it should be the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who fills that vacuum.  GAA pitches, community centres and cultural centres are part and parcel of the fabric of rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>Volunteerism, we are told, has diminished.  I do not go with the negative approach that it is dead.  Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann runs 40 fleadhanna cheoil each year.  The 2007 all-Ireland fleadh cheoil was held in Tullamore, County Offaly, with an attendance of 230,000 people and generated between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million for the region.  It was all organised by volunteers.  The same can be said for hurling and football games.  Financial back-up and resources, however, must be provided, be it 10% or 20% of the amount required to run such events.  It represents excellent value for money.</P>
        <P>The CL&Aacute;R and RAPID programmes have proved they give power to the people.  No matter where one goes in Ireland, rural or urban, one can see the results of the programmes.  The dormant accounts fund was used so wisely that there was only one debate in the House on how it operated.  The schemes sponsored by the fund worked well to the satisfaction of everyone involved.</P>
        <P>Bishop Fiachra O&rsquo;Ceallaigh at a Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann function recently spoke of rural organisations coming together to help those socially deprived.  Whether it is related to the demise of the rural pub or social isolation, the organisations have an ideal methodology for dealing with this.  The President, Mary McAleese, made the same point in her recent speech, <Col N="703"/>calling on rural organisations, with their own specialised objectives, to look deeper into their heartland and fill the gap and confront any social deprivation due to restrictive legislation, as mentioned by Senator Buttimer.  The partnership between the public and the community is important.</P>
        <P>The new Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, made two interesting points in recent speeches.  First, he spoke of creating a balance between individualisation and the community concept.  Borrowing in part from John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s famous dictum, the Taoiseach asked what should our contribution be back to the country.  The best vehicle for that is in rural Ireland.  With the Leader programme to provide an extra &euro;450 million and given the emphasis of other programmes, it will provide a great opportunity to assist rural communities.</P>
        <P>On last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, Councillor Michael Healy-Rae struck a blow for rural communities with regard to one-off rural housing.  He held An Taisce to account in front of a mixed rural and urban audience which supported his point.  An Taisce is a prescribed body in the planning Act.  The Minister and others involved in rural development must ask it to get off some of its hobby horses.  If people cannot build on their own land or return from abroad but not get planning permission, what is the point of debating the future of rural Ireland?  The future of rural Ireland is about people.  An Taisce will have to engage in a practical manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech was from the heart.  The programme for Government states vibrant rural communities are vital to the future of our nation.  I am sure every Member will speak with enthusiasm for this.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, I do not come from a rural background but no one is more than two generations from the country.  My mother came from County Armagh where I used to spend my summers as a child.  I accept there were difficulties and we were deprived then but there were many positive aspects to our rural communities.</P>
        <P>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to those who acted for rural communities in the past such as Monsignor James Horan, Canon John Hayes and Fr. James McDyer.  I recently met Fr. Brophy, who has done something similar in Graiguecullen, County Carlow.  I was invited down to speak at a novena, which involved nine days of prayer every Monday for nine weeks.  The church was packed.  There was benediction, which I had not attended for years &mdash; it does not happen in our church &mdash; and we sang &ldquo;Tantum Ergo&rdquo; and some of the old Latin hymns.  It reminded me of the sort of rural community that existed in the past.  I raise this point because I believe we will solve this problem only if those in the rural communities do something for themselves.  It is not the job of the Government to solve this problem; it is the job of individuals.  The job of the Government, as the Minister said earlier, is to allay the situation and make support available so that when people need help to do something, it is there for them.  I am sure F&Aacute;S is doing something like that.</P>
        <P>I have had the opportunity to visit India.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was correct when he spoke about the situation outlined by the Irish Rural Dwellers Association.  It pointed out that in 1926, 68% of the population in Ireland were rural dwellers whereas the figure is now 33%.  The Minister has just given a figure of 70% for India.  Having visited India, I know there is no way that we want to see a population having to live as those in India do, but while they may be very poor, there was a joy in the way of life in the rural community.</P>
        <P>I ask myself what we can do, how the Minister can contribute and what will happen.  I would also like to address the question of efficiency versus social or, better still, cultural benefits, a term used by the Minister.  The areas we are talking about here are the church, which I touched on earlier, and the schools.  It was interesting to hear the point made by Senator Buttimer on class sizes, which are too large in the cities and probably too small in the countryside to be <Col N="704"/>efficient.  However, we can now rely on other situations.  We must find a way to ensure broadband and other developments are introduced.  I spoke the other day to a man who lives in a rural area.  His daughter is doing a fourth level MBA course with Madrid University from home, 20 hours a week, although I am not sure how she manages it.  This is possible but we are very far behind with broadband and must find a solution.</P>
        <P>When we talk about efficiency versus social benefit, it is likely we will lose the smaller schools because they do not make sense in the long term.  However, there are other ways of supporting that area.  We are losing rural shops to a large extent, which I can understand as the marketplace is driving people to the larger supermarkets.  There is a danger we are losing the rural pubs as well for various reasons.  Much as I regret it, we are likely to continue to lose local Garda stations because it is much more efficient to have them in other locations, although we can battle against this.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal particularly with the issue of post offices.  I have some experience in this area as I was chairman of the interim board for four years and then of An Post itself for six years.  Clearly, our objective was to ensure the post office provided a service but also that it made money and was able to break even or be profitable.  While I argued very strongly that this should happen, I question the wisdom of suggesting that the only function of rural post offices is to be profitable and make money.  It was interesting to read during the week the argument of the Irish Postmasters Union, which stated it was forming an alliance of other social organisations in this area to argue the case.</P>
        <P>When debating the issue of post offices in the House last November, I stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will only solve the problem when we face up to the reality that the post office retail network cannot be justified in purely business terms.  We must recognise that rural post offices are a crucial part of a social framework and are vital to our society in a way that they can never be as part of An Post ... To lose the network of remaining rural post offices forever would be nothing short of a national tragedy ... It is inevitable that such will happen as long as we insist on regarding the question in purely business terms.  If one expects An Post to pay its way, the death of the post offices is inevitable.  If one regards the post offices as performing an important social service that one wishes to preserve, the way to do it is clear, namely, one must support the post offices by a national subvention quite apart from the business revenue that An Post can raise from the network.  As a nation, we can only preserve our post offices if we are prepared to pay for them.  Are we prepared?  We should focus our attention on answering this question.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We will not easily solve the problem of the shops, the pubs, the schools and the Garda stations but we can solve the problems for rural post offices if we can change their attitude so that, to use the Minister&rsquo;s words, they are not aiming solely at efficiency but are aiming at the cultural and social benefits we get from them.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the Irish Rural Dwellers Association and its concern with the planning situation regarding single houses.  The Irish planning Acts were developed back in the 1960s but they were based on the United Kingdom model of urban and town planning, as I believe it is called.  We must examine this model.  I did not see the television programme referred to today but one of the questions we must address is whether our system of planning is correct and whether the decisions are being made by elected or unelected people, and those who are part of the rural community or those who have a different agenda.</P>
        <P>I encourage the Minister&rsquo;s enthusiasm.  We are delighted to see him in his current role.  We must give him support.  While I question some of the decisions that have been made in the past, with proper decision making we can change the situation in rural areas.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="705"/>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his presentation.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of rural development.  When we talk about rural development, it is clear that the economic and social development of rural communities must involve much more than what was perhaps the more traditional model of direct assistance to farm families.  Some of the dangers of this kind of model have been highlighted in some of the changes that have taken place recently and the number of farmers who are leaving the land because they no longer can make a decent livelihood in the area of farming.</P>
        <P>Changes in the Common Agricultural Policy certainly have caused major perturbations in the agricultural sector.  There is now a very welcome focus, at least in terms of economic development in rural areas, on promoting rural enterprise.  This involves a change or a slight adjustment in terms of the kind of economic model we are promoting.  In the national economy there has been a major focus on trying to attract foreign direct investment and on a more outward-looking approach to developing the economic potential of this country whereas, when it comes to rural enterprise, there needs to be much more of a focus on supporting indigenous enterprise.  This was certainly recommended by the 2004 Fitzpatrick report on rural enterprise.</P>
        <P>There is a real need for training programmes in the area of agricultural entrepreneurship, in other words, a form of business training for those working on the land, with agricultural options built in so a person who wants to take on a farm or who owns a farm is enabled to transform it into a business based possibly on niche food production, organic food production, specialised horticulture or the development of new forms of energy or energy exploitation.  This is the way forward in terms of the economic development of rural areas into the future.</P>
        <P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is very committed to the idea of rural development.  Within the current programme for Government, the Government has committed to implementing proposals for a community development plan which will deliver community facilities in rural areas, such as playgrounds, community centres, local markets, recycling centres, sports and recreational facilities.  There is a specific community development fund to the tune of &euro;150 million which will ensure the implementation of this plan over a five-year period.  We know vibrant rural communities are vital to the future of the nation.  Social development, in addition to economic development, should be the way in which we try to sustain and enhance life in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government commits to enhancing and extending the rural transport initiative nationwide over the next five years.  This is very important.  As a representative of a partly rural constituency, Wicklow, I am aware that the issue of rural transport is complex and difficult but that it certainly needs to be tackled.  Where rural transport initiatives have been supported, they have been very successful.  There needs to be a much broader approach to promoting rural transport under the current programme for Government.  I welcome the fact that it is highlighted in the programme as an area of priority.</P>
        <P>We need to invest in the provision of broadband in rural areas and the current programme for Government has committed to this.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, recognises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The current programme for Government commits to doubling the funding for the CL&Aacute;R programme to enable rural infrastructure deficits to be tackled, and also to establish community and development agencies as one-stop-shops for advice on grant support, business opportunities, training and development and the management of grant spending under the new EU fund for rural development.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government also commits to conducting an enterprise audit of existing and redundant agricultural buildings and manufacturing plants in rural areas.  There is also an agreement to expand the rural social scheme to provide additional income for farmers and fishermen by increasing the number of places available.  A well-funded rural enterprise policy will be provided as part of the programme for Government to focus on a broad spectrum of rural enterprises, with special emphasis on artisan food production and production by small producers.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government also commits to initiating a study in consultation with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Leader companies, agriculture associations, county enterprise boards and rural tourism operators to devise a new plan for farm-based rural tourism, including the development of farm-based niche visitor attractions.</P>
        <P>Another very interesting and welcome part of the programme for Government in the area of rural development is the introduction of an all-Ireland walkways development plan to map out the infrastructural needs and routes and maximise their use.  The Minister has been very involved in working with various stakeholders throughout the country with a view to overcoming some of the problems that attach to setting up the network of countrywide walkways.  He has done very important work in this regard and we are making progress in establishing such a network.</P>
        <P>Irish Rural Link, which has done a lot of important work in this area, has highlighted rural public transport in terms of rural development.  It makes the very significant point that with rising fuel costs, carbon emissions and the possible introduction of a carbon levy, Ireland will <Col N="707"/>need to increase significantly its investment in rural transport and conduct a major reorganisation thereof.  We should be considering now how to provide transport in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The second issue Irish Rural Link has highlighted, and which is worth mentioning to the Minister, who will be aware of it, is that of rural proofing, as it is called.  The organisation pointed out that there is growing consensus among international expert policy organisations that rural policy on its own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will only ever have a limited impact on outcomes in rural areas because most of the policy outcomes result from non-rural Government policy.  A recommendation for dealing with this is rural proofing.  In the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Finland, mechanisms have been developed to ensure general Government policy is rural proofed.  In Ireland, while we began to develop rural proofing structures after the publication of the White Paper in 1999, the process seems to have fallen by the wayside.  Will the Minister consider re-examining the issue of rural proofing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially with the emphasis we are placing now on rural development?</P>
        <P>We should consider introducing a rural services Bill that will introduce a system of measurement in respect of access to services in rural areas.  This would cater for the examination of post offices and other such services and their availability in rural areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his re-appointment.  I noted Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for his canonisation.  I assure the Minister that nothing I say or do today will put him in mortal danger.  He will be absolutely fine in the wake of contributions from this side of the House.</P>
        <P>The sustainable development of rural Ireland is an integral part of the sustainable development of Ireland as a whole.  Rural development has two key aims, namely, to enhance the lives of those living in rural communities and to maximise the use of the countryside for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  To achieve these aims, we need to concentrate on three key areas.  We need to consider our range of agricultural products, including the types of food produced and crops grown; we must protect and promote local heritage and renew villages and towns to encourage rural tourism; and we must help rural communities by assisting local facilities such as shops and post offices.</P>
        <P>Organic farming is a fast-growing industry and is set to be worth approximately &euro;16 million per year.  This has led to an expansion of high-quality artisan food production.  Such food production has become very popular since the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Many farms are beginning to diversify into this area in addition to rearing herds and producing crops.  Such innovation by farmers deserves a kind of brand, like the Kerrygold brand, to help them promote their products.</P>
        <P>The agriculture sector can diversify from food production to include land conservation and land utilisation for alternative purposes.  Forestry, for instance, can play a central role in sustainable rural development.  The benefits of reforestation are immense.  In these days of rapid climate change, we need to encourage the growth and maintenance of forests with a varied selection of trees and plants.  The growth and maintenance of forests can also encourage a wide range of local tourism initiatives.</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P>We should encourage the development and use of old farmhouses and other disused facilities for agritourism purposes.  I used to be a director of Meath Leader, now known as Meath Partnership, and during my term in office several grants were given to individuals who wanted to refurbish old farm buildings for tourist accommodation.  This was successful and helped to promote local economic growth.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Countryside breaks, walking, cycling and pony trekking should be encouraged to enhance the experience of visitors.  We need to encourage small towns and communities to seek help to develop local heritage attractions to better emphasise the uniqueness of every town, village and community.  In north-west County Meath, for instance, there is a steam threshing festival in Moynalty.  It has become a fast-growing attraction for farmers and tourists alike.  Last year 20,000 visitors came to the area.  Over the years, the organisers of the festival have established a small museum dedicated to the tradition of threshing.  Down the road from Moynalty, the annual Jim Connell festival is hosted by the locals.  Hundreds of visitors gather to commemorate the life of the Meath man who wrote the song &ldquo;The Red Flag&rdquo;, which many Members will know very well.</P>
      
        <P>Celebrating this kind of local heritage is precisely what rural development should mean.  Other opportunities can be found in encouraging and supporting schools and local communities to restore local amenities and areas of historic value, such as graveyards.  The Minister may be aware of some of the good work done by Meath Partnership in places such as Athboy where a park was renovated.  In Kilskyre, in Deputy Johnny Brady&rsquo;s area, a new walkway was created with the assistance of Meath Partnership.</P>
        <P>In Bellewstown, assistance to local artists to provide accommodation and to provide workshops also has come about because of the Meath Partnership programme.  Such initiatives can be developed in the countryside to encourage people to visit and to sustain local communities.  People who come there then can be guaranteed a successful visit and in the process can contribute to the local economy.</P>
        <P>The Government, by providing grants to organisations such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities, can help to encourage the upgrading of local amenities, such as parks and riverside walks, in order that they can be used to the maximum potential.  I will cite the example of the Boyne Canal to the Minister.  It is an excellent but seriously under-used waterway that could be used by tourists to travel by boat from the historic town of Drogheda all the way up the Boyne to the new Battle of the Boyne site at Oldbridge and then on to Newgrange and up to Slane and Navan.  They could stop off along the way at rural communities, thereby helping to sustain and support them.</P>
        <P>I believe that investment in such initiatives will help to play a central role to develop rural areas.  However, assistance also must be provided in other ways to local communities to strengthen them and help them grow.  The Government must consider expanding the support for flexi-bus services to enable people to move around their communities more easily to gain access to necessary amenities and facilities.  Moreover, the policy on post offices should be revisited as rural communities will not thrive in the face of constant closures of small post offices and other essential facilities nationwide.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have noted, it also may be time to revisit national planning policies in areas that suffer from rural depopulation.  In some parts of the country, including parts of County Meath, different areas are under different stresses in respect of one-off housing.  It is extremely difficult to get planning permission in some parts of County Meath, which means that young families cannot enter an area.  Consequently, fewer children attend local schools and problems then arise suddenly with regard to both sanctioning additional teachers and the <Col N="709"/>existing complement of teachers.  A crazy position has arisen whereby some schools in rural areas cannot find enough pupils although school classrooms are overcrowded eight miles away.  I know of one family that moved to a rural area.  When they told the local school principal the family had three children under the age of four, the principal nearly bit their hands off because suddenly it meant she could continue with her existing complement of teachers.  The issue of rural depopulation should be reconsidered in an attempt to work out how schools can be supported.  Schools are at the heart of a rural community, as are post offices.  This point must be understood and must be supported by reflecting it in national policy.</P>
        <P>A combination of factors, including investment in tourism, expansion of agricultural industry and assistance to local community services, can help to ensure both the survival and the success of rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his re-appointment as Minister.  A perception exists in certain circles that rural Ireland is akin to a pristine wilderness that is to be used at weekends and for holidays.  However, Members must acknowledge &mdash; as does the Minister &mdash; that rural Ireland is a place in which people live.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated that one third of our population lives in rural Ireland and I agree with him.  I am one of those who were born in rural Ireland and who went off to the city to enjoy themselves for ten years or so but who always wanted to return to rural Ireland.  One of my inspirations and reasons for becoming involved in politics was to help the lot of rural Ireland by trying to improve and develop it.</P>
        <P>I believe the rural development programme, the Leader approach and the CL&Aacute;R programmes are helping to address the economic needs and issues in rural Ireland.  The allocation of &euro;5 billion alone over the next seven years, of which &euro;2.5 billion will come from the European agricultural fund for rural development, shows the commitment of the Government and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to the preservation and development of rural Ireland.  The relevant schemes have been mentioned, including the diversification of projects, micro-enterprises and farm shops.  Farm produce is becoming highly popular and marts are coming back into fashion as people seek more organic produce grown closer to their doorsteps.  They know where such produce comes from through local branding, etc.  While this is highly important, there is a certain degree of elitism in that.  I do not know the reason because I go to my local farm shop and find it to be cheaper than some of the bigger supermarkets and the produce is fresher.  Consequently, I do not know the reason this is an elitist matter.</P>
        <P>The 12 rural recreation officers that the Minister intends to appoint in respect of rural walkways constitutes an excellent initiative.  I ask him to consider the coastline in County Wexford because it is possible to walk from Wexford town to parts of the Hook Peninsula.  No coastline walk was included in the aforementioned walkways and this would be a perfect locate in which to place one.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the enormous commitment of the Government towards the development of rural Ireland.  However, consideration must be given to curbing its social decline and this must become a priority.  As speakers have noted, we are lacking proper planning and development.  As the previous speaker observed, in schools that are five miles apart, one has pupils in prefabs while the other is crying out for teachers.  This demonstrates serious problems in our planning and development systems.  I believe that many of our planners are educated under the English system and consequently, as has been mentioned, they look at the pristine wilderness in which at weekends, there is shooting of rabbits, hunting etc. and coming down from the cities.  People who live in the cities have idyllic homes in rural Ireland that they can use at weekends.  However, people from the area in question are unable to get housing.</P><Col N="710"/>
        <P>I went to school in Our Lady&rsquo;s Island, which is in the extreme south-eastern corner of Ireland.  The principal of the local school, who happens to be my mother, is heartbroken that children in her locality who attended school there must go to bigger areas, such as Kilrane or Bridgetown, where sewerage systems are available.  No progress will be made until the issue of sewerage is considered, perhaps involving grouping and clustering sewerage schemes in rural Ireland because An Taisce will object to one-off housing.  Moreover, it now appears the pastime of the fisheries boards is to object to every discharge licence that enters a stream.  In some parts of Ireland, the soils do not percolate, which gives rise to a problem that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>Social housing policy appears to place houses in certain parts of rural Ireland.  This gives rise to the position in which one local school is placed under pressure while another does not attract pupils.  Localities in which people seek affordable and social housing or which have a local area plan appear to be blossoming and are under serious pressure &mdash; even school transport is under pressure from that perspective &mdash; while other areas are falling off.</P>
        <P>Planners and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must plan this issue properly and must assess the present position.  Sewerage schemes, water mains supply etc. must be brought to rural areas.  Under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, which pertains to financial contributions given by builders, etc., the moneys have been directed to a fund for building footpaths, etc., in rural areas and in towns.  In general, such amenities were placed in the areas in which building was taking place.  However, I am aware of a Supreme Court decision on this issue, which is questionable in itself.  This money is no longer there and the funds have dried up because of the present climate.  Some form of bridge must be considered to assist local authorities over the next couple of years, while waiting for building activity to pick up again.  Perhaps there could be an individual fund for footpaths etc.  As a young mother&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>One minute remains to the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps this subject should be addressed again as several other speakers wish to contribute and there is enormous interest in this issue.</P>
        <P>However, as a young mother, it is highly difficult to take a pram on to the road as one taking one&rsquo;s life in one&rsquo;s hands when one ventures out in rural Ireland.  People should not be prisoners in their own homes.  Some would suggest they are prisoners in their own homes because they are unable to visit rural pubs, which is another issue that must be considered.</P>
        <P>As I have the opportunity, I refer to the reduction of the blood alcohol limit from 80 milligram to 50 milligram.  I would like to examine the underlying statistics in this respect because I am unsure whether this step is necessary.  Perhaps the provision of footpaths should be considered.  This would make it safer for people to walk home from the pub.  Moreover, I refer to the subject of transport.  We should examine whether, under the F&Aacute;S or CL&Aacute;R projects, it would be possible to have a non-partisan initiative whereby a pick-up service could be provided.  People in these schemes could be put to the task of bringing people home from pubs.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work of the GAA and of the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association.  These are at the heart of rural communities, especially the GAA.  Some clubs provide transport home at weekends and that must be acknowledged.  I fully support every cent that goes from the sports capital scheme to the GAA clubs for development because it goes back manifold into the community.</P>
        <P>The instances of urban decline and the attempts to address them, such as the Ballymun and Moyross projects, are known to all.  There is also a social desolation and silent decline in rural Ireland but it is not heard because the people are a little quieter.  They are under pressure. <Col N="711"/> Rural crime features attacks by people from outside the area.  City dwellers stalk the area and pass on the information they obtain.  This is going on and a high-profile response is needed.  The answer lies in getting together with the local clubs, post offices, etc.</P>
        <P>We must invest in infrastructure.  The Minister is doing valuable work but he cannot do everything.  There are related Ministries, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Transport, all of which must come on board.  There must be a unified response and a balancing of economic progress with the social needs of rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this very important topic.  I was among the first of many Senators who looked for this debate and have been looking for it for quite some time.  I am impressed by the passion of Senator McDonald for the rural area, something I could hear in her speech.  I have a similar passion.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge the value and contribution people in rural areas and communities have made to date.  These have sustained them to the modern era and against the many pressures that have tried to batter down rural life.  Such people depended greatly on the many institutions in rural areas with which we are familiar, such as the school, the church, the post office and the Garda station.  The farming co-operatives also played a major role in rural Ireland, as did the various community groups that have been mentioned, such as the GAA, the ICA, the IFA and Macra na Feirme.  Muintir na T&iacute;re, a very valued group that is not heard of so much now, did enormous work in rural areas throughout the country.  There were also the business people, the small shopkeepers, the publicans and those who contributed in a considerable way to developing community facilities many years ago.  With very little help some of these have managed to sustain rural communities to date.</P>
        <P>I am saddened to see &mdash; and Senator McDonald was right about this &mdash; that rural areas are suffering in a very quiet way.  A silent population exists that does not protest too much.  There is isolation in rural areas.  I have finished a series of meetings around my constituency in Waterford during which I met many rural people who complained quietly, without getting up on a soapbox, about the lack of community resources and garda&iacute; in their areas.  The local pub might have closed or the local shop. There is a real fear that rural Ireland is becoming disconnected.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister also has a real passion about rural Ireland but he has a lot to do to convince some of his colleagues. I am a bit bemused to hear the Green Senator talk about rural proofing.  That is a new buzzword to me.  The rural proofing needed is support for rural areas and the people who live in them.  That to me is rural proofing and the buzzwords can be forgotten.</P>
        <P>At one time in rural areas the local garda was well-known to almost everyone in the community.  I now know rural areas that are being policed from almost 30 miles away.  Garda&iacute; come and go at times that may be opportune.  I say this in a public forum.  They come when there is a bit of a gathering, perhaps an event in the local pub.  They come for a bit of publicity, perhaps, and to be seen around the area.  Where are they when they are really needed, when robberies are taking place in these rural areas?  The local garda is not there and is not known.  That is a fact of life and I am sure the Minister will agree with me.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a role in this.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with what Senator Quinn said.  Regarding Garda service in rural areas he stated that it is a question of efficiency and that we will manage to get on with it.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays an important role in the protection of our society and in the delivery of a service to our citizens, no matter where they live.  I do not agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s views regarding efficiency in Garda services.  I am sure the same principle could be applied to post offices. <Col N="712"/> There is a social need to have these services in rural areas and if we do not have them, rural Ireland will die.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>On the broad issue of isolation, connectivity is very important.  I acknowledge the role of the rural transport initiatives that have been carried out in various counties and constituencies which have supported a degree of connectivity.  Senator de B&uacute;rca mentioned broadband and I became irate because I know, as do other Senators, that the broadband scheme and grant aid have been cut by the present Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I know he has funded the very good greener home scheme but he has taken the money from the broadband scheme.  That is a fact.  There are vast areas of this country that do not have any broadband coverage, good, bad or indifferent.  Without wireless, Eircom or any other type of broadband, they suffer and are at a major disadvantage. As supporters of rural areas, it does not reflect well on us if we do not highlight this fact.  That is why I am so vociferous on the matter.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator McDonald on support for basic infrastructure such as water and sewerage for villages and towns.  I urge one caution on the Senator.  We have a scheme in County Waterford where seven villages are grouped together but it has been a bureaucratic nightmare to get it through the various Departments.  We have been waiting three or four years for an offshore licence for some villages.  Some are ready to go but cannot until the others catch up.  There is a difficulty there.  That is certainly an efficiency which the Minister might introduce into the Departments to help these villages.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers about rural enterprises and diversification.  Considerable experience is available over past generations regarding agriculture.  There is diversification into agri-related businesses, whether food produce, horticulture, or equestrian.  Other speakers mentioned tourism and heritage.  I recently visited the award-winning Sliabh gCua family farm guesthouse in County Waterford that attracts tourists from all over the world.  Those people are selling a product that perhaps not many of our own people are aware of but they have guests from Europe, the USA, Canada and Australia as regular visitors.  They do a marvellous job in promoting our country and its rural areas.  We must see more of this type of business.  I acknowledge the role of Leader in supporting these small enterprises in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister will announce the Leader funding in the coming weeks.  A fund of &euro;425 million certainly is a large sum and I hope to see it spent well in different areas. When will the groups be expected to have tenders back for the funding?  A year has already been lost.  The programme was to have run from 2007 to 2013 and it is now mid-2008.  Will there be a quick turnaround with regard to the Department approving tenders?  Concerning projects that must start urgently, will there be any retrospection with respect of their qualification for Leader funds?  We are half way through the year and programmes are literally waiting for Leader funds to get going.  There are very worthwhile causes.  Given that the programme was supposed to run from 2007 to 2013, will it be extended in any way because of its late start?</P>
        <P>We can return to this debate. Those who represent rural areas are fewer in number in both Houses of the Oireachtas and our voices must be heard.  The communities and the people we represent depend on us to be heard when we come to Dublin to speak in the Oireachtas.  It is not merely the communities and public representatives that have a role to play in sustaining rural areas.  There is a need for real political leadership.  I believe the Minister has a passion for rural areas and that he wants to see sustainable things happening.  He has a job of work to do to convince his colleagues in Cabinet.  I hope, now that there is a Taoiseach from a rural background, that the Minister may have his ear and that he may be able to get the funds required and have the proper balanced regional development that has been promised in differ<Col N="713"/>ent programmes for Government.  That is what rural Ireland needs.  It is a vast area outside the Pale that needs the attention of politicians from all sides.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue which is close to my heart.  I wish the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, well on his re-appointment.  He is a former Member of this House, having served here with me from 1989 to 1993.  I acknowledge his tremendous work on behalf of rural communities.  We hear much about the disadvantages of living in rural areas, and there are some, but there are many advantages which should be highlighted and promoted.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for the rural transport initiative, which has been a huge success.  The Bantry rural transport scheme was one of the pilot schemes and it now covers all of west Cork, serving places such as Bere, Sherkin and Cape Clear islands and the Sheep&rsquo;s Head, Mizen and Beara peninsulas.  It has expanded to cover the Borlin valley and other remote areas.  It is a huge success and people should acknowledge it.  The night service, which is now being operated as a pilot scheme, might help to sustain life in rural villages by keeping rural pubs open and taking people to bingo halls, GAA meetings and so forth.  It is wonderful and I take my hat off to the Minister for it.</P>
        <P>Other successful initiatives in my constituency include the caring peninsulas project, a wonderful scheme whereby people check on others living in remote areas.  This wonderful project should be funded on a multi-annual basis.  There is also the provision of community cr&egrave;ches in rural areas.  The west Cork community partnership, now amalgamated with Leader, supported initiatives to help small farmers and to offer people advice on fishing and so forth.  Cork South-West has suffered as a result of the fisheries legislation.  Fishing is under severe threat from rising fuel costs and declining fish stocks so it is important we examine other ways of helping people in rural communities.</P>
        <P>We should not throw in the towel.  I grew up in an area where the herring fishing declined for different reasons.  There was hake fishing in Bantry Bay.  Time moves on, however, and unfortunately we cannot make fish more plentiful.  One initiative the Minister might examine closely for these rural areas, and it could equally apply to Connemara and parts of Donegal and Kerry, is fish farming.  Mussel farming is very successful in parts of west Cork and people are considering farming oysters, clams and scallops.  One of the biggest abalone farms in Europe, an initiative supported by the Minister&rsquo;s Department, has been opened on the Beara peninsula.  I wish the operators well.  There is an unlimited market for abalone in Japan and it is hoped the farm will create many jobs.  Bantry Bay has the largest mussel factory in Europe which provides approximately 120 jobs.  It is under some threat but I hope it will be sustained.  There should be a more hands-on approach to salmon ranching.  The Minister supported me in my endeavours to support the salmon farmers over recent years.  There is also the option of wild salmon farming which has been carried out successfully in Canada and other places.</P>
        <P>The one-off rural housing issue is close to my heart.  It should be re-examined.  The Department&rsquo;s CL&Aacute;R programme seeks to prevent the decline of rural areas by encouraging people to live in those areas and providing sustainable employment and local services, such as small sewerage and water schemes.  I compliment the Minister on the programme.  Many little villages and towns in my constituency have secured money through CL&Aacute;R to provide and extend water and sewerage services in remote areas.  A huge sum of money has also been spent on boreens.  There have been huge improvements in the past ten years as a result of the Department co-funding schemes with the local authorities.  Long may such schemes last.</P>
        <P>I am not sure what can be done about one-off rural housing.  I spoke passionately on the issue on the RTE programme &ldquo;Questions And Answers&rdquo; some years ago.  An Taisce should have no role in objecting to one-off rural housing.  It should concentrate on its role in protecting <Col N="714"/>special buildings.  The organisation has a role to play in society but it should not get involved in one-off rural housing.  I recall fighting for two or three planning permissions for local people in Rosnacaheragh.  There are 13 children and two teachers in the local school.  However, there are far more holiday homes in the area than homes for local people.  Eventually, I persuaded the then manager of the council to come out to visit the area and the planning permissions were granted.  The school is now beginning to revive with new life.</P>
        <P>After the general election last year, in which I lost my D&aacute;il seat, I visited the islands of Mull and Iona and the Isle of Skye in Scotland.  The Isle of Skye was a typical case of rural decline where the population on the island declined.  However, initiatives were put in place to encourage fish farming and environmentally friendly developments on the island.  As a result, the population started to grow again.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the issue of rural life and where people should live.  A socioeconomic survey was carried out four or five years ago which compared the Beara peninsula in west Cork with Ballymun in Dublin.  Lest anybody think everything in rural areas is rosy, there are disadvantages.  The Beara peninsula is remote from many areas.  However, the survey showed that 70% of children reared on the Beara peninsula received third level education while in Ballymun, and I do not condemn Ballymun for its problems, only 7% of children reached third level.  I am the youngest of a family of 11.  When I was growing up we had no electricity and lived 13 miles from the nearest town.  We survived on a little fishing and farming.  Things have changed but we were as happy as pigs in muck.  There is another word for it but I will not use it.  There are some great advantages to living in rural areas.</P>
        <P>The Minister has done phenomenal work in the past 11 years in the Department.  I welcome the &euro;450 million that is due to be spent under the new Leader programme and other initiatives.  Long may that continue.  The Minister is to be complimented on his work.  Rural areas would be at a greater loss if the Minister had not held office for the past decade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, congratulate the Minister on his re-appointment.  Like other speakers, I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s sincere passion for rural Ireland, which I share.  I consider myself an example of rural Ireland at its best.  I come from a small farm on the side of a hill in rural Tipperary.  I have taken note of the new Taoiseach&rsquo;s change of language since his election.  He speaks about communities, rural areas and developing this, that and the other.  I do not doubt his sincerity but will he provide the funds to allow his vision become reality?  I will try to help the Minister to secure those funds because they are very necessary.  However, I believe the Taoiseach is simply trying to move the debate away from an economy that is, unfortunately, on a downward trend.</P>
        <P>I wish to bring a number of points to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  We could discuss this subject for hours but I will address just a few areas.  I support the rural transport scheme, which is a great initiative.  Unfortunately, however, it is not funded to the level that is required.  Is the Minister certain that the commitments made in the national development plan will be met?  I believe the commitments are totally under-funded.  There should be an increase beyond what is promised in the NDP for this initiative.  It has been shown in various studies that where it works well, there has been a reduction in depression and loneliness, etc., particularly among elderly people.  There has been a decrease in the number of visits to general practitioners for reasons associated with mental illness and depression, etc.  The Minister might want to examine a study that was conducted in Macroom.  I understand that the former Deputy, Moosajee Bhamjee, has made some helpful statements on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Departments of Transport and Health and Children were engaged in discussions about the use of the rural transport initiative to take people in isolated areas to medical appointments. <Col N="715"/> I am talking about bringing people to doctors&rsquo; surgeries rather than substituting for the ambulance service.  I understand that the discussions ended when there was a budgetary dispute.  Could they be renewed?  If the HSE could get local transport managers to employ rural transport administrators to bring people to doctors&rsquo; appointments, it would be a huge advance.  I do not think petty squabbling about budgets should come into play.  We should change the rules of the scheme so that all journeys no longer need to be point-to-point.  It should be more flexible and cover one-off journeys.  That would be a progressive move because many people want to do day trips, etc.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have spoken about the closure of shops, pubs, restaurants, post offices and churches in rural areas.  Perhaps the Minister&rsquo;s brief does not extend to doing something about the closure of churches.  When the market fails, we should adopt the concept referred to by Senator Quinn earlier.  I refer to what is known in economic philosophy as &ldquo;externality&rdquo;, which happens when the social benefits of a transaction outweigh its economic benefits.  We should consider offering an incentive to maintain the last post office, shop or &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; pub in a locality.  Like other Senators, I think we need to see the data underpinning the proposed changes to the drink driving laws.  If the data indicate that making a change is the right thing to do, that will be fair enough.  Perhaps the Minister will examine whether incentives can be put in place to save the last local business in a particular category in each rural area.  The Labour Party made proposals in this regard before the last general election.</P>
        <P>As I have said in this House previously, I am an inside trader when it comes to tourism.  I left a position with F&aacute;ilte Ireland when I was elected to this House.  I was present for a number of announcements made by the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, over the years.  The figures show that the tourism industry is in decline in the midlands and mid-west areas.  We will not be able to do anything about that until the role of Dublin Tourism is addressed.  Dublin Tourism, which does a fine job, is very good for Dublin.  As Dublin is the main point of access into Ireland, however, it also needs to do a fine job to encourage people to visit the spine of Ireland.  That is not being done.  I do not believe Dublin Tourism should be outside the remit of F&aacute;ilte Ireland as it is at present.  Perhaps the Minister will talk to his colleague about this serious issue.  Tourism is essential for rural Ireland.</P>
        <P>I support the initiatives taken by Mr. John Concannon in respect of the islands.  The Minister has been involved in such matters.  Mr. Concannon currently works on the promotion of our inland waterways, which is fantastic.  The Minister has initiated part of the project.  There is no such thing as a product called &ldquo;rural tourism&rdquo; &mdash; there is merely tourism in rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Rural Ireland will not have the products needed to embrace tourism unless cohesion funding is linked to the work being done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Rural Ireland depends totally on domestic tourism.  It is not getting a fair bang from the international buck.</P>
        <P>Reference has been made to the Beara walk.  There are issues in relation to the co-operation of the county councils.  Perhaps the Minister will examine the matter.  I do not believe it is succeeding as it could.  I ask the Minister to support those of us who are opposing the changes proposed by the EU to the HACCP legislation.  The changes will force people working in farmers&rsquo; markets to have running hot and cold water on tap.  If the change is agreed, it will have a detrimental impact on farmers&rsquo; markets.  The Minister might not be aware of this issue.  Perhaps he will discuss it with his colleagues.  I agree with those who have spoken about rural housing.  To date, the Green Party&rsquo;s attitude to broadband services has been a disgrace.  Some countries in eastern Europe have a better broadband service than Ireland.  We need innovative ways of addressing these problems.  Broadband is needed in rural Ireland.  The agencies which <Col N="716"/>are trying to attract small and indigenous high-value enterprises are unable to do so in the absence of broadband services.</P>

	<P>Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go raibh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht iontach againn ar maidin.  S&iacute;lim gur b&rsquo;fhi&uacute; go m&oacute;r an m&eacute;id seo de d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht a bheith againn.  The more we debate these issues, the more I think we should deal with many of them in much more detail at a later stage.  I am prepared to use the Seanad for the purpose for which it was established.  While it is a legislative body, of course, it also has a role in teasing out issues and finding solutions.  In the limited time available to me, I will be unable to deal with the many issues which have been raised.  I intend to address one or two specific issues and group the other matters under certain headings.  I suggest that we should debate such matters in more detail, as part of an attempt to find solutions to certain problems, at a later stage.</P>
        <P>I will deal with a number of issues relating to the rural development programme.  The EU agreed the programme, for which my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are responsible, last August or September.  It is a fallacy to think that any member state could have been ready to start implementing the programme from 1 January.  That is not how it works.  I accept that two and a half or three months were lost as a result of the issue that was raised by the Cavan-Monaghan Leader group, with which I will deal in a moment.  Ireland will be one of the first countries, if not the first country, out of the blocks, as it was in the last programme.  It is good that &euro;425 million is still available.  It will be spent over a timeframe that is one year shorter.  We will have to spend more every year from now on.  All the projects have to be approved between now and 2013 and payments will be made in 2014 and 2015.  We are still making payments under the last programme, which ended in 2006.</P>
        <P>The Cavan-Monaghan Leader group raised a question with the EU, as it was entitled to do.  I explained to the Leader groups, which were incredibly supportive, that it would have been wrong of me not to deal with this in a patient manner.  I am delighted that the permanent representative received a letter from the European Union in the last week.  I would like to quote from the letter.  It refers to the complaint made by Mr. Derek McCabe, who is the chairperson of Cavan-Monaghan Rural Development Co-operative Society Limited, about the cohesion process.  The phrase &ldquo;my services&rdquo; in the letter refers to the legal directorate of agriculture and rural development.  The letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I wrote to the legal representative of Mr. McCabe, Mr. Philip Lee, on the 9th of April 2008, informing him that my services will propose to the commission to close the file on his complaint at one of the forthcoming meetings of the commission for the reasons set out.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The letter then goes into the details of those reasons, before continuing:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is no information which has been brought to the attention of my services to indicate that the additional criteria present in the national programme or country are contrary to the principles of the Leader method, as set out in article 61 of regulation EC/1698/05, which should in general guide the implementation of the Leader access.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is clear that the EU is perfectly happy with Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the programme.  I would like to make it clear, in response to another issue that was raised, that there is no retrospection.  In other words, if one does the work before the grant is allocated, that is it.  I think that is common to all grants of which people are aware.</P>
        <P>I would like to run through a few more matters before I run out of time.  Senators raised many issues, such as rural transport, garda&iacute; and schools, which I like to group together as <Col N="717"/>&ldquo;social services&rdquo;.  Many rural schools not only have class sizes that are as big as anywhere else in the country, but they also have multiple classes, yet still the results are way better.  This goes back to my argument about the community culture involved.</P>
        <P>In addition to post offices I would cite credit unions, although nobody mentioned their growth and the major contribution they have made to rural Ireland.  I see such outlets as a group, not in an administrative or specialist sense, but as regards their role in rural areas.</P>
        <P>Speakers have referred to pubs in the context of rural social life, but restaurants constitute a new and growing phenomenon.  Do nightclubs suck all our young people into towns?  Does the way in which we operate such matters have a detrimental effect?  We should examine the issue of social life.</P>
        <P>Many infrastructural issues were raised in the debate, including water and sewerage schemes for small towns and villages.  I agree with the agglomerating effect in this regard.  In addition, we have done quite a bit of work on electricity supplies.  Ministers can transfer money where there is no expenditure involved under a certain heading.  In other words, if I find for one reason or another beyond my control that there is an underspend in one heading, one can often obtain permission from the Department of Finance to transfer the money concerned.</P>
        <P>We are at the final stages of a national broadband scheme, which will cover 99.5% of the remaining areas that do not have broadband facilities.  Somebody has made a minor legal challenge but we hope it will be overcome quickly.  The result of the tendering process was to be known next month but it may run into the following month.  It should be known this summer, however, following which the roll-out will occur.  That will bring broadband to every rural area.</P>
        <P>There is a saying in Irish, Is fearr deireanach n&aacute; go br&aacute;ch, but I believe this rural broadband approach is the only sustainable way of doing it.  The way to finish it is through one big bang.  The intention was announced last April and it has taken a year to get the preferred final bidders.  It is a slow process but it is at the endgame.  All the decisions have been made so it can now be finalised.</P>
        <P>The heading of social services includes the community services programme, F&Aacute;S, the rural social scheme, sport and volunteerism in rural Ireland, as well as services for children and the elderly.  I see that as another module.  Members have spoken about barriers which exist, but there are also incredible business opportunities.  At a time of economic downturn, I can think of a large number of such matters.  Senators referred to rural recreation and rural tourism generally.  The potential is unlimited because of our climate, topography, countryside, waterways, hills and mountains.  We have so many opportunities but we need enough time, effort and energy to get them all operating.  We should examine all those aspects to see how we can exploit them.</P>
        <P>We spoke about the number of young people attending third and fourth level education, which is an accrued intellectual resource.</P>
        <P>The planning debate has been very confrontational.  I do not want to destroy the visible beauty of rural Ireland and we can avoid doing so by engaging in a rational debate with those concerned.  We should be able to have houses and communities without destroying rural areas.  Some planning policies have been totally negative.</P>
        <P>The other interesting point is the myth that, by definition, urban dwellers leave a smaller carbon footprint than those in rural areas.  I do not believe that and I am willing to debate the point with the leading experts.  I recently received a report of the fantastic work being done by the Western Development Commission, including on wood energy.  The commission said, however, that wood energy will not work unless one lives near a forest or a timber mill, which are not in town centres.  Therefore, if one wanted to cut one&rsquo;s energy usage through the use of <Col N="718"/>timber, one would be much better off in the countryside than in the city.  Solar panels have a major role to play and are often easier to install in rural areas where there is more space.</P>
        <P>We should have a rational debate about positive and negative aspects of planning, in addition to discussing rural tourism and recreation.  Those are just a few headings that we should return to on another occasion.  If Senators wish to discuss such elements I am up for it.  I will leave that proposal with the Seanad as an offer.</P>
        <P>I have a big concern for deprived, disadvantaged rural areas, which come under the ambit of the RAPID programme.  Any debate on the positive aspects of rural Ireland must be counterbalanced by the fact that young people in certain areas of our towns and cities are predetermined to grow up amid the greatest disadvantage.  What are we going to do about that big challenge?</P>
        <P>Despite rural depopulation, some 70% of pupils in a small three-teacher school in my own community went on to third level.  That was long before there were remedial and resource teachers.  On the other hand, however, there are areas where only 2%, 5% or 7% of pupils go on to third level education.  That is a scandal and we face a big problem in this respect.  I am more than willing to return to this House to discuss these matters in detail and determine what the physical or social barriers are and how we should tackle the issue.  As well as physical renewal in urban areas, we also need social renewal.  If we do not change people&rsquo;s social values, we can build all the new physical structures we want but they will not solve the problems which will confront us again in five or ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Our time is up but I will allow a few brief questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s offer to debate the various issues in the House on another occasion.  Rural development is such a broad area that one cannot deal with it in one debate.  I thank the Minister for his offer.  </P>
        <P>We welcome the increase of &euro;425 million in funding for rural development under the Leader programme.  What is the timescale for tendering from the various Leader groups around the country?  Will there be a quick turnaround process in that regard?  As I said earlier, many people are urgently awaiting such funds and hoping they will qualify for them.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s views on rural planning policy.  We should revisit this matter.  I am concerned by some terms such as &ldquo;rural proofing&rdquo;.  What is &ldquo;rural proofing&rdquo;?  It should not be allowed to enter the political lexicon.  Is rural proofing aimed against farmers or others?  Is it just protecting rural areas for weekend use, as another speaker said?  I hope that theory is not advanced in any way.</P>
        <P>The Opposition will welcome whatever initiatives are announced to improve broadband penetration in rural areas.  We have already been through the community broadband scheme, which did not achieve its objectives despite the money and resources that were spent on it.  Britain and Northern Ireland have done it by achieving nearly 99% penetration, so surely we can learn from them.  I ask the Minister to examine the UK model to determine methods of delivering broadband to rural areas.  Nowadays, broadband is nearly as essential as rural water and sewerage schemes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the social effects of nightclubs in attracting young people away from rural areas into towns.  I advocate the theming of pubs, including restaurant add-ons, which should be facilitated.  Such theming would avoid forcing people into towns for social activities.  The Minister should examine that matter.  He might also look at health and safety legislation concerning the preparation of food. </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="719"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I posed two questions earlier.  Will the Minister use his good offices to examine the rural transport scheme with regard to facilitating health appointments?  In some places people simply do not go to the doctor.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister also re-examine the issue of point-to-point events, perhaps allowing a percentage of one-off activities, such as ten trips per year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The turnaround, once we advertise this, will be five or six weeks.  Let us be realistic.  I expect grants will be approved in October.  The Leader programme companies have not helped themselves here.  Instead of starting from scratch in October, if there is a good idea for a project, preliminary work could be started by interested companies.  The operating rules will become available in time.  Such companies could proceed in advance of official sanction.  The scheme will be open for anybody to apply, but most areas will only have a limited number of applications.</P>
        <P>In was only in later years that the previous programme took off.  In principle, there should be no gap between the programmes but it happens all over Europe and the problem is not unique to Ireland.  We are still one of the fastest out of the traps.  I will check the rate of our progress.</P>
        <P>Rural proofing has been around for a considerable time.  There are many types of proofing these days and I am not a fan of this method.  A draft memorandum will contain a section at the end asking whether the document is rural-proofed, gender-proofed poverty-proofed and so on.  The answer is already contained in the memorandum.  I try to approach the job in a different way and as policies are introduced ensure the job is done in a way that is sustainable for rural Ireland.  The theory is fine, but in practice it sometimes becomes just a paper exercise and I have no interest in that.</P>
        <P>I accept that the broadband scheme was not a great success.  Some two years ago the Government realised that because of barriers in the market, such as those caused by industry regulation and so on, a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach was necessary.  It took a decision to take this approach.  Last April there was an advertisement in the newspapers requesting bidders to provide broadband in the parts of rural Ireland that were not covered.  There was an extended mapping exercise to find the relevant areas.  By the following autumn there were four preferred bidders.  The hope was this process would yield one successful bidder by early this summer.  That is the current position.  It is like planning for motorways, only when the construction companies start work do people really believe it will happen, even though years of planning have been carried out.  We are at the final stage of the tender process.  I understand it will take between one year and 18 months to roll out fully.  This roll-out will stimulate some of the companies to enter the market in some of the areas in which they have not operated to date.  Some companies stood to make losses in certain circumstances because of the option to telephone using the internet.</P>
        <P>Regarding theme pubs, night clubs, public houses and so on, there has been growth in the market for rural restaurants, as people eat out more.  We should recognise that the decline of the rural pub is not only the result of drink driving legislation.  It is also being caused by changes in society such as the prevalence of more comfortable houses, fewer bachelors living alone and many other factors.  We must provide solutions that make businesses in rural Ireland sustainable and change the view that there is only the standard pub to be considered.  It should also be recognised that people expect more comfort.  It is possible to see examples around the country of a local pub closing down to be replaced by a huge hotel with excellent facilities, and the local people using the new hotel.  These people want higher standards.  It is like comparing the old facilities at Croke Park with the new stadium.  The GAA realised that the old Croke Park <Col N="720"/>would not attract the spectators of the future, so a new stadium was built with facilities that were laughed at by some people.  However, spectators began to come in ever increasing numbers.</P>
        <P>We have done much work on the hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, standards legislation.  It is possible to see these standards either as a nuisance or as an inconvenience that will eventually bring significant benefits and my view is, ultimately, inclined towards the latter.  We know that, for example, when Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, appeared in Europe, our beef market collapsed.  It was not because people died in significant numbers from the disease as a result of eating Irish beef, but because of the perception.</P>
        <P>I recently presented awards to butchers in the west who attained a HACCP standard.  With the support of the local authority and specialist advice we can help people reach the high standards necessary.  These standards can in turn be used as a marketing tool indicating that we have the safest food of all.  The issue of hot and cold taps was raised and my answer is that we should give money to provide them.  Through the CL&Aacute;R programme I have given money for farmers&rsquo; markets that do not have adequate facilities.  The mart of the old days &mdash; a rough place &mdash; is changing.  I believe there is an excellent market in County Kilkenny that is thoroughly modern and supported by FBD, other insurance companies and so on.  Farmers&rsquo; organisations have offices on site there and there are cafeterias to match what one would find in any hotel.  This is a far cry from the wellie cafeterias of older markets.  That is the way the world is changing and I keep saying to those people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Change is taking place and in my 30 years in rural Ireland I often find a discrepancy between claims about what rural people want and their actual requests.  Rural people keep moving ahead of our wishes for the past.  The best way to create a sustainable rural environment is to keep some of the good from the old world, but facilities for people are improving.  Given a choice between the old hotel in the town and the posh new hotel, most people will choose the new hotel and it is great that we have the resources for this progress.</P>
        <P>To address Senator Alan Kelly&rsquo;s point, I have done much work to try to use the rural transport scheme to provide a facility for hospital visits.  This approach makes sense, and it is not only related to the HSE.  In everything I do I encounter difficulties when I bring groups of people together to do something that makes good sense and should not require much convincing to get an agreement.  However, people have an infinite ability to get lost in the small print.  I believe in cutting a deal and getting on with the matter at hand.  Once could argue forever and a day &mdash; voluntary groups can be as bad as statutory agencies in this regard &mdash; over small issues rather than seeing the big picture.  Ireland must move on from this approach to life.</P>
        <P>I met a very fine person recently with whom I worked on rural development years ago in Connemara.  He recalled how in the early days we took a risk in starting projects, only some of which worked but at least we took the risk.  His view is that nowadays, so much study is required, every possible obstruction is raised and there must be a dotting of the i&rsquo;s and a crossing of the t&rsquo;s to the point of frustration.  We need to return to a more &ldquo;can do&rdquo; approach.</P>
        <P>As politicians, we should focus on getting the job done.  We should admit failure when it happens, but failure is not a reason to do nothing.  I remember providing playgrounds in the RAPID areas, one or two of which were vandalised.  Certain people in the media tried to create a story about this.  My sharp answer was that the vandalism was a pity, but I did not regret the <Col N="721"/>installation of the 43 playgrounds that were not vandalised.  The two that were would be replaced and CCTV installed.  I refused to quit just because two of the initiatives failed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an tAire as ucht na reachta&iacute;ochta seo a chur os comhair an tSeanaid agus a mh&iacute;ni&uacute;.</P>
        <P>The Bill is being introduced in the context of the official recognition in the European Union of Gaeilge as an official and working language of the Union.  The basic purpose is that there be an adequate number of barristers and solicitors capable of practising law in the language and that, in general, the professions have an adequate knowledge to deal with documents in Irish.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill.  The way it is structured in terms of the provision of a basic course and an advanced course by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and King&rsquo;s Inns accommodates different views on the way the matter is dealt with.  I am aware it allays many of the concerns of a number of groups which are anxious that there will be offered at least a basic course in Irish.  In practising in the Law Library I am always surprised by the number of barristers with total proficiency in the language and who regularly act in cases held through Irish.  On the capacity of the Bar, I can vouch for some outstanding barristers who are capable of fulfilling the objective of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I have one question for the Minister.  We have a situation where one can qualify as a barrister without necessarily sitting an examination in the language.  There are some who have passed the examination but have not sat the examination in Irish or perhaps have failed an examination either in the Law Society of Ireland or King&rsquo;s Inns.  Are they being accommodated?  Is there <Col N="726"/>an element of retrospection to deal with the few qualified lawyers who have been caught, as it were, by their lack of proficiency in the language?</P>
        <P>I note the case of Dr. Art Cosgrave, the former president of University College Dublin, who in a sense was a conscientious objector in sitting the examination last year and wonder whether that type of case can be or has been addressed by the Minister.  That is the only question I have about the Bill.  In general, I am happy with its construction and formulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis de bharr a bheith ceaptha mar Aire ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas m&oacute;r orm go bhfuil st&aacute;das &aacute; thabhairt don Ghaeilge sa Bhille seo.  Thug an Taoiseach spreagadh m&oacute;r don Ghaeilge le d&eacute;ana&iacute;. </P>
        <P>With my colleague, I too support the Bill.  I am delighted the Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is present in the House again, as he has a natural love of the Irish language.  Within the Law Society of Ireland and the King&rsquo;s Inns there is a further effort to promote the use of the Irish language among practising barristers and solicitors.  The Bill is a step in the right direction and a further recognition that the Irish language is an official language within the European Union.  It is another reason those who love and promote the Irish language should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the Lisbon treaty referendum.</P>
        <P>When I was in college, I travelled to London every year to work on the building sites with men from Connemara, County Kerry and throughout Ireland to make some money.  It was hard work but it paved the way for another year in college.  The venue in Blackhall Place was not used at the time, in 1973 or 1974.  When we did our degree course, we had to do a first, second and third law examination before we would be entertained in seeking an apprenticeship but that has changed since, for the better.  I was called in to do the Irish examination.  My mother &mdash; God be good to her &mdash; telephoned my brother and I had to return some time in the month of July to sit the examination.  The venue in Blackhall Place was not used at the time.  It was probably in Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
        <P>I was reasonably fluent in Irish when I had done my leaving certificate, having attended Col&aacute;iste an Chro&iacute; Naofa, Carraig na bhFear.  For my sins my Irish has got rusty, but I was involved at the time with Conradh na Gaeilge, with the headquarters in Harcourt Street.  I arrived to do the examination for which I had done no preparation.  I recall that the flight from Gatwick Airport to Dublin was &pound;9.  When I arrived to do the examination, in front of me were two black Africans, without, God bless them, a notion of the Irish language.  Whatever chance I had, from the Sheepshead peninsula, these boys from the Cape of Good Hope, or wherever, had a good deal less, I surmised.  I believe it was a written and an oral examination, and I was reasonably flaithi&uacute;il with the language then.  After about five minutes, the examiner, presumably from the Gaeltacht area of west Cork, either from Coolea or Ballingeary, which was quite close to me, showed me the door on the basis that I had more Irish than he had, which was probably true at the time.  Afterwards I was wondering how the other two had got on.  That was more than 30 years ago.</P>
        <P>The thrust of this whole debate is to raise the bar as far as the Irish language is concerned within the Law Society&rsquo;s school,  Blackhall Place, and also in King&rsquo;s Inns.  I am delighted that within the last two or three years it was decided that the Blackhall Place course can now be done in Cork.  My son will be starting his apprenticeship, hopefully, within the next three months, and he will be able to fulfil the first and advanced courses of Blackhall Place in Cork.  That is a major saving for people from rural Ireland and perhaps if it succeeds in Cork it could be replicated in Galway, to support the people in the west of Ireland, and so on.</P>
        <P>AT NUI Cork, there is a course for the BCL degree as Gaeilge.  I was fortunate enough to chair the Joint Committee on the Constitution in the five-year period until 2002.  Prior to that, <Col N="727"/>when it was chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, we visited NUI Cork.  One of the reports of the committee had been published as Gaeilge and we presented it to some of the students we met.  Some 23 students at the time were studying law and they were all studying Irish.  I presume it could be done with French, German and other languages too.  Nonetheless, it was great that they had the option of doing the BCL degree while at the same time furthering their knowledge of the Irish language.  It was a wonderful development.</P>
        <P>I have one question for the Minister, and perhaps he might not be able to answer it.  I have no doubt, as my colleague, Senator Regan has indicated, that there is a growing number of practitioners both within the Law Society and at the Bar, who have a great love for Irish, and would wish to expand and extend it &mdash; using it in court work and in dealing with people generally.  It must be the case in places such as the Dingle peninsula, Connemara and other parts, that people who have to attend court may want to defend themselves or be defended through Irish.  This Bill gives enormous encouragement to such people.  As somebody noted earlier, many people abandon the Irish language once they have taken the leaving certificate, which is a shame and a pity.  I sometimes feel ashamed of that myself.  Here we have an opportunity in that a platform is being given to the Irish.  It is of critical importance, too, that there will be an official assessment and that the law lecturers, professors, etc., will be tested on their ability to deal with legal complexities and niceties through the Irish language.  A register of such people is to be kept and it is not to be a hit and miss affair.</P>
        <P>The other point I wanted to put to the Minister was whether sufficient members of the Judiciary can deal with cases through Irish, where somebody wants to exercise his or her constitutional right to be defended, or use the Irish language in advocacy through the courts.  That is importance, since it would be a fatuous exercise, for instance if, say, only 15% of senior and junior counsel and also solicitors, were prepared to reach the necessary standard to use the language in the courtroom and advise clients in Irish.  In the event, there might be a problem if sufficient judges, in the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court did not have a facility in Irish at the required level.  I am not accusing anyone, because I realise that there is an onus on High Court, and perhaps Supreme Court judges to have a great understanding of the Irish language.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction and I am happy to support it.  It is wonderful to see the Irish language getting a boost.  I am pleased the new Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, has shown such great respect for the Irish language, as exemplified in his speech at Arbour Hill, on the day he was appointed Taoiseach and even on the day he was made leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, when he went back to Offaly.  I believe it is an enormous fillip for the Irish language that the Taoiseach is taking a hands-on approach.  He is giving a big boost to the language, which must have a knock-on effect.</P>
        <P>I am also pleased to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, to the Chamber, and wish him every success with his new brief and his transfer within the Department of Health and Children.  This is a promotion within the ministerial ranks and I wish him luck.</P>
        <P>I fully support the Bill and I hope it will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim comhghairdeas leis.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; an t-&aacute;dh leis ina phost nua.  Molaim an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Tuathail as a bheith in ann an Ghaeilge a stealladh le linn a chuid ama ag caint.  Is c&uacute;is n&aacute;ire &eacute; domsa nach bhfuil m&eacute; in ann sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  I am most embarrassed I cannot give my full speech in Irish.  This is despite the fact that when I was in secondary school, I would have considered myself to have a l&iacute;ofacht sa teanga nach bhfuil agam inniu.  As a practitioner, I would see the Bill as a serious improvement on the current situation.  Making it optional to practise in Irish or to hold proficiency in Irish to practise as a barrister or solicitor will encourage the use of the language and of a culture of use of Irish throughout the professions.  Perhaps it is more obvious in the Law Library and the Four Courts that barristers hold a certain gr&aacute; don teanga than is perhaps the case in a solicitor&rsquo;s profession.  This could be because they accumulate in the one area more often.</P>
        <P>If one were to examine the case of the typical law student, who would go from leaving certificate to university to study law and then onwards to either the Law Society or the King&rsquo;s Inns, most of them at one stage in their lives would have had a high level of proficiency in the language which then erodes through lack of use.  If there was encouragement to continue that, such as is provided in this Bill, and to sit examinations and the advanced courses that will be available in legal Irish, there would be a huge uptake.  I look forward to reviewing the Bill in a couple of years when we will see the changes that have taken place.</P>
        <P>When I was sitting the mandatory Irish exam for the Law Society, a friend of mine of Indian extraction learned off by heart an essay on l&aacute; faoin tuath, which had no relevance whatsoever to the practice of law but equally had no relevance to the question that was asked in the exam.  Fair play to him.  He went into the exam, wrote out the essay word perfect and passed the exam despite the fact it was about l&aacute; cois farraige, not l&aacute; faoin tuath.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is a welcome advance.  As part of the bilingual policy from the Government, it will enhance the use of the Irish language.  I come from an area in Loch Gorman where Gaeilge is not much used and one must go back many years to find Gaeltacht areas where it was spoken.  Through the gaelscoileanna and people like Gizzy Lyng, the Wexford hurler who is able to commentate in Irish on TG4, we can now see an upsurge in the use of the language.  Much of this is coming from the teaching profession.  I look forward to the legal profession taking a role.  The Bill will do much to help those people who at one time had proficiency in the language to maintain that and will encourage them to use it throughout their careers.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>What will happen with regard to solicitors and barristers who want to get back into the swing of things and become proficient in Irish?  I did not notice any mechanism in the Bill whereby they could be retrained in the language.  Also, if a barrister wanted to run a case through Irish, are there enough judges at all levels who are proficient in the language?  There is an old Irish saying &mdash; mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&eacute;.  Today, we can say that.  If we encourage Irish, it will work.  Heretofore, we have made Irish mandatory but this has not worked.  This is a new departure.  I look forward to and support the implementation of the Bill.</P>

Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn c&oacute;ras &eacute;ifeachtach a chur i bhfeidhm.  Caithfidh an ch&oacute;ras sin a bheith mac&aacute;nta freisin.  Luaigh an tAire an Acht Lucht Cleachtuithe Dl&iacute; (C&aacute;il&iacute;ocht) 1929, a fhor&aacute;lann gur ch&oacute;ir d&rsquo;abhc&oacute;id&iacute; &ldquo;leor-eolas&rdquo; ar an dteanga a bheith acu.  M&iacute;n&iacute;tear &ldquo;leor-eolas&rdquo; san Acht sin mar an m&eacute;id sin oilteachta i labhairt agus i scr&iacute;obh na Gaeilge agus is leor chun a chur ar chumas cleacht&oacute;ra dl&iacute;, le h&eacute;ifeacht, treoracha a ghlacadh, comhairle a thabhairt do chliaint, finn&eacute;ithe a cheisti&uacute; agus imeachta&iacute; sa Ghaeilge a thuiscint.

We must be honest about having a system in place that allows and provides for an efficient and reliable system to be available for people who wish to have their business in court conducted in Irish.  There is little point in continuing with what in reality has been a fiction, as referred to by Senators McDonald and O&rsquo;Toole.  The fiction goes back to the 1929 Act where that system was put in place.  For 80 years it simply has not been the reality at the level that was contemplated in 1929.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Rinne m&eacute; an scr&uacute;d&uacute; seo i 1987, nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; in &Oacute;sta&iacute; an R&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; olltoghch&aacute;n ar si&uacute;l ag an am ch&eacute;anna.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag obair in RTE ag an am sin.  Th&aacute;inig na tortha&iacute; amach an l&aacute; tar &eacute;is an toghch&aacute;in.  N&iacute; raibh m&oacute;r&aacute;n ullmh&uacute;ch&aacute;in d&eacute;anta agam don scr&uacute;d&uacute; Gaeilge an l&aacute; ch&eacute;anna.  Chuaigh me isteach go dt&iacute; &Oacute;sta&iacute; an R&iacute; ar mo rothar chun bualadh leis an scr&uacute;daitheoir.  Bh&iacute; an-suim aige sna tortha&iacute; &oacute; Chontae Maigh Eo.  It may interest you in particular, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that he was very keen to know what was happening with regard to the results in County Mayo.  I have to tell you that ceapaim gur Fianna F&aacute;iler a bh&iacute; ann, rather than a Fine Gaeler.  Bh&iacute; an-suim aige sna tortha&iacute; &oacute; Chontae Maigh Eo.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; &aacute;balta nuacht a thabhairt d&oacute;.  I was able to give him news of his favourite candidate who he was watching out for.  Bh&iacute; an-&aacute;thas air nuair a chuala s&eacute; an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; agam.  D&rsquo;&eacute;irigh liom sa scr&uacute;d&uacute; Gaeilge.

I was delighted to pass <Col N="731"/>the test but somewhat miffed to discover that my friend, who had never learned a single word of Irish ever because he had been given some sort of dispensation or exemption in school, passed with equally flying colours ten minutes later.  This was the sort of fiction that was evident.  Admittedly, this has improved in recent years.  I agree very strongly with my colleagues&rsquo; point that we need to put in place a system that does justice to the language and makes presumptions about people&rsquo;s knowledge thereof.  As Senator McDonald rightly said, the system should encourage professional lawyers to learn Irish and reach a certain level of proficiency while at the same time favouring those who make an effort to reach a higher level.</P>
        <P>There was some debate on a number of amendments tabled by my colleague, Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea, in the D&aacute;il.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Carey, said that during Committee Stage in this House, he would return to some of the matters raised.  Nuair a bheidh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh further discussion againn on individuals who are already in the system, as touched upon by Senator Regan and others.  I refer also to those who went through the system 30 or 40 years ago but who did not pass the test and were deprived of their qualification.  I do not know why they did not have the same outcome as my friend who did not have a word of Irish.  Perhaps they did not have the same examiner.</P>
        <P>I welcome the basic thrust of the Bill.  There is no question that it is progressive although there are a few issues I would like to revisit on Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm freisin nach mbeidh m&eacute; in ann an Bille seo a phl&eacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh mo chuid Gaeilge maith go leor chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh ach n&iacute;l s&eacute;.  Mar sin de, caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; a phl&eacute; as B&eacute;arla.  Unfortunately I do not feel my Irish is sufficiently proficient to discuss this Bill.  However, Des Bishop visited the Houses of the Oireachtas today and showed us all how one can improve one&rsquo;s level of Irish through total immersion.  As a non-Irish person, he demonstrated the level of fluency that can be achieved.  It is an example to us all and certainly one I hope to follow.  Perhaps in the future, I will be in a position to discuss Bills such as the one before us through Irish.</P>
        <P>We are all aware that Irish became an official language of the European Union on 1 January 2007.  It is likely that people will avail of the facility to seek through Irish documents that emanate from the various EU institutions.  It would be a sad state of affairs if the service available from the EU institutions were superior to that of our own legal system.  This Bill will ensure the better use of the Irish language by legal practitioners and also the adequate provision of legal services through Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill will abolish the compulsory Irish language requirement for solicitors and barristers in training.  It was required for barristers under the Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act 1929, under which no one could be admitted to practise at the Bar without satisfying the Chief Justice that he or she had competent knowledge of Irish, which was defined as the ability to receive instructions and follow proceedings through Irish.  This Bill, while removing the compulsory requirement, fulfils the Government&rsquo;s commitment to taking all reasonable steps to ensure an adequate number of barristers at law are able to practice law through Irish.  The Bill provides that King&rsquo;s Inns, which provides training for barristers, will hold a course on Irish legal terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language for all students undertaking the barrister-at-law degree course.  This will have the aim of enabling practitioners to identify the nature of the service being sought and, where appropriate, to facilitate a referral to a practitioner competent to provide a service through Irish.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that those studying for the barrister-at-law degree who have at the date of the repeal of the Legal Practitioners (Qualification) Act 1929 complied with the terms of section 3 of that Act shall be deemed to have attended the course on legal terminology.  It also provides that the Council of King&rsquo;s Inns will ensure an advanced course on the practice of law <Col N="732"/>through Irish will be included as an optional subject in the barrister-at-law course.  In effect, we are replacing the old system with a system that will recognise two tiers of qualifications in the Irish language.  We must recognise that many people now training as barristers and solicitors do not have a basic grounding in Irish and that this is putting an unacceptable onus on them to acquire apparent fluency in the language, which they do not have in reality, to be able to practice.</P>
        <P>Conradh na Gaeilge has drawn attention to the fact that there is no proposed examination on completion of the course in legal terminology, which will be mandatory for all trainee barristers.  It has made submissions to the effect that if there is no examination, it will command neither respect nor attention by comparison with those subjects that will require study and which it will be necessary to pass.  We need to consider this.  I do not know whether the Minister has a particular response but it is true that if there is no assessment of competency in respect of legal terminology in Irish, the subject may command no respect.  Students may then attempt to circumvent the requirement to attend the course.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on this?</P>
        <P>The position on solicitors is similar to that on barristers.  Prior to the enactment of the Solicitors Act 1954, students were required to take two examinations in Irish, one at the apprentice stage and the second at qualification stage, to become a solicitor.  The examinations consisted of written tests on prescribed texts that had nothing to do with the law and which were not conducted by the Law Society.  We want to end such practices whereby students are taking courses that have little bearing on the kind of competency in Irish they are encouraged to acquire, be it basic or more advanced.  The changes brought about by this Bill will require the Law Society to have regard to Government policy on bilingualism and take all reasonable steps to ensure an adequate number of solicitors are able to practise the law through the Irish language.  The Law Society is required to hold a course on Irish legal terminology and the understanding of legal texts in the Irish language and, where appropriate, to facilitate referrals to practitioners competent to provide a service through Irish.  The society is also required to ensure an advanced course on the practice of law through the Irish language will be included as an optional subject for those undertaking the professional practice course.  This is all very reasonable and sensible and is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Green Party supports the Bill.  However, Conradh na Gaeilge is concerned that some District Court and Circuit Court judges in Gaeltachta&iacute; are not competent in the Irish language while others who are competent in the Irish language are in districts and circuits outside the Gaeltachta&iacute;.</P>
        <P>The organisations have pointed out that Gaeltacht cases are conducted at locations in the Gaeltacht or through English in the Gaeltacht itself, except in south Connemara.  They believe this does not accord with Government policy on the fostering of Irish as the community language in the Gaeltacht.  They have proposed that the Gaeltacht should be considered as an administrative unit, administered through Irish by people interested in so doing.  This should apply to those judges who sit in courts on cases that relate to the Gaeltacht or which arise from Gaeltacht areas.  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s response in this regard.  Has he given consideration to this issue, which has been raised by the aforementioned organisations?  Does he consider that this Bill could attempt to rectify this issue?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their useful contributions.  Senator Regan raised a question, which also was raised subsequently, about those individuals who did not qualify.  I understand they were small in number.  I listened to the anecdote told by my colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, and while I do not know what happened to the two people who were before him in the queue, it was <Col N="733"/>always said that the examination was not that difficult to pass.  Never having sat the examination, I cannot give a judgment in this regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding those who have completed their legal training without meeting the statutory Irish language requirement and who have not been admitted to practice, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is aware of the issue.  He is in the process of consulting with the various interests on the best way to resolve this matter.  Any necessary amendments will be tabled in this House under the aegis of the Minister and this issue is under consideration.</P>
        <P>The second issue relates to that raised by Senator de B&uacute;rca and others and concerns the question of what was happening in the past, both with regard to the legal position and in practice.  From a legal perspective, the issue raised about people being competent to hear court cases in the Gaeltacht did not arise because according to the law, everyone had passed this great examination that meant they were capable of conducting cases through Irish.  In a fantastic world that appears to have been created, everyone had a marvellous competence to conduct their business in Irish because they had passed the examination.  Consequently, anyone who was appointed to serve in a Gaeltacht area should have been able to conduct the business by virtue of having passed the examination.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As everyone is aware, however, this legal theory was far from the reality.  The Government now is attempting to deal with the reality.  The idea of having a basic terminology requirement as well as a higher level examination is highly realistic.  I will provide two simple examples.  Members should consider the case of a solicitor in practice whose normal business is conducted through English.  That usually will be fine, as 99% or 100% of the solicitor&rsquo;s clients deal with him or her through English and have no interest in having cases heard through Irish.  Moreover, the solicitor does not feel competent to conduct cases through Irish.  One day however, a document in Irish arrives into the solicitor&rsquo;s e-mail, or however they receive information these days, with the words &ldquo;Urghaire Ch&uacute;irte&rdquo; air.  If one presumes the individual in question literally has no Irish, the urgency of the matter might not strike him or her immediately.  Allowing that one had a basic knowledge of basic terminology, one would immediately realise this was an injunction and one normally must deal with injunctions fairly quickly.  The terminology is a practical tool for people who are not practising in Irish but need to know at a glance, because the other side might send documents in Irish, whether a document is important or urgent and what should be done with it.</P>
        <P>Obviously, were the document complicated and were one to recognise it as an injunction, one would quickly get someone who could deal with the issue and explain its contents to allow one to move on to the next stage.  While it does not mean one is competent to deal with the entire issue, one would have enough Irish to know what is going on.  Members accept this concept in these Houses, where they use words such as &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ceann Comhairle&rdquo; and so on.  Everyone in Ireland understands this, although undoubtedly some visitors find proceedings to be something of a puzzle.  In a bilingual State, it is good that people can issue such documents in both languages.  However, it is important that people should avail of the opportunity to learn the basic terminology.</P>
        <P>One of the purposes of the Bill was to get away from an examination that had no function.  It was a compulsory examination that simply annoyed people and did not have a practical function in the world.  To those who do not bother to attend this course, I hope they never get caught out by not understanding simple terms like &ldquo;toghairm&rdquo;, &ldquo;urghaire&rdquo; and a few other key words.  Were they in a small practice without understanding what was happening, it could be very costly to them.  On the other hand, I refer to a scenario that will happen quite frequently in Dublin, because many more people now use Irish on a daily basis.  This is not simply a <Col N="734"/>Gaeltacht issue as the census proved that outside the educational system, more than 80,000 people choose to use Irish on a daily basis.  Therefore, when involved in court proceedings, they will wish to have the cases heard in Irish, as is their legal and constitutional right.</P>
        <P>At present, no list, register or other means exist to find out who, among those who passed this great examination that we know does not mean one can conduct business through Irish, really can do so.  As soon as the new system has been put in place, those who have done the ardch&uacute;rsa will be on such a register.  One will be able to contact any of them in the knowledge they have passed a real, genuine high-level test.  While I do not like talking in commercial terms, this pertains to the market and the customers or clients will be able to read the list and find the people they want.  Alternatively, a solicitor will be able to get a list of barristers and pick someone from it who is properly qualified do conduct the business in Irish.</P>
        <P>Recently, in respect of an issue pertaining to a special area of conservation, my Department needed an ecologist to advise a farmer.  There are registered lists of ecologists that are used, for example, by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  They have been recognised by the service as having the requisite qualifications and it is highly useful.  One provides it to the farmer who picks one, two or three names and proceeds from there.  In a similar way, for the first time ever, there will be a database of people who are competent to conduct business through Irish.  Not only will people be available to so do, their identities will be known.  This is absolutely vital.</P>
        <P>While Connemara is the strongest and biggest Gaeltacht in the country, I can think of a number of solicitors who have extensive practices solely on the basis that they are fluent in the language.  Many customers choose to go to them because of their competence and ability to conduct the business in court in Irish.  They have created a market niche out of it.  These are businesses and people are looking for work.  If one has a competitive advantage in the market, one can exploit it quite legitimately.  I foresee a development whereby many people will perceive that the ardch&uacute;rsa will provide them with a competitive advantage on the market because they will be in a market that others will be unable to access.  Heretofore, there was no official recognition of that reality and therefore there was no great spreagadh ann for people to improve their Irish and to try to aspire to be what one might call the A-list.</P>
        <P>It is vital that this test will be a real test of competency.  While the test will be voluntary, it must be of an extremely high standard.  The other point to be made is that many more people are pursuing law degrees and many more people are qualifying as barristers and solicitors than in the past.  Another good thing is that many more people who are daily Irish speakers now are getting such qualifications.  Therefore, I have no doubt about our ability to supply the market, given my personal knowledge of people who have qualified in law at all levels and in all branches of the law and who would be able to provide such services.</P>
        <P>It must be recognised that the Irish language has a constitutional status and there is a legal obligation on the State to ensure that people can exercise their rights in respect of the Irish language.  Moreover, further issues were raised in the Official Languages Act.  The Act established that it was customer-based in that a person going to court had a right to do business in Irish and the court could in no way penalise him or her for making that choice nor could it impose any cost burden on the person choosing to do business in Irish.  I believe that is only right if there are two official languages.  It would be ridiculous if a person who chose to take a court case in the first official language of the State suffered a penalty for doing so.  Equally, I do not believe a person who chooses to do so in English should suffer a penalty.  It should be equal to all.  The issue of language choice should be one for the customer, the defendant or the person before the court.  It is a citizen&rsquo;s choice issue.  That is very important.</P><Col N="735"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is very significant.  It brings a totally new and rational approach to the language in that it returns to the attempt made by the Official Languages Act to facilitate a citizen&rsquo;s choice within reason.  I have said previously with respect to the Official Languages Act, from which much of this Bill stems, that if such an Act had not been introduced, the Constitution makes the Irish language the first official language of the State, the national language, and the judgment given by one member of the Supreme Court was that a citizen is entitled to have every service and document through Irish.  By my reckoning we now translate a percentage of documents into Irish.  That is possible because the provision in the Constitution was used to delimit, by law, the right to documents and other services in Irish.  That is specifically provided for in the Constitution but if it is not activated, it does not happen.  For the first time ever, that provision was activated and severely limited people&rsquo;s rights to services in Irish.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, there is a basic level of documentation services, including court services, to which people are entitled.  An attempt was made to ensure not only were these in place in name and as a right, but that they were in place in practice.  A compromise or balance was involved.  One was to delimit and to be practical, while the other was to establish that the limited service promised would exist in reality when people came looking for it.  I see this Bill as complementing that philosophy.  There is no point in saying a person can go to court and do business in Irish if, when the person goes there, he or she finds, like Mother Hubbard, that the cupboard is bare in terms of aturnaethe and abhc&oacute;id&iacute; to do the business.</P>
        <P>There are two levels, the basic one of which is that a person can send a document to another person in Irish.  I would hope that most solicitors and barristers would avail of the opportunity to have the basic terminology so that they can defend their clients&rsquo; rights when they get the documentation in Irish.  The second level, which I believe will be addressed by the Bill, is that there will be a list of competent solicitors and barristers who have passed the &aacute;rd l&eacute;ibh&eacute;al, a real test which will qualify them to process cases in Irish.  That will exist for any citizen in this country who chooses, by citizen&rsquo;s right, to do his or her business in the courts through Irish.  I have no doubt this will create a market of its own.  Once the provisions are in place, people will know this and will be encouraged therefore to do their business through the Irish language if they are of a mind to do so.  They will know it is possible and feasible to access the personnel.</P>

	<P>I welcome the new Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I congratulate him on his elevation and wish him the best of luck in his new brief.  I am sure he will fulfil it with great passion, as did the previous Minister.  It is great to see Members of the House get elected to the Lower House and then climb the ladder.

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in light of</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the 10% fall in average house prices in 12 months;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />the continued fall in consumer and investor confidence to record lows;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />its failure to protect national competitiveness;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />its failure to reform the public service;</P>
        <P LI="1">and, in light of the deteriorating economic outlook, calls on the Government to:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />look at further stamp duty measures to stabilise the housing market;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />cut inflation to below the euro area average to help restore our national competitiveness and export growth;</P><Col N="737"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />adopt a leadership position in the vital national pay negotiations by foregoing the unwarranted ministerial pay increased approved by Government last year;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />cut the period before which F&Aacute;S meets with new unemployment welfare claimants to find alternative employment or training opportunities from six to three months, in order to prevent a drift into long term-unemployment; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />cut the number of Government quangos, and abandon legislative plans to create new quangos, in order to safeguard diminishing Exchequer resources for essential front-line services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I, too, congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment.  I hope he serves that office well.  He faces tough times ahead with regard to the economy, how the Government spends its money and what it does for the benefit of the people.  The economy has changed dramatically in the 12 months since the general election.  Everybody has spoken about the slow-down in the construction industry and its knock-on effects on the economy.  House prices are falling, the number of people working in the construction industry has reduced dramatically and the tax take from the construction industry is down significantly.  All this serves to show the weaknesses that existed in the economy due to Government policy prior to the boom.</P>
        <P>Basically, the Government has squandered resources.  It has failed to protect national competitiveness, control inflation and reform the public sector.  The Government has no control over vast sections of the economy, many of which are working very well at present.  It has no right to take credit for that because its role in that regard is incidental.  However, the Government exercises huge control on some sections of the economy.  In the last decade, spending in the health sector has increased by at least 75% and spending on education has increased by at least 50%.  There have been improvements in some sections of the health and education sectors but other parts of those sectors are in a terrible state and probably worse than they were ten years ago.</P>
        <P>It is clear how Government policy has affected those sectors.  If one is a private patient who wishes to access medical treatment, one will wait between three days and three months to access most consultants in the private sector.  The same consultants also work in the public sector but the wait to see a consultant in that sector is at least three months and can stretch to three years for some specialties, such as ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics.  There have been a number of scandals in recent years with regard to nursing home care and last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme highlighted how children are put at risk.  These scandals are happening in the health sector and are due to Government policy and its failure to reform that sector.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme may have taken a one-sided view but if one has dealt with a person who is being abused, be it physical, sexual or emotional abuse, within the home or by strangers, one will know that the abuse has a lifelong impact on the individual.  I am aware of its impact from my experience of working as a doctor.  To see the HSE and, in some respects, the Government take an almost blas&eacute; approach to it means they have learned nothing from the institutional abuse that dominated the newspaper headlines for many years.  It is obvious that the Government is aware of what is happening with regard to children at risk.  There is a serious need to take control of the situation and to put the required funding in place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the economy and how it affects the health sector, one must ask whether the Government knows where it is going with its policy on the health service.  We are told there should be a small number of centres of excellence throughout the country to provide cancer services, yet the Government is giving huge tax breaks and policy support to the establishment of small hospitals dotted across the country that will duplicate the services these centres of <Col N="738"/>excellence are intended to provide.  That is where one sees resources being wasted.  That might not have been too bad during the boom times, when the Government could afford itself the luxury of squandering our resources, but now it must make a decision.</P>
        <P>Does the Government believe in the centres of excellence because they will improve patient care outcomes or are they to be a cost containment measure?  Is the Government attempting to move health services into the private sector, regardless of where they are being provided?  Some of the private hospitals being built that will provide radiotherapy services are far smaller than the public hospitals the Government is attempting to close.  That can only lead to one conclusion, that Irish society is actively discriminating because of Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party policy.  Their policy basically states that if one cannot afford private health insurance, one will be subject to serious discrimination.</P>
        <P>The situation in the education sector is no different.  There has been huge outcry about autism services.  If one is seeking a public appointment for assessment of a child for autism, it will take up to 18 months to see the specialist.  The same specialist can work in the private sector and can see the child within four to eight weeks but at substantial cost to the parents.  However, once the assessment is carried out, the pupil can jump the queue for the provision of public services for autistic children.  We are establishing a system of complete discrimination.  That is the reason that probably every Member of the House has private health insurance.  Perhaps some Members see nothing wrong with that but when the State is providing a service to the public, especially when one considers that this country is a republic, that type of behaviour is absolutely wrong.</P>
        <P>A number of factors are at play in the way the Government is running the economy.  There is active discrimination, squandering of resources and disjointed thinking in providing services.  The examples from the health and education sectors show the Government has huge difficulty in understanding what it is doing.  However, that is becoming very clear now that tax revenue is dramatically reduced.  I have not even mentioned nursing home care, another pact promised by the Government, or the school refurbishment programmes which have now been cancelled.  Those social services provided by the Government are clearly falling apart now that tax revenue is reduced.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the motion commends the Government for its management of the economy, but that management is in serious disarray.  If current projections are correct, this year&rsquo;s tax take will be less than last year&rsquo;s, which means that the 2008 budget will be the first in 30 years where the tax take has dropped year-on-year.  If things continue this way over the next couple of years, the programme for Government will be short by approximately &euro;30 billion in terms of fulfilling its objectives.  That is a serious economic problem which would not prompt anyone to commend the Government for its management of the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment also &ldquo;welcomes the Government&rsquo;s firm commitment to position the economy for sustainable development over the years ahead&rdquo;.  That might be difficult, however.  It is amazing that in a decade of unprecedented growth the Government has failed to connect any of our major cities by a continuous motorway.  Neither the national nor non-national road infrastructure is up to scratch.  What has happened with broadband is a disgrace and should have been dealt with years ago.  Ministers talk about the research and development sector, including the concept of fourth level or high technology development, but they have failed to develop it in a way that people expected.</P>
        <P>Not only has the Government failed in what it was supposed to do over the last decade, it has also failed to provide for the next decade when things will not be as good.  The foundations that were laid during the past ten years, not just for social services but also for economic <Col N="739"/>services, are extremely poor for a country that was doing so well.  It did well not because of what the Government did, but because of what the people did.  Many of those aged under 40 who have worked hardest will be ill served by the policies pursued by the Government in recent years.</P>
        <P>The most amazing part of the Government&rsquo;s amendment &ldquo;welcomes its renewed commitment to reform the public service&rdquo;.  I would like to see a report from any Minister outlining what reforms have been undertaken in the past decade.  I have seen little or no reform of any substance in that period that would impress the public.  Our competitiveness has gone from first in the world to 17th, so there has certainly been no improvement in that regard.  My fear is that the Government will make a bigger mess of it now since it has acted so disastrously in the last few years.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to respond to our concerns by acknowledging the weaknesses.  They are not caused by a foreign power or extraneous events, such as the credit crunch but by the manner in which the Government has run the country.  We will return to this topic regularly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome my old sparring partner, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, back to the House.  We spent four years debating financial and economic issues prior to the last general election.  I am glad to see that he has been elevated to his new position.  As Senator Twomey pointed out, the Minister of State and his senior colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will have a serious job on their hands over the next few years or for however long they remain in those positions.  Nonetheless, it is nice to see one of our own returning to the House as a Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to the Opposition motion responds in the usual back-slapping manner.  It is clear, however, that the economic outlook for the country has changed since Deputy Mansergh left this Chamber for the other House.  Economic forecasts by various agencies all point to significantly reduced economic growth figures compared to recent years.  The ESRI forecast is somewhere under 2% for this year and many economists would say that we will be lucky to have economic growth of 1% or 1.5%.  That is a significant downturn from where we were during the past eight to ten years.  As a result of that situation, difficult decisions will have to be made by the Government.  I remain to be convinced, however, that those decisions will be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are facing into what will possibly be the weakest economic performance by the country since 1986.  We often hear references by Government Senators to the 1980s, but I never thought we would be returning to those kinds of figures in 2008.  There is no satisfactory explanation from the Government as to why we are now at this juncture.  Nonetheless, we are being offered the usual token excuses about factors outside this country, including the global economy.</P>
        <P>The recently appointed Taoiseach has been, at a time when he was Minister for Finance, the key to our economic downturn in recent years.  He has overseen a large part of that recent downturn.  We have seen significant disimprovements in most economic indicators, particularly in the last six to 12 months, including unemployment and inflation.  We have had a number of debates on the latter subjects during my time in the House.  Those and other indicators across the economy all point in a very poor direction.</P>
        <P>On television yesterday, the Minister of State and another newly appointed Minister of State referred to the ESRI&rsquo;s mid-term review which pointed to the fact that a recovery may be just around the corner.  The review did state that, furthermore, it was not mentioned that the Government would have to take a particular course of action.  However, I have seen no indication that the Government is prepared to do so.  We must see a reduction, in real terms, in the number of vanity projects that have been promoted by various Ministers in recent years.  The <Col N="740"/>Government must make a concerted effort to keep its costs down while delivering key infrastructural projects.  Senator Twomey mentioned a number of them.  The biggest scandal in my time in the House has been the appalling broadband infrastructure across the country.  It is vitally important for the economy to have next-generation broadband but large tracts of the country do not even have first-generation broadband.  If the new Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, can do something to rectify that situation he will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>There has been a significant deterioration in our overall competitiveness and in the balance of payments.  Over the past year, the live register figures have risen by over 41,000.  Some 1,500 people have been joining the dole queues every week since the beginning of this year, which is a big turnaround from where we were.  The biggest increase was in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s home town of Tullamore where more than twice as many men are currently on the dole than at the time of the last general election.  I hope that brings the message home to him in a stark manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The housing market has been mentioned and it played a crucial role in the development of the economy.  Numerous Opposition spokespersons, economists and other commentators have said the Government is placing too much emphasis on moneys derived from an artificially inflated housing market.  We had continuous rows in this Chamber about stamp duty reform and the Government did its famous U-turn in the run-up to the last general election.  If action had been taken sooner and more heed had been paid to advance warnings, we might not have seen the significant downturn which is currently under way in that sector.</P>
        <P>This year, it is expected that housing units will be down by 50,000 from over 90,000 a couple of years ago.  Many people, including myself, would say that over 90,000 units was an artificially high figure at the time.  However, the Government did nothing to try to ease the blow that such a significant reduction will have for people employed in the construction sector and, more crucially, for the revenues from construction upon which we are so dependent to keep our public services afloat.  Revenue from housing output in 2006 was &euro;23 billion.  That figure will fall to &euro;18 billion by this year, a 22% decrease, which significantly affects tax revenue.  As Senator Liam Twomey pointed out, there has been a significant reduction in all Exchequer revenue in the first quarter of this year, not just in VAT and indirect taxation but in income tax too.  This will have obvious detrimental effects if it is allowed to continue and something significant will have to be done.  Senator Liam Twomey referred to the public finances and the shortfall in tax receipts.  We have seen a reduction in tax receipts of 5.9% in April.</P>
        <P>I have not yet mentioned the issues regarding the cost of living and inflation.  There has been a small reduction in inflation this month and the annual rate is now 4.3%.  However, so many of the services that the Government is responsible for providing are those that most influence the inflation rate.  The factors influencing inflation for which the Government is not responsible are often those driving inflation down.</P>
        <P>The average European figure for health inflation is just more than 20%; in Ireland it is 60% at present which represents a difference of 40% between our rate and the rest of the European Union.  There are similar figures for housing, water, energy and education.  These are all sectors for which the Government has direct responsibility.  I urge the new Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to ensure the Government does something to address this.  It is easy for the Government to blame economic factors which are outside its control, but there are measures the Government can take which it has not heretofore.  There has not been a need for these measures heretofore because there has been sufficient money.  That abundance will not continue in the coming years and this is a time for a renewed stringency in economic policy.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving national competitiveness, as demonstrated by its maintenance of a low burden of taxation on labour and capital and its investment under the National Development Plan in the economy&rsquo;s physical infrastructure and skill levels;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />notes that house-building output had reached unsustainable levels towards the end of the recent catch-up period and recognises that the current slowdown in housing construction is a prelude to its reverting to more sustainable levels in medium term;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />and notes that the period before which F&Aacute;S meets with new employment welfare claimants to find new employment or training opportunities has already been cut from 6 to 3 months.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, to the House.  It is appropriate that we acknowledge Deputy Mansergh as a former Member of this House and a revered colleague.  I do not believe any other person in the history of the State is so qualified to hold ministerial office on the basis of such a long career in aspects of the public service.  It has been a great honour for me to sit beside him in this House in the past.  I am sure all Members of the House join me in congratulating him on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Fine Gael Members on using Private Members&rsquo; time to discuss the economy.  It is prudent to do so and we should have a rolling debate on the economy given these volatile times both nationally and internationally.  I welcome the opportunity to make some points.</P>
        <P>It is not too often that we have the benefit of a prop such as the headline of the front page of today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> in a debate on the economy.  The ESRI report predicts economic growth of 3.75%.  In case that was a fluke another publication, the<i> Irish Independent</i>, reported the same story.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;highlight various aspects of the report and the reasons for genuine grounds for optimism for the future.  There is no question we are in a changed economic situation.  In recent years, the country has thrived on the back of real sacrifice and tough decisions taken in the 1980s with the support of this Government and, in fairness, the Tallaght strategy too.  Credit for these advances can be taken on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P>Challenges have emerged largely because of a volatile international banking situation.  Banks are no longer lending to one another and it is difficult for a bank to secure 90-day finance from another bank at present, which is most unusual.  That lack of confidence had penetrated to other aspects of the economy.  This situation presents real dangers for all of us.  Mr. Jean-Claude <Col N="742"/>Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, has said that the level of uncertainty resulting from this global turmoil remains unusually high.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to speak to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to see if it is possible, along with other European finance ministers, to convince the European Central Bank to consider the wider economic picture, not just inflation.</P>
        <P>The euro is overvalued against the dollar and sterling currencies at present.  It is 100% more expensive for a tourist from the USA to come to Ireland than it was some years ago.  For someone going from Derry to Letterkenny it is 20% more expensive.  A friend of mine works in a cross-Border agency, is paid in sterling and his salary is worth 20% less than before.  These are real concerns.  While I recognise it is not the direct function of the Government, I would like to see the Minister for Finance raise at the Council of Ministers the issue of the strength of the euro.  Perhaps the European Central Bank could then begin to focus on improving the economy of Europe rather than focus only on inflation.  I recognise this is a difficult balance to strike but it should be addressed nevertheless.</P>
        <P>The Opposition has raised several issues but I have not heard many suggestions.  Much has been said on the issues with which the Opposition is dissatisfied, but let us have the tangible solutions it would provide.  The new Government sets out, with the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to reform the public service.  I welcome that the Taoiseach will establish a task force in the coming days for the implementation of the recommendations of the recent OECD report, which is welcome.  The same level of discipline displayed by the Government in 1987 will have to be adopted by Ministers now in managing current expenditure.  Modest borrowing should drive the delivery of the capital programme under the national development plan.  This is a prudent approach and fits the predictions of the ESRI report, which is a revered organisation with a proven track record of accurate predictions.  It predicted the Celtic tiger at a time when few could see it happening.  Professor John Fitzgerald and his colleagues have done exceptional work and have given grounds for confidence in the economy in the future.</P>
        <P>There is a sentence in the 1987 budget speech pointing out that optimism does matter.  The Opposition should embrace these three words.  We should think positively and look to our strengths while acknowledging that we have weaknesses and challenges.  We must focus on limiting our flaithi&uacute;lacht and expectation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the ongoing national social partnership talks, we must be realistic in our expectations for the future.  I am confident that the Government with renewed vigour and enthusiasm under the new Taoiseach and his new team can play an important role in ensuring we create a scenario to allow us to reap the benefits in the future by being prudent and disciplined at this time.  We must be cautious in our approach in staying within the budget on current expenditure and through modest borrowing maintaining momentum on the national development plan.</P>
        <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  We should frequently use Private Members&rsquo; time and other time to debate the economy because there is a very volatile international situation of which we must be cognisant.  I remember many days in recent years when Members of the Opposition were all to ready to say to us that the reason things were going so well was because of a favourable international environment.  Equally they must now be cognisant of the international environment when criticising any performance of Government or any changes in our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to a large number of debates similar to this one over the years in this House.  They take a predictable pattern.  The Government blames international global players and markets, and the Opposition blames the Government.  The Government claims the credit when things are going right and the Opposition claims it is because of inter<Col N="743"/>national markets.  This debate has not taken a greatly different course and I do not expect it to do so.  However, within those two views it is fair to say it is not just international markets that have gone wrong.  There are certain things the Government could and should have done, but did not do.</P>
        <P>I have been a long-time supporter of the Government&rsquo;s economic policy on the whole.  While I have not supported everything I have supported the broad thrust of the kind of market-led actions it has tended to take, which have encouraged the prosperity that has blown internationally and globally in our direction.  Particularly under Mr. McCreevy, the Government managed that extraordinarily well and derived benefit to the extent that it fuelled the Celtic tiger and made us considerably more prosperous than we would have been otherwise.  I also take the point I am sure will be made by the new Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, that there are many things about which we cannot do much.  We cannot do anything about the fact that the dollar is at an all-time low, which is bad news for us.  We cannot do anything about the fact that sterling is plunging almost daily and has fallen further today.  We can offer these as legitimate excuses that create real difficulties for the Government, particularly in the realm of exports.  It is only fair to say that is something it must accept and take on board.  It needs to ride it out and hope it turns.  We are at the mercy of international global markets, including bank markets to which Senator MacSharry referred.</P>
        <P>I am not a great believer of following where investment goes around the world, which is a moveable feast.  However, international markets are indicating one thing about Ireland at the moment.  They are giving it the thumbs-down in a forensic manner.  The people who must decide the countries in which to invest around the world have decided to pull their money out of Ireland.  The Irish Stock Market which in recent years has been the guardian of billions of dollars, euro, yen and other currencies, and the beneficiary of that money, has plunged this year because international investors have said there is something much more wrong here than there is anywhere else.</P>
        <P>I forgot to welcome the new Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, because I am so used to seeing him here that he looked like part of the furniture.  It is great to see him and I congratulate him.  I also congratulate him on what must be the first time he has not interrupted me in a speech as he did when we were in the same House for five years.  I thank him for that also.</P>
        <P>The Irish market is indicating we are doing worse than was anticipated and worse than anybody else.  That is coming from cold people with no emotional or personal involvement in what is happening here.  They are simply people who analyse whether it is a good place to put investors&rsquo; money and they have given the thumbs-down.  Why was Ireland one of the worst stock market performers in the world &mdash; if not the worst &mdash; last year and still a bad performer this year?  It is because those with a clinical interest are saying they do not like what is happening here that much now.  They may be exactly the same people who got excessively euphoric about what was happening here during the Celtic tiger years.  They got very excited about property and activity here, including stocks and shares.  They got themselves overexposed to property also.</P>
        <P>However, we must respect their opinions and ask them why they are taking this point of view.  Much of it relates to the property slump.  However, some of it is to do with the fact that they are not confident the Government at the moment has the political will to manage the economy in those areas in which it has some clout.  I take the points made by Senator MacSharry that there are some areas in which it does not have clout or interest.</P>
        <P>I date the decline in the Government&rsquo;s management of the economy at approximately three or four years ago.  I date it to an electoral timetable, which meant that the then new Minister for Finance &mdash; I take the point made by Senator John Paul Phelan that the new Taoiseach was <Col N="744"/>in the saddle as Minister for Finance when things have been going down &mdash; was reluctant to anticipate a downturn at any stage.  That was because he wanted to do the right thing &mdash; first to win the next general election and second to safeguard his position as the heir apparent of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Hard decisions are not made by ambitious politicians at a certain time.  That does not mean that he will not do them now.  Now that he is in the top job he may decide these things need to be done because they are necessary even if unpalatable.  The Government is now in a unique position to take unpopular measures that are necessary in a downturn, which will have been forgotten or overtaken by events by the time of the next general election.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what Senator MacSharry had to say.  He pointed to a very credible report indicating that growth would return to 3.75% by 2010, and upwards and onwards after that.  He is right that John Fitzgerald is an almost unique economist in that he anticipated the boom, which was extraordinary.  He also called the end of the property market, which is even more extraordinary.  He is paid by the Government, which also makes him unique.  In other words he was not singing the Government&rsquo;s song all the time.  We must respect what he says.  On the other hand it is an extraordinary hostage to fortune to tell us what will happen in 2025 &mdash; I do not believe anybody can do that.  It makes assumptions that the Government will take the right measures.</P>
        <P>It is vital for us to recognise that the Irish economy is nothing like what is described in either the motion or the amendment.  The engine of the Irish economy is in multinationals, financial services and other areas.  That is pointed out in the ESRI report.  It is not in the old-fashioned indigenous industries that we are so keen to portray as the Irish economy.  It is now a non-unionised, vibrant sector which is going to lead us forward, and that is the sector that must be encouraged.  I applaud the Government&rsquo;s recognition of the fact that we must attract those multinationals and that they are the most important part of the economy.  We have to give them those incentives because the old economy, which is dominated by a declining trade union membership, is dead.  The new economy is the one that must be encouraged.  We have to shed all those old shibboleths and recognise the fact that we are in a new situation and that those areas to which I referred are the ones we must encourage in the future.</P>

	<P>I accept the point made by Senator Ross that the issues we should be addressing are probably not dealt with in either the motion or the amendment to it.  The Government can take a great deal of pride in the sustained economic activity and the potential <Col N="745"/>for future growth that has been outlined in the ESRI report, but the economy needs to be debated in more realistic terms than we have heard thus far in this debate.</P>
        <P>The role of an Opposition is important in a democracy.  It must hold the Government to account.  The Opposition should highlight where policy failures have occurred and where resources have not been properly applied.  It should highlight also where errors of judgment have been made in terms of the application of policy, and the failure to follow through on promises of policy.  In the event of the Government of the day not performing its functions properly, the Opposition can present alternative policies.  I do not see any sign of those alternative policies in the motion, nor do I see a logical critique of the current state of the economy.  Several areas are mentioned in the motion, many of which are not connected at all and all of which are written in a way to portray the economy and, therefore, the Government&rsquo;s management of it in the most negative terms possible.  I consider that a dereliction of the role of Opposition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to hear any alternative policies devised by the Opposition, an explanation of why things are the way they are now and why they should be done any differently.  The truth is that in the general election, that analysis was not offered to voters.  The projections that were given by all political parties were too high.  When one comes down to the type of analysis we should have, no hard or fast policy choices have been offered by Opposition parties in terms of public sector reform and of how resources should be used for the provision of public services.  We have plenty of mechanisms for doing so in this House, as we discuss the budget and the Finance Bill.  If one believes in the concept of public service reform, which is becoming politically popular again and which we all would agree is necessary, we need to talk about the imbalance between administration and front-line services.  We need to talk also about the numbers employed in the public service and then we need to address the costs involved in the provision of those services.  I have heard none of that analysis from the Opposition and that is a dereliction of duty.</P>
        <P>Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world.  In the past 15 years we have benefited enormously from that fact.  As an Opposition spokesperson I once raised a note of concern that it was dangerous to be the most open economy in the world and events of the past two years have justified that.  An open economy is totally subject to global pressures.  The Irish economy began to develop in the mid-1990s when oil cost $10 a barrel and now the economy has to sustain levels of economic activity and growth when that same barrel of oil costs $126.  In terms of economic analysis, we have to stress the difference between then and now as regards how we are likely to progress.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s ESRI report is an optimistic document but it is grounded in reality.  It is couched as well in caveats.  It mentions the fact that because we are an open economy we are dependent on when recovery takes place within the United States economy.  There are many factors that will determine when that occurs.  I believe the change of presidential office holder in the US in November will engender a sense of confidence that will help things recover there, which will subsequently help our economy.</P>
        <P>We are also in thrall to decisions that need to be made by the European Central Bank in terms of interest rates.  At a time when there have been eight reductions in the past two months alone in the US from the Federal Reserve, there has been none by the European Central Bank, although there was a good case for two such reductions.  As and when such interest rate reductions are made in the European Central Bank, they too will have a bounce effect for the Irish economy.  We should not be totally bleak about where we stand.</P>
        <P>That said, a political analysis and a political criticism could be applied about the failure to anticipate how fast and how deep the economic adjustment could be.  I consider that valid.  As <Col N="746"/>an Opposition spokesperson I made those same political criticisms.  The change of Government and my party&rsquo;s participation has changed some of that emphasis.  Again, the ESRI report is predicated on changes in policy that affect environmental policy but that also have economic consequences.  That analysis will help us in the years to come.  Fine Gael seems to believe that the 10% fall in average house prices is a bad thing.  The reliance of 14% of gross domestic product on the construction industry was a bad thing, and there was a need for some economic adjustment.  However, that does not necessarily mean that those who have engaged in the construction sector need to transfer from it or lose their jobs entirely.  There are opportunities for the construction industry in retrofitting houses to introduce the energy standards that it did not introduce in the first instance.  That is an economic activity that has been forgone in the past that should be grabbed in the future and that will deliver economic as well as environmental benefits.</P>
        <P>Even though it is difficult for us to be certain of what will happen in the world economy and although we face environmental challenges, there is a series of opportunities for Ireland which will be helped along by the economic growth we have experienced.  We are not the economy we were before the mid-1990s.  We are now a more diverse economy with different types of economic activity.  We are less dependent on individual trading relationships with other countries and we trade with more countries.  On those grounds, we have reasons to be optimistic for the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on one element of the Fine Gael motion this evening on the OECD report.  I consider it an element of negative Opposition for the sake of it, which does not suit the political party concerned.  While the OECD report points out many systemic problems that exist in the provision of public services, it stresses that that is due to a culture in this country regarding how decisions are made and implemented.  I do not necessarily refer to the political culture but to the administrative culture we have allowed to develop that needs to be tackled in a more holistic way.  The fact that an honest in-depth report has pointed that out should be seen as an opportunity for us.  In many regards the OECD looks at the economy as one that is strongly performing and with innate strength that has the potential to become stronger in the future over and above many other members of the organisation.  When analysing the contents of that report that is the type of message we, as politicians and representatives of political parties, should take from it.  Unfortunately, the Opposition parties are choosing not to do that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I compliment and thank Fine Gael for putting forward this motion, one of the longest since I became a Member of this House.  It is urgently needed.  I agree with other speakers who said that from time to time we should return to the issue of the economy and debate it.  We are in changing times and such a debate is necessary.</P>
        <P>To get some of the good news out of the way, until recently we had a diverse and well performing economy.  As a country we have had a great history in terms of entrepreneurship.  We also have a well educated people with a great work ethic and a great deal of energy, and it is important we acknowledge that.  That is the good news but there is a good deal of bad news and, as requested by Senators MacSharry and Boyle, I will make some positive suggestions later on the way we can help the economy.</P>
        <P>On the bad news, it is my belief that this Government has been living in a type of cuckoo land in respect of the impact of the recent economic downturn on tens of thousands of people across the country.  The thousands who have lost their jobs, the businesses that are in trouble and the home buyers who are facing negative equity, particularly in urban centres, are aware of the current situation.  The housing market, as a driver, is obviously dead.  While it was <Col N="747"/>booming we were in reality eating our own flesh from an economic point of view as it did not contribute to exports and we were always looking internally.  I would argue that in many ways it innured us for a number of years from international competition and affected our competitiveness because we were looking inwardly to such a degree.  We did not believe we could compete in many sectors as the migration of the construction industry and the consequent production of mass sprawling housing estates led us into some form of cocoon.  Now that we are out of that cocoon and in the fresh air, so to speak, we are to a degree struggling to stand on our own feet.  The immune system of the Irish economy was attacked over a number of years and the failure of the current Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance to address that in the past five years was partly the reason for this change in the economy.</P>
        <P>Regarding the construction industry, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, recently proposed windfall charges on speculative land purchases.  To someone in my party that comes across as a fairly decent proposal but it was shot down by the current Taoiseach.  He also shot down the proposal on the section 110 loophole used by property developers to avoid tax.  They would be good initiatives if they were brought in but, unfortunately, the patronage given to Fianna F&aacute;il put paid to that.</P>
        <P>We also know that the Government is continually pushing down the expected growth rate, despite the admittedly positive report from the ERSI today &mdash; we must wait and see if it bears fruit &mdash; but the actual level is 2%.  Revenue receipts are down across the board, not just in one or two areas.  It includes corporation tax, VAT, capital gains tax, etc.  Inflation is high.  We have seen the largest monthly increase in the live register since 1967 while 1,600 people are losing their jobs every week.  The cost of living is increasing at 4.3%.  Retail sales are falling.  Consumer confidence is low.  Cuts in hospital budgets are being imposed this year which in real terms are the most severe since the mid-1980s.  There have been significant losses for investors in the stock exchange, as we heard about earlier.  Our competitiveness indicator has slipped 17 times.  The strength of the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other currencies is having a dramatic impact on the potential of our companies to export.  The number of house repossessions has increased.  As a nation we have the highest level of personal indebtedness in Europe.  There is also the issue of the high fuel prices.  That is not something that is in the control of the Government but it is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>What are the issues and what can we do about them?  A serious issue has arisen regarding the cost of living, which has increased a good deal in the past few years.  There is a massive problem with rising food prices.  I could not believe that the price of flour and milk has increased 40% and 30%, respectively, in the past year.  That is amazing and very concerning because it is the people on fixed and low incomes who will be most dramatically affected.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of fuel price increases including diesel and particularly home heating oil, which is affecting the same people referred to earlier.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, congratulated her own Government on extending the fuel allowance by one week in the year.  The reality is that if we take off the delivery costs, the VAT and the other tax, what those people are getting is minuscule.  That problem must be addressed.</P>
        <P>When a currency is strong we would expect a dip in inflation yet our inflation is above the eurozone average.  That is a serious concern.  At a time when our exporters are taking a hit from a weaker dollar and weaker sterling, our consumers are faced with higher prices.  It is obvious that sellers are not passing on the benefits of cheaper imports to the consumers.  We should all admit that this is a rip-off.  One can see the sterling and euro prices in the stores and it is obvious we are being ripped off.  It is a very simple problem in terms of how this is being dealt with by the Competition Authority and it must be addressed.  It is one of the suggestions <Col N="748"/>I will make when I sum up my contribution.  This is an area that the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency must address.</P>
<?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>A programme of training and reskilling in education for those coming out of the construction and manufacturing industries must be put in place.  We have all discussed that previously.  There must be a significant focus on opportunities for those people.  The cap on the number of participants in the vocational training opportunities scheme should be removed immediately.  That would be a positive move.  We should target those people for such training rather than wait for people to fall into the trap of long-term unemployment because we know what that can spiral into.</P>
        <P>Including school building programmes to fill the void in the construction industry would be a positive move.  The summer works scheme has ended and if this were put in place it would be a positive development and would tie into the area of building up the educational profile of those who are coming out of the workforce.</P>
        <P>Public sector reform is a phrase on everyone&rsquo;s lips.  We in the Labour Party would support proper reform that delivers better services but it has become somewhat of a buzz phrase.  What does it mean?  We do not believe that reform that takes the heart out of public service and tries to turn people, whose jobs are very much vocation led, into machines is the way to proceed.  We must examine the area in a more holistic manner and decide where we want to trim the fat.  The Taoiseach could have begun by doing something about the 21 Ministers of State.  He could have reduced the number to 17 or 15.  That would represent the beginning of public sector reform.  For example, why does Dublin have four tourism buildings and three tourism agencies?</P>
        <P>To sum up, the Government must give a direction to the National Consumer Agency to insist that all goods are priced in euro.  That would be a major step forward and simple to do.  We should put in place a major programme of education and reskilling.  We could introduce a &ldquo;begin to buy&rdquo; scheme to restore activity in the residential construction area, a recommendation my party has made for many years.</P>
        <P>An issue about which I am passionate, and it is something we will have to do if we want to diversify our economy into the high value areas, is shift the balance of advantage within our tax code from property based investments to high tech, high risk ventures.  There are not sufficient incentives available.  There is a divine trinity in regard to the whole technology area based on education, which we are fortunate enough to have, infrastructure, which unfortunately we do not, and broadband, about which I will not go on <i>ad nauseam</i> except to say everyone knows it is a disgrace.  Eastern European countries with economies much smaller than ours can address that area through very innovative ways but we cannot.  Also, we need the investment techniques to be provided by this Government, which it is not doing currently.</P>

	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the economic outlook because we need to take a sense of perspective about the economy.  I was prompted to speak to the motion as outlined by Fine Gael and the reference to the 10% fall in house prices and the possibility that 100,000 young families face negative equity.  In politics one has to be consistent.  Three years ago everyone was giving out about the steep rate of increase in the cost of housing, particularly in Dublin.  It was of concern since it was putting housing out of the reach of many ordinary families, and that was not desirable.  Equally, it is not desirable that prices are plummeting.  That is not the correct term, but the impression is being given that they are hurtling downwards at this point.  I do not believe that is a fair description of what is happening. </P>
        <P>A correction is being made to the housing market and this is to be welcomed.  Most people who buy a home regard it as an investment for an extensive period.  They do not do it on a speculative basis.  We hear on the airwaves that so many families are in negative equity.  It is <Col N="749"/>immaterial, since if it is one&rsquo;s home, one is not about to sell it, so what difference does it make?  It is only material if one intends to sell it &mdash; and most people buy their first home on the basis that they are staying in it for a while.  They do not intend to watch the property market and speculate on their home.  It is terrible to give the impression that people are living under this enormous threat.</P>
        <P>The notion of negative equity is a burden.  Naturally, if people cannot afford their mortgage payments, especially if they are increasing, as is happening at present, they are forced into a sale.  That is a different matter and is very regrettable.  However, the proportion of people in this position is much lower than the hundreds of thousands who continue to pay their mortgages.  I agree that they might well pay less today for a home than, say, 18 months ago.  The property pages of the newspapers show that prices are coming down.  However, that is the opposite to what the Government was being criticised for two or three years ago.</P>
        <P>Inconsistency is one aspect of an Opposition that galls me.  I like the discipline of consistency, which is necessary when one is part of a Government.  Ultimately, that is what politics is about.  I hope I shall be forgiven for saying that Fine Gael did not, perhaps, present itself as an alternative Government party, because it had never been consistent, particularly in the area of economics.  It therefore did not present itself as a credible alternative.  Having been a Member of the D&aacute;il as a Government backbencher I watched Members of the Opposition get great names for themselves and receive notice because they called for money to be spent in certain areas one week while pulling back the following week.  There was no consistency with the result that ultimately, Fine Gael did not present itself as a credible economic party.  That is the problem for that party.</P>

	<P>If the Senator does her sums on the number of seats her party got back, the public will not believe her either. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe public sector reform is happening fast enough, but I accept that Fianna F&aacute;il is the largest party in Government because it goes about bringing many people on board with it as it goes forward.  That has its benefits, but it also has its drawbacks because one is less inclined to fall out with a sector or an area.  I was glad to hear Deputy Brian Cowen in his speech last week on becoming Taoiseach speak specifically about the need for public sector reforms, and emphasise they will be delivered.  That is what is vital, since we have been held to ransom in so many instances as regards public services which appear to serve the primary interests of those who work in them.  I do not believe that is right and I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s  emphasis on the need for a shift towards service to the public.</P>
        <P>The economic outlook demands that we get changes in work practices.  We no longer have an embarrassment of riches which underpins the luxury of being able to throw money at a problem.  The Taoiseach also placed the focus on outcomes rather than inputs, and that is something to be welcomed as the new Government goes about its business.  What is important in public services is outcomes rather than inputs.  Of course inputs are important, but what are they delivering for the people, and what value for money are we getting?  These are questions that need to be asked.</P>
        <P>I also appreciate the mention of the  partnership talks in the motion.  It is important that we exercise a level of restraint.  It is advisable that the Ministers should lead by example in this <Col N="750"/>regard, but I do not expect the Taoiseach to make announcements as to what he is going to do.  As a keen negotiator, I do not suppose he will enter talks by laying his cards on the table beforehand.  He probably will negotiate quietly and gingerly, as is proper.  We need to be careful, but we should not set in train a scene of misery because that is not where we are at in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>As I begin my contribution, I want to respond to some of the points made by colleagues on the Government benches.  I will start with some of the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley.  The Senator is someone for whom I have a great amount of respect in terms of the contributions that she makes to this House.  However, I need to make clear to her and others that Fine Gael is not going to take lectures about economic credibility from a party that lost three quarters of its seats in the last election.  I suggest to the Senator that&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a good 25-year track record. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;across the period when the Progressive Democrats were in the last Administration, it lost sight of the manifesto which underpinned its existence.  The Progressive Democrats talked about the need for reform in Government, yet this was the party that set up the Health Service Executive.  It talked about the need for restraint in public spending.  In 1997 we were spending &euro;22 billion, while last year it was &euro;56 billion, and we are still here talking about the different social difficulties we have and all the problems the economy faces. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Perfection takes time. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>We undoubtedly have a duty in terms of what we have to say in Opposition.  However, to be told that we need to take lessons on credibility from another political party, given that Fine Gael implemented the Tallaght strategy and took a courageous stand on the benchmarking agreement, is more than I can take.  It is incumbent on me, therefore, to make clear that Fine Gael will not take lectures from the Progressive Democrats or anybody else about the credibility of our policy stances. </P>
        <P>I wish Senator Boyle was in the House.  He talked about our party having a dereliction of duty in terms of what we are saying about the economy.   The second part of the motion lays out different policies and measures that Fine Gael want implemented.  If it is the Opposition&rsquo;s duty to highlight what is wrong and should be done differently, then our motion is consistent in that.  It is consistent in pointing out the significant deterioration in the public finances and the private economic status of many people.  It is consistent in stating what Fine Gael would do differently to the Government.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley spoke of the Taoiseach outlining what he wants to do differently.  Perhaps there is a hidden disquiet on that side of the House in that all we have seen so far from the new Administration is continuity.  There is no indication as to how running the economy will be approached differently.</P>
        <P>Many Members referred to this morning&rsquo;s publication of the latest ESRI review of the economy, a fortunate time for the Government.  The report laid out a roadmap for how economic growth of 3.75% can be achieved.  What is noticeable is that for each of the factors that must be delivered, the Government over the past five years has not done so.  The report pointed to the need for fiscal policy to be tightened up when times are good.  Over the past several years, current spending has greatly increased at a time when the economy was booming.  When economic growth slowed down, the ability to manoeuvre was gone.  How is our economy, like the US economy, not technically in recession but front-line jobs are being cut?  The reason is that <Col N="751"/>current spending increased from &euro;25 billion to &euro;39 billion when the economy and the private sector was doing well while capital spending did not increase in the same way.</P>
        <P>The report called for an efficient delivery of the national development plan.  In the last review of Transport 21, a key element of the plan, not only did the Minister for Transport refuse to take responsibility on what he had not delivered, he refused to set targets for those plans behind deadline.</P>
        <P>The economy will move from one based predominantly on the manufacturing sector to the services sector.  The ESRI report outlined several factors requiring delivery to ensure this transition occurs.  Again, these recommendations are not being implemented.  The report called for the development of a national broadband infrastructure to facilitate the development of the services economy.  Broadband roll-out, as every Member will acknowledge, is not happening.  The report pointed out the need for advancing the education sector to stimulate a growing services economy.  However, class size is a serious issue and we do not have a world-class university.  While many of our universities are trying to up their game for a knowledge-based economy, we still do not have a university in the international top ten.</P>
        <P>While I was mildly dissatisfied with the timing of the publication of the ESRI report, I found it helpful in terms of forming a critique of Government policy.  The main factors that can help develop and grow the economy have been ignored consistently by the Government.  If Senator Boyle were present, he would speak of a dereliction of duty when the Opposition is pointing out facts.</P>
        <P>The ESRI report did not refer to China and India when dealing with the international economic context.  The template for our economic success is being copied by every other major country.  China has revised its growth forecast from 11% to 8% while India has reduced it from 10% to 8.5%.  The engine these economies have identified to deliver such growth is the service industry, the very area we want to develop.  The dereliction of duty is not recognising that the global economic environment has changed and identifying a solution to this.  I am disappointed not to hear this message from the new Taoiseach and his new Administration.</P>
        <P>The Administration has spoken for so long on the need for reform of the public service and how the economy operates.  The value of the dollar against the euro is falling and our economy is one of the most open in the world, yet inflation is increasing.  This is a sign of how the key fundamentals in the economy are being managed.  The greatest threat our economy will face in the coming years will be inflation.  It will affect our national wage agreements and international competitiveness.  The Government, with the opportunity of a new leader, should control those inflationary factors that it can and provide exemplary leadership to the other sectors in society that contribute to inflation.</P>
        <P>Our party will not accept this claim of a dereliction of duty.  The dereliction of duty is on the Government&rsquo;s part in that it does not recognise the new economic situation or propose new measures to tackle it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, on his reappointment.  I join with other Members who commended Deputy Mansergh, a former Member of this House, for his appointment as a Minister of State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the amendment to the motion.  The nature of the Fine Gael motion is negative and was moved in a negative tone.  I accept that Senator Donohoe took a somewhat different approach.  I always listen to his contributions because they are well thought out and well argued.  I would even concur with some of the points he made.  He pinpointed some issues which must be attended to.</P><Col N="752"/>
        <P>By any standards, Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic progress has been phenomenal.  It is no coincidence that China and many other countries in the former eastern bloc, have applied the same economic template which made Ireland so successful.  As one who grew up in the bad old days in the 1950s and 1960s, I recall the only travelling Irish people did was to get the boat to England to get work.  I was at the airport recently at 5.30 a.m.  There were queues which would take an hour to clear at the check-in desks, which is a remarkable transformation and indicative of the progress we have made.</P>
        <P>Some were inclined to dismiss international forces as irrelevant but they definitely play a part.  We are probably more exposed to these forces than other EU economies.  We have a very open economic template here, which has been to our betterment, but it means that the winds of change have an effect.  One of those international influences, the sub-prime crisis in the United States, had nothing to do with us but has rippled throughout the global banking system and has led to a huge increase in the cost of funds.  Worse still, it has led to a situation where the liquidity of banks and therefore the funding available for investors has been seriously affected.  We cannot ignore this.  It is extraordinary that interest rates have increased by quite a bit over the past 12 months whereas the ECB rate has been kept level at 4%.  Banking is certainly an issue.</P>
        <P>The currency position is another factor, in particular the strength of the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the dollar, and to some extent sterling, which has added to the challenges we face.  At a meeting two or three years ago I remember raising a question with an economist from one of the banking institutions who was addressing us as to how we would cope if the cost of oil went to $100 a barrel.  We were told he did not expect that to happen but that should it happen it would have many adverse economic effects.  Many people more expert than I in that area are now saying we could be looking at $200 a barrel in a couple of years, which will certainly have an impact.</P>
        <P>However, there are domestic matters which are under our control.  The manner in which we accept the challenge in that regard will determine how we meet the projections and expectations as set out in the ESRI report and other reports.  I would point to three issues.  One is inflation, which has been raised by other speakers.  Undoubtedly, we must do what we can to bring inflation back under control because it is at too high a level &mdash; we are double the EU rate, which is not sustainable.  For the Administration, it is very important that all fiscal policies are feeding into controlling and reducing that threat to our level of competitiveness.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Alan Kelly had to say and I concur fully with him.  The price of food in many of our stores&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>With some exceptions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps with some exceptions, although I have not found them.  The price clearly indicates that the weakness of sterling is not being passed on to the consumer in any way.  This should be having a positive effect but it is not.  I recently intended to cross to Britain, travelling from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Holyhead but returning by a different route from Holyhead to Dublin with a different carrier.  When I checked, I found the price for the return journey on the Irish Ferries website was approximately &euro;205 when converted from sterling but when I tried to book it through the Irish site the price was &euro;265, which is a significant difference.  I decided I would book through sterling only to find I was blocked and could not get through.  Eventually, I had to go through one of the agencies and I was able to accept the sterling rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Kelly's views in this regard.  It appears there is a strong case for the Competition Authority to be much more proactive and energised about ensuring we get the <Col N="753"/>benefits of competition and that we are not disadvantaged by people taking currency fluctuation profits at the cost of the consumer.  This probably merits a debate with regard to the effectiveness of the Competition Authority.  I hope the relevant Oireachtas committee is talking to the Competition Authority about these matters because I would have serious concerns about the extent to which the authority is safeguarding us.</P>
        <P>We have been speaking for some time about general competitiveness, which is an important issue for the economy.  The current wage round will be imperative in building a platform so that we continue the growth rates we want in the interest of all.  I have said before in the House that I believe a 12 to 18-month pay pause in the public sector would be highly desirable and, hopefully, the private sector would follow in a similar fashion.</P>
        <P>Public finances are a major issue.  There will be an increasing reduction in receipts and, therefore, we must trim expenditure.  We set up the National Treasury Management Agency to control the Government debt and get the best value we could, and it has been very effective and successful.  There is no reason we would not have similar bodies, including one to look after waste in the public service, which I would conservatively estimate is in the order of &euro;4 billion.  I have spoken to some people in the public service who say I am seriously underestimating it and that it is much in excess of that figure.  There is also a need to promote productivity and rationalisation within the public service.  This would mean those who are working would be rewarded, those who are performing moderately would be motivated to perform better and those who cannot be got to perform would be removed from the system altogether.  If we tackled the issue on that basis, we will build the economic success we want to see.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Pearse Doherty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  We are glad to have him in the House on the first occasion since he took up his new post.</P>
        <P>I have six points to make.  When I opened one of my first shops back in the 1960s, I was on the shop floor and I saw my professor, the dean of the faculty of commerce in UCD, doing his shopping.  I introduced myself to him and he asked me what I was doing there.  I told him it was my shop and that I had gone into business.  He said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful that one of my students has gone into business?&rdquo;  How the world has changed.  In those days, there was no belief that people would leave school or university and set up in business.  I ask that the Government would make sure we encourage entrepreneurship.  A couple of years ago I met the Secretary of Commerce in the United States.  Her words to me were that her job is not to create jobs but to create the environment so that others can create jobs.  My first point is that we would make sure we encourage enterprise.</P>
        <P>On my second point, I have travelled much in the past couple of years and have visited Estonia, Panama, Brazil and Argentina.  In each case, although I was there to speak on the grocery business, the first thing I was asked was to explain about the Irish economy and how well it is doing.  We are in a very competitive market.  Others are trying to take our business away from us so let us do nothing that upsets our competitiveness.</P>
        <P>My third point concerns the success of foreign companies.  I could not get over the figures when I examined them &mdash; 980 foreign companies in Ireland, 140,000 jobs and a corporate investment from the United States of &euro;83 billion, which is more than the &euro;73 billion which India, China, Brazil and Russia combined have made.  Let us do nothing to upset the investment opportunities for outsiders coming to invest in Ireland.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>My fourth point concerns Northern Ireland.  We now have an island community and a new organisation, InterTradeIreland, has been established.  Our ability to break into international markets as a combined country, North and South, is huge.  There is a surplus of graduates in the North of Ireland and we can make use of the opportunities there.  The Small Firms Association is already setting up networking opportunities.  Let us encourage that to take place.</P>
        <P>My fifth point concerns education.  Article 179 of the treaty refers to the research and development opportunities that we will enjoy when it is ratified, which I assume will happen.</P>
        <P>Sixth, optimism is required and we must not talk ourselves into pessimism.  I was pleased to see the ESRI&rsquo;s report today and to note its optimism.  There is a danger of complacency and it should be avoided.</P>
        <P>Let us ensure that we encourage entrepreneurship and do nothing to damage it.  Let us also ensure we recognise we have a competitive marketplace and do nothing to damage that.  Let us encourage inward investment and join Northern Ireland in networking and acting as a unit to penetrate international markets.  Above all, we should ensure that we continue to invest in education, particularly in research and development and science and technology.  Let us not be complacent and let us be optimistic and realistic.  The Minister is the right person in the job.  We look forward to what he will say to us and also to what he will do for us in the next few years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an tSeanad&oacute;ir Quinn as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire fosta.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt but that the impact of the economic slowdown and the rising cost of living are beginning to be felt by people across the State.  Many of those who borrowed heavily when house prices were at their highest face an uncertain future due to a decline in house values and high mortgage interest rates.  Low-paid workers are struggling in the face of rising food and fuel prices while, at the same time, there is downward pressure on their wages.</P>
        <P>How should the Government have prepared for the challenges we are now facing?  It should have planned ahead based on a realistic assessment of economic vulnerability.  It should then have taken pre-emptive action to ensure the impact of any slowdown, domestic or international, would be minimised.  The vulnerabilities in the Irish economy were quite clear for many years and were highlighted by my party and economic commentators.  These included over-reliance on the construction sector and an over-inflated property sector; the failure to deliver key transport and telecommunications infrastructure, including broadband, in a timely matter; the fact that growth in recent years was driven by domestic consumption rather than exports; and the fact that the level of worker participation in education, training and upskilling in the State was well below that required, and the norms in other European states.</P>
        <P>All these factors should have informed a Government strategy and put the economy on a sustainable footing.  There was also a drip of job losses in manufacturing in regional towns that was not met with any action to create alternative employment.  I know this only too well coming from the north west, Donegal in particular.  The Government has failed to take on board the slowdown in economic growth projected by economic analysts and the reliance of the Exchequer on revenue from construction and property warned about by the officials in the Department of Finance.  It failed to take any action to put the economy on a sustainable footing.</P>
        <P>The Government must now tackle issues such as the growing number of unemployed, the rising cost of living, the dangers of negative equity, rising mortgage interest rates and the fact that tax revenue is well below projections.  Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for a concerted effort to retrain and upskill low-skilled and vulnerable workers.  We call for a focus on creating jobs in regional <Col N="755"/>towns hit badly by job losses, including through increased support for indigenous enterprise.  We want the Government to focus on regaining competitiveness.  Where Government policies, including the raft of stealth taxes and charges, contribute to increasing the cost of living, they need to be re-examined.  Proposed tax cuts, which are clearly unviable and would undermine the State&rsquo;s ability to fund public services, should be dropped.  There needs to be a focus on increasing exports, particularly to other EU states, such that exporters will not face the uncertainties associated with exchange rates that they face when exporting to Britain and the USA.</P>
        <P>There is merit in the proposal to cut the period, from six months to three, before which F&Aacute;S meets with new unemployment welfare claimants to find alternative employment or training opportunities.  However, I do not agree with the Fine Gael proposers of the motion that further changes to stamp duty represent an appropriate response to the issues facing the housing market.  We would be better concentrating on coming up with measures to assist those on low and middle incomes faced with negative equity and rising mortgage interests rates.  While I agree that ministerial pay rises are unwarranted and should be abandoned, we must ensure they are not used as the basis for demanding that those on low incomes under severe pressure from increases in the cost of living should be forced to accept pay freezes.</P>
        <P>The Government, including the Minister, faces great challenges and I hope it can meet them face-on.  There needs to be a special case made for the north west.  I have called many times in the Seanad for it to be designated as an area of economic need.  I ask that the new Minister for Finance take my points on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.  I congratulate him on his new portfolio and wish him well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I am very glad to have the opportunity, on my first visit to Seanad &Eacute;ireann as Minister for Finance, to speak in support of the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion on the prospects for the Irish economy.  We have seen the publication today of a very favourable medium-term assessment of the economy by the ESRI.  However, before commenting on both our short-term and medium-term prospects, we must put our current economic environment in context.</P>
        <P>Over the past decade or so, Ireland has experienced unparalleled levels of economic success and prosperity.  Our economic environment has been transformed through the implementation of appropriate Government policies, underpinned by stakeholder participation, as shown through the social partnership framework.  Under several key measures our economic achievements have been remarkable.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the rate of economic growth in Ireland has averaged 7.25% per annum.  This buoyant rate of expansion has propelled average per capita income in Ireland not just up to convergence levels but has surpassed those enjoyed in most other developed economies.  We have changed from a country that had to send its people abroad for work to a country that now welcomes a substantial inflow of persons from other European Union member states and further afield.  Our labour force now stands at over 2 million.  The total number at work has risen by some 700,000 and the unemployment level decreased from some 10% in 1997 to approximately 4.5% in 2007.  More recently, however, unemployment has increased, thus reflecting the slowdown.  The pace of economic growth this year is far slower than it was in preceding years.</P>
        <P>It is true to say the economic environment has become more challenging in recent months and the outlook is less benign and more uncertain.  The risks that we identified in the last budget have materialised.  They include risks such as recent developments in the international financial markets, further appreciation of the euro against the dollar and sterling, lower inter<Col N="756"/>national growth and, at domestic level, a sharper slowdown in the housing market.  We must accept that the short-term prospects are more challenging and ensure that we respond appropriately.</P>
        <P>Global economic developments play a key role in shaping Ireland&rsquo;s economic horizon.  As a small open economy, Ireland is highly integrated into the global economy.  The difficulties in the United States stem mainly from the housing market and especially from the sub-prime mortgage segment of that market.  These developments have impaired the functioning of international credit markets and it is fair to say these problems have persisted longer than had been initially expected.</P>
        <P>Domestically, the residential house building sector is undergoing a sharp slowdown following a prolonged period of catch-up.  Uncertainty remains regarding the projected level of housing output for this year and how long it will be before the medium-term sustainable level of activity is achieved.  However, we know the underlying demand for housing remains strong and it is driven by a relatively young population and continued inward migration.  While we may experience a year or two of less than 50,000 completions, it is reasonable to expect over the medium term that the annual completion rate will return to a sustainable level that will remain high by international standards, reflecting the strong underlying demand for housing in Ireland.  This is a point that today&rsquo;s ESRI review has factored into its medium-term assessment.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the change in the housing market, which is being overlooked by commentators, is that the moderation in house price levels, when combined with measures on stamp duty and mortgage interest relief, taken by the Government at budget time, means that better value is being obtained by those who wish to buy their own home, especially first-time buyers.</P>
        <P>The key message of the ESRI&rsquo;s medium-term review is that the Irish economy is flexible and resilient.  Given our sound economic management and fundamental fiscal factors such as our low ratio of debt to GDP, and the substantial surpluses that we have had for the past decade, our economy has the ability to absorb shocks in an efficient manner.</P>
        <P>In view of the Government&rsquo;s sound economic management and fundamental fiscal factors, such as the low debt to GDP ratio and the substantial surpluses Ireland has enjoyed for the past decade, the economy has the ability to absorb shocks in an efficient manner.  By this I mean there will be limited economic fall-out and a return to trend growth within a reasonable period.  Based on the ESRI&rsquo;s analysis, real growth in GDP of 3.75% per annum is sustainable over the medium term.  This rate of growth is far higher than elsewhere in the euro area.  In contrast to the prevailing mood of pessimism, the ESRI shares my view in that we should see a return to trend growth from 2010 onwards.  As I noted previously, economic conditions in 2008 and 2009 will remain weak but sensible policies will be pursued.  The Government remains determined to press ahead with its infrastructural development programme, thereby enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s productive capacity.  Discipline on current expenditures under all headings will be critical in the next few years, given the changed resources available.</P>
        <P>As a nation we will be obliged to manage our expectations more prudently and to focus clearly on what are our spending priorities.  While this is a challenge for everyone, it must be seen in the context of the highly significant increase in the amount of Government spending that has been provided for in recent budgets.  While there is no denying that our fiscal position has changed from that envisaged at budget time, it is important to point out that the current situation is manageable given the strong position of the public finances.  Despite the underlying strength of the public finances, my Government colleagues and I are determined there will be no unnecessary loosening of fiscal policy.  Current spending must be controlled to keep it in line with resources.  I will consider these issues closely in the coming months as I prepare for <Col N="757"/>the budget for 2009.  It is crucial for Departments to adhere to the highly significant levels of current day-to-day expenditure provided for their activities this year.</P>
        <P>Successful achievement of this objective when resources are constrained must be based on sound priorities.  The priorities of the Government are clear and straightforward.  They are to protect the weaker in society through maintaining a high level of social spending; to deliver better and more effective public services; to seek value for money at all levels of public spending; and to continue the programme of substantial investment in public infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been hugely attractive to multinational investment given its skills base, pro-enterprise regulatory environment and low taxes on capital and labour.  The Government is committed to fostering the development of dynamic and innovative Irish companies.  A proactive initiative in this regard was the establishment of a seed and venture capital scheme by Enterprise Ireland in 2006.  This &euro;175 million scheme targets young, high-technology start-up firms.  These companies have high growth potential and operate in sectors such as software, communications and the life sciences.  This development complements the re-positioning of the economy in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services.</P>
        <P>Everyone is aware of the impact that unemployment has on the individuals affected, their families and wider communities.  Despite the success of the economy in sustaining several hundred thousand additional jobs in the past decade, there have been a number of recent high-profile instances of companies making workers redundant.  The various State agencies and appropriate bodies are providing opportunities to allow affected workers access training programmes to update their skills in order that they can then access new employment opportunities.  I might remind Senators that as the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, noted in the D&aacute;il last night, as part of its ongoing implementation of the Irish national employment action plan, a strategy introduced in 1998, F&Aacute;S reduced the employment action plan referral threshold from six months to three months for first referrals as long ago as December 2006.  Last year, under this proactive labour market initiative, more than 51,000 people were referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to F&Aacute;S, of whom approximately 32,000, or 63%, had left the live register by the end of the year.  F&Aacute;S also is placing particular emphasis on the training of low-skilled workers in vulnerable industries to ensure that in the event of becoming unemployed, they will have the skills necessary to make the transition to other employment.</P>
        <P>The Government has given priority to full implementation of the national development plan and has provided for an increase in capital spending of approximately 12% this year. In the short term, this will help to absorb some of the capacity emerging from the new house building sector.  The medium and longer-term impact of this spending will be more important.  Spending on human and physical capital under the national development plan will help boost the productive capacity of the economy.  It will remove critical infrastructural bottlenecks and will facilitate the re-positioning of the economy in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services.  This is how Ireland will become an even more knowledge-based economy, will lay the foundations for future improvements in living standards and will sustain the economy&rsquo;s competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the public service modernisation agenda has been and continues to be driven by the various partnership agreements across the public service.  The current partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives, as well as improvements in productivity across the public service.  It provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on the achievements of previous agreements.</P><Col N="758"/>
        <P>The OECD review of the Irish public service was published recently and it acknowledged the central role played by the public service in contributing to an economic success story that many OECD countries would like to emulate.  It states that while service provision is good, scope remains for improvement.  The key will be to get the public service to become more efficient.  Growth in new public sector bodies must be reined in and what is already there must be rationalised.  The Taoiseach will announce shortly the appointment of a task force on public service reform to report to the Government with a comprehensive programme for action.</P>
        <P>It has been known for some time that in riding out a storm, economic flexibility is crucial.  The Government knows this from having overcome difficulties in the past and the ESRI review, published today, restates this point.  The limited economic fall-out from the global information technology shock at the beginning of this decade is one of the best examples of the economy&rsquo;s resilience.  In other words, while the short-term prospects are unfavourable, we face them from a position of considerable strength and the economy is sufficiently resilient to ensure the medium-term prospects remain relatively benign.  This, of course, is predicated on implementing the correct policies, which the Government is determined to do.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s assured stewardship, the fundamentals of the Irish economy will remain strong.  Because of this, Ireland is well placed to absorb the housing adjustments and external shocks in order that its medium-term prospects will continue to be favourable.  The public finances are sound, with one of the lowest levels of debt in the euro area.  Irish markets are flexible, which allows us to respond efficiently to adverse developments.  Ireland has a dynamic and well-educated labour force and a pro-business outward-looking society.  The tax burden on both labour and capital is low.  Not many countries anywhere in the world face the present global economic difficulties with such advantages.</P>
        <P>In addition to corrective action, if Ireland is to keep its medium-term prospects bright, we must reassert our rightful position at the heart of Europe through a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on the Lisbon treaty in June.  I listened to Senator Doherty&rsquo;s contribution a few moments ago, which extolled the merits of export-led growth.  I am astonished that a party is campaigning against the Lisbon reform treaty when its principal spokesperson in Seanad &Eacute;ireann extols the merits of export-led growth.  Fundamental to export-led growth is Ireland&rsquo;s continued participation in the European Union on the terms we have negotiated in the Lisbon treaty.  These terms were negotiated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, in his former capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, ably assisted by many of the best in the Irish public service.  This is not a treaty which is being imposed upon us from Europe.  It is a treaty to which some of the best and brightest of a particular generation in Ireland applied their minds.  In economic terms, it is highly important for Ireland to reassert its position at the heart of Europe through a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on this treaty in June.</P>
        <P>Participation at the centre of a large political and economic grouping, the European Union, gives Ireland real negotiating power in international relations, particularly in the area of trade and increasingly in the field of diplomacy.  Only yesterday evening, I attended the meeting of the European finance ministers which takes place on a confidential basis, to meet the officials of the European Central Bank.  Through such a medium, Ireland, in common with the other smaller countries, as well as the greater countries that are in the European Union, has the access to at least make its views heard regarding the monetary policy that binds us all.  Previous generations of Irish statesmen, leaders and representatives did not have such access.  Ireland&rsquo;s membership has provided free access for Irish indigenous industry and international firms to an internal market, which now numbers 500 million consumers.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the house and congratulate him on his recent appointment.  I am glad that Fine Gael tabled this motion because with a new Taoiseach and Cabinet, it is essential to have a full and frank debate as early as possible on the economy.  There are many reasons why our economy boomed in the past ten years.  Many of these are due to external factors.  They have not been in the control of the Government but have been due to factors from outside, such as the World Trade Organisation and economic growth in the United States.  It is true that some reasons for our growth have been due to internal factors, for instance the corporation tax rates, but these were introduced by my colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, not by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, nor by Deputy Brian Cowen when he was Minister for Finance.  </P>
        <P>Much of the growth we have seen is due, not alone to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s stewardship of the economy but to ourselves and others.  Now there is a need for real stewardship because along with the slowdown in economic growth comes a reduction in employment.  Only last month the figures for unemployment showed a rise of 5.5% on the previous year.  That cold figure hides a lot of hardship.  In Meath, for instance, the live register figures have gone up by 1,430 in the year to April 2008.  Kells has seen an increase of 236 people on its register.  That means 236 families are now suffering and having to re-adjust their lifestyles to cater for their new economic situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are losing jobs fast and in two ways.  There is an almost constant loss of international companies that leave Ireland for cheaper workforces elsewhere.  The construction industry, which up to recently was extremely busy, is in rapid decline.  We can disagree about the reasons for this and disagree also about the quality of the handling of the economy to date.  However, I believe we all agree that now is the time for effective stewardship.  The economy can be steered in the right direction by investing heavily in technology, infrastructure, education and tourism.  Ireland must be an attractive and viable destination for international businesses.  We fall short, however, in areas such as access to quality broadband.  Often this is a deal-maker when it comes to businesses from abroad moving here.  Last year the Communications Regulator wrote a report outlining the supply of broadband to many rural areas.  It stated that almost all the businesses in these areas still used dial-up, not because they wished to, but because no broadband was available.</P>
        <P>Senator Dan Boyle &mdash; who was referred to earlier as Dan Brown &mdash; has said that nothing else can be done.  I would prefer to believe Dan Brown on this issue rather than Dan Boyle.  Clearly, things can be done.  We must invest in quality broadband.  The Government has been very slow to roll out broadband across the country and as it has struggled the technology has moved on.  The cutting edge of broadband is found in places such as Japan where up to 100 megabytes per second can be achieved.  In most European countries the speeds are between ten and 15 megabytes per second.  In Ireland we are lucky to get three or four per second.  One would wonder how a nation that is serious about trying to be a First World country can survive on Third World technology when it comes to broadband.  We must set our minds to discover how to make Ireland an attractive 21st-century country for 21st-century jobs.  We need investment in broadband, in roads and rail services, and in education.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle said that very little else could be done.  I would like to remind him of these words:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Government&rsquo;s failure to commit modest funding required for the implementation of the McIvor report shows that it is still failing to invest in the domestic skills base.  Irish industry and the Irish educational sector, will, I believe, join me in saying that this represents a serious misjudgment.</P><Col N="760"/>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In effect this person is saying that we will lose out when it comes to jobs and the economy because of not implementing the McIvor report on third level education and by not investing in education.  The quotation was taken from Senator Dan Boyle&rsquo;s website in December 2005.  Things can be done.  Senator Boyle is in Government now and can get the McIvor report implemented.  However, we have not heard him suggest this, so I remind him of his statement of 2005.</P>
        <P>We advocate investment in broadband, further investment in education and in public sector projects.  These will help to ensure that we continue to see economic growth.  We all worry that the boom years have perhaps been wasted to some degree.  There has been no improvement in health and underinvestment in our rapidly growing schools.  Few people now can afford houses.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley does not seem to have a problem about negative equity.  The truth is that many people bought houses at the top of the market at low mortgage rates in the hope that they could re-mortgage in a couple of years.  They cannot re-mortgage now for lower rates because their loan devalue is not what they had hoped to achieve.  Given the deficit in their loans in comparison to the value of the house they are not going to get cheaper mortgages.  This costs people money.  The issue is not about moving house, rather it is about people who might wish to re-mortage suffering because of negative equity.  It is unfair and ill-informed to suggest otherwise.</P>
        <P>We believe that the Government lazed its way through the economic boom and now it is time for real stewardship.  I saw the ESRI report this morning.  Perhaps that organisation is correct in predicting that we will be lucky and will see growth rates of 3.5% a year but we will not get it by default.  We must work for it.  If the Government is serious about achieving those rates it must invest, in education, in broadband and in industries such as tourism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House tonight.  His rapid rise puts him at a great risk of altitude sickness but I wish him very well in the next couple of years.</P>
        <P>While the Minister speaks much of what the Government has done in the past decade the most productive period in terms of real growth in our economy over the past 15 years was that during which John Bruton was Taoiseach and Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister for Finance.  We must emphasise that point on this side of the House because the Government is trying to take all the credit for any improvements in the economy during that time.  The best part of the growth occurred before Charlie McCreevy or Deputy Bertie Ahern became Minister for Finance or Taoiseach, respectively.</P>
        <P>A few problems lie on the horizon but some of these have been of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen&rsquo;s making.  There has been a &euro;10 billion deterioration in the Exchequer balance over the past two years.  That may well have been to buy the election but at the same time it may indicate poor management of the public finances.  Reform of the public service will be a very important issue over the next few years because funding will be restricted.  It is clear that the Minister&rsquo;s speech was made for his Cabinet colleagues as much as for the Members of the House.  If there is not going to be a dramatic increase in the level of funding over the next couple of years we must be more efficient in what we spend now.</P>
        <P>The idea of reforming the public sector started as far back as 1994 with the strategic management initiatives.  We must progress that a little faster than has been the case to date.  I would wish the Minister to comment on this.  Although there is much talk about this issue and a report was published recently we do not know what kind of initiatives the Government proposes and what they expect to save in the long-term once the modernisation and reforms of the public sector and the Civil Service have been carried out.  What sort of timeframe is expected for this?</P><Col N="761"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Progressive Democrats and, in its turn, the Green Party have taken up the role of mudguards for Fianna F&aacute;il.  They seem to agree that all the dirt should stick to them leaving Fianna F&aacute;il clean.  It is important that the major political party in Government takes responsibility for what goes wrong.  In the past couple of years, particularly before the general election,  the property and construction industries were hyped.  Many young people bought houses at what are now seen as exaggerated values and have been left with negative equity.  This has a very serious effects on young families.  If people feel that the house they live in is worth much less than they paid for it and if their mortgage rises, there is a psychological effect but also a reduction in ability to move to another job or another area.  Additional financial burden is created if an individual in that household loses a job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to having further discussions in this House.  The point is sometimes made that Members on this side of the House confine what they say to criticising the Government.  The economy is a broad subject. The Government takes up its Private Members&rsquo; time to discuss those aspects of the economy that might be felt to be outside politics, such as the service industry and other sections of the economy that are doing very well with minimum interference from Government.  This side of the House will therefore take it upon itself to discuss those parts of the economy it considers the Government has failed to address and which have an enormous effect on people&rsquo;s lives.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Michael Finneran, to the House, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  It is great to see those who have served in this House move to high office.  I call Senator Ivor Callely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, on his appointment and wish him well.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to raise the issue of the proposals for the Central Mental Hospital.  This matter was brought to my attention by the parent of a patient &mdash; I use the word patient, not prisoner &mdash; of the Central Mental Hospital.  It was suggested that the proposal to move the hospital will have implications for patients currently in the care of health professionals working under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.  This parent, rightly, put a strong, plausible, understanding case <Col N="763"/>to me with the reasons she does not want her son to be ensconced in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the prison system.  The patient in question has particular difficulties that are recognised by the State and appropriately treated by staff in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>I have visited the Central Mental Hospital on several occasions in my capacity as a member of the Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.  My understanding is that while the Central Mental Hospital is owned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science have an interest in part of the land there too.  I further understand the HSE deliver a number of services on campus.  While I am not familiar with the view of the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the proposals for Thornton Hall, I understand the current plans represent departmental policy and I assume the new Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will continue to pursue this policy.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be moving to Thornton Hall, surely it is appropriate that the Minister would take the opportunity revisit the proposal if it involves moving people who avail of a service from another Department, whether that service is provided by the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science or the Health Service Executive?  If such an outcome were to result from the proposals, I support the view put to me by a group of parents &mdash; including one of my constituents, whose name I will not mention at this stage &mdash; concerned about the proposal.  Their view is these patients should not be moved.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revisit the proposal, so that parents of such patients need not spend their energy lobbying politicians?  While the case brought to my attention involved the Department of Health and Children, equally if there are people in receipt of a service from the Department of Education and Science or the Health Service Executive that are not deemed to be prisoners, such patients should not be moved either.</P>
        <P>When the lady from Clontarf, in my constituency, brought this issue to my attention she was concerned and visibly upset that her son was going to be transferred to a prison site.  I am <i>au fait</i> and aware of the tremendous work, the sizable commitment and the challenges facing those working in the Central Mental Hospital as I have previously visited the site when I was a member of the Eastern Health Board.  The work there is challenging and difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran&rsquo;s response, although I do not wish to put him on the spot, as he was only appointed in the past 24 hours.  Equally, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is relatively new to the brief, but I suggest it might be opportune to revisit the proposal, especially if it is deemed to be inappropriate.  The information available to me suggests that it would be inappropriate to move such people to a prison site.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senator Ivor Callely for their kind words on my elevation to the position of Minister of State.  I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the plans for the re-development of the Central Mental Hospital.  In May 2006, the Government approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.  This decision was consistent with a recommendation outlined in A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy which recommended that the Central Mental Hospital should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date, humane setting and the capacity of the <Col N="764"/>Central Mental Hospital should be maximised.  The cost of developing the new hospital will be met from the proceeds of the sale of the existing site of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The Health Service Executive has established a project team to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital.  A project brief is being developed and a cost benefit analysis of the project is close to completion.  The new hospital will be a separate capital project, independent of the prison complex.  It will be managed and directed by the Health Service Executive with a new governance structure that remains distinct from the prison.  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a separate, therapeutic health facility.  It will have a separate entrance and a different address to the prison complex.</P>
        <P>The decision to redevelop the Central Mental Hospital is a major step forward in the provision of quality care to prisoners with mental illness.  There has been little or no structural change to the existing hospital since it opened in 1850.  With the exception of a small, single-storey block built some 20 years ago it remains essentially unchanged since it was built.  Many of the elements of the building are unsuitable to the provision of a modern, therapeutic, forensic mental health service.  Like other unsuitable  older psychiatric hospitals, the closure of the existing facility in Dundrum is the correct decision.  The Central Mental Hospital is the only centre in the State that provides treatment for mental illness in conditions of medium and maximum security.  The majority of admissions to the Central Mental Hospital are from within the Prison Service.</P>
        <P>Conditions within the Central Mental Hospital have improved in recent years with increased staffing and an end to the practice of slopping out.  Important safeguards for patients have been introduced by the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 and the Mental Health Act 2001.  However, the fact remains that the existing hospital facility must be replaced.  The report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services stated that the building at the current site is unsuitable for providing an inpatient service.  Members of the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture who visited the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum in 2007 were also critical of facilities.</P>
        <P>Building a new hospital on a new site will open up a range of opportunities for the provision of modern treatment and recreational facilities.  A purpose-built, modern facility, coupled with the required staffing, will offer the best treatment to people requiring forensic mental health services.  I will bring the views of the Senator to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children when I meet her next.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment and wish him every success in the future.</P>
        <P>An issue has arisen for young people with disability who attend a range of educational facilities, some of which are special school placements and others of which are in a mainstream school setting.  Ordinarily as these young people leave school in June, arrangements are put in place by the Health Service Executive to ensure funding is available to allow them to continue with their placements from the following September onwards.  Obviously as leaving school and adjusting to a new setting is quite traumatic and a big step for any person, it is very important adequate preparation should take place.  Appropriate training, employment or activation locations should be identified that would meet the needs of the individual young person.  Ordinarily at this stage of the year such preparations would be well advanced.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P>I welcome that in last year&rsquo;s budget the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, allocated an additional &euro;50 million for the provision of services for people with disabilities.  When I raised the matter of the expenditure of this &euro;50 million in a similar Adjournment debate in the Seanad a number of weeks ago, I received an assurance that every cent of that &euro;50 million would be spent on services for people with disabilities and that part of that funding would go to those individuals who were due to leave school in June.  However, some concerns have arisen and it appears that the money has not been committed.  This is causing quite a degree of anxiety and uncertainty for parents.  It has slowed the process of identifying appropriate settings, locations and placements for these young people from September onwards.  They are not getting the opportunity to prepare for the transition and to go to view the locations they are hoping to attend from September onwards for fear that the money we have allocated in the budget for 2008 will not be committed from September.</P>
        <P>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could alleviate that anxiety and concern being experienced by those young people and their parents, and confirm to the Seanad that the money that was allocated in the budget will be spent to ensure these young people will be able to continue their development come September 2008 and allow us to bring an end to any anxiety being experienced.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm also that the remainder of the &euro;50 million will still be spent in the disability area and not used, as has been suggested, to offset an overspend by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the words of congratulation from the Senator, for which I thank her.  I will be responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>Young people with disabilities leaving school have access to a range of training, employment and day services provided by the public sector.  These services are delivered by health and personal social service providers and by F&Aacute;S, the national training and employment agency.  The Health Service Executive and voluntary agencies funded by the Health Service Executive provide rehabilitative training for persons whose level of disability can make it difficult to access employment.  Vocational training is provided by F&Aacute;S to assist young people with disabilities progress towards employment on a full-time or part-time basis.  F&Aacute;S has 2,000 places available for vocational training for people with disabilities.  In addition, the HSE and voluntary agencies funded by the HSE provide a range of other day services designed to meet the needs of adults with disabilities.</P>
        <P>The HSE employs guidance officers at local level to assist in the transition of young school leavers with disabilities to training and day services.  The guidance officer will work with school leavers, their families, school authorities and service providers to ensure school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.  As part of the national disability strategy&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme, the HSE has increased the number of day places for people with intellectual disability by almost 1,500 since 2005.  In addition, almost 150 day places have had their services enhanced with the provision of additional supports to allow the places deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities.</P>
        <P>The increase in services in recent years has ensured young people with intellectual disabilities have appropriate services in place to ensure a smooth transition from secondary school.  In some cases the funding provided supported the school leavers to access appropriate day services in line with a person-centred plan.  In many cases this funding provided places for individuals completing rehabilitative training, thereby creating training places for other school leavers.</P>
        <P>The Government provided an additional &euro;50 million this year to the HSE to provide for additional developments for people with a disability, including young people leaving school. <Col N="766"/> The national disability strategy is underpinned by a multi-annual investment programme.  The funding is being spent on the development of additional health and personal social services for persons with a disability over the period 2006 to 2009.</P>
        <P>An additional &euro;50 million was allocated by the Government for the provision of disability services in the budget for 2008.  The HSE, in its service plan for 2008, proposes to allocate the &euro;50 million to provide 200 additional residential places for persons with an intellectual disability; 53 additional respite places; 467 additional day care places; 80 additional residential places for persons with a physical and sensory disability; 200,000 additional hours of personal assistance-home support and; 140 additional professional staff to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services for children with disabilities, with particular reference to the implementation of the Disability Act for children under five years of age.</P>
        <P>The Office for Disability and Mental Health was established by the Government in January 2008.  It brings together responsibility for different policy areas and a range of services that impact on the lives of persons with a disability and persons with mental health difficulties.  The main focus of the office is to improve co-ordination and communication across Departments and agencies in the delivery of disability and mental health services.  Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health, but we recognise that more needs to be done.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to move the disability agenda to a level that compares with the best in the world.  We will do so in partnership with all stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The response only reiterates what I was told a number of weeks ago when I asked whether the money would be spent on disability.  I am certain of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to disability, and of the allocation of the &euro;50 million.  However, experience has told me that while the Health Service Executive informs us and the Government that it is allocating money to a particular area, the evidence shows &mdash; as with A Vision for Change last year &mdash; that the HSE does not go on to spend the money in the area that has been identified.  That is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, is taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I urge him to convey my concerns to her and to ensure that this year we will be in a position where we can believe that the money we allocated for disability will be spent on it, and that at the end of the year we will not be told it was not possible to spend it in that area.  We now have a chance to intervene.  The evidence is that those preparations are not taking place and that parents have been told it is not possible to ensure a place will be available for their children in September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Senator and the House that I will convey her views to the Minister and outline the concerns she has expressed following my contribution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, on his recent appointment and thank him for attending the House to take this Adjournment matter.</P>
        <P>We had a good debate in the House earlier on rural development with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We discussed many aspects of the lack of services in rural areas.  I refer to the lack of adequate sewerage schemes, especially in County Waterford.  A number of years ago seven villages were grouped together to try to facilitate the development of adequate sewerage schemes.  An application was made to the Department and approval for funding was subsequently received, which I welcome.  However, there is much frustration and concern about the barriers and bureaucracy within Departments <Col N="767"/>dealing with various elements of the application.  I refer, for example, to the acquirement of foreshore licences to facilitate the development of the sewerage schemes.</P>
        <P>Cappoquin is one of the seven towns making the application.  The county council has been told that tenders for the works involving the installation of a new sewerage network in the town must be forwarded to the Department on the new tender documents.  I seek clarification on the matter because when the council inquired about the location of the tender documents it was informed they were with a working group and might not be available for a number of months.  That is a cause of huge frustration in a town that is crying out to expand.  The county council has set aside funds from this year&rsquo;s road budget to reinstate the roads to an adequate standard.  This problem has surfaced and we have been informed it will take a number of months to deal with it.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister of State to inquire as to the barrier regarding the tender documents.  If it will take the working group a number of months to deal with them, surely the previous system of tender documents should be acceptable to the Department?  However, it is my information that they will not be acceptable.  That is an unsatisfactory arrangement.  We talk constantly about how we should support rural towns and villages.  This is a practical example of how Departments can be more efficient in delivering the necessary infrastructure in an efficient, timely and cost-effective manner.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight the problem in Cappoquin and  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I hope I will hear a practical solution to the problem.  As politicians, we are elected to resolve the bureaucratic tangles that exist sometimes in Departments.  I am hopeful of a positive response from the Minister of State.  I thank him for taking the time to hear me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his words of congratulation.  They are appreciated.</P>
        <P>The Waterford towns and villages scheme is approved for funding under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 at an estimated cost of more than &euro;48 million.</P>
        <P>The scheme entails the construction of new or upgraded wastewater treatment and collection systems in Ardmore, Ballyduff-Kilmeaden, Cappoquin, Dunmore East, Kilmacthomas, Stradbally and Tallow.   Waterford County Council is advancing the scheme on the basis of separate contracts for the collection systems and the wastewater treatment plants, with the latter being grouped under a single contract.</P>
        <P>The council is making good progress.  Work on upgrading the wastewater collection system in Tallow has been completed.  Work on the Kilmacthomas collection system started in March 2008.  The council envisages seeking tenders for the remaining five collection systems on a phased basis up to early 2009. By this timetable, work on all the collection systems should have started by summer 2009.  This projection reflects the latest timetable Waterford County Council has received for issue of foreshore licences which are currently the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</P>
        <P>In October 2006, the Department of Finance issued a circular requiring all public works projects to use new forms of construction contracts from February 2007 onwards.  The new forms of contract were introduced to achieve greater cost certainty, better value for money and more timely and efficient delivery of publicly funded projects.  However, in the case of projects for which detailed drafting of contract documents had already begun, contracting authorities were given a choice.  They could either switch over to the new forms of contract or continue on to complete the existing contract documents.  I understand that Waterford County Council <Col N="768"/>elected to stay with the contract documents on which they were working for the five remaining collection systems, including Cappoquin.</P>
        <P>This interim arrangement, which applied only to cases where detailed drafting of contract documents was already under way by October 2006, was brought to a conclusion by the Department of Finance on 13 February 2008, after a 15 month lead-in period.  There is no uncertainty or ambiguity about the position.  All public works contracts on or after that date must now be awarded using the new forms of contract.</P>
        <P>While Waterford County Council must therefore redraft the contract documents for Cappoquin and the other four collection systems, I understand the tendering process should not be inordinately delayed, therefore, work on all these projects should still have started by next summer.  Even if finalising the revised contract documents takes a little time, this should be made up during the construction stage.  Under the new forms of contract, the contractor will have all design information in his possession and can then proceed to complete the project within an optimum timeframe.</P>
        <P>Waterford County Council is also finalising the contract documents for the wastewater treatment plants at the seven locations and will submit them to my Department for approval as soon as possible.  These are being procured under the design-build-operate contract model and are not affected by the changes in contract procedures for the collection systems.  The council expects to be in a position to seek tenders for the treatment plants by the end of this year.  I understand the council&rsquo;s intention is to structure the execution of the treatment plant contract in such a way as to ensure that the construction of each individual plant dovetails with the completion of the relevant collection system.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Senator that the Minister is well aware of the need to improve the wastewater infrastructure services in the seven towns and villages and that the Department will continue to co-operate in every way possible with Waterford County Council to advance this major scheme to construction with the minimum of delay.</P>
