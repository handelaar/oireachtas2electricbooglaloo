	<P>I have notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to allow the practice of tumoideachas to continue in gaelscoileanna throughout the State as is current practice in Northern Ireland and to carry out more research on the topic.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to review the control of dogs regulations to ensure the identified ten breeds of dog will not be facilitated to roam freely due to a gap in the definition of what is a public place, that is, when they must be on a short lead and muzzled.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Pearse Doherty and Cecilia Keaveney as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s business is No. 1, an all-party motion on Zimbabwe, No. 2, a message from the D&aacute;il about the Criminal Justice Human (Trafficking Bill) 2007 and No. 3, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  It is proposed that the all-party motion on Zimbabwe will be taken without debate on at the conclusion of the Order of Business; that the message from the D&aacute;il about the Criminal Justice (Human Trafficking) Bill be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; and that the Second Stage of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008 be resumed at the conclusion of No. 2.  It is proposed to interrupt the business of the House for five minutes at the conclusion on Second Stage of the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, after which time it is proposed to start on Committee Stage of that Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is agreeable to this side of the House.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing that such scant regard was shown for the medical files of patients from the southern capital, as outlined on the front page of the newspaper this morning.  I am sure the acting Leader has taken note of this.  It was disgraceful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="476"/>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that such files, which one would consider confidential, were found in a landfill site.  How a hospital authority could have behaved in such a way is beyond belief.  These items should have been shredded or incinerated.  Given this, the news of laptops going missing recently and so on, perhaps there is a need to legislate for stronger guidelines in the area of personal data protection.  I wish to hear from the acting Leader on this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We welcome the resolution, which hopefully is not temporary, of the dispute between pharmacists and the Health Service Executive.  We also welcome that medicines will continue to be dispensed to medical card holders and others under the drug schemes.  It is proper that the independent body on pharmacy contract pricing is allowed to get on with its business.  The HSE has behaved badly and it should never again resort to unilateral action of that kind.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the acting Leader perhaps overlooked the questions which Senator Ross and I raised regarding the property services regulatory authority Bill.  This is an important measure and it is badly needed.  Nobody wants consumers to be mislead in any way.  There could be something of a conflict given the existing legislation on data protection and the consumer protection agency.  Perhaps some amendments are necessary to allow for proper and full information where relevant to be revealed.  This is something everybody in the House would welcome.  However, it would be wrong to use estate agents as scapegoats and there seems to be an inclination to blame them for any collapse or decline in the housing market.  Hopefully the market will become more buoyant than it appears at present.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Members of this House who won awards last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were all well deserved and merited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Coghlan on the seriousness of the situation in County Cork.  That personal files have been unearthed in such a fashion &mdash; they were clearly visible owing to railway works &mdash; is regrettable.  A man with a history of alcoholism and drug use was referred to on the radio news this morning because his file, containing details of his address, occupation and so on, was found.  This concerning issue should be treated seriously.  It may also be a question of illegal dumping.  How did the files get there?  Senator Coghlan was right to refer to this matter.</P>
        <P>I do not agree on taking No. 1 without debate, which would be extraordinary.  Zimbabwe is an important problem because democratic rights therein have been violated, its army and police have been used against democratic opposition parties and its electoral process has been usurped.  A number of Senators met some of the people persecuted previously.  A small amount of time should be set aside for debate of the motion.</P>
        <P>When will No. 21, motion 3 be taken?  In it, the Independent Senators request the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ldquo;to seek the establishment of a monitoring group to supervise the implementation of the Human Rights Attachments to the External Association Agreement between the European Union and the State of Israel&rdquo;.  If human rights are to mean anything and if protocols on them are to be attached to international treaties, they should be monitored.  I am not calling for the implementation of sanctions.  Rather, the EU should establish a watchdog.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>On the subject of human rights monitoring, colleagues may know that the report of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, has been published.  Will the Acting Leader arrange a debate on this important report&rsquo;s findings and conclusions which are both positive and negative in respect of Ireland?  I agree <Col N="477"/>with the Commissioner that some developments have been positive and important, namely, the establishment of the Ombudsman for Children and the Garda Ombudsman Commission.  However, the House should debate the number of criticisms made by the commissioner.  For example, the deficiencies in the provision of professional care for children in State accommodation should be examined.  Of particular concern is the standard of care for young people in psychiatric institutions.  Our prosperous country is still accommodating children and young people in adult psychiatric units, a situation that no civilised country should allow to continue.  The Commissioner was right to point this issue out.  Will the Acting Leader accommodate a debate in the House?</P>
        <P>The Commissioner raised the question of the law in respect of abortion.  We cannot abdicate our responsibilities as legislators permanently.  In the X case, the Supreme Court set out the law.  Members will have opinions and disagreements on what should occur, but we cannot turn our backs on the issue having done so for long enough.  The commissioner is correct that the matter should be debated fully and legislation should be introduced to set out clearly the Houses&rsquo; opinion on the provision of abortion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Each winter, the House spends much time discussing road safety.  Given the lengthening days, it is timely that we consider ways in which to improve road safety so that we need not discuss it so much next winter.  I do not know whether the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or one of his colleagues would be responsible for requiring lights to be on all bicycles.  Before suitable batteries became available, the speed of one&rsquo;s pedals powered a bicycle&rsquo;s light.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is still the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Keaveney is showing her age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I challenge every Member to stand outside the gates of Leinster House on a dark evening and to count how many bicycles without lights go past.  Whether technology has reversed or advanced so far that there can be unlit bicycles, we should return to the good old days of pedal power.  It should be compulsory to attach lights during the manufacture of bicycles.  This would aid road safety in rural and built-up areas such as Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, other representatives and I attended a briefing given by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, which is concerned about the underfunding of third level education.  Registration fees in some colleges amount to almost &euro;1,000.  The percentage of money allocated from them to student support services is decreasing whereas the percentage used to pay budget deficits is increasing.  The USI suggested that it takes 12 weeks for students in need of help to see counsellors.  This is a damning indictment of colleges and I ask that the Minister for Education and Science address it as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Some students live in dreadful conditions.  Last year, the number of properties available to them decreased by 20%, forcing students into appalling conditions.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated that he would establish a task force or working group to examine this matter.  When will this urgently required task force be established?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the Middle East, especially in respect of ongoing tragedies in the Gaza strip where 1.5 million prisoners are kept in an open prison.  Recently, a woman and four children were slaughtered by Israeli firepower.  Hamas continues to launch missiles against Israel.  This conflict must be resolved.  I commend former American president Jimmy Carter on his courageous stand during his discussions with Hamas. <Col N="478"/> That movement must be spoken to if a resolution is to be brought about, as was the case in Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We are in a good position in that respect.  In this light, I hope a role alongside Tony Blair in the Middle East will become available for the Taoiseach, who would be a wonderful peace envoy to the region.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a discussion on Commissioner Hammarberg&rsquo;s report on human rights.  He was given open access to Ireland and, while I have not read the report, a debate would be worthwhile, subject to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The commissioner would be available to attend, as he addressed Senators at Council of Europe meetings.  Ours is an open and democratic society and we opened all of our facilities to the commissioner.  We put a stop to nothing during his tour of Ireland.  It would be worthwhile for the House to discuss his opinions openly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with him in some respects.  I have not read his opinion on abortion, a matter beyond his jurisdiction, but it can be debated.</P>
        <P>I agree with the acting Leader of the Opposition, who I congratulate on doing a good job.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the comments made by prison officers on overcrowding in prisons, I call for a debate on the prison system, criminal justice and our response to crime in society.  It appears Cork Prison houses double the number of prisoners it should and, as we know, Mountjoy Prison is seriously overcrowded.  The Prison Service has spoken about the expansion of prisons and increases to the number of places under its programme of modernisation, but we need to discuss whether those responses are sufficient.  We need to consider alternatives to prison for non-violent offenders and heed  prison officers when they point out the obvious by warning that overcrowding increases the risks of aggression among prisoners, illness and problems in the system for prisoners as well as for those who have the task of working with them.</P>
        <P>Instead of focusing on a punitive model, we need to seek the rehabilitation of prisoners not only for their own sake, although we cannot overlook their human rights, but also in order to work smarter rather than harder on preventing crime in our society.  For everybody&rsquo;s sake, it makes sense to work towards the rehabilitation of prisoners.  We are being short-sighted about crime if all we think about is expanding the number of prison places.  The Seanad is the place to hold the debate on how we can foster a more visionary approach than has been taken thus far, not only for the sake of prisoners but also for society as a whole.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to respond briefly to the remarks made by the supposed top human rights watchdog, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg.  I agree with him in so far as he spoke about foreign national children who are in danger of being trafficked for exploitation due to the insufficient care provided in State accommodation.  I also agree with his warning against placing child offenders in institutions with adult offenders.  Quite frankly, however, he hobbles his right to be called a human rights watchdog when in the same breath he calls into question Ireland&rsquo;s law on abortion, which is one of the few civilised laws in that regard in western Europe.  It is time we faced up to the fact that people who call themselves advocates of human rights have a duty to society to be consistent rather than selectively support human rights.  I would go further by saying there should be no co-operation on the part of this State or its officers with supposed human rights watchdogs who have such questionable views about the equal dignity of all human persons and the equal right to life.  We should make it a condition of our co-operation with such personages operating on behalf of international organisations that they do not seek to interfere with our laws&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can discuss that matter if the Deputy Leader agrees to arrange a debate on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and demonstrate consistent human rights credentials before they start looking at other countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>So, it is only when we agree with them that they are right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Consistency is required.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear to me that the Labour Party has called for the implementation of abortion legislation.  Senators should correct me if I am wrong.  Such a call is both untimely and wrong.  It was wrong in terms of the X case, in which for reasons of suicide Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution was allowed to include suicide.  A report was recently published by <Col N="480"/>the Royal College of Psychologists which indicated that abortion is a major cause of suicide.  We should not only avoid legislating but we should also ensure the significant expansion in the X case judgment is amended so that the true wishes of a large majority of the people in this country are taken into account and the right to life is protected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the subject of violence against the person, we have experienced a significant increase in anti-social behaviour and violence, some of it fuelled by drink.  Certain areas cannot be visited on Saturday nights for fear of random acts of violence.  I ask that some strategy be devised to deal with this major infringement on our rights.  People should be allowed to visit every part of town at any time of the day or night without fear of meeting with random, mindless violence.  As a country, we need to address that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s advice about awards, it is important that we join Senator Leyden in congratulating Senator Regan on the illustrious award he received last night.</P>
        <P>In the context of this morning&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> report about personal medical files, I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange an urgent debate on data protection and accountability of the HSE and the former southern health board.  We are discussing people in this regard, not clients or users.  Sensitive information about a person should not be disposed of carelessly and without accountability.  It is not good enough that sensitive information is strewn around the countryside or lost in cars.  How did it get there and who was responsible?  We need answers and accountability from those who were in charge.</P>
        <P>This morning&rsquo;s reports on overcrowding in prisons make disturbing reading.  It is unfair on prison officers and staff to work in such conditions and it raises the question of what we want the Prison Service to do.  Is the function of prisons rehabilitation or incarceration?  Are they punitive or can we reform people?  The dispute which began between prison officers and the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, is warming up again.  Prison officers are concerned about the situation which is developing.  That is bad for morale and the Prison Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the calls made by other speakers for a debate on overcrowding in prisons and new models.  I listened carefully to Senator Mullen when he spoke about how we could introduce a rehabilitation element before locking away people, which is not the way forward.  I would welcome a debate in which we could discuss the potential roles of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science.  I am like an old gramophone record in that I speak every day of the week about the role that society can play.  We can only do so much but working together we can develop new models of justice and rehabilitation.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the all-party motion on Zimbabwe but want to focus on human rights closer to home.  Yesterday saw the publication of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s report on human rights in Ireland.  It contained 34 recommendations for action by the Government.  Senator Alex White referred to some of these areas, which include rights of travellers, access to education and rights of people with mental health issues.</P>
        <P>A particular area of concern is extraordinary rendition.  The report calls for a proper regime of inspection to be put in place at our airports.  The Government has said it has assurances that everything is all right but I am concerned about those assurances because I recall from history that assurances were given at the time of the Vietnam War about bombings in Cambodia and Laos.  More recently, assurances were given about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  I would not take those assurances from the Government at face value.</P><Col N="481"/>
        <P>During the negotiations for the current programme for Government Senator Boyle and the Green Party were pleased to say they expected the situation to improve.  I have not seen any improvements and planes continue to take off and land at will.  They will be half way to<?oasys _jy ?>Uzbekistan before they are inspected.  We must put an inspection regime in place.  Amnesty Ireland has called for one as has this most recent report.  I ask for a debate to be held on this issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>On Monday last I attended the launch by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance of the OECD review of the Irish public service.  It is an impressive report which has an executive summary attached.  This is one of the most significant reports ever published on the public service and it is timely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>And damning of the Government&rsquo;s record.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The OECD concludes that there is a need for a more integrated public service, with all the Departments working together.  The logo on the cover depicts<?oasys _jy ?>gadgets fitting together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Buttimer trying to get an award for interrupting people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste stated also that the setting up of the Office of the Minister for Children was a significant development in integrating services and an important part of our policy making.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that rather than creating new structures there should be a network approach to working across existing structures to allow greater connectivity between different sectors.  Importantly, in a potentially tighter fiscal environment, the T&aacute;naiste said there is a need to prioritise spending within budget frameworks.  On the Order of Business I have drawn attention to the Health Service Executive budget of &euro;14.9 million and the fact that rather than look for more money it must prioritise the areas it is dealing with and deliver efficiency and performance.</P>
        <P>There are many recommendations in the report but the T&aacute;naiste stated:  &ldquo;I agree with the OECD that there is a compelling need to adopt a more citizen-centred approach&rdquo;.  That is the first time I have heard that spelt out.  As in private business, the customer is the most important person.  The public services are to be geared towards looking after the citizens who fund the public services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>We must put the public at the centre of our public services.  </P>
        <P>The launch was quite a long event with many senior public servants speaking, but in his final points the T&aacute;naiste, and this is relevant to everybody in this Chamber, stated: &ldquo;I am determined to take decisive action to improve Irish public services and look forward to working with the social partners to achieve this&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>He further stated: &ldquo;I intend that when I am Taoiseach, I and my successor as Minister for Finance will set out our more detailed response to the Review&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I look forward, having worked in the public and private sectors for many years, to seeing the way the incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, deals with this area.  I believe he has a passion to reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, want to raise the topic of the OECD report Senator White mentioned.  I called for a debate on that last week because it was likely this would be a landmark report on the state of our public services.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment briefly on the state into which we have got ourselves.  How has it happened that the concept of the user of a public service being the person around whom the service is designed is suddenly a revolutionary idea?  After ten years of increasing tax revenue year after year why is it suddenly dawning on this Government that the person we should be putting at the centre of our public services is the person who is using them?</P>
        <P>It is important to have a debate on this report alone because it comments on two major policy initiatives this Government has undertaken, to which Senator White did not refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not mention everything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It describes the Government&rsquo;s decision on decentralisation as being inherently wrong for the long-term success of our public services and challenges strongly the decisions this Government is making on cancer services.  One of the most reputed organisations on economics and the development of countries is stating that many of the major strategic decisions this Government has made on cancer services and decentralisation are wrong.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this report to ensure that all Members of the House have an opportunity to comment on it.  Why does no Member of this House get a copy of these reports?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Donohoe, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I tried to take the initiative.  I got on to the OECD website yesterday to get a copy of it but I was not allowed do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not.  How did we get ourselves to the point where not only action on public services is confined to Government, which I can understand, but the right to comment on that is also confined to the Government?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point on the loss of important and sensitive data belonging to patients.  The Government is proposing to introduce a new directive that will allow more information about citizens to be stored.  A directive is coming from the Department of Justice, <Col N="483"/>Equality and Law Reform, which has not been debated, that will extend the amount of time in which that Department can hold information on e-mails sent and mobile phone calls made.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks and this morning we have seen the inability of the HSE to manage that information.  Last week we saw the inability of one of our leading banks to manage it.  Why can we not have a debate in this House on the reason such a directive is needed, given that no other European country is doing this, and how it will be implemented without the privacy of our citizens being jeopardised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senators Mullen and Hanafin regarding abortion.  We all know there is no connection between the issue of abortion in Ireland, for instance, and the Lisbon treaty yet on the other hand we know there is a fear abroad that if our traditional pro-life stance on abortion is to change, the prompting for that is likely to come from outside the country.  It does not matter whether it is in a human rights document or whatever.  It is a matter entirely for the Irish people and the majority of the Irish people do not want abortion in this State.  If there is any need for legislation it should be to strengthen the position of the unborn and ensure their rights are beyond question while at the same time helping those misfortune women who are prompted to have abortions.</P>
        <P>From time to time I have seen the lobby groups promoting the idea of abortion but I have not seen them think of what it was like for women who had abortions.  There is no doubt they are traumatised for life and depressed, and many of them are suicidal also.  That is what we should be focusing on.</P>
        <P>I support the comments on the Middle East made by other speakers because in many ways the Palestinian question has gone off the radar, yet the atrocities are continuing.  To look at the picture of the four innocent children killed by Israeli forces must make one stop and ask what is happening.  I have raised the point in the House on many occasions that if we are to have progress on the Palestinian question, it will have to include Hamas which has been elected by the people to represent them.</P>
        <P>Former President Jimmy Carter has again put his head above the parapet, as he has done previously on many occasions on human rights issues.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I praised him in the House many times for doing so.  I hardly think he is doing this without a nod and a wink from within officialdom.  It is vital we continue to take a stand to arrive at a proper peace with justice, as we have achieved in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons we hear so little about it currently is because we are in the throes of a presidential election in America.  It is a pity that so many hundreds more people will be killed before that election is over and any progress is made.  I wish Jimmy Carter the best of luck because I have no doubt in my mind that if we face this issue with courage, in the same way as we did in the North of Ireland, bringing all the involved parties into the equation, there is some hope of success.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise a serious matter evident overnight in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital in Portrane.  Last night a number of staff covering three units had to continue working their shift to complete a full 24-hour cover round-the-clock work regime.  They could not go home because no relief was available to let them home.</P>
        <P>This outrageous situation has arisen as a result of an ongoing dispute of which many Senators are aware relating to the compensation scheme for nurses working in the mental health services who were injured as a result of an assault at work.  I understand the Psychiatric Nurses&rsquo; Associ<Col N="484"/>ation and SIPTU served notice in this regard three weeks ago.  The notice expired yesterday and no meaningful negotiations took place within the three-week period.  Nurses are now forced to take industrial action, including a ban on overtime, which staff consider to be voluntary in any case.  They are sticking to rostered hours.  As a result, units were covered by staff working for 24 hours.  This is to continue today and over the weekend until negotiations take place.  Similar cases are arising in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital in Dundrum as well as other locations throughout the country.  The other locations are less reliant on overtime.  It is a dangerous position for vulnerable and high-dependency patients and it is very unsatisfactory for staff.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to bring this matter urgently to the attention of the Minister and ask her to direct the Health Service Executive to initiate meaningful negotiations so this<?oasys _jy ?>15-year campaign by nurses can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the all-party motion on the Order Paper.  In doing so, I ask that we use every tool available and join our international colleagues to ensure the official results of the recent presidential election are published as quickly as possible as that would solve many of the problems being suffered by the people of Zimbabwe.  The sooner that matter is published and dealt with, the better.  We will see other events after that.</P>
        <P>My good friend and colleague, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, congratulated former President Jimmy Carter, which I support.  From what I have read, former President Carter has made very poignant suggestions and recommendations as to what is necessary to try to achieve some type of settlement for the Palestinians.  I hope this House will be able to support whatever proper publication of those recommendations comes in due course.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention briefly that some success has been made, as we know, on an issue that many of my colleagues and I have raised, namely, the community pharmacist issue.  I indicate that the issue is not over, although the Health Service Executive has given a little to prevent disruption of services.  Community pharmacists are still as anxious as ever to have these matters properly resolved.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange briefing material on the supports and services in place for vulnerable people, those with addictions and those with difficulties and mental health problems?  I ask this because, as the House is aware, I have raised the matter of homelessness on a number of occasions.  I listened today with interest when Senator Mullen and others mentioned the issue of people in prison and being discharged from prison.</P><Col N="485"/>
        <P>We have a range of State agencies and different Departments.  With regard to the group of people I am talking about, whether homeless or partaking of services, I ask for some type of briefing material that would outline the co-ordination that exists between the various services, State agencies and Departments.</P>

	<P>I thank those who congratulated me on receiving the <i>Magill</i> Senator of the Year award.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite an honour.  It is a mark of recognition of this House and its significance that the magazine has a distinct award for Senators.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Department of Finance statement to the social partners reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  It states that the economic prospects for this year and 2009 are challenging, which must be the understatement of the year.  The Department also points out that the three priorities are to manage the slowdown in the economy, stabilise public finances and regain competitiveness.</P>
        <P>On the note of competitiveness, I know the incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, is reflecting on the ministerial pay awards.  If we are serious about competitiveness and showing some leadership in the area, my question to the Deputy Leader is whether a decision has been made on reversing the ministerial pay awards and whether the Green Party supports the Minister for Finance and incoming Taoiseach in that decision, if such a decision is about to be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a matter which is not just housekeeping and is important.  I was very pleased to see the motion on Zimbabwe on the Order Paper, as it was bounced on, so to speak, in the last 24 hours as far as I can see.  I rushed down to the Chamber to make a speech on Zimbabwe as it was something in which I was interested only to be absolutely shattered to find it is simply an all-party motion to be rubber-stamped and put through this House.  I see no precedent for this.</P>
        <P>There is a precedent for matters going through this House being rubber-stamped by all parties without debate when they are technical or have been passed by other committees or elsewhere.  There is no precedent where issues of a substantial nature have been proposed.  This matter requires debate as there is much detail, emotion and passion in this motion.</P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>It is a great achievement to get an all-party motion.  I suspect the Department of Foreign Affairs has breathed down someone&rsquo;s neck and said that the motion should go through but that it does not want people exerting pressure on it or saying things that might exacerbate the situation or cause embarrassment to the Minister.  It is not our job to protect the Minister for Foreign Affairs from embarrassment.  Our job is to express our views on issues of great importance.</P>
        <P>There are very credible organisations, such as Amnesty International and others, that would thoroughly approve of this motion.  However, it is incumbent on us to properly debate motions relating to matters of this nature.  If the motion is meant to exert pressure on President Thabo Mbeki or President Robert Mugabe, it will not have the desired effect because when these people realise that we merely rubber-stamped it, we will be a laughing stock.  The way this matter is being dealt with will prove counter-productive.  It would be useful if the Leader agreed to devote time to discussing the motion when we have dealt with our other business.  From inquiries I have made, it does not appear the latter will take long to complete.</P>

	<P>I am glad the impasse involving the IPU has been resolved.  I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and her team, especially the Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher.  It would be wrong if we were to say that one side had been victorious in this dispute.  Senators on all sides who have worked on this matter would agree that compromises were made by everyone, that the midnight oil was burned on many evenings and that many discussions took place behind closed doors.  Those on all sides, especially the members of the IPU, are happy this morning.</P>
        <P>As public representatives, developments have given us confidence that the consultation process can work.  We look forward to the Dorgan report, which is due to be completed by the end of the month.  In the interim, we should not interfere or take the part of one side over the other.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House?  I requested on a number of previous occasions that the Minister might discuss with us matters such as the proposed new building regulations, planning guidelines and zoning.  It is estimated that the population will increase to 4.9 million or 5 million by 2041.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Department are taking a hands-on approach to the affairs of local authorities regarding the adoption of county development plans where zoning is taking place.  In respect of a number of provincial towns, some of which are classed as hub towns, the Minister is asking local authorities to reduce the level of zoning proposed.  In some instances, this is unbelievable because in many cases the necessary services &mdash; water, sewerage, waste water and gas &mdash; are available.  Such services are funded by taxpayers and ratepayers.  Where the relevant services are in place, land should be <Col N="487"/>zoned.  If we reduce the amount of land available for zoning, we will merely increase the cost relating to land that is zoned.  I ask that the Minister come to the House at an early date to discuss these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the issue of anti-social behaviour on housing estates.  Who holds responsibility in this area?  Is it the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, because there has been a breakdown in law and order, is it local authorities, which do not appear to have any regard to whom they place as tenants in their houses, or is it certain greedy landlords who take no responsibility regarding to whom they rent their properties as long as they obtain moneys from people&rsquo;s rent allowances or supplements?</P>
        <P>This is a serious matter.  Some long-established housing estates are being destroyed.  Families are living in fear of heroin addicts and criminals who come into housing estates and cause havoc.  There is a need for joined-up thinking between the Departments on this matter.  In addition, legislation designed to safeguard people&rsquo;s right to live in peace must be introduced.  Will the Deputy Leader make time available for a debate on this matter?  We all know what has happened on housing estates in cities such as Limerick and Dublin.  Some families have invested heavily in their homes only to have their entire housing estates destroyed by two or three bad elements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the congratulations extended to Senator Regan on his prestigious award.  It is a great personal achievement for him.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the all-party motion on Zimbabwe will be taken today.  This motion is very important.  The situation in that country is horrific and major human rights issues have arisen.  The results of the recent elections in Zimbabwe should be published.  I live near a missionary who worked in Zimbabwe and who continually informs me about the day-to-day hardships experienced by people there.  The stories she tells are horrific.  Action must be taken.  I am inclined to agree with Senator Ross that we should debate this matter, if only to signal how serious we consider it to be.</P>
        <P>As a country with a tradition of respect for human rights and a belief in moral law, we should seize the high ground in respect of the Palestinian question.  This matter also should be debated in the House.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was correct to state that Hamas must come into the equation and be part of the solution.  We must take action in respect of this matter.  I ask the Deputy Leader to reflect on making time available for debates on Zimbabwe and the Palestinian question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Coghlan and Buttimer in respect of the dumping of Cork hospital patient files.  As someone who represents Cork, I was appalled by today&rsquo;s news reports and the likelihood that I might know some of the people whose details may have been made public as a result of what happened.  Issues obviously arise in the context of the prosecution of existing data protection legislation and the need to examine whether it is adequate.  The files date from the 1970s and 1980s and it may well be that the Data Protection Commissioner may not have a role because the legislation did not come into force until the end of the latter decade.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan and others referred to the resolution in the pharmacists&rsquo; dispute.  This is a welcome development and it provides justification for not using the House as a means to prosecute the dispute any further.  Members should assist in ensuring agreement can be reached between the Health Service Executive and pharmacists.  I welcome that those who would have been affected by what was being threatened will not now feel the impact of the dispute.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>Senator Coghlan inquired about the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Some of the issues &mdash; and also the concerns expressed by Senator Ross yesterday &mdash; that might be addressed by the Bill might also be dealt with under the designated land (housing development) Bill the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to publish before the summer and bring before the Houses later in the year.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Reilly and Ross asked why time cannot be made available for the motion on Zimbabwe.  I have no difficulty with having such a debate.  The motion was ordered this way today due to precedent.  We have dealt with recent motions in the same way, for example, regarding Ingrid Betancourt.  It depends on the availability of a suitable Minister.  I ask Members to share the sentiments included in the motion when they are asked to agree to it later.  Time can be provided at a later time to discuss the impact of the motion itself and issues like the Middle East, which many Senators have raised today.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also asked that his motion, No. 3, be taken.  While I am positively disposed towards it, I have received a response from the Department of Foreign Affairs, which I would like to read into the record.  Senator Norris and other Independent Members might take that into account.  The Department states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement of 2002 states that relations between the parties, as well as the provisions of the agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles which guide their internal and international policy, and constitutes an essential element of the agreement.  The human rights situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories are monitored constantly by individual member states, including Ireland, through the representative office in Ramallah, the embassy in Tel Aviv and contacts with a wide range of Israeli and Palestinian rights NGOs and by the Council of Ministers.  The relevant Council working group in Brussels, on which all member states are represented, keeps the human rights situation under detailed review.  Individual instances are raised directly with Israel by the Presidency of the European Union and the member states.  The situation is formally reviewed at the annual meetings of the EU-Israel association committee and at official level in the EU-Israel association council at ministerial level.  The next meeting of the association council takes place in Brussels on 16 June.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Department is saying that a monitoring system does exist and that an important meeting will be held on 16 June.  I ask Independent Members who have tabled the motion to leave it on the Order Paper and to review developments in light of that.  I am not prepared to accept the motion today or to reorder the Order of Business on foot of that.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Leyden, Mullen, Hanafin and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the report of the Human Rights Commissioner.  Details of the report demand a debate in this House.  While most of its contents concerning the need to improve many aspects of human rights in this country seem to be readily agreed, there are also contentious areas.  Members should have the opportunity of discussing them.  Whether or not it is possible, as Senator Leyden suggests, to have the commissioner himself present is a matter that could be raised at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Even a standard debate on the contents of the report, however, would be a useful use of the Seanad&rsquo;s time.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney raised the issue of road safety and the possibility of regulations or legislation insisting that bicycles have lights fitted.  It is a very good idea.  Perhaps we could also have better enforcement of the law as it applies to the one-eyed cars we see driving around the roads of the country every night.  The principle seems to be similar.</P><Col N="489"/>
        <P>Senator Cummins raised the question of the USI lobby and his comments will be forwarded to the Minister, especially those concerning access to councillors.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated his intention to see how the idea of a task force can be proceeded with and he plans to make a statement on the matter in a few months&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Buttimer and Ormonde referred to overcrowding in prisons.  Today&rsquo;s press reports are deeply disturbing as regards Cork Prison which is the most overcrowded prison in the State.  Last year, the Government decided to develop a new prison in Kilworth which should alleviate the overcrowding situation, but raises new issues because it is 13 miles from Cork city.  Some type of regime would have to be put in place to assist family visits to prisoners.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin also asked about anti-social behaviour in public places, which tied in with Senator McFadden&rsquo;s request concerning anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to introduce a landlord and tenant Bill, whose provisions may cover some of the points raised by Senator McFadden.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan mentioned rendition flights.  There is a provision in the programme for Government, which has yet to be implemented, that would require the training of garda&iacute; to inspect aircraft as and when a fear exists that a plane might be being used for rendition purposes.  There is a precedent for the Irish authorities to inspect planes of foreign nations.  It is hoped that this provision of the programme for Government can be implemented soon on the basis of the existing precedent.  The Senator&rsquo;s views will be made known to the relevant Departments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Mary White and Paschal Donohoe referred to the OECD report on public services, but from different perspectives.  The fact that both perspectives were aired means we should have a debate on the contents of the report.  We are all interested in seeing more efficient and higher quality public services and we all suspect there are reasons that is not being achieved in many areas of our public services at the moment.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe referred to the decentralisation programme, which would arise in such a debate.  My take on what the OECD seemed to say is a bit removed from that of Senator Donohoe.  It seemed to say that while there are reasons for the Government&rsquo;s policy &mdash; namely, moving Government services into areas to provide an economic impetus, jobs, opportunities and spin-off effects there &mdash; it is not decentralisation, it is the relocation of services that are still centralised.  The debate we need to have is on how public services can be improved by having actual decentralised services, so that decisions will be made in local communities for those communities which are affected by the decisions.</P>

	<P>No doubt there is consideration about how these pay awards will be made and it is the subject of an ongoing debate within Cabinet.  Senator Regan asked particularly about the Green Party members of the Cabinet.  However, not being privy to Cabinet discussions, and rules on Cabinet confidentiality notwithstanding, I know those Ministers will be fully in accordance with the agreed Cabinet decision when it is reached.  I expect that decision will be reached in September. </P>
        <P>I believe I have covered most of the items raised by Members on the Order of Business.  I would now like to provide the House with an update on Seanad reform.  I have received a note from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which states that following the Seanad debate on Seanad reform before, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wrote to party leaders in January seeking nominations to a proposed all-party group.  Nominations received to date are Senator Alex White and Deputy Joanna Tuffy, representing the Labour Party; Senator Ciaran Cannon, leader of the Progressive Democrats, and Deputy Noel Grealish, representing the Progressive Democrats; and Senator David Norris and Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, representing the Independent Senators.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, will chair the group and I will represent the Green Party on it.</P>
        <P>Other political groups have yet to respond to the invitation to participate in the group.  Reminder letters were sent to the party leaders in mid-March.  Notwithstanding this, the Minister has decided to expedite the process by setting a date for the first meeting of the group.  His Department will be in touch with the Seanad office to set up the meeting and it is hoped the setting of a date for the meeting will encourage those who have yet to nominate people to the group to make those nominations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>In technical terms, the Seanad did not insist on one of the amendments, No. 1, that it made to the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill being agreed to by the D&aacute;il.  This is most unusual and I will briefly outline the details.  On Committee Stage, the Seanad accepted amendments which criminalised soliciting or importuning a trafficked person for the purpose of prostitution.  Since the substantive amendment made reference to a trafficked person, that expression then appeared in more than one section of the Bill.  The Parliamentary Counsel therefore drafted a reference to a trafficked person into what was then section 2 of the Bill, the interpretation section.</P>
        <P>On reconsideration the Parliamentary Counsel thought that the proper place in the Bill to define trafficked person for the purpose of the new section 6 was in section 6 itself.  This involved the deletion of the definition of trafficked person from the interpretation section.  This was done by way of amendment to the Committee Stage amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad but, unfortunately, due to a transcription error it was re-inserted into the Bill.  This was obviously wrong and that is why the D&aacute;il was informed that the Seanad was not insisting that the D&aacute;il agree to it.  The D&aacute;il was effectively being asked to reject the amendment which defined trafficked person in the interpretation centre.  It did that and the Seanad is now being asked not to insist on the D&aacute;il accepting the amendment.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not a particularly usual situation for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is virtual unanimity on the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, with the exception of one political party.  While I am advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum, I accept that people have the right to make up their minds on this matter.  All I ask is that campaigners be honest with the Irish people about the Bill.  It is shocking to hear some people try to insert the issue of abortion into the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty has nothing to do with abortion.  That and other health matters remain issues for the sovereign nations.</P>
        <P>The treaty is not about a unanimous and equal tax system across Europe.  Taxation is a matter for the national authorities, yet some people are asserting that it is part of the treaty.  The treaty is not about losing our neutrality or becoming less Irish.  Ireland has been involved in many peacekeeping roles in the past and can be involved in many more in the future.  We have secured great respect throughout Europe and beyond for our neutral stance.  However, another lie has been perpetrated about this.  I do not often use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; in parliamentary debate but so many untruths have been spoken about the treaty, it is hard to keep one&rsquo;s patience.  The untruths are propounded by people who say they have read and understand the treaty, which makes it difficult for people who have not read and do not understand it to differentiate between what is true and false.</P>
        <P>Another suggestion propounded by people who are supposed to be presenting the facts is that the treaty is a self-amending treaty and that when it is ratified, Europe will not have to refer back to the people again and will continue to amend the treaty to incorporate other issues.  This is a scare tactic that should not be accepted or perpetrated.  It is not true.  Similarly, some people are trying to relate the Lisbon reform treaty to the WTO talks.  The WTO nego<Col N="493"/>tiations are utterly separate from the Lisbon treaty.  The farming community, of all sectors, must realise how important Europe has been for Ireland.  That community, as well as many other sectors, has been a serious beneficiary of the European Union.  The fishermen would not feel that they and their industry have benefited as much as the farming sector.  I plead with people in the agriculture sector to realise the damage that could be done if they link the treaty to what is not in the treaty and link that to whether they vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I believe the treaty is good for Ireland.  We have supported and voted for all previous treaties and each time Ireland and its citizens gained from them.  The same people who opposed previous treaties now oppose the Lisbon treaty.  We must consider that fact.  If one is constantly against something from which Ireland benefits, then whose interests do those people have at heart?  What are they propounding?  I only want the facts to be available.</P>
        <P>The question is why we need the treaty.  We all know that any institution set up with six countries in mind cannot operate at the same level, in the same way or with the same efficiency and effectiveness when it becomes a group of 27 countries.  There are 27 member states now and we must adapt the mechanisms and the administration to ensure the Union is effective and efficient for all.</P>
        <P>The European Union and the rest of the world face new challenges that are best dealt with in a consolidated way with people working together.  I am talking about issues such as global warming, energy security, globalisation and cross-border crime.  By working together we can solve those issues.  Ireland by itself cannot solve many of them.  It is important therefore that we work with a treaty that can support Europe to be as efficient and effective as possible in these areas.</P>
        <P>What are the reasons to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?  The Union will be more democratic as a result of this treaty if it is passed.  The European Parliament will have a greater role in making EU law and will gain greater oversight of the EU budget.  The national parliaments will have a greater role as a result of this treaty and, via the citizen&rsquo;s initiative, citizens will have the right and ability to have their voices heard.  The Union will be more efficient, its citizens will be better protected and the EU will be better equipped to meet global challenges.</P>
        <P>We might look at the other treaties that have been passed.  The Single European Act led to the Single Market and Structural Funds.  Those that came to Border regions were hugely important to Ireland, not merely as a republic but as an island.  The Maastricht treaty gave us the euro.  If we look now at the strength of the euro now against the dollar and sterling we must acknowledge that if we were separate states with separate currencies, one could be played off against another at a time when currency fluctuations are quite serious.  While the euro has its own challenges for business in terms of competitiveness, its strength is important for us in terms of personal finances.  The establishment of the euro was a positive and important decision that came from the Maastricht treaty.</P>
        <P>The Amsterdam and Nice treaties helped to end the Cold War and unify Europe.  A unified and peaceful Europe is a better place for all Europeans.  The Lisbon treaty equips Europe to deal with the challenges of today&rsquo;s world in a similar way to that in which previous treaties attempted to improve the situation at point of treaty, with all the pertinent contemporary difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We might examine the issue of justice and cross-border crime.  I come from the Border area, near to the fourth largest city on the island and yet it is in a different jurisdiction.  This issue is magnified if we look at crime in the context of the European area where people can be on the verges of a number of different borders.  The Lisbon treaty contains important new provisions that will strengthen the EU&rsquo;s ability to fight cross-border crime, illegal immigration, trafficking of people, arms and drugs.  These are key matters to us all as citizens of Europe, no matter <Col N="494"/>where we live.  As a Border representative, I believe this to be especially the case.  As our legal system differs from those of most of our European partners, we will apply an opt-in, opt-out procedure that will enable Ireland to join in new arrangements case by case.  The Government attached a strong declaration to the reform treaty making it clear that Ireland intended to join its European partners wherever possible, that we intend to participate in full with police co-operative measures and that we will apply all measures aimed at the freezing of terrorists&rsquo; assets.  That situation will be reviewed in three years&rsquo; time.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If we look at Ireland&rsquo;s record regarding criminal assets it is clear that we have been at the forefront of attempts to deal with terrorism.  We have not merely looked and thought, we have acted and reacted.  We have discovered that we cannot do this alone.  To those in other political parties who call themselves &ldquo;Ourselves Alone&rdquo; I would say that Europe has been good for us and we must value our international links while remaining Irish and maintaining an Irish identity.  If we vote for this treaty we will retain the respect of Europe.  I do not say that in a patronising way.  Wherever one goes abroad one finds that people recognise that Ireland has always punched above its weight because it has an ability to work with other countries and maximise results for itself.</P>
        <P>People who have isolationist views and who propound things that are not in this treaty are not being fair.  In the next few weeks as we approach the treaty referendum and the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, I trust there will be honesty regarding what the treaty is about and there will be a fair chance for the people to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; again to further improvements in how EU member states will work together for the benefit of all the people of Europe.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House I wish to share my time with Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen in proportions to be very strongly weighted in my favour.</P>
        <P>I listened to what Senator Keaveney said and I agree with some of it.  The historical points she addressed are absolutely correct.  On the whole, Europe has been good for Ireland and if gratitude exists in politics, let us be grateful to it for what it has done for us.  Much of the Structural Funding went in our favour.  We were net receivers of money and donations for a very long time and many people will say that contributed to the Irish boom.</P>
        <P>I am not decided concerning the Lisbon treaty.  One of the things Senator Keaveney said was indicative of some of the attitudes to Europe and the treaty in this country, namely, that all political parties in this House, bar one, were in favour.  She stated that this was a good thing but I am not sure that is necessarily the case.  When we think of Europe we tend to lose our critical faculties.  It appears to be an irresistible train which we must board because jumping off it or even aside from it, criticising it or being different, is something we fear.</P>
        <P>The safe choice is to vote for Lisbon, to go the way of all the political parties, bar Sinn F&eacute;in, and support it.  The correct choice is to know what is in the treaty, to criticise it and then to make a decision on balance.  The reality is there is not a sinner in the country who knows what is in the Lisbon treaty.  I must confess that I have not read it all.  I was rather struck by something that Ulick McEvaddy, a businessman who has come out against the treaty, said.  He read the text on the way between Singapore and Australia and when he got to Australia he was irate because he believed he had only got the draft.  He telephoned Dublin, asked that the full document be sent and was told that he had it.  He said that what he had could not be the full document because it was almost impossible to understand.</P>
        <P>That lack of understanding of the full document is undoubtedly translated into a lack of understanding of what is in the treaty.  Politicians have played little part in conveying the <Col N="495"/>message of what is in the Lisbon treaty because they do not really know what is in the text.  They do not need to know because every politician, bar a few, is uncritical of Europe.</P>
        <P>I am in the ranks of the undecided because I have reservations about this treaty.  I deeply resent the fact that Ireland is the only country holding a referendum.  I also deeply resent the fact that some European countries and Ministers have taken the view that this is too important an issue to be left to the people.  The former President of France, Val&eacute;ry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, is quoted as saying that the French people cannot be trusted with making a decision on this treaty.  That obviously extends to other countries as well.  Whereas, we may applaud the Government for taking the legal advice to the effect that there should be a referendum here, giving us the choice, the fact we are taking the initiative on our own puts Ireland under a pressure that is not shared by other European governments.  Why will they not put this to a referendum in all the member states of the EU?  The reason is quite simple, or so it appears to me.  It would be defeated, as the polls in many countries show.   What we are actually seeing here is a concerted effort to bypass the individual nations of Europe.  If it was put to the individual nations of Europe, it would not go through.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is a pretty devious type of activity for governments to indulge in.  It is not necessarily unusual because governments are, by definition, devious and do not like the people between elections.  They want to leave as little as possible to the people, unless it is inconvenient for them to make decisions.  The fact that Ireland is the only member state holding a referendum and that other countries have been deliberately denied that privilege makes me suspicious.  I resent the fact that this treaty is being pushed through by stealth because the people who control the European morass have decided it would never get through if there was a popular or democratic vote on it.  That is the problem I have, generally, with Europe and the European model, in that democracy is subsidiary to the administrative machinery which governs it.</P>
        <P>The other issue that is so often taken up is that of tax harmonisation.  We are reassured time and again that the Lisbon treaty will not make any difference to tax harmonisation.  That is true if one reads the small print.  However, there was a good deal of sabre rattling a few months ago by the French and the Germans about tax harmonisation.  They have been very quiet about it in the last few months as this referendum comes up, because they do not want us to take the opportunity to send a message to them that we do not want them tinkering with tax harmonisation.  One can be certain, however, that the moment this is passed the French and the Germans will start rattling those sabres again &mdash; and do not believe those who say it cannot be changed because we have got a veto.  They can hit us in other places, in all sorts of other areas, including agriculture.  If they threaten us in one place or other, while calling for a review of tax harmonisation, we can be put under almost unbearable pressure on that front.</P>
        <P>We should not believe, therefore, that this has gone away or is copperfastened because what the French and the Germans want, the French and the Germans get in Europe.  That is the lesson we should learn.  That is why we do not have the type of economic independence which we might have.  That is why we do not have control over our interest rates.  It might or might not be a good thing &mdash; I have not the time to go into that.  That is why we do not have control over our currencies, because it is the French and the German will that this is the way Europe should be run.</P>
        <P>Let us not be naive and say it will not happen or will not be threatened again.  It will be threatened almost immediately the treaty is passed.  One must be careful, even in the Seanad, to see the type of window dressing that has been going on over this.  We had the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, here the other day.  He was a very good speaker and had a good deal to say, but that was an example of the European machine moving in on the parliaments and doing their public relations.  Nobody on the other side was invited <Col N="496"/>to address the Seanad and say the treaty was wrong.  At the same time EC President Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso was in Dublin Castle and coincidentally paid a visit to the National Forum on Europe, to do his job of pushing the European message.  The balance does not exist.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am worried about this treaty for the reasons given.  I am not saying I shall vote for or against it, since I have not made up my mind yet.  However, I am concerned at the fact that there is a kind of European train going through, supported by all the political parties, criticised by no one, with very few opponents in the media or the Irish establishment, when this is too important an issue not to warrant more scrutiny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time with me.  I find myself in a similar position, with questions and concerns as regards the Lisbon treaty.  I want to stress, however, how important it is that the people of Ireland should engage and give concentrated attention to the decision they have to make on the Lisbon treaty.  We all know how difficult it is, sometimes, to pay attention to referendums such as these, where net issues do not appear to be at stake.  There is much about this treaty that appears to be administrative in essence, and as such perhaps people will tend to throw their hands in the air and not engage  properly with the issues involved.  It is the duty of all of us as citizens to engage as much as possible and try to understand the issues.  Admittedly, there are complexities, but I agree with the view that the treaty can be boiled down to certain recommendations in terms of institutional change, the composition of the Commission, the new President of the European Council and so on. </P>
        <P>Like Senator Ross, I have noticed the tendency of the institutions to row in behind a particular point of view.  Despite telling us that it is the people&rsquo;s decision, there has been a clear imbalance.  I was very glad that Herr P&ouml;ttering was invited to the Seanad, but by the same token I should have liked, perhaps, if similar respect had been shown to those with a different viewpoint.  That has not happened and I have been wrestling with the question as to at what stage it is desirable that institutions such as the European Commission should weigh in on one side or other of an argument.  I accept the point, however, that there is such a thing as representative democracy.</P>
        <P>While I know some are concerned at the fact that Ireland is the only member state to hold a referendum on the treaty, and empathise to some extent, I understand that ultimately, people elect their public representatives.  If they do not like the direction in which public representatives are taking them, in terms of increased integration or the move towards a more federalised Europe &mdash; let us be honest, that is what is on the cards &mdash; ultimately, people in each of the member states have a choice in terms of deciding whether they are satisfied when they elect their own governments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree that certain issues should be kept separate from the Lisbon treaty.  Politicians on the Government side have been at great pains to emphasise that some of the more unwelcome interventions from European bodies have nothing to do with the treaty &mdash; such as the one we discussed this morning on the report from the Council of Ministers calling into question Irish legislation on abortion.  I accept a protocol was introduced into the Maastricht treaty which has been extended to this treaty and which in theory at least should preserve for Ireland the right to determine all its own issues regarding abortion and specifically regarding Article 40.3.3&deg; of the Constitution.  That said, I am not entirely happy and would welcome clarification about the Government&rsquo;s assurances on the Charter of Fundamental Rights included with the Lisbon treaty.  We are told this will relate to only existing areas of EU competence or the implementation within member states of areas covered by existing European law.  While that sounds fine in principle, people as eminent as Professor Gerard Hogan SC of Trinity College Dublin are concerned that this charter could eclipse the Supreme Court in its deliberations on sensitive <Col N="497"/>social issues.  If my memory is correct, he has also pointed out that there are areas covered by this charter, such as the right to marry etc., which in principle should not be covered by European law.</P>
        <P>The concern would be that areas we believe not to be covered by European law could turn out to be covered by such law.  A good example is the intervention by Commissioner Vladim&iacute;r Spidla over section 37 of our employment equality legislation concerning the right of institutes run by religious to discriminate positively in order to preserve their ethos.  At one level we would have thought that education was an area in which the member states had sovereignty and not an area for intervention by the European Union.  However, it comes in under the heading of employment equality.  Sometimes the areas we believe to be outside the purview of European institutions come rapidly within.</P>
        <P>I do not know how the referendum will go.  The opinion polls suggest it could be tight and possibly defeated, such is the momentum against it.  It is up to our politicians, particularly those in Government, to tell us the implications of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  Is there a plan B?  Will there be the possibility of renegotiating?  Will there be the possibility that Ireland could seek greater opt-outs, for example regarding Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution, of the kind we have with the protocol on abortion that would allow us to ensure sensitive social issues remain maters for us to decide?  However we decide them may not agree with my preferences, but they should remain matters for Ireland to decide.  That margin of appreciation should continue to be respected at European level in a way that is not happening lately with other European institutions, such as the Council of Ministers and the European Commission as evidenced by the intervention on the employment equality legislation I mentioned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Much comment has been made about the factors that may lead to a substantial &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the referendum that this Bill seeks to bring into being.  There has been demonisation of those campaigning on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side in a referendum, which has been unhelpful.  Aside from a distaste for politics, one of the biggest factors that brings about a strong &ldquo;No&rdquo; feeling in the country is an attitude of being talked down to and lectured.  There has been a process in several referenda concerning the European Union of the phenomenon I would call the unquestioning &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  We need to be open at all times to have an honest debate about our existence in the European Union, the value of the Union and where it is likely to go as a result of the changes proposed in the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>For the most part everybody can say membership of the European Union has been positive for this country.  The potential for further development in the relationship and what the country can get from our membership of the European Union remains large and should be striven for.  Unfortunately a debate with the kind of name-calling and demonisation we have seen in the past creates an unnecessary group of people who are opposed to the very idea of the European Union itself.  We need to move away from that if we are interested in advancing some of the stronger principles of the European Union and impressing the value of the European Union on our citizens.</P>
        <P>I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in all previous referenda.  While I was only ten years of age in 1972, I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; on referenda from the one on the Single European Act onwards.  I did so because while I continue to recognise the value of the European Union and the European Community that preceded it, I was concerned at the direction it has been taking in terms of distance from the <Col N="498"/>citizen and not being an institution with which ordinary people could identify.  I believe I would have supported the constitutional treaty, a matter to which I will return shortly.  I support the Lisbon treaty because it is the first instance I have witnessed in that series of referenda in which the move towards the centre and towards an elite has turned back towards national sovereignty, national parliaments and the individual citizen.  It does not go far enough.  It does not bring about a fully democratic open and inclusive European Union.  However, at least it goes in a direction that previous treaties have not.  The main reason to support the treaty is to try to work from within, bringing about a more open and democratic European Union.</P>
        <P>As someone promoting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote, I believe we should get out to the people who should participate in the referendum.  The participation in referenda on European Union issues has oscillated all over the place.  The turnout for the first referendum on the Nice treaty was 35%.  While it increased significantly it was still a low enough poll by the time of the second referendum on the Nice treaty.  We should encourage more than half of the electorate to participate.  The primary challenge will be to get people to vote in the referendum and then to inform the voters to ensure they vote in an informed way.  Those of us on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side have a further challenge in trying to ensure there is a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>I sense from many of the people with whom I have shared &ldquo;No&rdquo; platforms in previous campaigns something I would describe as a degree of paranoia.  I do not believe in the idea of a monolith, a clique or people who sit in dungeon-like rooms in a mythical castle in Brussels ordaining that there will be a Europe to fit their vision.  I recognise that within the European Union there is a diversity of opinion.  I accept the French and Germans would like to have a co-ordinated approach to taxation.  Under existing legal mechanisms they cannot get their way.  I do not like eating snails or sauerkraut.  They will not make me change my opinion on that and the treaty does not allow them to do that kind of thing.  The idea that there exists an organisation to which we have already given powers that can force us to change elements of our national decision making and sovereignty is a myth that needs to be challenged.  It is based on opinion of Ireland as a nation that lacks self-confidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should really say that our participation in international organisations and in particular the EU is based on the fact that not only are we getting something from it, but we are getting something from it because we are contributing significantly to it.  We will be a net contributor of funds from now onwards.  However, our contribution in terms of the people we send to the European Parliament, the people who have represented us as Commissioners, our representation on the various secretariats of both the European Council and the Commission shows this is a country that has punched above its weight.  We have been able to do so because we have acted as an honest arbiter in ongoing discussions on many issues at the heart of the European Union, including the questions of whether we are moving towards federation, whether there should be a military component and whether we could possibly have a co-ordinated foreign policy approach.</P>
        <P>On the last area, I believe it is possible.  However, ultimately no matter how advanced or entrenched the systems of the European Union become it will still be a decision-making body where national interests predominate and decisions will be informed because of that.  Two examples inform my opinion on having a common foreign policy.  I recall the reaction of member states&rsquo; governments at the time of the Iraq war.  Some chose to support it, some chose to oppose it and some chose to remain neutral.  There was no common European position and I suspect that if the same set of circumstances occurred in the next ten years we would have exactly the same situation.  Recently an issue has arisen relating to the recognition of Kosovo as a sovereign country.  The Irish Government and other European Union countries have chosen to recognise it but some member states have great difficulty with this.  Greece, Romania <Col N="499"/>and Bulgaria have difficulties with the recognition of Kosovo as a sovereign country and because of this the European Union has not recognised it.</P>
        <P>These are issues at the heart of national interests that should contribute to informed national foreign policies.  I do not share the fears of some people regarding a European army, the role of the European Defence Agency or the role of the still to be appointed foreign policy member of the Commission.  Despite this, we need to be involved because of our foreign policy record and our history as a sovereign nation.  We should never forget that when we try to achieve common foreign policy positions very often they may be informed from a bad perspective.  Many large countries in the European Union were colonists but as we were not so we can inform the debate and apply the brakes when the occasion deems necessary.  We can make ourselves available as the type of honest arbiter we have proven to be in leading the force in Chad at present.  On all these grounds I think we should take a more positive approach to our participation in the European Union.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier that I would have been supportive of the constitutional treaty and much has been made of the rejection of it by the French and Dutch electorates.  The constitutional treaty was necessary and will be necessary again because the European Union lacks a single, simple, comprehensible document on how its institutions should be run.  That we have difficulties relating to what people are voting on in this referendum, how it can be understood and the effect of the changes is due to our having a referendum on yet another amending treaty.  We must return to a final document that all member states and citizens of the European Union can understand.  When that time comes I would prefer that the document be approved by the people of all European Union member states.  The constitutional means for ratifying treaties are different in every country.  We may come to a time when we finalise the documents that lie at the heart of the European Union and this will ultimately show that the step we are taking through the Lisbon treaty towards greater democracy, when previous treaties went in the opposite direction, has paid off for the citizens of Europe.</P>
        <P>My party leader was a representative on the constitutional body that met to put together that treaty, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, and he suggested that we should have a referendum of all the people of Europe that would be valid only if also approved by a majority of member states.  There are other mechanisms that could involve the people of Europe that are not being used today, but I believe the Lisbon reform treaty is an important step towards helping us get there.  It is important that we put this referendum to the people, encourage them to adopt an appropriate response and do so in a frame of mind that does not demonise, is not selective with information and allows an informed debate in this country that results in a decision that best serves our interests and those of the European Union.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Lisbon treaty involves a set of organisational and administrative changes that will properly organise a Europe of 500 million people and 27 member states.  The directional shift in the treaty is towards greater democracy, greater participation by individuals, greater participation by member states and greater participation by national parliaments.  The individual is put centre stage by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has 54 articles that set out the rights of the individual in a range of areas.  This is a very reassuring document and I am disappointed by people who are not aware of its merits.</P>
        <P>National parliaments will have an enhanced role through the treaty and will be given advance notice of legislative proposals.  The Seanad will have one of 54 votes as a house of a national parliament and if 18 votes from either upper or lower houses of national parliaments are cast in a particular direction legislation must be reviewed.  In matters of criminal law 13 votes can effect a review of legislation.  This is called the yellow card system.  At present the Seanad has <Col N="500"/>no legislative safeguard relating to blocking European legislation but this system will change that.  This is a significant alteration of our current status.</P>
        <P>The European Parliament will be strengthened and will have a greater say in budgetary affairs, which is a welcome further democratisation of Europe.  This treaty will bring about administrative change to cope with greater numbers and democratisation to shift power to the regions and to the people.  I contend that this treaty represents an advance in these areas and I congratulate Senator Boyle on identifying this.</P>
        <P>A number of misconceptions exist regarding the effects the Lisbon treaty will allegedly have on this country.  In the area of tax harmonisation we will retain our veto and unanimity must prevail in this respect.  It is disingenuous of my distinguished and erudite colleague, Senator Ross, to suggest the French and Germans will start talking about tax harmonisation when the Lisbon treaty has passed.  Of course they will; that is the nature of politics.  Irrespective of whether we pass the Lisbon treaty, some elements in Europe will favour tax harmonisation.  We know how much Irish national interests depend on not conceding to tax harmonisation and, consequently, we will not concede to it.  Our position on tax harmonisation will not change and it is a non-issue in the context of the treaty.  As of today, some people in Europe want tax harmonisation; we do not.  The day after the passage of the Lisbon treaty the same situation will prevail.</P>
        <P>Misconceptions and dangerous distortions also apply to the issue of abortion because there is a protocol in the Maastricht treaty that specifically accepts Irish legislation on abortion, which prevents abortion in any case, except where the life of the mother is in danger, including suicide.  It is untrue, a misconception and a distortion to say the abortion issue applies to the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>The issue of neutrality is a bit like the issue of tax harmonisation.  We are neutral today, we are against militarisation and will remain so after the Lisbon treaty is passed.  Politics will, naturally, go on and some elements on mainland Europe would like us to give up our neutral status and join military alliances.  Some people on mainland Europe want abortion and tax harmonisation.  Those people will still be there after the Lisbon treaty is passed but these issues do not relate to the treaty itself.  The Lisbon treaty is about administrative change, the democratisation of Europe and making Europe manageable in the context of its current large population.</P>
        <P>We should not lose sight of what Europe means for the future, in practical terms.  There is a wonderful parable in the gospels about the curing of a group of lepers and only one returns to say, &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;.  This should warn politicians that we should not rely too much on the gravy train Europe has been for this country in the past.</P>
        <P>Those mean enough to want to forget everything that has been achieved through Europe should consider the future.  Our future within the EU involves giving us a market of 500 million people for our goods and services, an opportunity we cannot ignore.  As an island country wanting to trade, progress our services, and use the expertise of our brilliant graduates and universities, Europe is the place to play.  The way to enhance our credibility in Europe is to go with the Lisbon treaty and be proactive supporters of the European ideal.</P>
        <P>Rather than considering our future involvement in Europe as a slavish mentality of subjugation, I believe Ireland has a national self-confidence on the European stage, taking part in the institutions and flying the Irish flag.  I am proud to be part of the Irish delegation, of which Senator Terry Leyden also is a distinguished member, in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  We are well fit as a delegation to put forward our views to amend documents and put across the Irish perspective.  Our MEPs are similarly equipped in the European <Col N="501"/>Parliament.  We have had Commissioners second to none.  Our Governments and Civil Service have been second to none on the European level.  We are well fit to stand up there with the best.</P>
        <P>Without giving away secrets, I was born in the mid-1950s and come from a generation that knows of an Ireland before and after EU membership.  I remember an Ireland before EEC membership where women had to give up their State jobs when they got married and there was not equal pay for equal work.  I remember growing up in an Ireland with limited and backward infrastructure and subsistence levels of income in farming which depended on one market in Britain.</P>
        <P>I also remember a changing Ireland after EEC entry when our infrastructure and third level colleges and institutes were greatly improved.  New social legislation and directives that opened up the windows of this country were introduced.  We got a larger market for our goods and a confidence as an economy.  Those are the two contrasting Irelands which I have known.</P>
        <P>There is nothing sinister in the treaty.  We are well fit to play on the European stage.  Our social, economic and other advantages lie in the European project.  There is no place to be other than in Europe.  To go outside of a wholesome participation in Europe would be regressive.</P>
        <P>Some argue the treaty can be re-negotiated.  That is not the way to progress the European project when there is nothing sinister in the treaty.  We must knock down the myths about the treaty.  Europe has been good for Ireland.  We are well fit to make Europe better in the future.  We can sell our goods and services to a market of 500 million people.  While it may not be politically correct to say so, it is regrettable there has been so much debate around the treaty.  None the less, it is a worthwhile exercise.  I am so convinced that it must be a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on 12 June that I find it difficult to grapple with the alternative.  Ireland has a young and vibrant population which needs its future to be centre stage in the world.  We must vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for the treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, on the useful meetings he is holding throughout the country on his drugs strategy.  It allows people to have an involvement in the most serious social issue of our day.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly for his compliments on working together in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, of which he is a distinguished member.  Senator Ann Ormonde is also well regarded in her work there and has made a major impact in it.  It is a useful forum for Irish parliamentarians, as is the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>We are facing an important decision on 12 June.  We all have a tremendous involvement in the Lisbon reform treaty.  It is a monumental decision for the Irish people.  Each citizen has an individual decision to make.  It is a credit to the authors of our Constitution, especially Eamon de Valera, to foresee that Ireland would join international bodies in the future but that the people should decide.  The Irish electorate will decide on the future development of the EU for 500 million people.  It is an enormous responsibility.  Ireland is the only country out of 27 member states that will have a referendum on the Lisbon reform treaty.  The Minister of State will know from his visits to Europe that the one question that always comes up is whether the referendum will be passed.</P>
        <P>One of the most important provisions of the treaty is the recognition of the EU as a single legal personality, requiring the EU&rsquo;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The convention has stood the test of time as a comprehensive yet practical protection of human rights.  While it has high aspirations and protects fundamental rights, it is not simply a declaration.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P>The establishment of a court to protect individuals from human rights violations is unique among international conventions on human rights as it gives the individual an active role in the international arena.  Ms Ann Power has recently been appointed as the Irish judge to the European Court of Human Rights by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  I wish her every success in her role.</P>
        <P>The effectiveness of the convention is evidenced by the improvements in member states&rsquo; domestic legislation and judicial decisions which have directly resulted from decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.  The accession of the EU to the convention will mean the institutions of the EU, when making and implementing EU law, will be subject to the same judicial control in respect of human rights as the individual state parties to the convention.  An individual EU citizen will be able to make a complaint to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg against the EU.  Citizens will of course retain the right to make a complaint against their own state.</P>
        <P>Despite the efforts of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote campaigners, it has been conclusively established that the proposed treaty poses no threat to our sovereignty in many important areas, including taxation.  This was confirmed in this House by Mr. Hans-Gert P&ouml;ttering, MEP, President of the European Parliament, and by Mr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Vague claims such as a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote will protect workers add nothing to people&rsquo;s understanding of the treaty.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s claim that the treaty erodes Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality is nonsense.  It is a simple fact that our Constitution prohibits participation in any common defence.  The treaty does not change that; it maintains the member state veto on defence matters.  However, it adds to the debate that a national political party such as Sinn F&eacute;in is participating in the democratic process and putting forward ideas to debate this issue, which I welcome.  If everyone were singing from the same hymn sheet there would be no real debate.  Therefore, I commend a political party that decides on a particular course of action.  That party will then put its case to the electorate on 12 June and the electorate will have the final say.</P>
        <P>This is not a party political issue, rather it is an individual issue.  Political parties will have made up their minds and the majority of them have gone in the same direction.  Ultimately, the treaty is an individual contract between each voter and the European Union.  I believe that, on reflection, the people will decide the European Union is worth supporting on this occasion.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, claims by groups such as Libertas that the Lisbon treaty would create a serious democratic deficit are simply untrue.  For example, any analysis of the treaty will rapidly conclude the claim by Libertas that the treaty would make national parliaments subordinate to the Union is quite simply nonsense.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  The treaty gives national parliaments more power in European matters.  All draft legislation must go directly to national parliaments giving them more time to consider Commission proposals.  National parliaments will have a so-called yellow card procedure giving them the right to request a review of draft legislative Acts.  Parliaments will also have a right of veto in certain matters for the first time.  The reform treaty will bring national parliaments directly into the European Union decision-making process.</P>
        <P>This House will have an enhanced role because of the Government decision to propose this treaty and I commend the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, made it clear in statements in recent days that the D&aacute;il and Seanad will have the role of examining European legislation as it is published, which means that for the first time we will have a say in European legislation.  This is of great benefit to individual citizens and of vital interest to this House.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>The main implications of the treaty have been discussed often but particularly in light of recent polls indicating a low level of knowledge of the treaty, there is nothing to be lost by again summarising the treaty.  The implications would be as follows: a new voting system in the Council of Ministers to make decision making more effective; a greater role for national parliaments in the Union&rsquo;s activities; a rotating system of membership of the European Commission; a full-time president of the European Council to co-ordinate and chair European Union summit meetings and appointed for a term of two and a half years; a high representative for foreign affairs and security policy who will bring greater coherence to the Union&rsquo;s approach to foreign policy; and the Charter of Fundamental Rights is given legally binding status, which I outlined at the start of my speech.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More specifically on the Bill before the House, which represents the seventh proposed constitutional amendment on European integration, it is worth noting that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in European referendums has been consistently higher in referendums with higher turnouts.  The disappointingly low turnout of 38.4% in the first Nice treaty referendum meant that we were almost obliged to put the issue to the people again.  That treaty was decisively endorsed by a more representative portion of the electorate in the second referendum.  However, in the case of the Lisbon treaty, it is either passed or rejected.  I do not believe it is possible to have a second bite at this cherry.  The other 26 member states have agreed to the reform treaty.  If we decide to reject it, the treaty cannot be amended to satisfy objections we might have and the reform treaty would fall.</P>
        <P>As soon as this Bill is passed and the text of the amendments finalised the referendum campaign can begin in earnest.  The most important objective to be achieved is a high turnout and I hope all sides in the debate will encourage people to vote on 12 June.  The sign of a true democracy is participation by the people and if the treaty is endorsed, as I hope it will be, I expect that will be in a referendum with a turnout which can be said to be a fair representation of a well-informed Irish electorate.  Contrary to some assertions, hard copies of the text of the treaty are available to the public throughout the country in all public libraries and on many authoritative websites, and information on the treaty is freely available.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment to the Constitution is quite straightforward and is in line with previous amendments which have facilitated our participation in European integration.  There is a clear prohibition on Irish participation in an EU common defence in the proposed subsection 15.  The proposed subsection 11 is modelled on the existing subsection 10, which has been in place for many years and ensures compatibility between the Constitution and the EU.  It is important to note that this applies only to laws, acts, and measures &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations&rdquo; of European Union membership.  It is nonsense to claim the treaty will have unlimited supremacy over our Constitution.  Subsections 12 to 14 allow for the opt-outs secured by Ireland in the treaty negotiations.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the acceptance of this Bill by the Oireachtas and to the ongoing and developing debate on the Lisbon treaty.  It is time for Ireland to take on a role we have held previously with respect and distinction, namely, leaders in Europe.  I commend the Bill to the House and the treaty to the people of Ireland.  It is far better for Ireland to be inside looking out than outside looking in and to be there to have a say in the future of Europe.  It is imperative for the future progress of this country and I will say as much to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  What control would we have over the European Commission if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June?  The answer is &ldquo;Very little&rdquo;; our influence will have waned.  I make this appeal not in the interests of any political party, not on behalf of the Government, but on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="504"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the majority of people on this island I believe that Ireland&rsquo;s place is in Europe.  Many benefits have come as a result of our membership of the European Union.  Continued co-operation with our European partners is essential if we are to meet the challenges facing us in the future.  It is certain that regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Ireland&rsquo;s place in the European Union will be secure.</P>
        <P>It is now just more than six weeks to the day of the referendum and only 5% of the Irish electorate say they understand the Lisbon treaty.  This speaks volumes about the Government&rsquo;s handling of the referendum.  Let us examine the debate which has taken place in the Oireachtas.  It has dragged on for weeks, squeezed in before and after other legislation, and with no real focus.  It is not an overstatement to suggest that the majority of people are as unaware of the debate inside this Chamber as they are of the treaty itself.</P>
        <P>People need information if they are to make an informed choice.  I accept the treaty is technical and unwieldy, but a bigger problem is that the majority of citizens will not even have seen the treaty, never mind read it, before polling day.  The Government is taking the electorate for fools and it is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>When one pares it back, the biggest reason to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this treaty is that it gives the EU too much power.  We are giving up too much and getting far too little in return.  How could it be in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to lose our automatic right to a Commissioner, to cut our voting strength on the Council by half, to hand over power to unelected officials and to change the future direction of the European Union without recourse to a new treaty or referenda?  The Irish negotiators failed to stand up for Ireland&rsquo;s interests.  However, we can secure a better deal if we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the serious implications for rural Ireland if this treaty is passed.  It is not an over-statement to say that rural Ireland is suffering a death by a thousand cuts and while the key responsibility for this lies with the Government, the decisions of unelected EU leaders are also having a major impact.  Let us examine what has happened in recent years.  EU policy has led to the closure of the sugar beet industry.  The EU is also actively undermining the provision of vital services to rural communities, including post offices.</P>
        <P>EU policy has become synonymous with red tape and bureaucracy, due to which rural Ireland is suffering.  The farming community and rural Ireland are significantly concerned by the World Trade Organisation negotiations.  There is considerable resentment at the approach of Commissioner Peter Mandelson.  It is part of a pattern that emerged under his predecessors, Mr. Pascal Lamy and Sir Leon Brittan, and that will continue after he has gone.  This agenda promotes free trade aggressively irrespective of the cost to family farms in rural communities or the world&rsquo;s poorest countries.</P>
        <P>How will the Lisbon treaty affect this issue?  Its passing will strengthen Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s hand.  Article 2 gives the EU exclusive competence over commercial policy, including the negotiation of international trade agreements.  Article 188 gives the Commission power to initiate and conclude negotiations, including international trade agreements, and transfers the final decisions on such agreements from the unanimity principle to qualified majority voting at the Council of Ministers, thus ending the State&rsquo;s veto.  It is a critical matter, as the ability of future Governments to protect farming will be removed.  Article 10A mandates &ldquo;the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade&rdquo; to be one of the EUs guiding principles in its interaction with non-EU states.  Restrictions would include agricultural subsidies, preferential treatment for developing world companies in government procurement contracts or environmental and worker protections.</P>
        <P>Last week, the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, spoke at the National Forum on Europe and called on the Government to use its veto at the Council if the outcome of the WTO trade <Col N="505"/>talks was bad for Irish farming.  What he did not tell farmers is that if the Lisbon treaty is passed, the veto will be gone.  In future rounds of WTO talks, farmers will ask why Fine Gael urged them to support a treaty that was clearly not in their interests.  To make matters worse, Ireland will lose a Commissioner for five years out of every 15 years under the terms of the treaty.  When critical matters are being discussed, such as international trade agreements or reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, Ireland may not have a voice at the Commission table.  Attempts by the Government and Opposition parties to tell us that the loss of a permanent Commissioner will not make any difference do not wash.  Imagine the outcry if the Government told the people of County Donegal that they would have no Deputies for the next five years but that the other counties in the region would look after their interests.  It would not be acceptable in that case and should not be acceptable in this instance.</P>
        <P>Government claims that it is not practical or efficient to have 27 Commissioners is a nonsense.  There are 15 Ministers and 20 Ministers of State for a population of fewer than 5 million people.  It seems more than credible and necessary to have 27 Commissioners to represent more than 500 million people.  The Government does not want people to know that Ireland&rsquo;s voting strength on the Council of Ministers will be reduced by 50%.  In comparison, Germany, France, Britain and Italy will each nearly double their voting strengths.</P>
        <P>Weighing up the increased centralisation of powers, the self-amending articles, the loss of influence of smaller member states and the weak measures offered to member state parliaments and citizens, there is no doubt that the Lisbon treaty is a bad deal for Irish and EU democracy.  If ratified, it will deepen the democratic deficit.  The treaty should be rejected and negotiators sent back to do a better deal for Ireland and the EU.</P>
        <P>Significant challenges lie ahead, but we must face them as full members of the EU.  We must secure a better deal for Ireland.  I urge Senators and the people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum on 12 June.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, to the Chamber during this important debate on the EU reform treaty or, as it is commonly know, the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">As the world&rsquo;s largest trading bloc, the EU is crucial to Ireland&rsquo;s future economic and trading strategy.  Irish trade in merchandise with the EU-25 in the year ending December 2006 comprised exports to the value of approximately &euro;56.6 billion and imports to the value of &euro;36.1 billion.  Companies supported by the State in the form of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht, which comprises the most peripheral areas of Ireland &mdash; west County Mayo, west County Galway, west and south-west County Donegal and parts of County Cork, west County Kerry, County Waterford and the Ring Gaeltacht in County Meath &mdash; created trade or merchandise valued at &euro;700 million in 2007, of which &euro;350 million was exported.  The majority of those companies are small.  These figures reflect the considerable benefit of the EU as a market of 500 million people, as the majority of the exports were to other EU member states.  Service exports to the EU amount to a further &euro;30 billion per annum, representing 63.9% of our merchandise export market.  Some 59.7% of imports come from within the EU.</P>
        <P>Our membership of the EU has coincided with strong Irish economic growth and convergence of <i>per capita</i> income levels with some of the best regions in the EU.  GDP <i>per capita</i> has increased from 58.8% of the EU average in 1973 to almost 125% of the EU average in 2006.  The Union is important to the development of business in Ireland.  Many business groupings around Europe are making queries about how the referendum campaign is going.  The primary reason these queries are being made worldwide, but particularly in Europe, is that individual companies and groupings know the EU must engage more effectively if their opportunities for <Col N="506"/>business expansion within the Union are to be developed.  After 50 years, the EU must modernise and change if its business is to be carried out in a more effective manner.  It must reform so that we can face the new realities, namely, EU member states are not the only countries in the world seeking to secure higher levels of inward investment.  It must be generated from within.  We live in a globalised world where we compete for new business against other trading blocs, including India, China, Brazil and emerging markets in Asia.  Europe cannot stand still.  We must raise our game, which is the purpose of the treaty.  We must engage positively and proactively with it.</P>
        <P>Anyone who opposes the treaty on the grounds that it is the wrong way forward for the European economy is putting a case that lacks credibility.  During the referendum campaign, those opposing the treaty, including Sinn F&eacute;in and Libertas, a business liberal think tank, have sought to put forward obscure political and economic arguments to justify their case.  They tell people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because it is the right way forward for the European economy, Article 48 is a self-amending provision and the EU will have more power over finalising common commercial agreements with third countries.  Their arguments are always couched in the negative.  Nothing has changed in this respect since 1973 when they opposed Ireland&rsquo;s entry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The choice for the Irish electorate is either believe these obscure and technical arguments or look to the list of proven economic successes that the EU has brought to its citizens.  Europe may have started as a common market but the Single European Act brought about the Single Market, in which 82% of the Irish people now have full confidence.  The Maastricht treaty gave the green light for the euro, thereby bringing many practical benefits to consumers and businesses alike.  Not only have exchange rate transfers been eliminated but the euro is a significant source of stability for the European economy during the current rocky period.  Members will recall the currency speculation that took place in 1992 which resulted in currency devaluations across Europe, a hike in interest rates and serious economic difficulties for member states and individuals.  In the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage collapse in America, the European Union would once again be facing the bleak scenario of 1992 if it had remained a community of 27 different currencies.</P>
        <P>EU competition policy is pro-business and it helps the European economy to grow and prosper.  Through the European Social Fund, the EU is a major contributor to the training of youth and long-term unemployed in Europe.  EU regional and cohesion funds have helped to rebuild the infrastructures of the poorer economies of Europe to help them participate effectively within the Single Market and the eurozone.  Those who oppose this treaty on economic grounds are putting forward flimsy arguments to back up their cases.  They fail to recognise the stability and success that the EU has brought to the economies of all member states.  It is as if the Single Market and the euro are apparitions or optical illusions. The EU needs new structures in order to address global challenges such as climate change, security of energy supplies, organised and cross-border crime and multilateral trade agreements.</P>
        <P>The reform treaty has nothing to do with the consolidated tax base.  The EU cannot set tax rates without the unanimous agreement of all member states.  A study of the practicalities of introducing common corporate taxes in Europe conducted by the European Centre for Economic Studies on behalf of the German Ministry of Finance concluded that common corporate taxes were unworkable, politically undesirable and too simplistic for the EU with its 27 member states operating 27 different tax models.</P>
        <P>This treaty is not only about the present generation, it is about the future.  The intention behind the establishment of the EEC was to bring peace and harmony to Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War.  This has been a success in that member states can engage with each other in a peaceful and democratic way.  We have seen that first hand in the North, where <Col N="507"/>the European Union has played a significant role in bringing peace in our time.  The Taoiseach also played a major part in that regard.  The electorate needs to recognise the &euro;58 billion which has come from Europe since 1973, as well as the funds that have transformed the Border regions from which Senator Wilson, Senator Doherty and I come.  I am daily reminded of the benefits of the EU for Border regions.  The Irish people will not forget that.  We will be voting for the people of the North as well as for the Republic.  It is time we tell the Irish people we want to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; because we want to be major players in Europe and to protect future generations in the decisions we make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of this debate on the Lisbon treaty, I have no difficulty with people raising profound issues on where Europe is going, the policies it takes in respect of world trade and the impact it has on different sectors of our economy and society.  I do not criticise Senator Doherty or anybody else for raising such issues in this debate because we are thereby afforded an opportunity to consider the treaty and related issues.  However, I have a difficulty with the attempts being made by Senator Doherty and others to visit at the door of this treaty all the concerns and objections people have about what is happening in Europe.  That is a fundamentally dishonest approach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For example, the need to rebalance world trade should be debated politically in Europe.  Senator Doherty, Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties, irrespective of who they are, have a responsibility to engage in debate.  However, to suggest that the provisions of the Lisbon treaty somehow privilege the position of Commissioner Mandelson, who seems to be the new bogey man for opponents of the Lisbon treaty, is fundamentally dishonest.  The Lisbon treaty does nothing of the kind.  I may be one of the few people who actually read the treaty, perhaps because I lead a nerd-like existence.  Nothing in the treaty supports for a moment what Senator Doherty is arguing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned the three articles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the legitimate point he makes in respect of the need to have a debate about trade but it is inaccurate and dishonest to visit the issue at the door of the Lisbon treaty.  I do not mean to personally attack the Senator because he has the right to raise these issues and I respect people who have different points of view on this debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Senator suggested that the Government is taking people for granted but, while the Minister of State will answer for himself, I do not take anybody for granted.  Anyone with an interest in the issues could find parts of this treaty that he or she does not like.  However, anyone who believes in the social market, which I believe Sinn F&eacute;in does, would come down on the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side in an objective judgment of its achievements compared to the negatives.  I say that without demur or qualification.  Anybody can list the negatives but it behoves us to acknowledge the gains made in this treaty.  Senator Doherty failed to mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly made a useful point in that regard.  The notion that it is us against this big monolithic Europe, that we are losing something or being diminished by this process is the sort of thinking, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, that is more associated with the past about which he spoke than the present.  Robust, self-confident political parties, whether it is the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in, and Sinn F&eacute;in has representatives in the European Parliament, can get in and work with other people for a social Europe.</P>
        <P>The notion that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are undifferentiated is wrong.  We had an interesting debate yesterday and this morning about agency workers.  I take a different view from that of IBEC in regard to agency workers.  The &ldquo;we&rdquo; of Ireland, if I can call it that, is not an undifferentiated thing.  There are different interests internally in this jurisdiction and I would want to fight for much better protection for agency workers and employees throughout Europe.  It is <Col N="508"/>clear that an opportunity is available for us as politicians, and those of us who want to promote a social Europe, to fight for that at the heart of Europe rather than saying the only way we can deliver this is by voting down the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most fallacious notion I heard was that we can secure a better deal and that we send back our negotiators to do that.  If we are asking people not to take people for granted and to be honest with the Irish electorate, is there any reality to the suggestion that we can vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Lisbon treaty and send the negotiators back to get what is called a better deal?  That will not occur.  There will not be such an opportunity.  The opportunity to negotiate a deal has been taken.  I am not saying it is the best possible deal that has been obtained but it contains a sufficient amount that we can support.</P>
        <P>Regarding some of the proposals on the move from unanimity to majority voting, which relates to the point I made earlier, we should not take it for granted that majority voting is by definition against our interests.  There is a presumption in the debate that if something is moved from unanimity to majority voting we must lose out.  That is not the case.  We can look to secure our interests in common with other countries to press for decisions to be made which other countries are against.  We can sometimes be in the majority of that majority voting, and very often are, a point made by both Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and Senator Boyle.  It is about having the self-confidence to negotiate, do battle and win.</P>
        <P>I must refer to what is almost a little Ireland approach in that if it is out there in Europe, we must resist it and put the brake on because it can only go against us.  Those arguments have been heard repeatedly.  Each time there was a vote, a treaty or a proposed amendment, there were stories that it would lead to a calamity and we would lose out.</P>
        <P>The very principle of what we are doing in terms of pooling sovereignty, and we should remind ourselves of that, is that we make a decision to give up or share sovereignty.  It is not taken from us.  It is not a raid on our sovereignty by this big conglomerate monolithic body.  We make a judgment ourselves that we are prepared, in the interests of achieving things, to pool our sovereignty.  That may not be a particularly exciting point to try to make in the context of the debate, and perhaps there are complexities in it, but people should be honest about what is happening and understand that whereas there are losses and potential downsides, what can be achieved is vastly greater than the risks to us of any loss to our sovereignty.</P>
        <P>On the point made by Senator Ross earlier, I understand his frustration that Ireland is the only country allowing for a referendum on this treaty, which is unfortunate, but it is not a reason for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  In fairness to Senator Ross, he was not specifically advocating a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote but he criticised the fact that Ireland was the only country holding a referendum and it seemed to him, if I understood him correctly, to be an argument against the treaty.  That argument does not hold water.  The fact that we are having a referendum and other countries are not may be a subject for criticism but it is not a reason for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is ludicrous that we would vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; simply because we are the only country being given the opportunity to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty made the point that we will not have a Commissioner sitting at the table for five out of the 15 years after 2014.  He made an unsustainable comparison with representative TDs.  People elect TDs to a sovereign Parliament and they have representative responsibilities under the Constitution but we must understand that the European Union appoints Commissioners in a different constitutional and legal context.  They are not there simply to fly the flag for their country.  That is not what they are appointed to do.  At the risk of offending the Minister or anyone else here, I would have far more confidence in some of the non-Irish Commissioners, and I say this from a political point of view in terms of what I believe in in <Col N="509"/>Europe, and would find myself in a much higher measure of agreement politically with many of them sitting at the table in Brussels than with some of the Irish Commissioners waving the so-called Irish flag there.  It is not a valid comparison in constitutional or legal terms to say that if Donegal or some other county lost a representative TD, it would be the same as losing a Commissioner.  It is a nonsensical comparison.  It is not sustainable.</P>
        <P>My party has done the analysis.  We have tested this against our politics and our priorities and have no hesitation in supporting the Bill on Second Stage and the referendum when it is held.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  He has had a very busy schedule in recent days.  He attended the European scrutiny committee; he was in the Czech Republic; he was in this House; and he is back in this House again.  We also hear him on the airwaves.  The Minister of State is doing a great job in respect of this treaty.</P>
        <P>I have some questions about the Bill, one of which is about the name of the Bill and the language that is used.  The majority of people do not understand what is meant by the Lisbon treaty or the Nice treaty.  Different language should have been used in describing those treaties.  Perhaps it should be called a more power to the parliament treaty, which is what this Bill is about, or the people&rsquo;s treaty because it is about people.  It is not about Lisbon but people do not understand that the treaty was agreed in Lisbon.  Naming it differently might mean more to people in putting forward the treaty.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s contribution he referred to the use of the general <i>passerelle</i> provision in the treaty.  Is that a new word in the dictionary?  Is it a country, a town or the name of a person?  I had never heard the word previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a French word.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>An economic argument cannot be made for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; in this referendum.  That is a non-starter.  This country knows what it has gained from the European Union in the years since we joined.  As the Minister and other speakers have said, this treaty is about the individual within the EU.  We are privileged in this country to have a vote.  Each and every one of us has the same right in ratifying this treaty.</P>
        <P>The treaty is about enlarging the Union from 15 to 27 countries and increasing the population from 250 million to 500 million.  The United States of America has only 250 million or 260 million and this new Europe has 500 million people.  We will need every one of them to have the power and momentum to compete with other nations and continents, such as China, India or other heavily-populated areas that will be a big force in the years ahead.</P>
        <P>We come from a nation of 4 million people.  I recall Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned he remembers his area in a time before EU involvement and after, which I do myself.  We had some very dark days and Europe has been particularly good to this country.  Travelling around Europe one can see the hand of the European Parliament and the European Commission.  There is no way we can vote against this treaty.</P>
        <P>My party is having 34 public meetings around the country and we are campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Like Senator Leyden, I believe it important we have people like Sinn F&eacute;in who will put their case forward so we can get answers to questions.  I am very much in favour of this treaty.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State himself indicated on a number of occasions that this will lead to a very exciting Europe.  Many nations and continents would like what we are going to have.  Our Commission will not be elected but will be appointed by various Governments.  Senator Alex White and I, as members of the EU scrutiny committee, met eight Commissioners recently in <Col N="510"/>Europe.  I could not believe the transparency evident in the European Commission and with each of the Commissioners.  They were very open and frank about what they are doing and so forth.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government and its Departments here were as open and transparent in their work.  If they were, we would not need the Freedom of Information Act to the same level as is currently required.  I would not be at all afraid of placing my full confidence in the European Commission.</P>
        <P>This treaty will give the individual more rights also, as more power is being given to the European Parliament and there will be co-decision making between the Council and Parliament.  There will be an openness in the Commission and there is a veto which can be operated by parliaments.  Even this Parliament, including the Seanad, has a full veto in Europe.  It is a major power to be able to use, indeed it is unbelievable power that this House, comprising 60 Members, will have a veto in Europe.  We do not fully understand the power that we may really have.  I am very excited about the new Europe and how it will go forward after this referendum has been passed.</P>
        <P>We can see ourselves where major projects are taking place around the country which are co-funded by the European Union.  It never seems to get any credit for any of the major funding it provides or for projects that have been put in place.  There should be some mechanism where the European Union takes some credit and representatives should be present at the opening of some of the major projects.</P>
        <P>All too often we criticise Europe.  For example, there was an issue with water rates in schools, for which Europe was blamed.  There was also a turf-cutting regulation for which Europe is being blamed and the cottage industry is also affected.  With red tape, it is all too easy to blame Europe, not giving any credit for matters raised by several Senators, not least equality for women in work and incomes.  Europe and its Commissioners should take more credit for its actions and involvement.</P>
        <P>I am very much in favour of this treaty and do not see any problems with it.  We are in a great position.  As the Minister of State has indicated, it is a revolution within Europe and I am looking forward to a new Europe with more power to our Parliament and people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I was absorbed in my notes and from looking over some of the comments.  I congratulate Senators on what I believe was one of the most calm, focused and best debates I have ever heard in any House on this treaty or any other.  That is in no sense a patronising comment.  If there was ever a reason to retain a good and strong Seanad &Eacute;ireann, it was reflected in the debate.</P>
        <P>I will not have time to mention everybody but I will refer to Senator Burke&rsquo;s contribution.  The word <i>passerelle</i> is the French for a bridge and the word is jargon in this treaty.  There is, unfortunately, much jargon but we have to reflect that this is a Union with 27 different member states and 22 different working languages, including Gaeilge.  We must occasionally genuflect in the direction of other languages.</P>
        <P>The word is used in the treaty to mean when one moves from one position to the other.  I am delighted the Senator raised the matter because in this case it refers to those arrangements where the Union would move from unanimity to qualified majority voting, QMV.  This has been grotesquely misrepresented.</P>
        <P>First and foremost, that would only happen in areas which are strictly circumscribed within the treaty.  It would not happen in the areas that certain persons have suggested.  For example, <Col N="511"/>it will not happen with tax issues, defence or those areas where the treaty specifically subscribes to the protection of unanimity.</P>
        <P>The Senator touched on an important point in the final part of his own contribution.  There can only be a move from one state to another in this treaty, from unanimity to QMV, if every government in the 27 member states agrees, bar none.  The European Council must unanimously agree and the European Parliament must also agree.  It can only happen if none of the 27 member state national parliaments, many of which have two Chambers, disagrees.  In the case of Ireland, it can only happen if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann votes in favour of the change.  Why anybody would pick this word, <i>passerelle,</i> to use as a scare tactic and shadow I do not know.  I am grateful that the Senator raised the issue.</P>
        <P>The contributions earlier today and yesterday were wonderful.  I compliment Senator Alex White on his contribution.  I do not understand, after 35 years of remarkable progress, how it is that people in Ireland conjure shadows about Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Union, for its faults, warts and deficiencies, has given the Continent of Europe the longest period of peace, tranquility and progress in human history, not just recent history.  How is it that any person with a sense of history could consciously destroy that?  I do not understand the thinking.  With regard to the Irish peace process, Europe gave us a space in which our politicians and political leaders North and South on this island could meet and discuss matters along with British counterparts.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White is right when he states the debate should focus on facts.  It is very important we have a debate and it is very healthy for people to take opposite sides.  If we take opposite sides we should do so on the basis of facts.  There is a slogan arguing there are no politics, but facts.  I would subscribe to the slogan if it were sincere.  He also correctly points out that it is inaccurate to state that the arrangements on trade will somehow or other be changed by the Lisbon treaty.  Such statements are false.  The Lisbon treaty will not change the arrangements to which the Irish people signed up in 1973.  The Senator is also correct in that it does not change any of the arrangements to which we have subscribed in the interim.</P>
        <P>The Senator was also correct to point out that qualified majority voting, QMV, is a positive development.  Ireland is the most striking example of the importance of QMV.  The reason is that the Republic exports 80% of everything it produces.  This is the case because in the late 1980s Irish citizens had the good sense to vote in favour of the Single European Act.  Does anyone present recall the referendum relating to that Act?  I do and I remember people arguing that it would be the death knell for Ireland&rsquo;s trade and the final nail in the coffin as regards our neutrality.  It seems that each treaty represents the final nail in that coffin.</P>
        <P>People have a right to take a different view on these matters.  However, I recall &mdash; because of the sense of history I felt at the time &mdash; travelling to the Border on 31 December 1992 and watching it being dismantled.  It was one of those amazing occasions: a crystal clear, frosty night on which a border was being removed.  The latter was happening because the people, contrary to advice they received from those who are again advising them to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, had the courage to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Why does a small country such as Ireland possess one of the most successful economies in the world?  Why is it capable of attracting foreign direct investment?  The answer lies in the fact that we voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and signed up to the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act.  It is also due to the fact, as Senator Alex White stated, that Ireland, even though it is small, is not afraid to fight its cause.  It is not the number of votes one obtains in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty that wins the day, it is the strength of one&rsquo;s convictions and the quality of one&rsquo;s arguments.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>I started out in my working life as a civil servant some 35 years ago.  At that time, I attended my first European meetings and I recall the mystique of it all.  I have lectured in public administration and European affairs for 22 years and I have never come across a single instance &mdash; I challenge people to cite one &mdash; where the big countries conspired to do damage to their smaller counterparts.  Quite the opposite is the case.  If anything, they have been frustrated by the smaller countries fighting their corner.</P>
        <P>The slogan &ldquo;Vote No for a better Yes&rdquo; is just that, a slogan.  More than that, it is a hollow slogan without any truth, focus or reality.  The treaty represents the work of almost ten years.  Some 205 men and women drawn from all of the parliaments, institutions and governments of the European Union spent the better part of two years producing this treaty.  It is the most democratically produced treaty we have ever seen.  I accept that it is complex.  I do not subscribe to the view expressed by one businessman that treaties should be similar to Ladybird books in order that seven year olds might read them.  People would not expect that to be the case in respect of a serious contract and neither should they expect it in a treaty which binds together 27 member states.</P>
        <P>There is no possibility of the small and medium-sized countries negotiating a better deal.  I do not agree with Senator Doherty, who made a fine contribution, but I compliment him on the way in which he put his arguments.  I had the great honour to be part of the Convention on the Future of Europe.  Ireland was well served at the presidium by Mr. John Bruton, by Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, who played a sterling game at the section of the convention that dealt with social Europe, and by Deputies Carey and Gormley, who put in many long hours of work.  I led the group, which was an honour, which was supported by Mr. Bobby McDonagh and various officials.</P>
        <P>Ireland was at the core of a group of small countries called the Friends of the Community Method.  A book was written on this issue and I recommend it to Senator Doherty, who is an open-minded man.  We fought hard to have particular issues dealt with in the treaty and we won great victories.  We won the right to ensure that the treaty refers to equality and that a two-tier Commission would not be created.  The latter was a major victory because the larger states were of the view that they would have permanent commissioners and that their smaller counterparts would be obliged to make do with having junior ministers of some form.  As someone who has served in Cabinet and been a Minister of State, I can say that the more senior position is the one everyone wants to occupy.</P>
        <P>It is disingenuous to suggest that it would be easy to renegotiate the treaty.  As already stated, the treaty was largely the product of the Convention on the Future of Europe.  The biro marks on it are Irish.  More than ever, we had, by good fortune, the opportunity to make a real mark.  We led the Friends of the Community Method, protected the idea of equality in the Commission, we ensured that there was a more coherent voting system put in place and we fought the cause of smaller countries and won.  In the final days, virtually all the amendments put to the Convention on the Future of Europe and carried were penned in Ireland.  Those are the facts; that is the history.  The veracity of said history is capable of being checked.  France and the Netherlands rejected that draft of the treaty and a further intergovernmental conference, IGC, was held.  However, 95% of the material put forward by the Convention on the Future of Europe &mdash; all of it good &mdash; was eventually retained.</P>
        <P>We should not delude ourselves.  It is easy to make a slogan.  Those who put forward the slogan &ldquo;Vote No for a better Yes&rdquo; should indicate what they mean by a &ldquo;better Yes&rdquo;.  This treaty is plan B and there is certainly no plan C.</P><Col N="513"/>
        <P>I am sorry I missed Senator Mullen&rsquo;s contribution.  The Senator referred to two main issues, namely, abortion and the charter.  I understand the sincerity with which he raised the issue of abortion.  I fully respect his views, which are not that far from my own.  Everybody knows that I am strongly pro life.  I accept, however, that the beliefs of others are different to mine.  Under the treaty, we will retain our protocol on abortion and the protection we placed in the Constitution at Article 40.3.3&deg;.  I wish to give credit to someone who is not a Member of the House, namely, Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, who on a number of occasions courageously stated that this matter is not an issue in the debate.</P>
        <P>The charter is not a reason to be fearful.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights, to which the treaty will give effect, was drafted by the convention.  It represents bringing together those values of which everyone in Europe is proud.  I refer for example to the protection of human life, democracy, the rule of law, the rights of individuals and minorities and the right to work.  I cannot understand how anyone could perceive the charter as diminishing our position.  The opposite is the case because under its provisions member states will be protected against the institutions exceeding their mandate.  The charter is an additional statement of rights.  An important point made at congress last year was that the trade union would be obliged to support the treaty if the charter was included.  The latter has happened and the charter will have the force of law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ross referred to tax harmonisation.  I apologise if I misrepresent his views but I was not present for his contribution.  When he came before the House, the President of the European Parliament, Professor P&ouml;ttering, made the point that the treaty contains no changes in respect of taxation.  He was telling the truth.  A week later, at the National Forum on Europe, the President of the European Commission made the same point.  On Monday last, I read newspaper reports to the effect that Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill, who chairs the Referendum Commission &mdash; which we have appointed, which is completely independent and which, among other things, is attempting to get at the truth &mdash; had also made statements to this effect.  More to the point, the treaty makes it clear that there is no change in respect of taxation.  I was not present to hear Senator Ross&rsquo;s point but it seems the President of the European Parliament, the President of the European Commission and the chairperson of our independent Referendum Commission are making the same point on the treaty.  We should start believing them.  If we have any doubts, we should believe our own eyes.</P>
        <P>An attempt is being made by one group to suggest that this change could happen under Article 113.  I was listening to a debate recently and it was claimed that three new sinister words were being added to an obscure article in the treaty.  I looked up the article and tried to point out on the radio that people should read the first five words of the same article which state that &ldquo;The Council shall, acting unanimously...&rdquo;.  That was dismissed because it was said that words do not matter, but of course they do.  The treaty says what it says.</P>
        <P>The World Trade Organisation featured a lot in the discussions and I would like to make a few points about it.  First, the WTO has absolutely nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty.  Second, the discussions on the WTO are taking place under treaties that we signed up to in 1973.  Therefore there is no change whatsoever in the legal position in Europe made by this treaty.  There is certainly no honest connection between this treaty and Commissioner Mandelson or the WTO talks.  On the basis of everything we are reading, the basis of a WTO agreement is not in place.  In a sense therefore, we are flogging ourselves over something that may not happen.  The various countries are just too far apart.  If anything, in recent weeks they have grown further apart.  We know there was supposed to be a WTO ministerial meeting in May but they are now talking about it being in June.  I wish that meeting was held sooner rather than later because we could get it out of the way.  I have no doubts whatsoever that the basis of an agreement is not in place.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>Candidates in the US presidential election campaign have made it abundantly clear that they do not accept what is being said.  The WTO is a group of 151 countries, of which we are one.  Ireland&rsquo;s voice is amplified because as members of the European Union, we are not in the debate on our own.  The agricultural sector&rsquo;s leadership should recognise that.  Earlier this year the IFA president made a courageous statement pointing out that we must be in Europe to be in a position to build alliances.  That is why he was advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
        <P>We have strong allies in this debate.  For example, President Sarkozy of France wrote to the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso indicating his concerns about the balance.  We also had the recent intervention by Chancellor Merkel who superficially mentioned her concerns.  Mr. Barroso was in this country and heard Irish concerns at first hand, which were amplified ten thousand times in the streets.</P>
        <P>Does anyone engaged in this debate seriously believe that if we were to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 12 June we would be in a better position to build alliances, win allies to our cause and defend agriculture?  It defies logic that we would go to a group of countries that have been good and supportive to us &mdash; it has been two-way traffic because we have been good to Europe too &mdash; and give them all a collective slap in the face, saying that out of some sense of hubris we will not allow them to have what they want, and then expect them to be our friends the next day?  That is illogical.  I hope and pray that people will be able to make the difference between the two positions.  Why should anyone stand with us when we stand against them?  We must face that fundamental question.  Twenty-seven sovereign governments want this treaty because they want Europe to be more efficient, effective and democratic.  They also want Europe to be in a position to cope with all the challenges on the international stage.  If we destroy that and frustrate those requests, how will we build the necessary alliances?  My answer is that we simply cannot do so.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris, who is always colourful, began by talking about the theatricality of the French presidency.  I had to say to him yesterday that he probably knows more about theatricality than any other Member of the House, but I take his point.  He referred at length to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> written by Susan George, although he did not refer to the response.  Susan George made the point that the treaty contained 25 references to competition and 63 references to the market.  I do not want to be accused of being exceptionally pedantic, but the treaty contains only seven references to competition, so there was a slight exaggeration in her research.  There are fewer than 30 references to the market, including agricultural markets.  It may be a petty point but it highlights the fact that if a person wants their research to be taken seriously, it must be undertaken seriously.</P>
        <P>Ms George also mentioned that the treaty is too complex, which is a point that has been made in this House and elsewhere, including on the RTE 9 o&rsquo;clock television news last Sunday week.  Of course, the treaty is a detailed and complex document.  It represents the aspirations and concerns of 27 different member states which have a series of different legal systems.  It is, however, no more complex than any of the previous treaties.  It is certainly no more complex than, for example, a major contract, our welfare code or the taxation code.  To suggest that because a treaty is complex it should be destroyed, and to suggest further that it should be re-written like a Ladybird book, is not a real basis for voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  When people say, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know, vote no&rdquo;, my argument is that if people do not know, they should ask.</P>
        <P>The point was also made about the amount of information that is being made available.  The information booklet is now going through every door, although earlier on there was an argument over an attempt to stop it legally.  It will not challenge anyone to read it.  In its new form the booklet has 24 pages in English and 24 pages in Irish, setting out clearly and objectively <Col N="515"/>what the treaty is about.  We also have a reform treaty website on <i>www.reformtreaty.ie</i>.  We also have a website on which one can ask any specific question on <i>www.dfa.ie</i>.  In addition, we have a lo-call number.  I have looked at the number of website hits and the number of requests which are very high.  I am grateful that is the case.</P>
        <P>As Senator Alex White indicated, we also have a wonderful document, the consolidated treaty, produced by the Institute for European Affairs.  A copy of that has gone into every library.  It would cost tens of millions to send a copy to every household, but I am not sure that would be a prudent or efficient use of public funds.  It can, however, be downloaded free on the website <i>www.reformtreaty.ie.</i>  If anyone calls the lo-call number or sends a text, we will send them a copy of the consolidated treaty free.  Copies of the treaty itself are freely available, so it is not true to suggest there is a conspiracy to keep information away from people.  The worst thing a Government could do is to put a copy of the treaty in a brown envelope and send it out to everyone.  That would be a disingenuous way of dealing with it.  The Government&rsquo;s responsibility is to explain the matter.  The political parties and IBEC are doing a superb job in providing information.  There is no shortage of information.</P>
        <P>In addition to a lengthy representation of Susan George&rsquo;s views, Senator Norris also dealt with the issue of the European Defence Agency.  There is absolutely nothing sinister about that agency.  I would like to be in a world where there were no guns, armies or wars.  It would be a wonderful world to live in, but the reality is that there is a potential for great evil.  We saw it several times in the last century with war, destruction and the Holocaust unfolding.  We have also seen it in this century.  Our great troops are out in Chad at the moment trying to deal with an arrangement that goes back generations.  A wonderful book has just been published on it, which I am in the process of reading.  It is extraordinary how the people have suffered rapine, slaughter and starvation at the hands of governments, as well as the predatory activity of warlords.  It is good that we are in a position to send young men and women there to help those people.  It is a humanitarian and Christian thing to do.  However, if we are sending our men and women out there, we must ensure they have the best equipment and that if they are in one part of that troubled country they can talk to their counterparts from other armies who are also there for humanitarian purposes.  The point of the EDA, which was established during the Irish Presidency, is to support the member states and the Council in efforts to improve defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the ESDP as it develops into the future.  It is not a sinister agency.  It is intended to ensure that where money must be spent on armaments, it is spent prudently.  It is an entirely voluntary agency.  No state must join it and states can leave it if they wish.</P>
        <P>I mentioned the issue of corporate taxation.  I wish to make a final point without being too pedantic and detailed.  The arguments that have been put forward by one of the recently formed <i>ad hoc</i> groups outside the Houses suggested that there was a back door system of dealing with corporation tax.  That argument is false.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators who participated in the debate.  It was one of the most enlightened debates I have heard in any forum on this issue.  I particularly thank the new Senators who clearly put a huge amount of time and effort into preparing for the debate.  I also thank the Opposition parties and those who take a different view from mine.  I believe in democratic debate; it would be a monologue, not a debate, if we heard just one side of the argument.  The debates in the Houses demonstrated huge support for the Bill.  The extent of our engagement in the European Union is also a feature of the debate.  Incidentally, I should point out to Senator Doherty that I insisted the maximum amount of time was made available in the other House.  It was the longest debate we will have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  He asked a question and it is common courtesy to allow a person to reply to a question.  I respect the Senator&rsquo;s right to ask a question; he should respect my right to reply to it.  I wished to make the point, not to be aggressive or to increase the Senator&rsquo;s blood pressure, that there has been a lengthy debate.  In both Houses, too, we have seen a huge demonstration of support for the treaty.</P>
        <P>The debate also demonstrated that the Union has brought great benefits to Ireland.  The reform treaty will continue that.  Yesterday in the Czech Senate we discussed this treaty.  The one thing the Senators were interested in was how to emulate Ireland.  How can anybody say this country has not gained immeasurably from participation in Europe?  How can anybody who has opposed joining the Union, the Single European Act, the Amsterdam Treaty, the Maastricht Treaty, the Nice Treaty twice and now opposes the Lisbon treaty suggest that they are pro-Europe?  The Bill will be debated on Committee Stage and then the people will have their say.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The reform treaty has simple objectives even though it is a complex document.  It will make the European Union more effective than ever and more efficient in conducting its business.  It will make it more democratic, as Members of the House have attested, by expanding the amount of democracy in the Union.  It will give the Union, for the first time, a clear and coherent voice on the world stage.  Whatever our differences in this House or in this debate, we would all agree that the values of Europe are values that should be expressed on the world stage.  The values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law, the rights of minorities and workers&rsquo; rights, which are central to the European project, should have a coherent voice on that stage.  There has been one loud voice on the world stage for the past few years and other loud voices are beginning to be heard, but they do not espouse any of the causes we espouse in Europe.</P>
        <P>The treaty will ensure equality of treatment between the member states.  Equality is written into the treaty in a way it was never written into previous treaties.  The treaty also offers a clearer explanation of the distribution of powers between the Union and the member states.  Most importantly for those who are nervous about moving forward &mdash; there is always reason to be nervous about that &mdash; this treaty ensures that the vital national interests of each member state are recognised.  It ticks all the boxes in that regard.</P><Col N="517"/>
        <P>We will continue to bring the message to the people, and I am grateful to the Opposition parties for their support.  The treaty is about making Europe and, by extension, Ireland more efficient and effective and more capable of dealing with the challenges in the world.  It is about Ireland&rsquo;s position in the world &mdash; a confident, outward-looking, focused Ireland.  It is the type of Ireland Senator Alex White spoke about in his fine speech.  We are a confident people, we have made a mark and we are capable of defending our rights, as we have shown over 35 years.</P>
        <P>We should focus on our sovereignty.  Until we joined the European Union, the only sovereign right we had was to export our sons and daughters and to live in a country that was continuously under the shadow of a near neighbour who was not always benign to us.  Our exports went to that country.  When we joined Europe we liberated ourselves as a nation and when we broke the link with sterling we learned to stand on our own feet.  We have shown, under different Administrations led by different political leaders, a capacity to use Europe for our benefit as well as for the benefit of the 500 million other citizens of the Continent.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill and I am grateful to the House for a wonderful debate.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The question of the democratic deficit in the European Union and across the institutions and the need to foster democratisation in the Union is one of the issues that was addressed in the discussions in respect of the EU constitution and when the matter was revisited in the context of the Lisbon reform treaty.  There are a number of provisions in the Lisbon treaty which genuinely address that question and what has come to be called the democratic deficit.  There are the question of the citizens&rsquo; initiative, more powers being given to the European Parliament, the question of co-decision and the manner in which the Commission is to be made up.</P>
        <P>One of the most important if not the most important aspect of what is being proposed in the reform treaty is the enhancement of powers of national parliaments and the new role they are to be afforded in the new dispensation.  Already the majority of legislation that passes through these Houses comes from European Union directives.  European legislation comes to these Houses and feeds its way into the law of the land.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>In the context of the proposed change it will be vital for us to review the procedures in the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate on and consideration of European directives before they are implemented and transposed into law.  It is an area in which we are somewhat wanting in the sense that it might be said to some extent of the changes proposed that we should be careful about what we wish for because we are seeking a real level of scrutiny for European legislation in the Houses.  However, if and when we get that we need to be prepared to ensure that our mechanisms and procedures really do engage in the sort of scrutiny that is contemplated and essential in respect of EU laws being implemented in this jurisdiction.  That may be an issue for another day.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this amendment is to specify in the Constitution what we mean by endorsing this additional role for national Parliament.  We should point to the centrality of the Oireachtas as our national Parliament.  That is the thinking behind my amendment.  This matter was discussed in the other House.  I hope the Minister of State will consider that the role of the Oireachtas, our national Parliament, is sufficiently important to be specified separately in the constitutional amendment.  I commend the amendment to the House and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Alex White.  He is correct.  Deputy Costello and I had a lengthy discussion on this matter in the other House and we also exchanged correspondence.  I understand the objective the Senator wishes to achieve.  However, I believe when he hears the counterarguments he will probably take the same course of action as Deputy Costello did.  The treaty clearly strengthens the role of national parliaments, which is one of the major benefits in the treaty.  Jaime Gama, the President of the Portuguese Parliament, said the real winners in this treaty are the national parliaments, with which I agree.  The new powers will promote democratic responsibility and will place a major challenge, particularly on the Houses of the Oireachtas as to how we do our business.  One of the Fine Gael speakers earlier said that there is a distressing tendency in this country &mdash; as is the case in other countries &mdash; for people to blame Europe for anything we do not want to sell to the people and then to claim credit domestically for everything beneficial that Europe gives us.  This will produce a much more realistic debate.</P>
        <P>Having examined the proposed amendment, I believe that to single out the provisions relating to national parliaments could give rise to uncertainty about the status of other elements in the treaty not specifically referred to in the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point that the centrality of Parliament should be recognised.  I consulted with the Attorney General particularly after receiving correspondence from Deputy Costello.  It is not legally necessary to insert the change as proposed.  The view is that it is much more appropriate that the mechanics and methods of how the Houses of the Oireachtas can fully engage and implement the new powers are formulated in the context of the review of the scrutiny legislation.</P>
        <P>The Senator will recall this because his party proposed it.  After the second referendum on the Nice treaty, scrutiny legislation was enacted as a result of which we moved the Oireachtas committees to a different status.  It is better to insert the detail that is necessary there than to insert it into the Constitution.  In the other House and in other debates I have made the point that we have appended considerable verbiage to the Constitution, which is a very fine document.  People have commented how complex international treaties are.  We should not make the Constitution any more complex than is necessary.  For those reasons I believe the objectives the Senator and his party wish to achieve would be better achieved &mdash; as was done after the second referendum on the Nice treaty &mdash; in the context of the Oireachtas scrutiny legislation.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="520"/>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that Senator Alex white raised the matter because it reinforces the powers the national Parliament will have in this regard.  As the Minister of State has said the matter should be addressed in the scrutiny legislation.  It is great to have that extra power and it gives us all more responsibility.  Whenever legislation is proposed in Europe we will be conscious of the scrutiny that it will receive not alone in the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny but also in this House.  I welcome that we can have debates in this House to analyse and scrutinise such proposals.  It is no harm to highlight the matter as it gives the public reassurance regarding the power we have as a result of this treaty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Minister of State has said.  I am inclined towards the view he takes in respect of sparse language in the Constitution and that we should not overburden it with detail.  We should not leave aside the responsibility these Houses will have.  We have had scrutiny legislation before and people are alive to the need to ensure proper scrutiny.  However, we need to put that into terms.  We need to discuss that matter perhaps after the people decide on the treaty.</P>
        <P>My experience in another life was of dealing with the practical implications of legislation, much if not most of which in the employment field comes from Europe.  There is a debate on whether there is a significant dividend for workers from being members of the European Union.  There have been a number of directives in the past ten years covering fixed-term working, equality and organisation of working time, all of which found their find way into Irish law and have a profound effect on the daily lives of citizens, employees and workers.  They are not of a theoretical nature.  They are real and afford people rights which they can then have vindicated in Irish tribunals and courts and ultimately, if it is necessary to raise a particular issue, they can go back to the European Court of Justice.  These are practical effects and advantages that people obtain as a result of our membership of the Community.</P>
        <P>I do not want to stray too far from the proposal.  I understand what the Minister of State is saying and I thank him for being prepared to engage with Deputy Costello on this and other issues.  Further to what he has said, I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator.  I share his enthusiasm for the new role to be given to parliaments.  There was a wonderful debate on this at the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny earlier this week.  I am probably the most enthusiastic Member of the House about this because I believe there is something revolutionary about this treaty.  It will drag the legislative process into national parliaments, which is wonderful.</P>
        <P>I think the Senator and I agree that the wording to be put in the Constitution regarding this Bill is already very complex.  I already said in a debate elsewhere that when this referendum is over, we should examine how we deal with our Constitution.  Every time there is a referendum amendment we put in many words produced by lawyers, for the best and most appropriate reasons, that detract from the legibility of what was and still is one of the finest constitutions in the world.  I am grateful to Senator Alex White.</P>

        <P LI="3">&ldquo;To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I propose this amendment and hope the Minister of State and other Senators will recognise it as an effort to contribute to the debate, shape the Bill and address some of the deficiencies of the Lisbon treaty.  This highlights the nonsense spoken by the Minister of State in his suggestion that people are out to destroy Europe.  No one seeks to destroy Europe and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this amendment.  I hope the same approach as was taken in the D&aacute;il is not taken, with the Government thinking I am going on and on and then guillotining the debate.  I hope the Minister of State lives up to his promise that he will facilitate full debate on this issue.  I do not intend to keep Members long.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment relates to non-membership of military alliances and seeks to address the failure of Government negotiators to ensure Irish neutrality is protected in this treaty.  This is a crucial issue for Irish people and, incidentally, many references are made in the treaty to North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, a military alliance.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has a clear vision of the kind of EU it wishes to see develop.  We want an EU that promotes conflict resolution, peace-building and global stability.  We want an EU that protects neutrality and opposes militarisation and the arms trade.  In the past Sinn F&eacute;in tabled legislation in the Oireachtas to enshrine neutrality in the 1937 Constitution.  I believe this is something that would receive the support of the people of this State who are neither comfortable nor happy with the increased militarisation of Europe and the world and the use of EU troops in operations dictated by the EU rather than the United Nations.  Had our previous proposal to enshrine neutrality explicitly in the Constitution been accepted, we would not have to be here discussing this amendment today.</P>
        <P>Proponents of the Lisbon treaty will argue that the triple lock, whereby military interventions abroad require a UN mandate, the consent of the Government and the consent of the Houses of the Oireachtas, defends Irish neutrality.  However, the triple lock has been weakened already by legislation in 2007 that opened the way for military interventions abroad based on UN authorisation rather than a formal UN mandate.  Authorisation would not necessarily require a UN resolution, rather a weaker form of UN assent, such as compatibility with the UN Charter.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty also dispenses with the requirement for a UN mandate for military interventions, thus neither Irish nor EU deployments abroad will automatically require a specific UN resolution for military operations.  This is made more worrying when one considers the expansion of the scope of EU military actions contained in the Lisbon treaty.  In Article 28 <Col N="522"/>B(1) of the treaty the Petersberg Tasks, which list the types of military interventions deemed possible, are expanded to include joint disarmament operations, military advice and assistance tasks and post-conflict stabilisation.  The treaty also contains new obligations in Articles 28 A(7)and 188 R, whereby member states must assist others that are victims of armed aggression, the mutual defence clause, or a terrorist attack, the mutual solidarity clause.</P>
        <P>Combined, these changes weaken the threshold for UN sanctions for military interventions abroad while significantly expanding the scope for such action.  When taken with the sections on common defence, NATO and military expenditure they signal the most substantial erosion of neutrality and control over foreign policy to date.  It also moves us further down the road to a common defence while significantly advancing the capabilities and competencies of the EU to act independently on the world stage.  When the European Commissioner Romano Prodi said in 2001, &ldquo;Are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a world power?&rdquo; it was this vision that he was alluding to.</P>
        <P>This is why I propose this amendment which seeks ensure the State maintains a policy of non-membership of military alliances.  I ask that it be accepted as I feel a majority of the people would want this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Doherty and do not doubt his sincerity on this issue.  This is much the same proposal that was addressed by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>As was explained already, the reform treaty does not affect Ireland&rsquo;s tradition of military neutrality and several safeguards for our position are in the treaty.  Unanimity continues to be the rule in security and defence matters and we preserve a veto on any proposal or crisis management mission with which we disagree.  The treaty recognises that the policy of European Union &ldquo;shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;.  The Senator referred to negotiators and this phrase was inserted specifically at the request of Irish negotiators and it is a phraseology that appears in several recent treaties.</P>
        <P>The Senator correctly points out that there are a significant number of references to NATO in the treaty.  However, the references to NATO arise from the fact that the majority of member states see their defence arrangements as best served through membership of that organisation.  A small number of countries, including Ireland, Austria and the Nordic countries, do not share this view.  I am discounting Denmark because it is a member of NATO and has a unique position regarding the European Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security and policy, CFSP.  There is no one-size-fits-all policy for all member states.  We would not accept an attempt by a NATO member state to dictate to us that we should join that organisation and we would not dictate to it.</P>
        <P>The protection of our position of military neutrality is already enshrined in our Constitution and there can be no better guardians than those given guardianship of military neutrality.  Article 29.2.2&deg; was one of the significant changes made between the first Nice treaty referendum and the second Nice treaty referendum.  We had the Seville declaration, which recognised Ireland&rsquo;s position and we added a clause to the Constitution that made it very clear this State could not become part of a defence arrangement without the prior agreement of the Irish people.  To do so would require a constitutional referendum.</P>
        <P>There are other defences for our neutrality that are not as strong as that offered in Article 29.2.2&deg;.  There is the triple lock, which consists of Government decision, D&aacute;il approval and United Nations authorisation.  The important point is there is no power or mechanism in the treaty for the EU to oblige a member state to become involved in a defence arrangement.  Unanimity is required, even for peacekeeping arrangements, and the EU has no power to oblige a member state to increase military spending.  I feel we should not impose our views on <Col N="523"/>other member states and neither I nor the Senator would be willing to have a view imposed on us.  I think we have a shared opinion on this matter.</P>
        <P>Ireland is already a member of the European Defence Agency, EDA, which was established in 2004.  We aim to ensure we get value for money, we have the equipment we need and we deal with programmes case by case.  I do not think this is sinister, although I do not expect the Senator to share my view.</P>
        <P>The treaty allows for future permanent, structured co-operation in the area of defence by member states that wish jointly to develop capabilities.  There is no obligation on Ireland to take part in permanent, structured co-operation.  We can opt in if we wish but we can opt to stay out, if we so wish.</P>
        <P>The treaty states that member states shall come to the assistance of fellow member states.  I was surprised during the D&aacute;il debates that the issue of coming to the assistance of a fellow member state was an allergic point.  This provision refers to a case of a member state suffering a natural or man-made disaster, a terrorist attack or being the victim of armed aggression on its territory.  The obligation in the treaty makes it clear it shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.  The phrase Ireland penned to deal with its position is written into the treaty.  Ireland will, therefore, retain its right to take its own sovereign decision whether or how it would come to the assistance of another member state.  There is no threat to our tradition of military neutrality.</P>
        <P>The changes introduced in the reform treaty will equip the Union to undertake widely supported crisis management tasks.  In the D&aacute;il, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh characterised the Chad mission as a military adventure.  It is certainly not that.  It is a humanitarian intervention of the highest order.  I regret that the Deputy and other members of Sinn F&eacute;in have not taken up this point.  I accept Senator Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s contribution is more measured.</P>
        <P>The mission seeks to assist people who have been displaced and have experienced generations of slaughter.  They are people who have had their lives and livelihoods destroyed by warlords, their women raped and their children starved to death.  It would be very wrong of any nation which is wealthy and has decent young men and women to help to stand in the way of assistance.</P>
        <P>The Senator and I share different views on this overall matter.  The Senator should consider the activities of the EU as not being militaristic and most definitely not aggressive.  They are do with the highest standards of peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a risk that inserting the phrase, &ldquo;To this end the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances&rdquo;, into the Constitution may have an opposite effect.  It would come after the phrase &ldquo;any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  It could give rise to the question whether we already have such a policy of non-membership of military alliances.  If we were to put it into the Constitution, we would have to explain to the people that there was a doubt whether the Constitution would allow this to happen by reason of some other constitutional provision or the treaty.</P>
        <P>In fact, the safeguards in the treaty negotiated by the Government to copperfasten and protect our neutrality have been carefully calibrated to achieve precisely the outcome which, in good faith, Senator Pearse Doherty wishes to achieve.  However, he lacks confidence that the Lisbon treaty will not take us somewhere else with this provision.  I do not support his amendment because it could have the opposite effect and raise doubts where no doubts exists.</P>

	<P>I do not agree with the Minister of State or Senator Alex White.  Inserting into the Constitution the phrase, &ldquo;the State shall, in particular, maintain a policy of non-membership of military alliances&rdquo;, would clear up the doubt that exists among the public.  We must remember the Government voted down an amendment to the Constitution which would have enshrined neutrality as part of the Constitution.  This amendment seeks to address some of the deficiencies in the Constitution and the Lisbon treaty.  The best guardians of neutrality are not the parliamentarians but the people.  Enshrining it in the Constitution would ensure the people, not the Cabinet or Oireachtas Members, would have the final say.  I do not agree with the Minister of State or the other parties because outside of the triple lock mechanism, we have signed up to articles of mutual defence and, under Article 28, the appropriation of funds and the rapid accession to a<?oasys _jy ?>start-up fund, all contained in the Lisbon treaty.  I will press the amendment and call a vote on it.</P>

	<P>There is great wisdom in the point made by Senator Alex White.  The current arrangement is specific and unambiguous.  The State cannot join a common European defence.  The only way this can be changed is by the will of the people as expressed in a referendum.  To insert an additional phrase, which could be overegging it, could raise legal questions.  There will always be legal arguments as to how many angels dance on the head of a pin.  There is no point in or purpose to this amendment.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Pearse Doherty that the real protection in this matter comes from the people.  That has already been enshrined in the Constitution.  The protection the Senator seeks to ensure Ireland is not forced into a common European defence already exists.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I thank Senator Norris for supporting my amendments.  As with these amendments, while only 4% of Senators are opposed to the treaty, the percentage will be far greater in the wider public.  Amendment No. 3 addresses the requirement on the Houses of the Oireachtas to have a referendum of the people of the State.  Instead of the Houses deciding issues, they would be decided by referenda.</P>
        <P>As amendment No. 5, which is similar to amendment No. 3, has not yet been moved, I ask that the Minister of State take on board my contribution to accelerate the debate.  Both amendments seek to ensure that any significant policy change in these areas requires the approval of the people of the State, not merely that of the Houses.  They would ensure that people are informed and that such decisions are taken with the genuine approval of the people.  There should be no fear of holding referenda on these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The matter of democracy is to the fore of the debate on the Lisbon treaty.  The treaty&rsquo;s failure to address the deep democratic deficit in EU institutions and at the heart EU governance is a major concern for everyone.  In the 2004 European elections, only 59% of the Twenty-six Counties&rsquo; electorate voted, more than 10% above the EU average of 45%.  In the two Nice treaty referenda in 2001 and 2002, the turnout was even worse at 34% and 49%, respectively.  In the Netherlands, the turnout was 39%, and it was 38% in Britain.  Similar figures were recorded in Portugal, Spain, France, Denmark, Germany, Austria and Finland.  A significant number of newer member states recorded turnouts of less than 28%. Some 18 of the EU&rsquo;s then 25 member states had turnouts lower than 50%, five having turnouts of less than 30%.  Across the EU, voters no longer understand nor have confidence in what it stands for, where it is going and how it takes its most important decisions.</P>
        <P>The rejection of the proposed EU constitution by France and the Netherlands in 2005 was a reflection of this uncertainty.  Analysing why the French rejected the constitution, the eminent European historian, Donald Sassoon, stated, &ldquo;There is no denying that the driving ethos of the Constitution was &lsquo;market&rsquo; Europe rather than &lsquo;Social Europe&rsquo;.&rdquo;  He also highlighted the fact that many people &ldquo;were afraid of ceding more powers to what they regarded as an unaccountable bureaucracy.&rdquo;  Interestingly and in stark contrast with the 42% turnout in the 2004 European Parliament elections in France, 70% of voters went to the polls to reject the constitution by 55%.  In the Netherlands, the turnout was 62%, of which 61% said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">After 18 months of reflection, EU leaders returned in June 2007 with the Lisbon treaty.  All but ten of the 250 or so articles of the new treaty are the same as in its predecessor, a 96% match.  It is important to cite this figure, as the Minister of State maintains it is 95%.  Valery Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, chairman of the convention that drafted the constitution, speaking to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament in July 2007, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In terms of content, the proposals remain largely unchanged, they are simply presented in a different way.... The reason is that the new text could not look too much like the constitutional treaty.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The vice-chairman of the convention, Giuliano Amato, went further when, during a speech at LSE in February of this year, he stated, &ldquo;The good thing about not calling it a Constitution is <Col N="526"/>that no one can ask for a referendum on it&rdquo;.  That political leaders across the EU, including in Ireland, believe it is acceptable to ignore the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda and to return with the same proposals is an indication of their disregard for basic democratic principles.  What clearer demonstration of the democratic deficit could there be?</P>
        <P>The electorate of the Twenty-six Counties will vote on the Lisbon treaty in 2008.  We will be the only state to do so, placing a significant responsibility on our shoulders to ensure that, before we vote, we understand the content and implications of the treaty fully.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants society to have an open, honest and frank debate in advance of the 2008 referendum.  We want a debate on the issues and what they mean for Ireland, the EU and the wider world.  We want to ensure that future decisions with implications for the people of the State are taken with their assent following referenda.  This is the purpose of these amendments and I ask the Minister of State to take them on board.  Given the sovereignty of the people, which has been mentioned, why should we be afraid to put further decisions on the treaty&rsquo;s implications to them?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 3 addresses the Schengen Agreement area.  Under the Bill, Ireland could opt out of the agreement wholly or in part with the approval of both Houses.  Speaking as someone from the Border county of Donegal, opting out of the agreement while the United Kingdom remains would have serious consequences for those living in Border areas.  A decision of such magnitude should be taken only by the people.</P>

	<P>Senator Doherty mentioned &ldquo;market Europe&rdquo; and &ldquo;social Europe&rdquo;.  We should be happy about the former because, as an open economy, we can sell our produce across the free markets of an expanding European Union.  Ireland has benefited socially from the policies of the &ldquo;social Europe&rdquo; of which it is a member state, a fact that many fail to remember.  Without our membership, we would have had fewer social policies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Deputy Dick Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that I must be brief, as I must answer parliamentary questions.  I understand Senator Doherty&rsquo;s point on Border counties and will give him an assurance &mdash; the issue under discussion is not related to the Schengen Agreement.  Rather, it relates to justice and home affairs.  Our current position on the agreement is regrettable and relates to the British attitude to it.  The last thing any Member wants is to see another border coming down.  While I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s point, the issue is irrelevant.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for discussing amendments Nos. 3 and 5 together.  He is aware that I am under pressure.  We cannot accept amendment No. 3 because requiring a referendum for each change would be to trespass on the people.  The process would be debased and we would run the risk of the onset of referendum exhaustion.  Subsection 13 provides for Ireland to choose which criminal justice or police co-operation measures to participate in on a case-by-case basis.  There is not a large body of public opinion to the effect that we should not participate in bringing to a halt international criminality.  For example, nobody would support those involved in specified criminal activities, such as the trafficking of humans or drugs, or make it easier for them.  We have constantly supported practical EU anti-terrorism measures and concerted action against organised crime.  That is the aim of this section of the treaty.  It will move Europe forward in terms of combatting international criminality which states cannot address individually.  The reason we took a prudent approach is that we have a different legal system.  We will find out the actual position on conclusion of the three year review period we have inserted.  I ask Senator Doherty to accept my assurance that this section does not focus on Schengen but on a matter on which I think we would agree, namely, that the EU should take concerted action against terrorism, cross-border crime, human and drug trafficking and money laundering.  I may have misunderstand the Senator&rsquo;s colleague in the other House when this issue was being pressed because I was not aware he was focusing on Schengen.</P>

        <P>Subsection 14&deg; of Part 2 deals with the <i>Passerelle</i> options, which provide that the Council can decide unanimously to replace unanimous voting in the Council of Ministers with qualified majority voting in specified areas set out in subsection 14.</P>
        <P>In simple terms, this means where an element of policy is decided unanimously by Council, the relevant matters may be decided by qualified majority voting in the future.  To do so, however, the Council needs to decide unanimously to make this change, giving each country a veto at the outset.  It is essential to remember this provision simply pertains to a change in the decision making process, not the competences of the Union itself.  In voting for this process, the Government would never require a constitutional referendum.  The powers to engage in this procedure and vote at the Council of Ministers are already inherent in Government.  It is clear the Government is including the provision in this Bill solely for the purpose of transparency.</P>
        <P>My amendment revises subsection 14&deg; and suggests a clearer text.  We have received oral and written confirmation from the Minister of State that the insertion of this subsection into Article 29 of the Constitution is not necessary.  The powers contained within it are already inherent in the Government and do not require explicit conferring in this manner.</P>
        <P>The insertion of this detailed provision is perhaps intended to pre-empt the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign inasmuch as it may accuse the Government of covering up the <i>Passerelle</i> provisions.  While we understand that rationale, we are not of the view that inserting unnecessarily detailed and time limited provisions into the Constitution is good practice.  We have already alluded to our desire in regard to Senator Alex White&rsquo;s amendment to avoid overburdening the Constitution with too much detail.  The tenor, quality and integrity of the Constitution would be at risk if a series of such amendments were made.  It is a principle of good constitutional practice and drafting that the text be succinct and clear, and that it operates exclusively as the higher law.  Specific powers should be created under statute.  The effect of the proposed subsection is to insert an unnecessary specific provision which is legislatively detailed and limited in time.  This amendment should, therefore, be accepted.</P>

I am aware he does not intend to remove powers from the House but it would have that exact effect.  His is a counter-intuitive proposition.</P>
        <P>If we went the route advocated by Senator Doherty, we would trespass on people&rsquo;s time and would not maintain a sustainable position.  The purposes for which he intends his amendment are already achieved in the legislation.  Unanimity in Council and the agreement of every parliament, including the Oireachtas, will be required.  Therefore, significant protections already exist.  I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

Molaim don Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta tarraingt siar &oacute;n gciorcl&aacute;n 0044/2007 a d&rsquo;eisigh s&iacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Cuireann an ciorcl&aacute;n deireadh leis an gcleachtadh at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh i ngaelscoileanna ar fud an St&aacute;it, scoileanna ina bhfuil luath-tumoideachais ioml&aacute;n &aacute; chleachtadh acu.

Crutha&iacute;onn gach staid&eacute;ar at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ar an tumoideachais n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go nd&eacute;anann s&eacute; sochar don mion-teanga ach go gcuireann s&eacute; leis an m&oacute;r-theanga chomh maith.

        <P>I ask that the circular issued by the Department of Education and Science be rescinded.  The Gaelscoileanna and the Irish language community ask that it be rescinded because it does not make sense that the practice of early language immersion would be ended by this Minister and this Department.  Every international study shows that the practice of early language immersion benefits the minority language but also the majority language, which is English in this case.  The results attained in reading levels in English in gaelscoileanna indicated 43% of the children were at the same level as 33% of the children in the normal &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; English-speaking schools.  This shows that not only does tumoideachas support the Irish language but it also supports reading and the English language.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister withdraw this circular and carry out further research.  This issue must be based on research because the Minister has gone against the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoila&iacute;ochta.</P>
        <P>I bring it to her attention that the practice of l&aacute;n tumoideachas, or Irish language immersion, exists within the Six Counties.  It will continue to exist into the future in an area where there is a demand for rights to the Irish language.  They have no protection of rights for the Irish language and yet Irish language immersion exists in the Six Counties.  In this State, where the language is protected by the Constitution, we seem to want to end that process, which has been invaluable to Irish language students throughout decades.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht an seans seo a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a fhreagairt sa Teach inniu.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas freisin leis an tSeanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Dochartaigh, a d&rsquo;ardaigh an t&aacute;bhar seo.  &Oacute;s rud &eacute; gur th&aacute;inig an cheist chugam i mB&eacute;arla, n&iacute;l rogha agam ach freagra a thabhairt i mB&eacute;arla freisin.  As we received the matter in English, the response came to me in English to be delivered on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P>I should make clear that the Department fully supports immersion models of education and provides a range of supports to encourage the establishment of all-Irish schools.  The right of parents and children to choose education through the medium of Irish is fully respected but this does not obviate the need for schools to provide children with their entitlement to the full primary school curriculum.</P>
        <P>What is at issue in this case is the requirement that schools should implement the minimum instruction time specified in the curriculum for English and do so no later than the start of the second term in junior infant classes.  In the introduction to the curriculum, on page 27, it is stated, &ldquo;It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages&rdquo;.  The curriculum also specifies a set of learning objectives for each area of the curriculum for four groupings &mdash; infant classes, first and second class, third and fourth class, and fifth and sixth class.  Promoting the achievement of the curriculum objectives in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an overriding requirement of all schools.  The Minister has therefore determined as a public policy issue that the introduction of a minimum of 2.5 hours per week for English as language 2 in Irish medium schools should not be delayed beyond the start of the second term in junior infants.</P>
        <P>What we are talking about here is that for the entire first term in junior infants, the school may communicate with pupils exclusively in Irish, subject to the agreement of this policy with the school board and the parents&rsquo; association.  After that, 88% to 90% of the interaction with pupils is through Irish, with all subjects except English being taught through Irish.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no evidence that an 88% to 90% immersion model is insufficient to promote high levels of competence in Irish by students, or that it puts the objectives of immersion education at risk.  Indeed, almost one third of gaelscoileanna are already teaching English from the outset without apparent ill effect and without detriment to the success of gaelscoileanna, which have been shown to perform at higher levels than ordinary schools in both Irish and English.</P>
        <P>Research studies in Ireland and internationally have shown that immersion schools tend to have a higher socioeconomic profile, higher educational levels among parents and greater levels of parental interest in education, and that these factors may contribute in large part, although not exclusively, to the higher achievement levels compared to children in English-medium schools.  It is important that our gaelscoileanna are seen to be inclusive and an attractive option for all pupils whose parents want to choose an Irish medium education, including newcomer pupils, disadvantaged pupils and those with special needs.  We are simply seeking a balance, under which all subjects in the curriculum are taught from the earliest possible stage, so that students receive the benefits of an integrated curriculum.</P>
        <P>There is extensive evidence that children from disadvantaged backgrounds enter school with significant deficits in oral language <i>vis &agrave; vis </i>their peers.  If there is no English tuition and these deficits are not being addressed in the home environment, there is some potential for these pupils&rsquo; educational progress in English, at least in the early stages of schooling, to be put at risk.  In such a context, the Department could not approve the exclusion of children from English tuition at a vital time for language development in early learning.  Neither could we approve a position where schools exclude an entire subject of the curriculum for particular class groups.  The flexibility for schools in the curriculum does not stretch this far.</P><Col N="533"/>
        <P>There is a wealth of research to show that literacy skills are generally transferred to the non-immersion language, and the Minister is aware that some studies indicate that total immersion is more effective than partial immersion.  The precise forms of immersion in use, whether this applied to the exclusion of all other languages, the socioeconomic profile of students, their home linguistic background, and the national context and level of societal use of the immersion language in the studies are not always clear and make comparisons difficult.  In international terms &ldquo;partial immersion&rdquo; can be at any point along a continuum from 50% to 90%.  The NCCA has advised that the research available is not sufficient or adequate to decide such matters definitively in the Irish case.  To undertake research in the Irish case would take a considerable number of years, and it would be difficult to come to definitive conclusions given the range of variables at play, including socioeconomic status, education levels of parents, parental support, home language, community use of the language and school practices.</P>
        <P>Very recent research has tended to the view that the quality of teaching trumps virtually all other variables, including the language of instruction, with regard to impact on achievement.  It would be virtually impossible to control for all these variables in an experimental research model.  The results of any such research would be likely to be inconclusive. This is a broader policy issue than educational achievement levels.  Issues of a broad and balanced curriculum, inclusiveness, parental rights for their children, and the integrity of an integrated curriculum for all classes need to be considered also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decision the Minister has taken in this case is based on a considered view of what is best for all children attending gaelscoileanna.  The Minister has consulted with a wide range of stakeholders, including Irish language advocates, parents and officials, and weighed all the advice and the options carefully.  The Minister is confident all children will benefit; children&rsquo;s Irish will continue to flourish from the known advantages of early immersion education while they are accessing the full curriculum, including English, from an early stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I note from the script read by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science one element which should be highlighted.  It indicates that gaelscoileanna must be inclusive and this view has been repeatedly advocated by the Department of Education and Science.  Gaelscoileanna are inclusive and time and again a challenge has been put to the Department to name one case where a person has been turned away from a gaelscoil.  No such case exists and the Department should not be trying to indicate gaelscoileanna are not inclusive.  They are a great model that promotes education and the Irish language in this State.</P>
        <P>Research was at the heart of the matter I tabled on the Adjournment.  There is no indication in the four-page reply that the Minister received any research in taking the decision she did.  Where did she come up with the idea to end early Irish language immersion overnight?  The practice has been in this State for over 50 years.</P>
        <P>The fact that the Minister is ruling out any further research does not make any sense.  Perhaps the Minister of State does not know the answer but did the Minister receive any research indicating that the ending of this practice would be beneficial for students?  Did she come up with the idea herself or was it some official within the Department of Education and Science who advised her on it?  Was it based on any real grounds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Senator reads the script again, he will see that at no stage was it ever suggested that gaelscoileanna were not inclusive.  It was indicated that it is apparent that <Col N="534"/>the achievements of gaelscoileanna pupils are higher than those of pupils who are not exclusively from gaelscoileanna.  The point was also made that if gaelscoileanna are inclusive, they take into account children from all socioeconomic backgrounds.  Where there is disadvantage in the home, it is essential the children develop the English language from a very early age.  To have 100% Gaeilge spoken in the absence of English would be a detrimental step for such children, which is underlined very clearly in the response from the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue.  I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The primary reason I raise the issue of dangerous dogs and the need for them to be kept under reasonable control relates to the possible impact their being at liberty may have on children.  However, given that the Minister of State has responsibility for the elderly, this matter is as much a concern in respect of older people as it is in respect of the young.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a growing trend for people to keep as pets animals that appear on the list of ten breeds of dangerous dogs.  I refer here to the American pit bull terrier, the English bull terrier, the Staffordshire bull terrier, the bull mastiff, the Doberman Pinscher, the German shepherd or Alsatian, Rhodesian ridgeback, Rottweiler, the Japanese akita, the Japanese tosa and every strain or cross of these breeds.</P>
        <P>I raise this matter on foot of a situation that was recently brought to my attention involving a young family that lives next door to a house where a Rottweiler is kept as a pet.  The Rottweiler escapes on a fairly regular basis and then appears on the private property of the family in question.  The difficulty is that the parents feel they can no longer allow their children to play outside, particularly because the Rottweiler previously entered their property and tossed one of the children.  The parents to whom I refer have made reasonable attempts to keep their property secure by erecting fences but the dog continues to gain entry.  They are worried that the dog may toss the child in question again, causing it to hit its head and be either seriously injured or killed.</P>
        <P>It appears that until the dog mauls or bites the child &mdash; no one knows too many Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers or Alsatians that will stop at giving someone a gentle nip &mdash; the matter cannot be pursued.  The Control of Dogs Act 1986 and the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 specifically state that dangerous dogs must be kept under proper control or destroyed.  I am not suggesting that the animal to which I refer should be destroyed.  I am merely using the case as an example.  According to the regulations, &ldquo;These dogs, or types and crosses thereof, must whenever they are in a public place, be kept on a short strong lead by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them&rdquo;.  The regulations also stated that such dogs must be securely muzzled.  I am concerned that the term &ldquo;public place&rdquo; is interpreted in this instance as a public park.  An immediate intervention must be made, in the context of the regulations, to ensure that where dogs gain entry to other people&rsquo;s private property, serious sanctions can be imposed.</P>
        <P>The parents of the family to which I refer have done everything reasonable to work with their neighbours in order to resolve the situation.  They feel that if they take the matter to court, the judge hearing the case will merely direct that the dog be kept under control and that everything will be fine.  The children involved do not feel entitled to go outside to play because <Col N="535"/>they do not know when the dog will appear.  In addition, they do not know whether it is going to be friendly or whether it will toss them and cause an accident.</P>
        <P>The answer from the Minister of State will probably indicate that animal welfare legislation is due to be put in place in the next 18 months and that perhaps cases such as that to which I refer can be dealt with under it.  People are concerned, however, that if they are obliged to wait 18 months it might be too late.  I wish the Minister of State to clarify whether an intervention can be made by the dog warden or the Garda if one of these listed breeds is found not wearing a muzzle and a short lead and is not under the control of someone over 16 years of age.  I want to be informed as to the strength of the regulations.  If they are not sufficiently robust, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should immediately bring forward a new regulation that will change the position.</P>
        <P>The members of the family to which I refer are living in terror.  I do not believe they are on their own in that regard.  Having spoken to colleagues in the Seanad and the Lower House, I am aware that there appears to be an increasing trend to keep these types of dogs as family pets.  I am a dog lover and I do not have any difficulty with people keeping particular breeds as pets.  It is when their choice of pet begins to impact on those around them that issues arise.</P>
        <P>I have provided a specific example to try to outline the fact that there is widespread concern about this matter.  Urgent action is required in respect of the case to which I refer and others like it that have not been brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I will be taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to outline the current requirements applying in respect of particular breeds of dogs to which the Senator refers.  The Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 provide for special controls in respect of the following breeds or types of dogs: the American pit bull terrier; the bull mastiff; the Doberman Pinscher; the English bull terrier; the German shepherd or Alsatian; the Japanese akita; the Japanese tosa; the Rhodesian ridgeback; the Rottweiler; the Staffordshire bull terrier; every dog of the type commonly known as a ban dog &mdash; or bandog &mdash; and every other strain or cross of every breed or type of the dogs listed.</P>
        <P>The regulations are quite specific in this area and require that a person shall not permit any of these dogs to be in a public place unless the animal is securely muzzled and being led, on a sufficiently strong chain or leash not exceeding two metres in length, by a person over the age of 16 years who is capable of controlling the dog.  The Control of Dogs Act 1986 defines &ldquo;public place&rdquo; very widely.  Included under the definition are any street, road, seashore, park, land, field or other place to which the public has access, whether by right or permission, and whether subject to or free of charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Act also contains specific requirements in respect of the control of all dogs by their owners and persons in charge of dogs, including places where dogs are permitted to be.  Section 22 of the Act provides that, on a complaint being made to the District Court by any interested person that a dog is dangerous and not kept under proper control, the court has powers to order that a dog which the court considers dangerous be kept under proper control or be destroyed.  While the Minister is generally satisfied with the wide definition of a &ldquo;public place&rdquo; <Col N="536"/>where the breeds of dogs to which I refer must be controlled, he intends to keep this issue under review and, if necessary, to introduce further measures to tighten the controls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I outlined in sufficiently clear terms the issue about which I am concerned, which relates primarily to what happens when these animals gain entry to private property.  I do not wish to advocate a specific solution because I might be promoting some commercial interest or other.  If, however, the use of electric fences or collars was compulsory on private property, dogs might not be able to escape from their owners' properties.  I am not confident that the case to which I refer can be dealt with under the regulations.  I trust that the Minister of State will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has raised an important issue and has identified the fact that even though a dog might be on private property, said property might not belong to its owner.  The definition in that regard may not be sufficiently clear and I assure the Senator that I will raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on the next occasion on which we meet.</P>
