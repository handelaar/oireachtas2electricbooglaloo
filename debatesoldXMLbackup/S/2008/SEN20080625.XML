	<P>I have notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review the decisions made by a special educational needs organiser which reduced access to special needs assistants for pupils in schools in Inishowen, County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled an amendment to the Order of Business yesterday to debate the economic circumstances in which this country finds itself.  That request was voted down by Senators on the Government side of the House, quite a number of whom seemed to say that the economic situation we find ourselves in is solely the result of global forces.  That view does not stand up to scrutiny and it did not stand up to scrutiny in yesterday&rsquo;s ESRI report.  There has been mismanagement of the public finances by this Government under the stewardship of the man who was the Minister for Finance and is now the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.</P><Col N="412"/>
        <P>I want to point out to the House some of the waste that has occurred in previous years.  We have had a &euro;3.2 billion overrun on the roads programme.  We have had a decentralisation programme which at this stage will cost us &euro;1.2 billion.  We have had &euro;380 million in unlawful nursing home charges.  We have had &euro;19 million in unused accommodation for asylum seekers.  That money would provide many front-line services, be they speech therapy services, home care packages or step-down facilities.  All those front-line services are being cut as we speak.  As I said yesterday, those services are being cut in the absence of any statement from Government on the reality of the situation facing hospitals, many of which are facing serious overruns.  They are cutting back outpatient services, laboratory services and we have no plan from Government.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader, Senator Boyle, to arrange for a debate in this House on the topics of the waste, the economic plan and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assessment of the financial situation.  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s assessment of the situation we are in?  What are the Government&rsquo;s plans?  Will it go into the summer recess, start announcing plans and not come into this House or the D&aacute;il to debate those matters where they should be debated?</P>
        <P><i>The Irish Times</i> asked today if the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, is up to the job.  Let us hope he is, for all our sakes, because we need a proper assessment of the situation.  The people need to know also because they are trying to deliver services and pay their mortgages.  They want to know the Government&rsquo;s plan for the housing market, for example.  People are caught in appalling circumstances in the current housing market.  We need to have some leadership from the Government on this matter.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business today to discuss the public finances and I ask Members on the other side of the House to support this.</P>
        <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for Defence to come to the House because we are all very aware of the dangerous mission currently being undertaken by our Defence Forces.  The Minister has recently visited the area.  Some comments were made by the UNHCR about the Irish troops.  It would be helpful for the House to hear from the Minister the exact circumstances in Chad and whether the Army has the resources and the numbers for such a mammoth task.  We should have a discussion before the end of term on the Defence Forces mission in Chad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have some sympathy with the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  If we are not going to deal with this rationally, there will be no gain to be made for this country by arguing in this House over whose fault it is.  We need to have clear information.  I have tried to see both sides of this argument.  We need to know the current economic indicators, the current tax take.  We need to know the scale of the problem so that we can come to terms with it.  We need to then know how the solutions are to be found.  We need to consider issues such as the national development plan and how we can build our way out of the recession or whatever we wish to call the current position.  We need to have a clear view and we need to understand the situation.</P>
        <P>Broad brush strokes are no good and neither is blaming the other side.  We need to be specific.  It is all very well to talk about pay freezes, take-home pay and profits but we should also discuss the people at the bottom end of the scale, those on the minimum wage.  There are issues to be dealt with.  People either have the moral and political courage to deal with these issues or they have not.  Politicians do not like taking unpopular decisions.  Some of us have spent our lives selling unpopular decisions to the people who elected us and this can be done again.  However, we cannot blame Libertas if we get this one wrong; it is a problem for us to deal with.  We need to have the information put in front of us in a calm manner about the Government&rsquo;s view on where interest rates, inflation, unemployment figures, are going, and <Col N="413"/>the Government&rsquo;s decisions on the possible options for dealing with the situation.  This must be done and there is no other way to do it.  The Deputy Leader has been studying these matters for the past five years and I trust him to come back with a proper response.</P>
        <P>We are faced with a strike in the Bank of Ireland.  This is another good example of how we never hear anything about industrial relations problems until a strike is threatened.  A strike in the Bank of Ireland was narrowly avoided some years ago.  The unions and management along with the various State support groups, the National Implementation Body and others, became involved and came to a conclusion.  The subsequent deal cut 2,100 jobs, saved the bank &euro;147 million a year and gave the workers in the Bank of Ireland a 6% share pay-out each year.  This deal was hard won for the staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bank has now decided, without any consultation, to reduce the 6% share payment to 3%.  This is unacceptable and it is no way to run a business.  Bank of Ireland has plenty to answer for in other spheres of its activities.  It is a company making a &euro;1.7 billion profit per year and the amount in question is less than 1% of that total annual profit.  These people are walking all over their employees and also their shareholders and others.  The bank has a lot to answer for.  The greed of the Bank of Ireland senior management, of the court of the Bank of Ireland, as it pompously calls it, is unacceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the Bank of Ireland, whose behaviour is not justified.  It is a sign of the times when the bank takes such actions.</P>
        <P>We need clear information on the country&rsquo;s finances, as other speakers have said.  I made my comments yesterday on what action was needed.  I wish to return to one issue, the upskilling and reskilling of manufacturing, construction and textile workers.  They are quite vulnerable when jobs are lost.  There is a need to allow for investment in programmes to upskill and reskill these workers.  We also need to consider those working in administrative jobs.  This country has significant exports of high value goods in the areas of risk management, finance, IT, insurance, for instance.  The announcement earlier this week by Hibernian Insurance of its intention to cut more than 500 jobs is worrying.  With global communications, administrative jobs can be located anywhere in the world.  Pioneer Investments, one of the largest investment firms in the world, stated that it is quite difficult to find employees in this country who are suitably skilled in certain sectors.</P>
        <P>A few years ago, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said the financial services sector should have a centre for skills.  Nothing was done but it is now high time that something is taken.  We must face the reality that if we are to compete we need to compete in the high value areas of business and we need highly skilled individuals.  With regard to administrative work, I do not know if we will be able to compete at the same level as a number of years ago.  I ask the Deputy Leader to address this issue.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the Government will be examining the national development programme.  I suggest that the examination includes the provision of broadband and the prioritisation of the broadband strategy within the NDP.  This is the number one infrastructural issue for the country and the Government needs to state that priority.  It is above and beyond everything else.</P>
        <P>Lessons need to be learned from the Lisbon treaty.  I am a member of the sub-committee on European scrutiny.  I was taken by the comments of Senator McFadden yesterday about turf-cutting and I have great sympathy for the fishing sector.  We need to stand up and say that rural Ireland in particular is being affected by some silly overburdening legislation that comes down from the EU from time to time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="414"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the legislation on health and safety which is necessary but which puts up barriers of entry to people working in farmers&rsquo; markets and also the issue of food labelling.  Why does a man or woman making 12 tarts need to obtain scientific analysis of the ingredients of a tart such as jam?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>This is ridiculous.  They have to print the information in font size 12 on the jars, which is also ridiculous.  As a country we need to say we have had enough.  Rural Ireland is being affected both socially and economically.  We need to dismiss such legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with many of the comments made about the rules and regulations and directives coming from Europe.  There is a public perception that we are being ruled by Europe.  While the issues of enhanced co-operation and democracy were discussed with reference to the Lisbon treaty, the perception is that there are too many regulations, too many directives.  I agree we need to consider this issue because the public do not like it.  We need to drive this point home in Brussels.</P>
        <P>I agree with the position taken on Zimbabwe by the United Nations Security Council when it condemned the campaign of violence and intimidation by the Government of Zimbabwe.  It is understandable that the Opposition leader had to withdraw in light of what has been happening there.  I acknowledge the support from the international community.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should attend the House to give us an up-to-date assessment of how our NGOs and other agencies are dealing with the humanitarian crisis.  In the 2006-07 period we provided some &euro;17 million in aid to Zimbabwe.  This year, through channels including Tr&oacute;caire and Concern, we have provided over &euro;4 million in funding.  It is only right that we should get the updated position to see how far we can go in helping the situation.  We should support any EU measures to help stamp out the awful violence that is taking place there.  The Deputy Leader should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline the awful situation that currrently exists in Zimbabwe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to second the proposal by Senator Fitzgerald for an amendment to the Order of Business.  One of the points she forcefully made concerned examples of public moneys being wasted by the Government.  An unfortunate example of this will take place in August when a new barrier system comes into operation on the M50.  This House should examine where large amounts of Exchequer funding have been invested in semi-State bodies, and how that money was spent.  We should also examine examples of where semi-State bodies are levying charges that are adding to the cost of living, thus hampering our economic competitiveness.  During August, a new M50 barrier system will commence, which has cost the Exchequer &euro;488 million to purchase.  The new scheme will ask each user if they want to buy into the new plant, paying &euro;52 to participate.  The scheme will cost the Exchequer &euro;25 million annually, despite the fact that the State will have spent almost &euro;0.5 billion buying out what is in operation at the moment.  We will see further examples of where the Exchequer will be asked to pay out more and citizens will also be asked to pay more to participate in the new scheme.  We need to challenge this kind of thinking as we move into a new economic environment.  We must ensure that public moneys are being spent well and that taxpayers do not face further rises in the cost of living.</P>
        <P>In recent months, other speakers have raised issues concerning homelessness and the rental sector.  I have frequently raised these matters myself.  Last week, a Government strategy was published to make more use of the rental sector for homeless people and drug addicts.  New rental regulations are urgently required, together with a new local authority scheme to improve <Col N="415"/>management of conditions in the rental sector, otherwise we will be putting even more taxpayers&rsquo; money into a sector that is not regulated or run properly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Cork City Council on passing a motion by Councillor Chris O&rsquo;Leary of the Green Party, which places a moratorium on all planning decisions for mobile phone masts within the city until evidence is produced that they are not harmful to people.  The moratorium will not be lifted until the council is satisfied that the European environmental protection agency&rsquo;s precautionary principle is applied.  That principle is that we should err on the side of caution when it comes to public health.  If it is believed that mobile phones and masts cause cancer, we should apply the highest possible precautionary principles to them.  I have received information from Genevieve Maul, Communications Director, University of Cambridge on the link between mobile phone usage and cancer.  Last year, a Swedish study showed that one has double the risk of contracting a brain tumour if one uses mobile phones for over ten years.  In light of this growing evidence, I call on the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to implement the recommendations of the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the last D&aacute;il.  That committee&rsquo;s wide-ranging recommendations were not implemented but they should now be introduced in light of the growing evidence I have cited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the call by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others for a debate on the economy.  The issue of how banks deal with employees was mentioned, but we should examine the extraordinary job they have done in damaging the economy in the last few years.  It ought to be realised, if it has not already been, that Irish banks in particular are disgracefully run because they are run for bankers and nobody else.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Correct. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>They are run for the board and the management.  That is why they have been lending recklessly and irresponsibly to people who are now in the sort of misery to which Senator Fitzgerald referred.  The banks set themselves extremely undemanding, short-term targets which depend on them lending to people who cannot afford to pay them back.  They get their short-term performance bonuses while the debtors are unable to repay what they owe.  It is a disgracefully structured system which is a particular shame here in Ireland.  It is worse here than it is anywhere else that I can think of.</P>
        <P>We should point out that this is a serious matter.  The head of the UK&rsquo;s financial services authority has said that bankers&rsquo; pay is now so excessive that it is a factor which may contribute towards the destabilisation of the banks themselves.  This has been echoed belatedly by our own Financial Services Authority.  These people are running a bank for short-term gains for themselves.  I should declare that, to my cost, I am a shareholder in the Bank of Ireland.  They are the worst offenders of the lot; one person got &euro;4 million last year.  These people are running it for themselves.  They are the beneficiaries while shareholders, employees and consumers are suffering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish with another matter which is relevant to the Order of Business and was raised by Senator Kelly.  I still maintain that the broadband issue is not appreciated by Members of the Oireachtas.  For some time, I was a voice in the wilderness on this matter but I am delighted to hear Members of this House who are now very vocal about it.  However, a document was leaked &mdash; and I have to say that I am not professionally against leaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="416"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not talk about any leaking.  The Senator should speak to the Order of Business. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, that was an aside.  A legitimate and authoritative document was leaked to <i>The Irish Times </i>yesterday, stating how well the Government was doing.  A very good Green Party Minister is involved in this.  The document said the Government was proposing a paper on broadband and that it was somewhere in the Department.  This was to give us the impression that something was being done about broadband.  There is a consultation paper in the Department which was prepared by a forum of global people who were flown in for the day to give advice, which anybody in this House could have given years ago.  It was irrelevant.  There was then going to be some sort of an open day when all the vested interests could come in and bellyache, and then there was going to be a proposal.  As far as I know, however, there is no Bill and no money for broadband either.  There are no proposals.  We should have tackled this five or six years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy Leader should ask his parliamentary colleague if he is prepared to take the Bill I have placed on the Order Paper concerning broadband, if I do not push it to a vote.  It contains many of the things of which he and his party approve, as well as many of the things in the leaked document, as a basis for discussion and moving this matter on.  We should not just sit back and talk about it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues who have raised the issue of over regulation.  When regulations come down the track from Europe we, as a country and as a people, seem to automatically accept them.  We should have a debate on this issue and I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate that.  For example, a farmer can produce 50 free-range eggs.  I know a particular family which produces free-range eggs and they had to devise a system whereby the husband, wife and two children were each able to get a quota.  It is ridiculous.  The colour and size of the eggs must conform to all of these regulations coming from Europe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I met a group called Slow Food which is involved in organic farming.  In west Cork, and I am sure in other counties, there are Saturday and Sunday farm markets for home produced foods.  There is so much regulation tying these down, rather than supporting activities such as cheese making in rural Ireland.  One of the big complaints of fishermen when they meet me is that there is so much regulation from Europe and we, as a country, seem to be so anxious to accept this.  Sometimes we should say &ldquo;Hands off Europe, we will do some regulating ourselves&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That might not be enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is two weeks too late with that message.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>That leads me to a point on planning permission.  The area of planning in rural Ireland is another on which I also ask for a debate, although not before the end of this session.  I have discovered in the new county development plan that three quarters of my entire electoral area, the Bantry electoral area, which has 16,000 to 18,000 people, cover<Col N="417"/>ing all of the peninsulas, can never be built on because there are mountains, valleys, etc., yet that entire area has now been regulated as scenic and tourism related making it nigh on impossible for somebody living in a rural area to get planning permission.  I am not supporting second homes or holiday homes but I do support cases where a farmer&rsquo;s son or daughter or somebody wants to stay in their home community, get involved in sport and look after their kin.  That is becoming impossible and it is all driven by EU regulations.  It is time to say &ldquo;hands off&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I fully support the remarks about the banks, particularly those by Senator Ross who is probably more eminent and capable of making them, and some of whose remarks were veiled.  Let us be real here.  The leader of the Opposition has rightly called for a debate on the economy, but the banking institutions have a significant role to play.  It is not that long ago that some of my children, who are now young adults, got letters asking did they want to borrow more money and within a year or two they are getting letters stating the banks want them to pay back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a credit crunch taking place that we have not yet even seen where the banks are squeezing and squeezing, and yet, as Senator Ross has stated, some of the directors are being paid annual earnings of &euro;4 million plus.  They are thinking selfishly.  If the banks do not play a role in the economic recovery it is time the Government told them to come on board on this one or else the ship will go down entirely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;iceberg and holing the ship.  The banks cannot selfishly walk away from the situation which they are responsible for creating over the past decade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us hear what the Government will do with the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the calls for a debate on the economy.  Listening to all sections of the House, it is clear that there is a deep interest in what direction the Government wants to take and what direction we, as Oireachtas Members, want to take to face the challenges ahead.</P>
        <P>I reassure Senator Ross that the roll-out of broadband is one of my high priorities.  I agree with him that we are hearing much talk about it but seeing little in the way of tangible efforts so that it reaches the necessary areas.  It is an area on which we should have further debate.  It is will help the economy, if we prioritise and give clear leadership and direction on where the priorities for investment should be as we go forward.</P>
        <P>I would also support Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  He has made numerous calls here in support of the fishing industry, which is another sector under serious pressure.  I regret to inform the House today of another sector facing serious decline, that is, the poultry industry.  In west Waterford in my constituency the well recognised brand of Cappaquin Chickens is under serious pressure to survive.  Mention was made of the regulations coming from Europe.  Given the labelling regulations, the company is not playing on a level playing pitch.  It is trying to compete with importers who are not complying with the same regulations and it is putting the company at a serious disadvantage in a competitive market.  The company also faces significant <Col N="418"/>overhead costs.  The price of feedstuffs for the poultry sector has increased by over 50% in the past year.</P>
        <P>Cappaquin Chickens has a wide remit in supporting the rural economy.  We have had debates here on how we should support and sustain rural areas.  This is an indigenous enterprise operating in rural west County Waterford.  It is reaching out to farms that the Government agencies would never reach.  These are the real industries that are operating in rural areas and they need to be supported.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, who I believe has a deep interest in the poultry sector given the constituency from which he comes, to recognise it is an area that needs assistance.  For example, I am aware that there are seven full-time Department inspectors working in Cappoquin Chickens at a considerable cost to the company when I, and many in the industry, would consider that possibly half as many would suffice to keep the industry regulated.  I call for an urgent debate on this matter.  It is one of the indigenous industries we will lose unless we pay attention to it.  All Members from all sides of the House should take an interest in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to a number of the speakers, including my good friend and colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, on over regulation and I must concur with what has been said.  I visit the village of Kilcrohane where Senator O&rsquo;Donovan is from.  I have very good friends in the village who run an Irish farmhouse bed and breakfast.  The Senator mentioned the regulation of eggs.  My friends have hens and they are not allowed serve the eggs from their farm to their customers.  Poultry and other products, including their own home-grown potatoes, all must comply with regulations.  The eggs must be stamped, etc.  It is crazy.  One goes into this small village to a beautiful farmhouse bed and breakfast which is not able to serve certain produce because of regulation, and we sell this as an Irish farmhouse experience.  I look forward with interest to see what we in the Seanad can do to make changes in that area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have listened to many people speak about the recent ESRI report.  People seem to be cherry-picking certain aspects of the report.  I look forward to a good broad debate on the report and the direction the country is taking.</P>

	<P>I look forward to the steps that we will take in this turbulent period due to the international situation that prevails.  When I reflect on where we are, I am delighted to say that I was somewhat responsible in bringing to this country one pharmaceutical company which in the past number of years has trebled its production and employment in this country.  Ireland has some of the biggest and best pharmaceutical companies involved in considerable employment in all of the areas that we would wish such as manufacturing and research and development.</P>

        <P>Mention was made of the financial services industry.  When I look across the river, close to my constituency, I see what we have done in the area of financial services.  The banks are dealing with a credit crunch but we should acknowledge that they have done Trojan work in fuelling the economy and they are well capitalised.</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on one area in which I have an interest, that is, the motor industry.  The motor industry is experiencing serious turbulence and requires a much-needed lift.  The car sales market is down over 15% and there are significant problems with second-hand and used vehicles.  The problem is that there is a large number of vehicles being imported into this country.  We need to be innovative in introducing an escape valve to encourage the export of some of our second-hand and used vehicles, particularly in light of the new emission-based tax regime being introduced on 1 July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether there can be a bit of a credit crunch.  It is like a bit of an earthquake.  Either there is a credit crunch or there is not.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate on criminal justice in light of the three shootings in Dublin in the past 24 hours?  Shockingly, one of those shootings took place at 1 p.m. yesterday in Drimnagh and one took place last night very close to where I live in the Coombe area of Dublin, the south inner city.  We all should be deeply concerned about this.  What we have learned from past experience is that knee-jerk reactions in terms of mandatory sentences for firearms offences, etc. do not have the desired effect of preventing these appalling shootings.  We need a more measured debate on alternative responses to severe crimes such as these and more long-term solutions in the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>I have attended the fourth annual North-South criminology conference in the Dublin Institute of Technology over the past two days at which very measured academic presentations were given and which provide useful insights for policy makers on approaches which could be taken in the criminal justice system.  These include simple matters such as changing and streamlining the way in which we run our criminal justice statistics gathering system.  That is vital and I would like us to debate it.</P>
        <P>On a slightly related matter, I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he will not abolish early houses.  Anyone who has frequented early houses will know they are generally fairly quiet places to which people go for a pint after a night shift.  It is important that he has taken on board the recommendations of people who know the system of early houses and who have been able to advise him that there is not a public order issue.  That is useful because it shows that knee-jerk responses do not always work.  It was a knee-jerk response to real and serious problems arising from alcohol abuse which led to the suggestion that early house licences should be extinguished.  The Minister is now taking a more measured approach to this by saying that the existing 50 licences in place will be retained.</P>

	<P>I am delighted there have been so many contributions on the Order of Business on excessive regulation emanating from the European Union.  We are not only talking about excessive regulation but about nonsensical regulation.  Even during the campaign on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, it was raised on the doorsteps.</P>
        <P>I remember a time when the local housewife could make apple tarts and scones, bring them to the local shop and sell them.  We knew they were wholesome and what the ingredients were.  However, we are not quite sure how wholesome many of the mass produced products we now buy are.</P>
        <P>There is also excessive regulation of bed and breakfasts.  I fully agree with Senator Alan Kelly that we need to have health and safety concerns.  However, I forecast that within the next three or four years, there will not be a bed and breakfast left in this country because approximately 50% are already gone owing to excessive regulation.</P>
        <P>I refer to the small farmer.  If a chicken dies, one cannot bury it on one&rsquo;s land.  One must then try to explain how the European project is important to Ireland.  I am delighted we are dealing with this issue, even if it is a post-referendum syndrome.</P><Col N="420"/>
        <P>The problem is that directives are brought in for the 27 countries but we all know that the same environment does not obtain in each.  There must be some way to recognise that.  If we must scientifically analyse everything made in small cottage industries, they will be wiped out and the small operator will suffer.</P>
        <P>I refer to the challenges facing the economy on which we should have a debate.  It would be surprising if that did not happen.  Whether it should take place today is another issue but it should happen soon.  I have already noticed that the Economic and Social Research Institute report is now being looked at a little bit more positively than at first, especially on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today.  I do not know if Members had the opportunity to hear this morning&rsquo;s analysis of what is a recession and of a recession now compared with those we had in the past.  I noticed a different tone to the debate.</P>

        <P>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole was 100% right that, as legislators, we should act as such because neither compassion nor recrimination will give any solace whatever to someone who loses his or her job or if a small business closes.  Now is the time to unite because that is what is expected of us as legislators.

	<P>I was delighted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, state on &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; yesterday that he would take determined, resolute and prudent action in response to the growing recession in which we find ourselves and to the ESRI report.  As many other speakers have said, we need to know before the summer recess what he means by that and the action he plans to take.  We need to be confident he will not wield the axe indiscriminately and that sensible action will be taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Did the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, intervene to prevent the loss of 580 jobs in Hibernian Insurance in Dublin, Cork and Galway?  These are sustainable jobs needed to service the Irish insurance industry.  The chances are that more of these situations are coming.  How will she deal with them?  The House needs to know the answer before the summer recess because we must have confidence that <Col N="421"/>jobs are being protected.  It will take much action by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and IDA Ireland to create 580 new jobs.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is not replacing front-line staff who are on leave.  For example, if a speech therapist is on maternity leave or annual leave, there is no one to serve a child&rsquo;s learning needs.  That speech barrier is preventing the child from learning.  I know of a woman with a broken arm and a son with mental health problems who cannot get physiotherapy because the physiotherapist is on leave.  There are no social workers to deal with 50 cases of reported abuse in Galway.  The Minister for Finance needs to look at that area in which further cuts should not take place.  Front-line services need to be maintained.  The House needs information on the resolute, determined and prudent action the Minister for Finance and the entire Cabinet need to take prior to the summer recess.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy which I hope will be constructive.  Given the number of speakers who called for such a debate, I hope solutions will emerge from it.  We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation with the oil crisis.  The cost of oil is putting pressure on the various service industries.  There is also the problem of the credit squeeze in the banks, which affects everyone.  There is the sub-prime lending situation, which is more relevant to America and Britain than Ireland.  I believe the banks have been lending irresponsibly and I agree with Senator Ross in this regard.  All these factors affect the economy and I hope when we debate this matter we will have solutions.</P>
        <P>There are solutions.  Some 50,000 people in the house building industry will become unemployed and there is a solution to be found for this.  There are new technologies coming on stream which will create new jobs in that industry.  Everyone believes the housing industry is synonymous with building industry, but it is only a small part of it.  There is the green collar worker which we can introduce with new skills to work with energy ratings which we badly require.  If we introduce energy ratings in housing projects, it is another significant area where we can create new and necessary jobs.  I hope when we have a full-day debate on this matter that the Minister for Finance will come to the House and outline his plans and views.  Recriminations will not get us anywhere.  We are elected to this House as legislators to ensure we tease out the problems and find the best possible way out of a situation.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; put his finger on it; we need to be a little more patriotic now.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is clear the Green Party does have a modicum of influence on the Government and I would like to see it use that influence on the very important matter of broadband.  As my colleague, Senator Alan Kelly, has said, it is essential we have broadband if we are to dig our way out of this economic crisis.  There are two developments we must see.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not need a team of international experts.  As Senator Ross said, he just needs to read the transcripts of this House.  We need universal access throughout the country and we need faster broadband speeds.  Japan has speeds some 30 times faster than Ireland and we need to see our speeds improve.  Will the Deputy Leader pass this on to his Minister?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome a debate on the economy following the publication of the report by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I am mindful that in the past decade there have been two downturns, one following the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the other after the tragedy of 11 September 2001.  Very quickly the economy managed to turn the situation around.  The report indicates that within 18 months we will be back to very strong levels of growth, which I welcome.  I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Finance to attend the House to discuss the report and especially to reaffirm the commitment of Fianna F&aacute;il and the other Government parties to looking after those less well-off in more uncertain and difficult times.</P>
        <P>As a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; supporter in the recent Lisbon treaty referendum, I commend some of the political achievements of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign which humbled those of us in politics.

	<P>On the Lisbon treaty, several points have been made across the floor on the Government side.  There has been talk of issues decided in Brussels which constitute excessive regulation.  The reality is that every measure agreed in Brussels is agreed by the Government and the relevant Minister who attends the Council.  One cannot wash one&rsquo;s hands of decisions made in Brussels since we are part of the decision-making process.  It is a cop-out for the Government and the representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il to complain about several of these measures.  It is the manner of implementation of these measures with which people find fault.  This applies to the legislation that is passed in these Houses and the way it is implemented.  We have seen this previously with the habitats directive and water charges where there is specific flexibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I support the call for a debate on the economy.  The Taoiseach, in <i>The Irish Times</i> newspaper this morning, denied he is to blame for the economic downturn.  We cannot blame the Taoiseach for everything.  We do not believe all aspects of the recession are down to the Minister for Finance.  However, we believe the management of the public finances is the responsibility of the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, said before the general election that his party&rsquo;s policies were based on responsible <Col N="423"/>budgets that would pass on an effectively debt-free country to the next generation.  What is clear from the ESRI report, if nothing else, is that in 2006 we had a budget surplus of &euro;5.2 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald, opening the Order of Business, suggested an amendment to a debate on the economy, which repeats the call from yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  As is usual with such calls, it is difficult to get a Minister available at short notice, but yesterday&rsquo;s call has been taken into account.  Efforts are being made to make available the Minister for Finance and there is every confidence that such a debate will take place before the House rises for the summer, which will happen in the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>Many other speakers discussed the content of such a debate, including Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Kelly, Donohoe, Ross, Callely, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Healy Eames, Butler and Hanafin.  It is hoped when the Minister for Finance does come to the House that the context of the debate is well placed.  Yesterday&rsquo;s report from the ESRI has engendered an initial debate the especial subject of which has been public confidence.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald in her opening contribution today spoke of the local factors which might be involved in the current economic downturn.  It is still largely the case that most of the factors are international.  Any other performing international economy is in a similar situation.  The ESRI report does discuss public confidence, which is sometimes influenced by the tone and tenor of debates in this Chamber and others like it.  However, public confidence is influenced also by factors mentioned by other speakers.  I refer especially to the contribution of Senator Ross and his comments on the level of personal indebtedness in the economy, which is one of the highest in the world.  There would be an open call for a debate in the House on the role of the banking industry in trying to establish consumer confidence which has been badly affected by the type of policies that many of those financial institutions have put in place.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole questioned the likelihood of a strike at the Bank of Ireland.  While this House cannot intervene directly in such labour disputes, its Members hope the measures the Senator outlined will be followed so that a strike can be averted at one of the largest financial institutions in the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Kelly highlighted the need for new skills in areas such as administration.  As did Senator Healy Eames, he referred to the regrettable announcement that has been made by the Hibernian Insurance company.  I suggest that the report that was published recently by the future skills group and Forf&aacute;s forms a good basis for the debate in this House on the issues the Senators have mentioned.</P><Col N="424"/>
        <P>Senators Kelly, Ross and Hannigan spoke about broadband services.  Senator Ross referred to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  Having spoken to the Minister, I understand the report in question was largely accurate.  I do not doubt the Minister will make time available to speak on the matter in the Seanad, although I am not sure whether that can be done before this House rises for the summer.  The Minister is committed to increasing the availability of broadband services.  Yesterday&rsquo;s newspaper report reminded us that the Minister is working to a particular deadline to ensure we have maximum broadband coverage in this country.  There is a need for a fully informed debate on this issue.  The Private Members&rsquo; Bill that has been proposed by Senator Ross will help to bring that about.  We need to consider what exactly we mean when we talk about broadband.  We have to set out what we believe to be an acceptable speed in the context of the provision of broadband.  We should specify the geographical locations where the people of this country can access broadband services.</P>
        <P>Senators Kelly, Ormonde, O&rsquo;Donovan, Callely, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Regan referred to the introduction in this country of regulations on foot of EU directives.  Such a level of interest in the issue of regulation makes it clear there is a need for a debate on it in this House.  We need to consider the extent to which EU directives which have a practical use are being accepted by the public.  We also need to reflect on the degree to which such directives are being policed.  Are we being too zealous in implementing regulations?  Do we choose to implement certain regulations but not others?  Do we know whether the various regulations are being implemented in other EU member states?  Many of the concerns which have been raised can be debated properly if we arrange a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe commented on the new regime of levies and charges on the M50.  Such matters can be discussed in the context of the debate on the economy that we will have in the weeks to come.  Some of the problems associated with the M50 were caused by a badly flawed original contract.  The moneys to be paid by the State, which were mentioned by the Senator, are equivalent to the moneys which the State would have continued to pay under the original contract.  They are now to be paid in a different form.  The new system will help traffic flow while ensuring the Exchequer&rsquo;s original investment is repaid.  The Senator&rsquo;s points are well made.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe also spoke about the homelessness strategy, the contents of which were recently made available.  There is scope for a good debate in this House on the strategy.  The Senator referred to the new rental regulations, which I do not think are part of the same debate.  I will bring his view that the regulations need to be strengthened to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly talked about Cork City Council&rsquo;s decision to introduce a moratorium on mobile phone masts.  I am aware the Senator takes a great personal interest in such matters.  He referred to a report produced by the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources which set out the guidelines which should apply in these cases.  I will inform the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of the Senator&rsquo;s interest in this matter.  I will find out whether there is a possibility of a separate debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of planning in rural Ireland, which is highlighted in the House regularly.  The Leader of the House has promised that such a debate will be organised soon.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey spoke about the effects of changes in the poultry industry on the Waterford area.  He pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also represents a constituency in which the industry is strong.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Smith, shares Senator Coffey&rsquo;s concerns and is prepared to address such issues in the House.</P><Col N="425"/>
        <P>Senator Bacik referred to the many shootings which have occurred in a certain district of Dublin.  Like the Senator, I stay in the Coombe area of the city where last night&rsquo;s unfortunate incident took place.  The shooting resulted in the closure of that part of Dublin while garda&iacute; were initiating their investigations.  I am sure the Leader of the House will make time available for a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik pre-empted the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008, which will take place in this House over the next few weeks.  Like her, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to proceed with certain provisions in relation to early opening bars, which have a distinct culture and do not contribute to this country&rsquo;s overall problem with alcohol.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames spoke about Health Service Executive staffing in the context of an incident in the Galway area.  HSE issues are regularly raised on the Order of Business.  We have had several debates on such matters.  The Minister for Health and Children has come to the Seanad on several occasions.  The HSE receives an equivalent amount of resources in terms of man hours.  We need to understand the management difficulties that are causing problems at national and local levels.  The Senator is right to raise the issue.</P>

        <P>Senator Hannigan welcomed the publication of the heads of the civil partnership Bill.  I am confident the Seanad and the other House will be prepared to proceed with the legislation as quickly as possible.  It will be a significant and important Bill.  I accept it will not address all issues fully.  It is an important stepping stone.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about the need for the Government to emphasise, in the context of the debate on the economy, the need to allocate existing resources in a proportionate manner.  Everyone on the Government benches will be happy to do so, especially as the 2008 economy will be 99.6% the size of the 2007 economy.  Special attention will have to be paid to those in our society who are less well off.  To be fair to the Taoiseach, the three budgets he introduced when he was Minister for Finance were verified by the Combat Poverty Agency as the most socially equitable budgets of the past decade.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government amendment No. 76 replaces one of my previous amendments.  While I do not intend to speak on each grouped amendment as Members continue to consider the Bill, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; i mB&eacute;arla mar gheall ar c&uacute;pla ceann acu.  Amendment No. 14 is important and the Minister should make a gesture in this regard.  All I seek is that RTE&rsquo;s website should be bilingual, which simply means it would include two languages.  It does not mean that every single word contained therein must be translated into Irish.  I nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, b&iacute;onn deacrachta&iacute; ag muintir na Gaeltachta faoi l&aacute;thair nuair at&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh a gcuid oibre.  M&aacute; t&aacute; m&uacute;inteoir scoile i gceartl&aacute;r na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh ar a rang f&eacute;achaint ar website RTE chun teacht ar any piece of information, ba mhaith an rud &eacute; go mbeadh an Ghaeilge ann chomh maith.  An deacracht at&aacute; ann i gcona&iacute; &oacute; thaobh m&uacute;ineadh na Gaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute;, &oacute; thaobh maireacht&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachta&iacute; agus &oacute; thaobh l&aacute;rnacht na Gaeltachta&iacute; gan Ghaeilge a bheith acu, is that every time one must do something, one must find it in English.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of all Members, I take a highly practical view on Irish language policy and in general, I receive the blunt end of things from Irish language groups, who consider me to be namhaid &eacute;igin den teanga or, as has been stated publically to me many times, treasonous towards the language.  Stories are carried regularly in Irish language newspapers that I am no friend to the language.  I take a practical view and the Minister should do likewise.  It is not unreasonable for people in Gaeltacht areas to request that the RTE website should carry a significant amount of Irish.  I would like to hear an argument against this proposal that reflects the views the Minister holds towards Gaeilge and the Gaeltacht.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh?  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag r&aacute; go gcaithfidh gach focal ar an website sin a bheith i nGaeilge.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin at&aacute; i gceist agam.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach mbeadh ruda&iacute; i nGaeilge ann?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil duine ann chun a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil ruda&iacute; curtha ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge? When using Google and having entered a website in French that I do not understand, I simply can choose the translation option and change it over.  I do not understand the reason one cannot ensure such a facility is used to its greatest extent because entire sections of the Bill constitute a recognition go bhfuil muintir Gaeltachta&iacute; na t&iacute;re seo mar shaor&aacute;naigh na t&iacute;re seo.  T&aacute; ceart ar leith acu.  T&aacute; freagracht orainn an Ghaeilge a chur a f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh agus a gcult&uacute;r f&eacute;in a chur ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh.  Caithfimid a bheith cinnte go bhfuil go leor sa reachta&iacute;ocht seo do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  However, I refer to muintir na Gaeltachta in particular.</P>
        <P>Members have a job to do in this regard and I do not seek the expenditure of significant sums of money.  I visited a Gaeltacht school last Monday morning and spoke to people there.  D&eacute;antar gach cuid oibre as Gaeilge sa scoil sin.  All the speeches were made tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  There was an offical opening of the school.  Bh&iacute; gach rud d&eacute;anta tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  However, the school continues to struggle to teach the Irish language because half of the children attending it have satellite television at home, as they should.  They have access to BBC, ITV and the other channels.  This is as it should be and I am not one of those zealots who believes such programmes should not be allowed into the Gaeltacht.  People there should enjoy a full quality of life.  However, there can be problems muna bhfuil seans acu an Ghaeilge a bheith acu.  TG4 was a great gift to them.  I sat on this seat in the Chamber approximately 15 years ago making the case for an Irish language television station and it was ridiculed by many people who stated it could never be viable, there was no case for it, etc.  It has been a massive success.  At that <Col N="430"/>time, support for the idea of investing &pound;5 million into the establishment of what was being loosely called Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeltachta, came from me and a young Senator called &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Subsequently, this evolved into what nowadays is called TG4.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is creativity in the Gaeltacht.  The attitude on the east coast, when discussing or considering the Gaeltachta&iacute;, is almost patronising.  People almost look down on them.  However, people there are as bright as anywhere else in Ireland.  Moreover, they offer a new perspective on matters because they bring a bilingual or bipolar culture.  T&aacute; siad ag f&eacute;achaint ar ghn&eacute;ithe eile de ruda&iacute;.  T&aacute; treoir agus d&iacute;ri&uacute; eile acu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna leis an d&iacute;ri&uacute; a bheith acu ar an mB&eacute;arla.  They have both an English and an Irish approach to matters.  They possess an Irish language culture based in the Gaeltacht and can bring it to bear on what they do.  It is highly disappointing for such people and for me that simple proposals on issues such as making an Irish language website available to them are refused.  These are not difficult matters.</P>
        <P>In addition, some of my other amendments were tabled to recognise the responsibility for the Irish language.  The organisation is not simply there to facilitate, as its purpose also is to stimulate and promote.  As such matters are not easily measurable or quantifiable, why do they pose difficulties to the Minister?  I refer to amendment No. 18, in which I suggest that instead of facilitating Gaelic culture, the phrase &ldquo;stimulate and promote&rdquo; should be used.  Does the Minister object to this?  He made an impassioned contribution in the House on Committee Stage about the proposed film channel, which impressed all Members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thought of him at the weekend when looking at the cl&aacute;r or timetable for the Hay-on-Wye festival, which finished two weeks ago, one section of which was devoted to the showing of community film.  It was along the lines mentioned by the Minister.  The festival, which is based in Wales, ensured that without being overwhelmed, space was given for the development of Welsh culture.  Consequently, the festival was not simply facilitating Welsh culture; it was promoting and stimulating it. C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil an rud c&eacute;anna ar f&aacute;il againn anseo?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuilimid s&aacute;sta tac&uacute; le sin?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th a bhfuil deacracht ag an Aire sa mh&eacute;id seo?  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta taca&iacute;ocht leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; mholadh agam i leas&uacute; Uimh. 18?</P>
        <P>In deference to the House, as I have raised many of these issues on Committee Stage, I will not go through them again.  It would be unfair to subject Members to my views in this regard again.  I recognise and welcome the small amount of progress that has been made, particularly in respect of the concession made in amendment No. 76, which in many ways was one of the most important issues to me.  I refer to recognising the Gaeltacht areas and the people of the Gaeltachta&iacute;.  However, the other amendments to which I refer are not major issues.  It would not be difficult to state the station would in some way promote and stimulate Irish language and culture. N&iacute; cheart go mbeadh deacracht ag an Aire sa mh&eacute;id seo.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn &eacute; a chur chun cinn.  T&aacute; freagracht orainn an rud seo a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith an rud &eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh tuiscint ag muintir na Gaeltachta, agus ag Gaeilgeoir&iacute; eile na t&iacute;re, go bhfuilimid ann d&oacute;ibh chomh maith.  That is without listening to every off-the-wall suggestion to translate every word we speak into the Irish language.  We are not going down that road because we can do something simple.</P>
        <P>Later on today we will be dealing with the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Bill 2007.  There was always an optional Irish language course to be pursued by people who were studying to be barristers.  It worked very well, and even people with no Gaeilge learned words like &ldquo;d&uacute;nmhar&uacute;&rdquo;, which was welcome.  At some stage someone decided that it would be used differently, and the exam was made almost impossible to pass.  The State is now enacting a Bill stating that it is no longer a requirement to pass the Irish exam, just an option.  When things are pushed too far, the State is forced to concede.  I am not asking that anything be done that will cause a major administrative problem, but it does require political will.  The cost base is <Col N="431"/>tiny, but the strategic importance to people who are promoting the policy of the Irish language is very important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Officials from different Departments normally talk to each other.  What did officials from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs think of my amendments?  Did they offer any view to the Minister present?  Surely it is in line with stated Government policy.  N&iacute;l aon rud &aacute; mholadh agamsa anseo nach bhfuil r&aacute;ite ag an Taoiseach mar gheall ar an nGaeilge &oacute; thoghadh sa jab nua &eacute;.  He has made it clear he is supportive of the Irish language.  I am trying to sidestep people who would push Irish down our throats and believe in compulsion.  I am trying to give the stage to people who are reasonable and to recognise that people in the Gaeltacht feel isolated, cut off, and do not feel represented and reflected in much of what we do.  There is a good reason for these policies, because it can be so expensive to implement them.

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag cur leis.  I am seconding what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said and his amendment.  It is very important that we promote the visibility of the Irish language, which is the key issue in our culture.  It is a great thing that documents are required to be translated into Irish.  If they are to be available in English, they should be available in Irish.  Many people complain about the expense of doing so, but the fact is very few people read State documents in English in the first place.  The really important thing in advancing Irish is to ensure it has high visibility in the culture.  That applies to bilingual forms available to the public and so on, but it is classically important that it be visible in areas that pertain to modern culture.</P>
        <P>A public body with a website primarily in English and with very little Irish language content, such as the RTE website, sends out all the wrong messages about our shared aspiration to promote a use of Irish that fits in with our contemporary experience.  There may be different arguments from officialdom about the expense involved, but unless we are serious about maintaining the visibility and the usability of Irish language in our modern experience, then we are not serious in our aspirations to promote it.  Is ar an mbun&uacute;s sin at&aacute; m&eacute; ag cur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Tuathail agus tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis as na molta&iacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh inniu.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to the points that were raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and he has acknowledged my amendment No. 76 as including representation from the Gaeltacht in the bodies we are creating.  RTE&rsquo;s website does include Irish language material, especially in its Irish language output.  The Bill also allows the use of public money on the website for the first time.  I would like to see the use of Irish developed on the website, recognising that it is a central part of the communications infrastructure for the public sector broadcaster.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14 is related to the website of the new authority.  The Official Languages Act 2003 allows the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to require a range of bodies, including the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, to set out a scheme on how it deals with the public through Irish.  There is a mechanism that makes sure we are involved in promoting the use of Irish in our everyday communications.</P>
        <P>I would be happy to consider amendment No. 18 and see whether we can introduce a similar amendment when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il.  It would reflect the desire to stimulate and promote the language rather than just to facilitate its use.  While I cannot accept either of the amendments as drafted, there is merit in what is being proposed.  I will reflect on what we have heard on the issue with a view to amending the Bill further in the D&aacute;il.  I hope that is satisfactory to Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I intended to call a vote on one of the amendments because I wanted to make a point about them.  I appreciate that the Minister is prepared to consider what I am talking about, particularly as regards amendment No. 18, to consider &ldquo;stimulate and promote&rdquo; in respect of the Irish language.  I take his point, incidentally, about amendment No. 14, which is concerned with the authority, etc.  I used it in order to get the matter stated.  It was the most convenient place to do it, so that was the practical reason I put it there. </P>
        <P Just="Left">An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; domsa n&aacute; go mbeadh Gaelainn ar f&aacute;il agus go mbeadh s&eacute; de ch&uacute;ram ar an RTE Authority chun Ghaelainn a chur chun cinn agus cult&uacute;r na Gaelainne chomh maith.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach domsa.  Mar gheall ar sin, an rud a d&uacute;irt an tAire ansan, go mbeadh s&eacute; s&aacute;sta f&eacute;achaint ar amendment No. 18, where the word &ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; would be substituted by &ldquo;stimulate and promote&rdquo;.  I welcome that initiative.  If he can find better words and there is some reluctance to use those particular words, I shall be happy to defer.</P>
        <P>The issue for me is that if people are speaking, learning and teaching the language, there should be facilities available, not just for teaching and education at school level, but to enable them to do other things, without difficulty.  If, as the Minister says, he is prepared to consider a change in the Bill to facilitate &ldquo;stimulate and promote&rdquo;, I accept his good offices in that regard and very much welcome this.  In the context of what he has already said about recognising the needs of Gaeltacht people, reflecting their needs and providing for a Gaeltacht view to be brought forward, I recognise that this is progress, however small.  Others may not be happy with it &mdash; and neither am I &mdash; but I recognise where we are going.  On that basis I shall not press amendment No. 14 and I thank the Minister for the openness of his response.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 17, in the names of Senators John Paul Phelan and Paul Bradford, is related to amendment No. 41 and they may be discussed together by agreement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 32, line 29, after &ldquo;disabilities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;requiring the use of sign language and subtitles&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister was present for most of Second Stage and possibly heard my comments on the issue of subtitling in particular.  Perhaps I sound like a long playing record on the issue of subtitling, but in dealing with this broadcasting Bill we must have high standards and set the bar as high as possible in this regard.  The subtitling of programmes heralded a major step forward for people hard of hearing across the country and indeed opened up the world of television for many.  It has to be recognised by the Minister and his officials, however, that the quantity and quality of subtitling, particularly on live programming such as news and current affairs broadcasting is not nearly as efficient as it should be.  I said on Second Stage that if one wants to realise how poor the service is, one can just turn down the volume on the 6 o&rsquo;clock or 9 o&rsquo;clock news bulletins, switch on the subtitles and try to follow the programme.  It will be very difficult to do so in the sense that the presenter will be five or ten seconds, in some cases, ahead of the subtitling.  Unfortunately, tens of thousands of people across the country must endure that level of service, and it is not good enough.  When we have an opportunity to legislate in respect of broadcasting services for the disabled, we should apply maximum pressure to ensure the best possible subtitling standards.</P>
        <P>From observing how the service works on other channels, whether the BBC, ITV or the Sky channels, I note that the situation on those is not much better to any extent.  Again, I believe it is a question of the amount of resources that broadcasting companies are willing to invest in this regard.  At a time when technology has made enormous advances and we are about to send men and women to Mars, it should not be impossible to have a top-class subtitling service for all those who need it.  I appreciate where the Minister is coming from and his earlier comments on the matter.  However, since we have the opportunity to make clear our demand that both the quantity and quality of subtitling should be much better than it is at present, I hope he will respond in a reasonable manner to the amendment.  It is a reasonable request, not for any minority group, but rather for a growing sector of society &mdash; mainly, though not entirely elderly people &mdash; to which we have a responsibility to provide these services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Bradford&rsquo;s amendment.  I did not contribute on Committee Stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly is unavoidably absent today, so I am replacing him, but I agree with the sentiment expressed by Senator Bradford with regard to subtitling.  I take a slightly different view, however, as regards what is available in Ireland compared to what is on offer from across the water.  The slight  amount of television that any politician gets to view might comprise an hour, perhaps, after coming home from some meeting or other.  However, I sometimes watch the BBC 3 or BBC 4 channels.  The standard of subtitling on their current affairs and documentary programmes is far superior to what is available in this country.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said that he hoped he could examine this issue for Report Stage and that it might be possible to insert a provision requiring the broadcasting authority to report on subtitling.  This amendment is about trying to formalise the position of subtitling.  This is an appropriate time to raise the issue.  I hope the Minister can take it on board because the current situation, particularly with regard to live sporting events, but also current affairs, as Senator Bradford has mentioned, is very unsatisfactory.  A significant improvement is <Col N="434"/>required as a great many people have viewing difficulties.  We have come a long way, and there has been significant improvement.  A number of programmes are available now with subtitles.</P>
        <P>However, some channels, particular the independent television stations in this country, have very poor subtitling standards and this is an apt provision to insert into the Bill to improve on those.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We had an interesting discussion on Committee Stage.  When Senator O&rsquo;Reilly raised amendment No. 17 on Committee Stage, proposing a change to the objectives, I expressed the view that this had already been sufficiently dealt with elsewhere.  I do not want to accept this amendment, but I said then that we would look at how the Bill might be amended so that the issue of the quality of subtitling would be taken into account in the biennial reviews of the broadcasting access rules.  It is in that regard that we are proposing amendment No. 41, which sets out that &ldquo;the Authority shall consider the quality of services provided by broadcasters in endeavouring to comply with a broadcasting rule&rdquo;.  I hope that delivers what we have been talking about. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland would say that there is already consideration of the quality of subtitling in the assessment it does.  However, it is appropriate for us to set out that quality requirement in legislation, and that is the intent of amendment No. 41, arising from Committee Stage. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with interest to the Minister.  I concede amendment No. 41 will oblige the authority to consider the quality of services, such as subtitling, provided by broadcasters and report on them.  However, where is our imprint in the sense of imposing on the authority an obligation to mark and ensure progress?  It is okay for the authority to consider the quality of services and inform the Oireachtas of them.  However, is the Minister satisfied there is enough of an obligation on the authority to ensure services will be maximised and improved?</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan referred to several of the independent television channels.  TV3 does not have any subtitling for its productions except for imported programmes such as &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 17 seeks to strengthen the obligation of broadcasters to maximise subtitling from a quality and quantity perspective.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 41 but it only obliges the authority to report on progress in this respect.  I want a stronger demand to ensure progress.  I do not believe sufficient steps have been taken in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Quality, especially in communications, is a subjective area.  Amendment No. 41 gives clear direction to the broadcasting authority to consider the quality assurance two-year review.  This would be taken up by the authority and it would present its analysis.  Legislation does not need to be prescriptive to the nth degree.  A clear direction to consider the quality issues will lead to a report from the authority on the improvement or lack of performance in quality issues.  There is sufficient direction in amendment No. 41 to give the authority direction in this regard, as suggested by Members on the Opposition side of the House on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The Bill also requires the authority to establish access rules.  The requirement of a consultation on quality would have to be taken into account with these rules.  It would also be included in any public consultation which the authority would be required to take out in regard to the rules in section 44.  Broadcasters must comply with these rules.  Inserting the requirement that the quality of services be considered by the authority will trigger different responses which will be included in the consideration of the success, or otherwise, of those rules.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 33, to delete lines 5 to 17 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) prepare a strategy for the provision of broadcasting services in the State additional to those provided by RTE, TG4, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel, the Irish Film Channel, and the Heritage Channel,</P><Col N="436"/>
        <?oasys _fp ?><P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) prepare a strategy statement under <i>section 29(1)</i>,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) direct the Contract Awards Committee to make arrangements, in accordance with this Act, to invite, consider and recommend to the Authority, and the Authority shall follow such recommendation, proposals for the provision of broadcasting services additional to any broadcasting services provided by RTE, TG4, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel, the Irish Film Channel and the Heritage Channel under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 20 is related to amendments Nos. 22, 62 and 107.  All these amendments relate to my proposal to include a heritage channel in the Bill as it provides for two new channels, an Irish film channel and a Houses of the Oireachtas channel, within the broadcasting services to be made available in the new digital service.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 30, 59 and 82, relate to the issue of service provision targeted at the needs, interests and tastes of older people.  The fact that this group of amendments includes amendments relating to the needs, tastes and issues relating to older people, should not be taken as meaning that the heritage channel aims exclusively to cater for the interests and tastes of older people.  I must confess that part of the inspiration for this proposal has been my observations when visiting places such as nursing homes, which have an overall national population of 25,000, many of whom rely on television as a source of company.  We might not be happy with the fact that in some places, television may be among the few outlets for people but the fact remains that in general, as people get older, television can be an increasingly important support in their lives.</P>
        <P>The proposal to establish a television broadcasting service to be known as the Heritage Channel, is an attempt to redress the current situation where a certain kind of quality television programming that could be regarded as family-friendly viewing or programming that could be watched by any person of any age or background at any hour of the day, is not available on RTE.  I have had the experience of being in nursing homes and seeing people being forced to watch &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo;, in the late afternoon.  This is fine if that is their choice.  However, the number of older people in society is increasing and there should be a greater range of choice available to reflect the life experiences of older viewers in particular.</P>
        <P>When I proposed this amendment on Committee Stage, I was gratified by the support on all sides of the House and outside in the media and generally.  The heritage channel would address the interests, not just of older people but of sectors of the community such as the Irish abroad or tourists visiting the country.  It would draw on much of our archival footage and the wonderful documentaries made over the years.  However, it would not just be about the past but would also draw on our tremendous cultural and entertainment heritage such as traditional music.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal for an Irish film channel as this will be attractive to a certain audience.  Like Lyric FM and the Houses of the Oireachtas channel, those channels would address the interests of niche groups but they are no less welcome for that.  The heritage channel would be of more popular appeal because it would appeal to older people if it focused on their interests and tastes and if it included not only archival programmes but also programmes made for the channel.  It could also appeal to people visiting the country and people of all ages would be attracted by programming which would draw on our considerable television archive of documentary and entertainment programmes.</P>
        <P>Certain programmes available currently are very good and popular, such as &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;.  I do not deny that RTE currently caters to some extent for people who are interested in this type of programming but the problem is they are only hitting it in spots.  Why have channels dealing with Irish film and the Houses of the Oireachtas and not something that could <Col N="437"/>appeal to a much wider section of society?  Some of these people may be less politically influential but they are certainly large in number.</P>
        <P>I would worry that in the broadcasting of programmes and in the decisions made about programme content, there might be excessive attention paid to the economic bottom line, that the classes of people with high spend potential might be more likely to see their tastes reflected in broadcasting output than those who are less lucrative from an advertiser&rsquo;s point of view.  It is entirely appropriate that legislators should seek to put the &ldquo;public&rdquo; back into public service broadcasting by ensuring there would be at least one channel with programming that anybody could watch at any hour of the day.  This is the impetus behind the heritage channel and this is provided for in amendment No. 107.  The other amendments are procedural amendments.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the amendment.  This is not solely about the issues, needs and tastes of older persons, many of whom will be quite happy to watch &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo;, but we wish to guarantee a certain level of high quality programming that is appealing and accessible to a range of people, regardless of their stage of life, independence or vulnerability.</P>
        <P>The thrust of the other amendments Nos. 30, 59 and 82, relate to the need to provide for a certain minimum content of programming aimed at people over 65 years.  Amendment No. 30 proposes that in the case of sound broadcasting, a minimum of not less than 10% of the broadcasting time should be devoted to the broadcasting of programmes for people over 65 years.  Amendment No. 59 is related to the same issue and provides that in considering the suitability of any applicant for the award of a broadcasting contract to provide a broadcasting service in respect of an area in which more than 10% of the population is over 65, the contract awards committee should have particular regard to the needs of this population in respect of programming content.  Amendment No. 82 proposes an amendment to section 101 to provide for the inclusion of a clause (<i>b</i>) to provide that the nature and number of hours of television programming aimed at people over 65 years to be broadcast by the corporation, be taken into account in that section.</P>
        <P>The question of these amendments relating to programming directed at older people is related to the issue of the heritage channel but the channel goes beyond that issue.  I am pleased the Minister has chosen to be specific in this legislation and he has not just left matters to broadcasting codes but rather he has been very specific in section 96, which deals with the audience council.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is specific mention made of children, their interests, needs and tastes and a provision for consultation on these matters.  I am pleased the Minister takes a personal interest in the advertising of junk food and he has rightly brought that issue onto the agenda with this Bill.  Once there are specific proposals about these matters, if one is not specific about other equally important matters, by implication they are deemed to be less important.  We should not leave it to the discretion of RTE, in the case of the heritage channel, to make that decision as to whether that would be suitable programming.  Our job is to legislate and to have regard to the interests of the entire community, not just those who are economically powerful.  We must listen carefully to what are their needs and try to specify them in this legislation.  On that basis I ask the Minister for a favourable response.  M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to challenge the ruling of the Acting Chairman but I do not believe amendment No. 21 is necessarily an alternative to amendment No. 20.  If amendment No. 20 is put to the House and lost, there is no reason amendment No. 21 cannot be put to the House and either <Col N="438"/>won or lost.  Amendment No. 21 only becomes a substitute for amendment No. 20 if the vote, which one chooses to put, is &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;  That is what I am querying, however.  That does not need to be the vote.  We are proposing amendment No. 20, which can be put forward in its own right.  If it is defeated it then allows me to put forward amendment No. 21.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.  In the event of amendment No. 20 being defeated, all that will happen is that we will have decided not to delete lines five to 17.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to change one of those lines, line 14. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>In the event of a division being called on amendment No. 20, the question to be determined by the House is that all the words from section 26(<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) stand.  Therefore that renders amendment No. 21 redundant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct but when I second amendment No. 20 why can the vote not be on that amendment?  Why is the vote on the wording &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand.&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Indeed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to second amendment No. 20 tabled by Senator Mullen.  In doing so, I wish to address some of the other issues.  I will begin with a story.  On Sunday night, in my home town of Dingle, I was out with one of the youngest people I know.  We had a few pints, went for a meal and had great fun.  He is 93 years of age and I do not think he would have liked Senator Mullen&rsquo;s speech inferring that something happens when one reaches the age of 65.  I completely accept Senator Mullen&rsquo;s good offices on the age issue but it is very close to being ageist.  I see where he is coming from and appreciate what he is trying to do.  He is right that there should be something which reflects the views of every group in the population.  I entered public life back in the 1970s and one of the first major rows I had was in 1981 when a Minister decided that four-year-old children could not go to school.  I did not like that much and still do not like age divisions on anything.</P>
        <P>I take all the argumentation that Senator Mullen has made in favour of reflecting elderly people in programming.  I completely agree with that but I have a real difficulty with the age limit of 65.  I am approaching that age rapidly myself, so perhaps I have a personal interest.  We are all approaching it at the same rate, but some of us will arrive at it more quickly.  I was trying to think what I would do if I was given the brief to implement the amendment as a broadcaster.  I do not know.  Senator Mullen mentioned certain programmes, such as &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;, and I could mention &ldquo;Laochra Gael&rdquo; and &ldquo;GAA Gold&rdquo; on TG4, which are retrospective.  Young people are as interested in those programmes as older people, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, including the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the heritage channel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a different section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with the heritage issue.  I am referring purely to the requirement to find programming to deal with people over 65 years of age.  The heritage one is very clear and I fully support it.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on it.  The earlier point on amendment No. 20 is important and I completely agree with the points made by Senator Mullen on that and other issues.</P>
        <P>I missed some of the debate on Committee Stage but I am intrigued.  As a person who is interested in language, I am happy to see amendments which replace the word &ldquo;people&rdquo; with &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister will explain the reasons for that change in amendments Nos. 77 and 79, which substitute the term &ldquo;young persons&rdquo; for &ldquo;young people&rdquo;.  I am sure there is a good reason for that.  I love it when we examine such changes because accuracy in languages is very important in order to live life together.  It is for the same reason that I have some difficulty with the ageist view of the other amendment.  The Minister is rapidly looking for his brief on this question and has clearly not given it much thought in the meantime.</P>

	<P>I look forward to learning why young people have become young persons.  Pope John Paul II came from Rome in 1979 but he did not say &ldquo;Young persons of Ireland, I love you&rdquo;; he said &ldquo;Young people of Ireland, I love you&rdquo;.  Was he wrong?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="441"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief because it has been a long discussion so far.  I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s support of Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment, particularly concerning the heritage channel, which is a very good idea.  I watched most of the debate on Committee Stage and I find myself in complete accord with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposal.  He proposed that we could perhaps watch Galway winning an All Ireland hurling match, which could be dusted off in the archives.  More seriously, there is great merit in the proposal for a heritage channel.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I hope the Minister can take the idea on board.  There is a whole market for such programming.  Previous speakers have mentioned that RTE and other broadcasters touch on spots on heritage issues.</P>
        <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas channel is a very good idea which I welcome wholeheartedly, together with the film channel.  If we are developing niche channels, however, I agree with Senator Mullen that a heritage channel would have a much broader potential audience.  Contrary to Senator Mullen, I do not see any particular problem.  I never get to see programmes like &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo; or &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo;.  Perhaps we could have done with Judge Judy earlier to adjudicate on the procedural issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We did so well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not casting aspersions.  There is much greater potential in the area of a heritage channel.  Many people right across the board, not just people over the age of 65 or 93, would be interested in archive footage as well as new programming specifically designed for such a new channel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage I supported the idea of the heritage channel.  It would be a good idea for our culture, music, national games and history.  As has been stated already, &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo; appeals to all generations.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen&rsquo;s point is important as well.  There are people who in the main are probably retired who will look at television during the daytime when much of the canned stuff shown is rubbish.  It is merely filler, simply because the viewing population is down.  People are entitled to better than that.</P>
        <P>I am also reminded that since we had the debate in the House, a few people, including a person who interviewed me on radio, made the point that they would really like to see a heritage channel.  The interviewer thought it would be a brilliant idea.  I do not think he was even following our debate as his was something of an off-the-cuff comment.  It would be fertile ground for the independent television producers to get to grips with and perhaps RTE would be in a position to commission good programmes in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is a good development in this area that we are moving towards having channels such as a Houses of the Oireachtas channel.  I would urge the Minister to see how this can be done, even on a phased basis.  The transmission time could be limited to an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon, but at least there would be an initial step made in that direction so that one of the initiatives that would have been taken through this good Bill would be the potential for a heritage channel as we move forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the amendments in a general fashion.  In particular, the issue of the heritage channel has been discussed previously on Second and Committee Stages.  It would allow an opportunity for production and for film-makers to respond to an obviously growing market.</P>
        <P>Frequently, we debate the promotion of the Irish language and the way it is taught at school level.  We remark often that while the language, as a subject, does not appear to be as strong as it should be, all the aspects surrounding it such as culture, heritage and history are going <Col N="442"/>from strength to strength.  There is considerable, ongoing and increased public interest in Irish heritage and culture.  I am one of those who feel that if there was a subject of Irish heritage or Irish culture on the curriculum, it would be a great success.  However, that is a matter for another debate on another day.</P>
        <P>The concept of a heritage channel would allow much fresh thinking to come to the fore.  Often we hear of the need to respond to the marketplace.  Broadcasting should not always be about the marketplace, but in my view there is a market for this type of channel.  The Minister spoke eloquently previously about his thoughts as to how the film channel could be developed, and I hope he would be prepared to give the same sort of thinking and space to the possibility of a heritage channel because there is a need for it.</P>
        <P>On the question of broadcasting provisions and programming for people over 65, I was impressed with the initial contribution of Senator Mullen but, in the typical political view of matters on the one hand and on the other hand, I was also impressed with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bradford sounds like Senator Cassidy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sounding like our dear Leader.  I know where Senator O&rsquo;Toole is coming from.  I recall raising the concept of older people and people over 65 with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs five or six years ago.  I must take full credit for this as my only political achievement over 20 years, having the term old age pension taken out of the directory of social welfare and replaced by State pension.</P>
        <P>While this question of what is old and defining people beyond a certain age as being old is difficult, we know deep down that there is a market for programmes for people of maturing years.  Whether it is &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo;, programmes on the GAA of old or whatever, there is great interest in such programming.  In the course of any politician&rsquo;s day in the constituency, one visits the houses of elderly people late in the evening and often they remark that there is nothing on television.  It would be helpful if we could gear a degree of programming to that market.  I appreciate that this market is difficult to pin down and to define.  We know what we want to do but the journey is probably unmapped.  Perhaps it is a principle to which we must aspire rather than a prescription.  It is an amendment worthy of reflection.</P>
        <P>We also discussed subtitling.  Senior citizens, mature people or retired people have a little time on their hands and television can be a useful form of entertainment and window to the world for them.  We should try to respond to the needs of such people, especially elderly people living alone, and fill some of the gaps that may exist in their lives by having programming which would appeal to them.  There are so many channels available, even on the domestic market, with the independent channel, the RTE channels, TG4, and now perhaps a film channel and the heritage channel.  There should be space on the broadcasting spectrum for designing a degree of scheduling to facilitate these undefinable people.  I hope the Minister will at least take the spirit of the amendment on board and respond to it in the most practical and positive way possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>To respond to Senator Bradford, I do take the spirit of it in the sense that we need public sector broadcasting to present programming to the various publics, and to ensure that it is not always on the basis of commercial return and it looks after specific audiences.  I also have the sense that programming which dips into the our heritage, especially archive programming, would make very interesting viewing, not just for the elderly but also for younger people who are often at home during the summer holidays or at other times.  It is not being prescriptive in terms of the age catered for by such heritage programming.</P><Col N="443"/>
        <P>If I outline the evolving framework as I see it and where any such programming or channel, as one might call it would fit in, it would explain why I would not at the same time accept the amendments.  We are developing a new digital television platform.  Within it, the structures which we are following involve a MUX, to use the technical term.  The MUX is a platform for public free-to-air programming.  Separately, we will have three platforms, probably working on a co-ordinated basis, which will be commercial programming or certainly provided by an operator or combination of operators who will have a VICS, a variety of pay-per-view and free-to-air programming.</P>
        <P>The first public free-to-air platform will include stations such as RTE 1, RTE 2, TV3, TG4 and also two new channels that are prescribed in the legislation, an Oireachtas channel and a film channel, but it does not end there.  There is the space within that digital platform for an estimated further two platforms, depending on the technology of the transmission equipment.  Within that, there is real scope, for RTE in particular, to see what additional channels it might provide.</P>
        <P>There is a fundamental difference between our film channel and the Oireachtas channel and any such additional services.  First, the archive in the case of the film channel is held by the Irish Film Institute.  It is far more appropriate that it is not an RTE managed service and that it is separately managed by an agency such as the film institute which has access to the resources, has or could develop the facilities, and which is the instigator of the concept.  I am legislating to allow the film institute to introduce such a channel.</P>
        <P>Likewise, the Oireachtas channel will be different from the type of channel RTE might decide to evolve using archive material.  The broadcasting material available for it is available here.  The channel would be fundamentally directed and developed under the guise and aegis of the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than any broadcaster.  It recognises that it is for that reason we are legislating for the Oireachtas and the film channels.</P>
        <P>Development within the wider range of channels available, either on a commercial or a free-to-air basis, is for public or commercial broadcasters to decide.  It is not appropriate for us to legislate for the detail of such additional channels which may be provided within this new digital area.  RTE already seems very active in terms of providing programming which reflects the interests and needs of various demographics.  I understand 62% of the over-five demographic watch public service broadcasting channels during peak hours.  It is not that it is not providing a service for those people.</P>
        <P>I hope the Senator will at least be pleased to note the proposed amendment No. 79 which gives the audience council the power to survey elderly people from time to time to ascertain their views and interests as regards public service broadcasting.  We are not ignoring that audience but are specifically allowing for the audience council to do what is most appropriate, namely, to survey to find out what people want.</P>
        <P>On Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s question on some of the textual changes, we are of the view that our amendment is better English than the previous one.  That alone is the reason for the change in the wording.  However, we are open to anyone else&rsquo;s interpretation of the language.  On amendments Nos. 21 and 23, which propose to mention the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; specifically in regard to additional broadcasting services, I do not regard this as necessary as the current provision does not distinguish between languages and is all-encompassing.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the debate we have had.  Other than amendments Nos. 77 to 79, inclusive, which I propose, I cannot accept the Senators&rsquo; amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I have great respect for him but I do not believe the arguments he has made in which he seeks to distinguish between the <Col N="444"/>case for an Irish film channel and a Houses of the Oireachtas channel and a proposal, such as mine, for a heritage channel holds up.  If I understand the Minister correctly, he seems to be saying that because the Irish Film Institute is somehow external to RTE and has an archive of its own and because the Houses of the Oireachtas is not located in Montrose and, therefore, is somehow in a different location, it is commendable or acceptable to require in legislation that those channels be provided and facilitated but because a heritage channel could be provided by RTE from its own resources or from drawing on resources from independent producers, that is somehow different.  I do not understand that argument.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister not already conceded the principle that legislators should be allowed to be specific?  For example, the advertising of junk food is not left to the codes the same way as other issues are left to them.  The Minister has been specific on that issue in legislation.  He has conceded the point that legislators can be specific.  What kind of philosophy of legislation do we have if we decide that bodies such as RTE have to be left to themselves to decide and that for legislators to intervene and be specific is somehow inappropriate?  We are the elected representatives of the people.  We are entitled to identify lacunae where they exist and to be specific and to say to RTE that it has not done something, that it might or might not do it in the future, that it might or might not be in hock to advertising interests and that it might or might not have a director general or staff who are very conscious of the needs of an ageing sector of society but that we will take the chance that it will do the right thing some time in the future.  Is that not a very demeaning attitude to take to our Legislature?  Why can we not be specific and prescribe that something should happen if we all agree it is a good idea?</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is sincere in making the distinction that the Irish Film Institute has an external archive.  I will go back to my original point.  Logic should prevail here.  The provision of an Irish film channel will appeal to a certain number of people.  It will not particularly appeal to people who do not have a huge appetite for films or to those who do not have a long concentration span.  I would watch it some of the time but there will be many people who will benefit from the provision of a day long service or, as Senator Paul Bradford said, a service for part of the day, which provides viewing that is inclusive rather than niche.  Will the Minister reconsider even at this stage?  This Bill will not pass through the D&aacute;il before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>I wish to address what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  I would be the last person who would want to promote anything construed as ageist.  His example of his 93 year old friend is very well taken.  What that example illustrates is that we should not presume that everybody&rsquo;s experience of life is the same.  Some people will be very active into advanced years and they are the people who will be able to press the button and choose &ldquo;Judge Judy&rdquo; if they want to do so.</P>

The only reason I chose the age of 65 was that it is the normal retirement age.  Senator Paul Bradford very generously acknowledged the general truth we all know that as people grow older, their tastes change and that as they move towards retirement, they have different uses for their time and for many of them, television will be part of that.  The more active people are, perhaps the less part television will play.</P>
        <P>I do not find the distinction persuasive.  I do not believe anyone would disagree that the heritage channel would reach a wider section of the population, which would appreciate what it would provide, than the Houses of the Oireachtas channel or the Irish film channel, welcome as they are.  It is our right and duty to legislate for specifics and not to leave them to other <Col N="445"/>bodies which are beyond our direct control to make the decisions we know need to be made.

	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 38, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The levy referred to in <i>subsection 15</i> shall be capped at a maximum annual figure to be determined by the Minister, following consultation with both the Authority and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Such levy will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to impose a check in the system of how the levy will be used by the new broadcasting authority; that the Minister, in consultation with the relevant Oireachtas committee and the authority, be permitted to cap the levy at a maximum amount and that their discussions and deliberations and the levy be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation.</P>
        <P>The issue was discussed on Committee Stage.  The amendment seeks to impose a check and a balance to ensure that the levy, which is set at a relatively low level, does not increase dramatically into the future.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure there is discussion and scrutiny of any proposed increase in the levy.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment relates to the levy imposed on broadcasters by the BAI to meet its expenses.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, I believe the levy is justified and appropriate.  Also, the BAI should not seek, through a levy on broadcasters, to obtain funds greater than those it requires.</P>
        <P>As I outlined on Committee Stage, the legislation places sufficient strictures on the BAI in this regard.  In the case of regulators, for most sectors funded by a levy, it is not standard practise for the Minister to have powers to cap that levy.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  However, I believe that accountability in regard to levies is important and I will ask my officials to consider this matter further before the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not.  Attention to detail is important.  I appreciate what is being done here.</P>
        <P>TG4 is a minority station dealing with a minority group.  It is ludicrous to require it to pay such a levy.  It does not make sense that it could be subject to a levy.  I accept that under the section as drafted, a levy could be imposed from which TG4 could be exempted.  I would like it to be explicitly provided that it would not have to cope with such a levy.  TG4 is struggling and is producing programmes on a shoestring.  Many of us in this House have dealt with TG4 over the years and there is no fat in the station&rsquo;s programme production.  It does a fabulous job against all the odds.  It is unfair that they might be subject to the levy.  It would be easy for the Minister to accept this amendment and say that TG4 should be excluded.  I will not go on at length.  I know the Minister supports the station and such support is universal around the House.  I ask him therefore to give it some clarity and space, and a bit of rope to ensure it will not be held subject to a levy at any time in the future.  This should not be left to the discretion of a broadcasting authority or any other group but should be simply by decision of the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must go back to the fundamentals of the Bill.  One of the basic principles was that we wanted to have a level playing pitch between public sector broadcasters and commercial, independent and community broadcasters.  In those circumstances it would be inappropriate, where a levy is to be applied, to fund the regulation of that level playing field in order that it would apply to one broadcaster and not to another.  It is much fairer, more equitable and justifiable for it to be applied across the board.  In that context, the levy can be kept at a low level in order that it does not hamper excessively any one broadcaster.  I cannot accept the amendment because it goes against the fundamental principle of the Bill. </P>
        <P>I  acknowledge the Senator&rsquo;s instinct in terms of wishing to preserve or strengthen TG4 in whatever provisions we set out in the Bill.  That is something with which I agree and I was pleased to see in last year&rsquo;s budget, in difficult economic times, that my Department was able to achieve a significant increase in funding for TG4, above the overall level of increased funding across other Departments.  The process of TG4 funding has been determined over a number of years.  I do not believe it is appropriate, nor that it would be easier, for us to change direction in terms of the structure and funding characteristics of the station at this time.  We need time to give it solid back up to allow it expand its audience and to recognise that it has a commercial revenue stream and not completely dependent on funding from the Exchequer.  In this fast-changing broadcasting market, however, as we move towards digital television, we need a period of stability and sound resources for TG4.  That can be provided under current provisions and this Bill does not seek to change again the direction for the broadcaster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand what the Minister is saying but I do not agree, for two reasons.  First, even though TG4 is a State-owned broadcaster, a large percentage of its programming is made by independent producers and companies, many of them in Gaeltacht areas and surviving on a shoestring.  More importantly, the station is a fragile flower and needs the support of the State and our support as it continues.  I regret the Minister will not accept the amendment.  I will not, however, press it.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos 27, 28 and 84 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
        </Speaker><P>Government amendment No. 27:</P><Col N="448"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 41, line 14, to delete &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;as soon as may be but not later than 6 months after the end of the financial year to which they relate&rdquo;.</P>
            <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I appreciate Senator Quinn&rsquo;s concerns and I understand the thinking behind amendment No. 28.  I agree that best practice dictates that annual reports and accounts should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas without delay upon completion of the audit.  I do not accept, however, that the timeframe proposed in this amendment would necessarily achieve such an end result.  The proposed date, 30 April, might not allow sufficient time after the end of the financial year for the authority to have prepared its accounts and for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have completed its audit.  As such, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 28 as tabled.</P>
        <P>I propose, however, to accept amendments Nos. 27 and 84 which will amend sections 37(4) and 109(4) to specify that the accounts and the report of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, RTE and TG4 must be presented to the Minister as soon as may be but not later than six months after the end of the financial year to which they relate.  The purpose of this amendment is to assure that the Oireachtas will see the accounts concerned within a reasonable timeframe which was a fundamental concern articulated by the Senator during Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for accepting the principle of the point I made which was, as he recognised, about good practice.  It is good business practice and I love to see that practice initiated into all legislation in order that State companies have the same practice that is commonplace elsewhere.  I accept the textual change to read &ldquo;six months&rdquo;.  I put down &ldquo;four months&rdquo; in the hope of being able to achieve it because we would like to see that improvement over the years but I accept entirely what the Minister said.  He has taken the concept towards which I aimed.  </P>
        <P>I would love to see this period shortened as time goes on and to set a marker that whenever a Bill is drafted for a new State institution that this period would become progressively earlier.  The large banks publish their accounts within days of the end of the year and some of the largest multinational companies publish theirs on a quarterly basis.  It is possible to achieve better than we have done in the past and this is a considerable improvement.</P>
        <P>As an example of what I have in mind, which I touched on briefly on Committee Stage, when I was chairman of An Post, we did our best to hand the accounts to the Minister in question and to the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months.  Sometimes the Minister was tempted to sit on them for some time, although obviously that was not the present Minister.  My aim in asking for four months was to achieve that timeframe.  I am happy the Minister has taken on board the point and I believe we will benefit as a nation by having better standards in State companies.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 44, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P><Col N="449"/>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(7) A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement, promoting alcoholic beverages, which is aimed at minors. A broadcaster shall not broadcast an advertisement promoting alcoholic beverages before 9pm. Any advertisements for alcoholic beverages shall not encourage immoderate consumption of such products. A broadcaster will ensure prior to transmission that any such advertisements conform with appropriate broadcasting codes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
	<P FLI="0">The issue here concerns broadcasting and the advertising of alcohol which is of real concern.  I oppose censorship whenever I see it.  I have found myself in a situation here, however, where I can see the other side of this matter.  Sporting organisations deal with this matter on a regular basis.  I declare an interest here as I am involved in the management committee and am a director of the GAA.  It is fair to say that my colleagues at senior level in the GAA feel that broadcasting of drink advertising should not be allowed and should not be associated with sporting activities.  As long as it is permitted, however, people cannot walk away from it because if they do they are turning away from necessary sponsorship money.  This is a classic example of an issue on which the Oireachtas must regulate.  It is similar to the introduction of employment equality in 1977.  The playing pitch must be levelled and the only way to do that is to take on board these matters.  Other European countries have done this.  </P>
        <P>What I propose here is a regulation banning such advertising before 9.00 p.m.  Surely it is not unreasonable to ask that there would be no broadcast promotion of alcoholic beverages before that time.  Amendment No. 35, in the name of Senator Norris and myself, goes a little beyond that and attaches a fine.  I cannot add to the debate because we have all discussed it over the years.  However, the manner in which society controls and presents alcohol consumption must be considered.  Having reached a certain level of maturity, it would be appropriate for us to ban the advertising of alcohol before 9 p.m., or ban it altogether.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  There have been several discussions in the House on alcohol-related issues.  As a nation, we have an issue with alcohol and cannot afford to ignore it in any relevant legislation that passes through the House.  I am involved with sports organisations, particularly the GAA, and know valuable revenue is collected through the advertising of alcohol.  It is ironic that a child cannot be in a public house after 9 p.m. but can watch advertisements showing people enjoying alcohol on television before that time.  Amendment No. 33 is therefore a reasonable suggestion.</P>
        <P>I concur with the sentiments of amendment No. 35.  We need to set a standard and did so by banning tobacco advertising in Ireland some years ago.  Tobacco advertising is not permitted in most countries, certainly in the European Union and even further afield.  We need to take the bull by the horns regarding alcohol advertising.  As a nation with issues regarding alcohol, we could take a step in the right direction by adopting much tougher guidelines and legislation on alcohol advertising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the concept behind the two amendments.  I recognise there is a problem with instituting a ban on advertising in one country that does not apply in the rest of the world.  If Sky, UTV and other channels were allowed to advertise alcohol, the advertising revenue from companies that would otherwise advertise in the Irish media would be lost.  The revenue would go abroad and, therefore, any step taken must be on an international basis.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to note what Senator Phelan said about tobacco advertising.  I was in Germany last week and was rather surprised to see advertisements for tobacco, including cigarettes.  I had not seen any in recent times and consequently I realise the ban is not EU-wide.</P><Col N="450"/>
        <P>I would love the Government to take a step &mdash; I am not sure what it is &mdash; to discourage the promotion and advertising of alcohol.  We cannot do it in Ireland alone because steps must be taken on a broader scale.  I proposed two years ago and again last year that there be a levy of 100% on all advertising of alcohol such that the proceeds of each advertisement would be devoted to enthusiastic anti-alcohol advertising.  This would contrast with the half-hearted effort of the drinks companies.</P>
        <P>This is not a matter for today.  While the two amendments are aiming in the right direction, it is not possible to achieve what they seek at this stage because the issue needs to be handled at a European level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Quinn on this issue.  Banning advertising of alcohol on RTE and other Irish television stations will not make a blind bit of difference if there are to be advertisements on Channel 4, ITV and other stations.  The approach should be negotiated on a European basis in line with the approach to tobacco advertising in many countries.  If an agreement is not negotiated with the United Kingdom, ITV and the other channels will simply take the advertising money from RTE, thus placing it at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>This is not a cut and dried issue and requires considerable thought.  The aim of the amendments is desirable but I wonder whether they would achieve their intended goal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the variety of comments on this crucial issue.  There is clear recognition across all parties that there is public interest in our reducing our consumption of alcohol; it is as simple as that.  This can be achieved in part through a reduction in availability and advertising and through greater education on more responsible consumption of alcohol.</P>
        <P>The issue is cross-departmental and is being treated as such by the Government in that the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science and others have a clear role in formulating co-ordinated Government policy across a range of different areas.  Members will be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Wallace, is due to launch new codes on alcohol marketing, communications and sponsorship at the beginning of July 2008.  Such codes must be adhered to and this is the approach the Government has taken in this area.  Existing and future codes are planned to dovetail with the analysis and strategy of the Department of Health and Children, which has a central role in determining our response in this area.</P>
        <P>A significant element of the new codes will be the placing of an upper limit of 25% on the volume of all alcohol advertising.  Thus, alcohol advertising will be limited to no more than 25% of space or time on any occasion across all Irish media, including television, radio, cinema, outdoor advertising and print.</P>
        <P>While I understand the intent of the amendments, my line is to follow the co-ordinated Government strategy and to dovetail this with the recommendations of the alcohol advisory group established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in January 2008.  The resulting legislation, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, was introduced yesterday.</P>
        <P>There is a co-ordinated approach and the codes we are establishing will follow the line taken by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children.  This is the appropriate approach because those Departments, particularly the latter, have expertise regarding the health implications.  The codes also provide strong direction to the effect that alcohol advertising should not be carried out during any programme that would have a large audience of children.  If there are any weaknesses in this regard, we will support the further strengthening of the codes.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>I understand the satellite broadcasters broadcasting into Ireland and inserting advertising have agreed voluntarily to follow the codes applied here.  Senator Quinn is absolutely correct that we do not have statutory control over them.  We have tested this in the European Union and have failed to achieve agreement thereon.  I met my UK counterpart and stated we want to work with the United Kingdom.  There is provision in the new EU regulations to allow us to work with the United Kingdom to ensure that codes on alcohol advertising are adhered to across national boundaries.  Work is being done in that regard.</P>
        <P>There will be further tightening of alcohol advertising and general marketing guidelines in the areas of sponsorship, print media and elsewhere in recognition of the fact that our alcohol consumption has serious consequences.  This is a subject for consideration by the Government rather than by my Department alone.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 60 and 108 are related, and may be discussed together by agreement.  Senators John Paul Phelan and Bradford also have tabled amendment No. 60.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note we tabled the same amendment as the Government.  I wish to move both amendments.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 60:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 74, line 29, to delete &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The two amendments under discussion are clearly related because they pertain to the granting of licences.  I am glad the Government tabled the same wording in respect of amendment No. 60 as did Senator Bradford and I, namely, that on the renewal of a local licence, the term of which has elapsed, if no one is competing for it there should be an automatic re-granting for seven, as opposed to five years, as originally proposed in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 108 refers to digital technology in radio broadcasting.  While the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Government are anxious to move towards a digital radio network, this <Col N="454"/>will involve considerable expense for all broadcasters.  However, many local community stations in particular are not in a position to carry that expense.  If they make a substantial investment in digital equipment, the Bill proposes that they would be entitled to an automatic four year extension to their licences.  Amendment No. 108 seeks to change that to seven years, in line with what has been agreed on uncontested local area licences in amendment No. 60.  I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about promoting digital radio across the country, we need to provide incentives for local stations.  Many of them do not make much money and operate on a shoestring budget.  Applying for radio licences is a time-consuming and costly job.  In my own area, the local station has to go through a process of application about two years before the licence is due for renewal.  If it invested substantially in digital technology at great expense, it would be appropriate to give it a suitable extension to its licence period.  I think four years is too brief, as once the station has started that period, it is already looking for a further renewal.  Given the level of investment involved, seven years is more commensurate.  I understand that it costs about &euro;250,000 to get a local radio station digitally equipped.  The digital network is not in operation.</P>
        <P>A number of stores around the country sell digital radios.  During the week, I walked into a high street store in Kilkenny that sells digital radios, but it had sold only a couple because there is little point in buying such radios if most of the nation&rsquo;s radio stations are not available on the digital network.  If we want to ensure local radio stations embrace digital technology, we need to provide an incentive for them to do so.  A suitable incentive would be an increased extension to their licence period.  I hope the Minister can accommodate that in amendment No. 108.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the increase to seven years.  All sides feel that was warranted and a step in the right direction.  Another step in the right direction would be for the Minister to reconsider the concept of a heritage channel.  Senator Phelan made the point that the move to digital broadcasting is exceptionally important.  We need to ensure the structures exist in a way that incentivises that move.  The points being made today should be examined prior to the Bill going before the D&aacute;il.  If the move in that direction does not occur, it will inhibit what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the comments and the like-minds on the continuation of a licence for seven years in the case of uncontested applications.  With regard to amendment No. 108, section 134 provides that the BCI may extend by four years the terms of an FM sound broadcasting contractor, provided the sound broadcasting contractor concerned is willing to provide its sound broadcasting services on a digital sound broadcasting multiplex.  DAB radio is up and running in north-east Dublin, Cork and Limerick, is managed by RTE and has about ten channels.  The BCI can licence commercial DAB and plans to begin that in the autumn.  We are, therefore, developing our digital radio service.</P>
        <P>Senators have argued that the extension period of four years is insufficient to encourage stations to simulcast on the radio, but I am not completely convinced by that argument.  While there would be costs for broadcasters that chose to take on that simulcast in digital format, there also would be benefits and opportunities associated in a digital environment.</P>
        <P>I will keep the issue under review as the Bill progresses, but I do not propose at this stage to accept Senator Phelan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

	<P>We are seeking to take on board here some of the discussions on Committee Stage, particularly with regard to the commissioning of programmes from independent radio producers.  Senators argued on Committee Stage that this be changed to a fixed percentage rather than a fixed amount, and such a percentage should result in a higher level of mandatory commissioning by RTE from independent radio producers.  Having heard the view of Senators and considered the appropriate balances between legitimate interests of RTE radio services and those of the independent production sector, I propose in amendments Nos. 88 to 91, inclusive, and amendment No. 95 to increase the statutory commissioning requirements on RTE to a minimum of 3% of the value of the independent production account over a period of five years, beginning in 2009.  While 3% is a significant figure, it is important not to lose sight of the primary objective of section 116 when focusing on percentage levels.  The objective is to ensure RTE fully engages with the independent radio production sector, to the benefit of all &mdash; including RTE, independent radio producers and most importantly, the listening public. </P>
        <P>I have no doubt that over time such engagement will result in commissioning in excess of the statutory requirement.  We are not seeking to put a limit, in setting such targets, but rather establishing a base camp from which further progress can be made in the use and development of the independent television and radio production sector.  That has already occurred in the independent television sector.  We are seeking to replicate that and expand it in the radio sector.  The limits, as set out in independent television production, are exceeded by a multiple at the present time.  The purpose of this provision is to provide a base for such a development of an independent radio sector.  I believe the Government amendment, as proposed, will achieve such an engagement.</P>

The Minister has come a part of the way along the road towards accepting amendment No. 94 and setting a target of 5%. </P>
        <P>I disagree with a couple of things the Minister said.  He said he was setting a base figure.  The legitimate fear is that the base figure will be a limit rather than a base, and that it will be used as such into the future.  I acknowledge that the increase to 3% is an improvement on where we were when we discussed this on Committee Stage, but I disagree with his opening comment to the effect that 3% was a significant figure.  It is not a significant figure in the overall context, <Col N="459"/>although an improvement from where matters stood.  The fund we are speaking of is the RTE independent production account.  Over the past few years there has been a significant development in the independent radio sector.  Compared to their colleagues in independent television, which has been part of the Irish broadcasting system for a number of years, the independent radio sector has found times more difficult.  The proposal that just 3% of the RTE independent production account would be allocated for independent radio production is not enough and the Fine Gael amendment seeks to increase it to 5% over a period of a number of years, as suggested.  I accept that it would, perhaps, be difficult to do this in a single move, but it would be a significant step in the right direction to increase it over a period of four or five years.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will be able to respond positively to this issue.  I acknowledge that he has made a step in the right direction.  The Bill provides for an increase of about &euro;10 million per annum in the independent production account to bring it up to about &euro;40 million.  In other words, what we are speaking about in terms of the 5% is just &euro;2 million out of the total, a very small proportion of the overall cake.  I hope the Minister will be able to accommodate and increase the figure from 3% to 5% on a staged process over a number of years.  It is not too much of an increase to ask for and it would be a significant positive development for the independent radio sector.  We should be trying to encourage that sector.  Not enough has being done by Government and by radio networks over the years to try to promote the independent radio sector.  I believe this would be a significant step in the right direction if the Minister could see fit to increase the percentage up to 5%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, we cannot but say that Deputy Ryan is a listening Minister, in terms of the number of changes and amendments that he has been prepared to take on board as we have gone through this Bill.  I always believe this reflects a confident Minister in charge of his or her brief.  I welcome the fact that he has listened to our arguments on this general area of the issue under discussion, independent radio production. </P>
        <P>Starting from where he began he has come to the point he is at now, and that is to be welcomed as measurable quantifiable progress.  I shall support his amendment because I like to tie down progress when I see it.  However, will the Minister not think further on this as it goes through the other House?  Perhaps he will come to the Seanad again, afterwards.  I want to give a couple of reasons for this.  Just to get critical mass into radio production, more money needs to be diverted in its direction.  I speak of somebody who is completely supportive of public service broadcasting, as the Minister is well aware.  I am very much supportive of RTE and of its line with regard to the division of moneys.</P>
        <P>It would be very good for us to have thriving independent creative and self-sufficient independent production.  Speaking as a trade unionist, I am appalled at the conditions of service &mdash; pay, salaries and everything else &mdash; that are available to people working in independent radio and broadcasting.  I ask the Minister to talk to a few people in this regard.  The next time he is being interviewed by somebody on local radio or on independent television he should ask what he or she is earning.  The next time he dealing with anybody in those areas, he should ask about his or her career structure, if only to inform himself.</P>
        <P>I raise this for the following reason.  If there was a thriving independent production sector, where there was movement in and out of local and independent radio and RTE, with some equality in terms of the conditions of service that could be offered in all cases, we should all be the beneficiaries.  People can argue that this is not about conditions of service.  To me, it is one of the issues that arise from it.  If we want to match like with like, some element of security must be given to those involved.  I know the private sector does not like the idea of employment security, instead preferring to give employees short-term contracts and then kicking them out <Col N="460"/>the door when finished.  If that is the society people choose, then it is fine.  A balance, however, is needed.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal gives the start to what I want to achieve &mdash; a thriving independent radio production sector, which is very important.  Less money is being put into independent radio production.  If the Minister examines this he will agree with me.  While I accept and welcome the proposal which will give some life to and recognition of independent radio production, it is not enough.  I cannot add to the argument put forward on Committee Stage.  I know no further progress will be made on the issue and the Minister does not need to kill my arguments with his briefing.  However, when the buckets and spades are out in the summer and the Minister will be around the country listening to local radio, will he consider the issues I have raised?</P>
        <P>He should examine also some of the overheads and margins for independent radio production companies and compare these with the quality of their productions and the outlets they provide.  Many young graduates in broadcasting production from colleges of technology can make an input in this sector.  I want a career structure to be identifiable in the independent radio sector.  Many graduates get several years&rsquo; experience in the sector but cannot afford to stay in it.  I know it is not the Minister&rsquo;s fault.  However, ensuring a thriving sector would be beneficial to everyone.</P>
        <P>As a supporter of public service broadcasting, it is not healthy that RTE is the only customer in this market.  Ways must be examined to ensure similar demand comes from independent radio.  This debate went through Second and Committee Stages.  The Minister listened and said he would return on Report Stage with proposals.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendments which meet some of the issues already raised.  However, it does not go far enough.  Will he examine how to extend this proposal to the peripheral areas I mentioned?</P>

	<P>I found myself imagining the scenario where the Minister returned from his summer holidays, full of vim and vigour, to tell his civil servants it would be better to give 5% to create a proper independent radio production centre.  I also imagined him telling them to re-examine the heritage television channel.  I would like to think it was more than a daydream.  Since the Bill will not be passed by the D&aacute;il before the summer recess, I hope the Minister will listen to more of our suggestions.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on going some way with these proposals.  The Association of Independent Radio Producers of Ireland and others, however, believe the Minister is not going far enough in providing for 5% of the budget.  It is worth noting Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the importance of radio in people&rsquo;s lives.  We are trying to promote a quality independent radio sector.</P>
        <P>The amendment will allow for funding of &euro;1 million to be spent by 2013.  On year one allocations, this will mean one programme per week and just two at the end of the five years.  This does not envisage the expansion in the production of independent programmes that the Minister is serious about.  The reasonable 5% only accounts for one-fifth of the increase of &euro;10 million which brings the overall total to &euro;40 million, with television programmes being guaranteed 95% of this.  Given that the Minister accepts the principle, why does he not take it further?</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P>I know the Minister has been listening to the argument for some time.  He was part of the discussion on the e-consultation process in the 29th D&aacute;il.  There may be arguments that this fund is only a kick-start.  What is the point in having one if it comes with such a low ceiling?  Whereas the provision states &ldquo;no less than 3%&rdquo;, in the real world that figure becomes the maximum.  It would be unfair to suggest the Minister is striking a balance between this new radio venture and the television sector.  A budget with 3% versus 95% does not represent a balance.  The importance of radio in many people&rsquo;s lives is often understated.</P>
        <P>I do not know if the Minister is in mind to get more adventurous over his summer holidays.  I welcome the step he has taken, so far that it goes.  I support the other Senators and the Association of Independent Radio Producers of Ireland in seeking a provision of 5% and not 3% as a maximum to be devoted to the production of independent programming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s increase to not less than 3%, I am inclined to agree with the arguments that it should be greater.  I am sure the Minister wants a vibrant independent radio producing sector providing good quality programmes.  Between this Stage and when the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il, will the Minister consider a ministerial regulation without recourse to further legislation to increase the allocation if it sticks at the 3%?</P>
        <P>The programmes that will be produced by the independent broadcasters should be available not just to RTE, a point I highlighted earlier.  There is tremendous potential in this area.  Good quality television programmes have come from the independent production sector.  I hope this can be replicated in the radio sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking suggestions on board as the Bill progresses and I am sure there will be further amendments.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that it is very important for us to recognise there are obligations on independent commercial broadcasters just as there are with public service broadcasters.  Each broadcaster has access to a valuable public commodity in the spectrum which can be used in a range of different applications outside of broadcasting.  With that allocation of a public resource, there come public obligations.  One of these obligations is that the employment conditions and career opportunities in the area are progressive.  I have a real concern that in the radio sector in particular, which has smaller stations, it is difficult to get the scale in a newsroom or a current affairs producer&rsquo;s environment where experience and talent is being developed on a long-term basis but that is what must be done to be successful in radio production.  Money must be put in to human resources to build up a pool of talent.  A two-tier type system cannot be allowed to develop.  Independent radio may become an area where a person would start his or her career, get experience and then look for better pay and conditions, possibly in public sector broadcasting where I understand the conditions are typically much better.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the directions we will have to give to any new authority is that with that public resource, the spectrum to broadcast and the ability to use that public owned asset, comes obligations to ensure we develop high standards.  I am not saying individual journalists are not meeting the highest standards against the odds but it is important we set standards to ensure broadcasting can flourish in what it is there to do, namely, present Irish life to the people in a way that is informative, entertaining and educational.  The development of an independent radio sector both for public sector broadcasts and other independent broadcasters has the potential to improve that quality.  It is something we will have to develop.</P>
        <P>I asked my officials for a copy of the latest accounts to determine the current position and effectively it is at zero.  As we move towards the amount set out in our proposed amendment, <Col N="462"/>it is a significant step in a different direction but I will consider the comments made over the summer holidays and I am sure we will have further discussion on the issue in the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns the issue of long-wave broadcasting, which is of concern to people who speak for immigrant groups in parts of the United Kingdom and even in northern Europe.  It has to do with people who are involved in the GAA in particular who wish to listen to sports broadcasts on a Sunday evening in different parts of the UK.  It has to do with parts of Ireland such as northern Donegal and other areas where the reception is very weak.  It has to do also with changing over from medium wave to long wave.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister should be aware that for many years I have been interested in the issue of the availability of Irish broadcasts in different parts of the world, particularly Europe.  My view is that arising out of the Good Friday Agreement, long wave BBC Radio 4 should be broadcast through our Summerhill facility and that RTE long wave should be broadcast from one of the BBC transmitters outside Belfast and outside London to get the sense of the agreement.  Nonetheless, people in the Minister&rsquo;s Department remain of the view that despite what is contained in the Good Friday Agreement we should not have any great interest in the capacity of people outside Ireland to pick up RTE in other jurisdictions.  We need to nail that lie.</P>
        <P>The position is that from the foundation of the State we have always had a short wave, long wave, medium wave and FM service.  We now have the new digital and other satellite broadcasts coming through, although satellite is also digital in another form.  Issues arise in that regard which I cannot get to the bottom of.  We have a licence to broadcast at 50 kilowatts during the daytime but we broadcast at far less than that.  I will come to that shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue is that we are not using our capacity.  For instance, we have the Atlantic 252 long wave service but it is being interfered with every night by Radio Alg&eacute;rienne.  Radio Alg&eacute;rienne is broadcasting at about eight times the power of RTE on the long wave station.  They are all dealt with under the same international agreement reached in 1975.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P>I have two letters from the RTE Authority, one of which was written in 2002 and the other in 2008.  One of the letters purports to tell me that long wave is not received well in London while the other purports to tell me that long wave is received far better than medium wave in London.  Those letters are from the same office in RTE.  I am not happy with that.</P>
        <P>I realise elements of what I am saying may not come within the competence of the Minister&rsquo;s Ministry but how will the Minister respond to the problem?  We are allowed to broadcast at 62.5 kilowatts from 6.30 in the evening until 6.30 in the morning.  I cannot find out the reason that is the case.  It was not the case when Atlantic 252 was leant by us to Radio Tara when it was broadcasting pop music, and it was well received.</P>
        <P>We are broadcasting at well below our power but at the same time there are Irish emigrants in parts of London, north London in particular, who cannot receive it.  I know from personal experience that is correct.  There was a time I could receive RTE long wave on my car radio in most parts of the UK, particularly near Edinburgh and areas near London, but that is no longer the case.  I tried to receive RTE in north London recently but could barely hear it.  That is a real difficulty being experienced.</P>
        <P>In terms of the night time operation, going back to what my old physics teacher taught me in Dingle years ago, long waves do not travel as well at night whereas medium waves, the shorter wave lengths, travel further at night.  That is the reason some people of my age &mdash; fewer and fewer as I look around me &mdash; would remember Radio Luxembourg broadcasting to Ireland from Luxembourg in the 1960s and the 1970s.</P>

	<P>We could receive it only at night when the signal could travel.  The reverse was the case with RTE.  Broadcasting on medium wave, its reception was much clearer at night than on long wave.  Long wave radio needs to have its output and strength increased at night rather than decreased.  Why is RTE broadcasting only at 62.5?

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and thank her for returning to the House today for the conclusion of statements on older persons.  I wish to highlight once again a number of issues which are of grave importance to our ageing population.  In a fast-paced society such as we have today in Ireland, it often seems that the needs of older persons can be all too easily forgotten.  I have raised some of these matters on previous occasions but as was expected, progress has been dreadfully slow.</P>
        <P>Health will continue to be the single most important issue to older people and their families.  As we get older there will be an increased need for involvement with the health services, either in the acute hospital setting or in long-term nursing care.  The present state of the health service does nothing to reduce the anxiety of the older person when we hear constantly of the lack of hospital beds and the hours spent on hospital trolleys in draughty accident and emergency departments with the accompanying lack of privacy and dignity.  This is the service we provide to the people who built the prosperous Ireland in which we live today and yet all we can offer them is uncertainty and a second-class health service.  Waiting times and the delay in gaining access to mainstream health care continue to be a problem.  While the Department of Health and Children prides itself on the fact that waiting times are reduced, in my experience I find this is not really the case.  Now, instead of a long delay in the hospital setting, there are extended delays between the initial referral from the general practitioner and that first appointment within the hospital.</P>
        <P>I know of one lady who was in urgent need of a hip replacement.  Her mobility was severely affected and she was in constant pain. Her GP referred her to Waterford Regional Hospital in July 2006 and by the time she contacted me in April 2007, she had heard nothing with regard to an appointment.  When I contacted the patient services manager, whom I have always found to be very efficient, I was informed this lady was categorised as a routine patient and that she could be waiting up to four years for an initial appointment with the consultant.  This is simply not good enough and it is an insult to people to refer to this inadequate response as a service.  Service implies that a level of care and standard is being upheld.  This was not the case in this situation which is mirrored throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I recently had a call from a lady who, having been seen in South Tipperary General Hospital, was referred to the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital for investigations and treatment.  This lady is chronically unwell and has a dismal quality of life.  She was referred to the Coombe in October 2007 and given an appointment with a consultant for September 2008, which is almost one year waiting just to be seen.<b> </b> We can undoubtedly assume that a further delay is imminent should she need surgery and further treatment.</P>
        <P>The fair deal plan is money-centred as opposed to being people-centred.  The State&rsquo;s plan to apply a levy of up to 15% was bound to create constitutional difficulties and will have to be reconsidered.  We need to look at the needs of our ageing population, ensuring those who wish to stay at home will have the opportunity to do so for as long as possible and for those for whom long-term nursing home care is the best option, we need to ensure they will be able to receive this care in a secure, safe and fair manner.</P>
        <P>While the fair deal plan advocates allowing people to remain in their home for as long as possible, it is not clear that the measures are in place to support this approach.  It is well recognised that home care would continue to rely for its success on informal carers, and families who are already in this situation would argue that the level of respite care available to them is minimal.  This will need to be addressed as most family carers have their own young families to look after and, more than likely, the carer is also working full-time.  The level of support will have to increase to sustain caring for the elderly over an extended period, perhaps years. <Col N="466"/> The fair deal scheme needs to be taken back to the drawing board and given deeper consideration with further reference to the Mercer report, in particular with regard to looking at PRSI funding of long-term care.</P>
        <P>The final issue I wish to raise is the status of women who were precluded from working by virtue of the marriage ban.  This occurred in an Ireland of a different time but this small but significant number of women continues to be affected by this ban.  Their old age pensions are invariably non-contributory pensions, despite that if they had been allowed to continue working, they would be entitled to a full contributory pension. This subject is raised frequently by women who feel disaffected since their careers were cut short without their consent.  These women consequently went on to rear, nurture and educate the men and women who benefit from the prosperous Ireland of today.</P>
        <P>I recall one lady who worked in the sugar factory in Thurles in the 1950s.  She was personal assistant to one of the managers and both enjoyed and valued her career.  When she married in 1961, she was forced to vacate her position.  This lady went on to have six children, all of whom were reared and educated on her husband&rsquo;s wage.  Money was scarce and although she managed to ensure the family&rsquo;s basic needs were met, she told me that money was so short at times, she could not afford iron tablets when pregnant.  It is clear that had she been able to continue working, the family&rsquo;s quality of life would have been quite different.</P>
        <P>When this lady applied for the old-age pension, she was informed her contributions fell below the required level to secure a contributory pension and when she highlighted her concerns relating back to the marriage ban, she was told by officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs that plans were afoot to deal with this issue.  However, eight years later there has not been one word about these forgotten women whose children fuelled the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>I have made a submission to the Green Paper on pensions on this matter.  This issue should be dealt with once and for all.  These women were not allowed to have a voice in the past but they certainly have a voice now and it must be heard.  It behoves us all to compensate these women, albeit in a small way, by ensuring a provision is made through notional assessment to allow this diminishing group to avail of full pension rights.  I thank the Minister of State for taking time to attend the House as I appreciate she has a very busy schedule.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to the House and to compliment her on being reappointed as a Minister of State.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the subject of the elderly.  In my former profession I had a lot of dealings with the elderly.  I agree with much of what Senator Prendergast said as she also has a background of knowledge in this area.</P>
        <P>I have always been a strong proponent of community care.  I agree with the view that care of the elderly in their own home, wherever possible, is infinitely preferable to hospital care.  I have spoken about this matter in the House on other occasions and I know I have incurred the ire of some people.  The truth may hurt but so be it.  When old and not so old people are placed in care, they can often be forgotten about, although not in all cases.  After yearning to go home, an institutional malaise sets in which is called institutionalisation.  This is because, of necessity, they must adapt themselves to their surroundings and they make new friends.  Many of the people we are talking about, if not all of them, built up this country.  They paid their taxes and dues and it is now society&rsquo;s responsibility, especially of their own relatives, to ensure wherever possible that they are cared for in an appropriate setting, preferably the home.</P>
        <P>Day care centres contribute greatly to the care of the elderly and we have one such centre in Mullingar.  I have already spoken to the Minister of State about day care centres that have <Col N="467"/>closed for a number of weeks during the year.  I take the view that they should not close at all.  In many cases people come from remote rural areas and the only people they interact with are those they meet in the day care centres.  I hope that, if possible, St. Mary&rsquo;s day care centre in Mullingar will be kept open all year because it is providing a pivotal service to those who avail of it.  People come from as far away as Castletown, Finea, Castlepollard, Collinstown and Delvin in north Westmeath, as well as places south of Mullingar.</P>
        <P>Elderly people in care should be visited as often as possible, but regretfully that is not the case.  In a former professional practice, I had much experience of working in the community and carrying out domiciliary visits to my clients.  They would say: &ldquo;Nurse, it&rsquo;s great to see you.  I have not spoken to anybody since I last saw you&rdquo;.  It is not a very nice thing to hear but that is the situation in some cases.  We are fortunate in Mullingar to have a retirement club.  When it was set up they checked the numbers and found that it comprised 1,428 members, so it is now called the 1428 Club.  The club organises trips, including one that I sponsored to Leinster House.  I am sure other Members of the Oireachtas from County Westmeath have done likewise.  Such visitors are always welcome.  Retirement clubs provide a marvellous service for older people.</P>
        <P>I encountered a very fine model in London when my brother-in-law&rsquo;s mother was in care there.  It is a two-storey facility with younger people upstairs and the elderly downstairs.  It works very well but I do not have time to develop the point because I note that the Leas-Chathaoirleach has shown me the yellow card.  I had better sit down before I get the red card.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to the House.  It is good to see her again.  The last time I met her was in Mullingar.  I agree with Senator Glynn about the closure of day care centres.  The centres in Athlone and Longford are both affected in the same way.  I welcome the intervention for St. Mary&rsquo;s day care centre in Mullingar, which was closed for two weeks.  That is two weeks too long, however, as Senator Glynn said.  The centre should be revived and should not be closed at any time during the year.</P>
        <P>Home care packages should be re-examined for those who are leaving acute hospitals.  Very few drop-down beds are available so home care packages should be put in place for people returning home alone who may have little support in their community.  I am aware of one man who suffered a stroke and returned home even though there is no support for him there.  He has a very good family, but the public health nurse is put to the pin of her collar to assist and very little home help is available for the individual concerned.  The burden is falling on his wife who is also elderly.  If we are to keep such people out of nursing homes and hospitals, it is incumbent on us as legislators to provide proper home care packages.  I am referring to physiotherapy, speech therapy and even somebody to spend time with an old person to give the carer a break.</P>
        <P>The budget for the carers&rsquo; association in County Westmeath has been completely spent and it is no longer accepting any new applications for carers, which is a terrible situation.  If we are trying to sort out our acute hospitals and keep them free of elderly patients, we should put home care packages in place for them.</P>
        <P>I also wish to raise the issue of fuel poverty.  Last week we had freezing weather and on one night the temperature fell to 4&deg; Celsius.  Fuel allowances are very welcome but they are cut off from April to October.  Older people should be able to accumulate fuel allowances to use them in cold weather.  The minimum temperature for older people to live in is 16&deg; Celsius, otherwise <Col N="468"/>they are at risk of hypothermia and invariably end up suffering from pneumonia and being hospitalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I wish to discuss the abuse of older people.  The Minister of State addressed a conference on the topic of elder abuse last week in Galway, so she knows that it is an area of major concern for families.  I will explain why financial institutions and the social welfare system are putting older people at risk of abuse.  Elder abuse can take many forms, including physical, financial and psychological.  A good definition of such abuse is when an expectation of trust is violated and harm or distress is caused to an older person as a result.  How widespread is elder abuse?  Nationally, some 1,500 referrals have been made to the HSE, with 60 of them in my own county of Galway.  Some 150 of these cases have been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and 83% of them concerned people living at home.  This is why I am calling for a public awareness campaign to tackle the abuse of older people.  In 96% of such cases there was a familial relationship between the older person and the person allegedly causing the concern.  Most reports of elder abuse are made by health care staff, including GPs, public health nurses or home helps.  It is good to see, however, that 10% to 11% of such reports are made by the elderly person&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>The abuse can involve shouting at an older person, restricting visits, threats, instilling fear, neglect, leaving them alone all day, inadequate nutrition or dehydration.  I am aware that it is difficult for families to mind older people because it is not always an easy relationship.  Issues can arise on both sides of the coin, but the elderly are particularly vulnerable.  It is all the worse when the situation is compounded by illness, such as early Alzheimer&rsquo;s, which does not provide for an easy relationship in the home.</P>
        <P>Financial abuse may occur when a person&rsquo;s mobile phone credit is used by someone else, or their change is not returned after shopping.  Even greater financial abuse can take the form of pressure concerning wills and the question of inheritance.  A public awareness campaign needs to tackle attitudes to elder abuse.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to mention the issue of abuse by the financial institutions.  Some 10% of the cases coming before the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Joe Meade, are of uncaring, unthoughtful financial institutions selling unsuitable financial products to older persons, for example, the case of a 94 year old woman being sold a six-year bond.  I spoke to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and he stated that we have a consumer protection code but what is needed here is professional and competent people selling products, particularly in the case of older persons.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, for listening to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on older persons.  This is a key issue for the Government because it is important that we start planning for aging in Ireland and ensure that we make it a positive experience.  There is none of us here who will not experience the aging process and it is important that with advance knowledge of the extent to which our population will age, we put in place proper policies and do the necessary planning to support that.</P><Col N="469"/>
        <P>In 2002, the proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s population aged 65 years and over was 11.1% but, according to population projections prepared for the National Council on Aging and Older People, this proportion will rise to between 14.8% and 15.3% by 2021.  The number of Irish people aged 80 and over is projected to increase steeply, from 100,583 in 2002 to 137,305 in 2021.</P>
        <P>I was in discussions with the Age Action Ireland group before this debate to get their views on what they felt were the priorities in terms of the delivery of services for older persons.  They emphasised the area of community care and the fact that, from their point of view, the Government has every reason to support and develop community care services for older people.  They pointed out that for every &euro;1 spent on community care, &euro;2 is spent on residential care, and also that many older persons who have been surveyed want to remain and be cared for at home.  Unfortunately, access to community care at present is a little like a lottery, they argue, depending on what part of the country an older person is living in.  In certain parts of the country the services are satisfactory but in other parts they leave much to be desired.</P>
        <P>The issue of rising fuel price was also highlighted by Age Action Ireland as an area of major concern.  As the House will be aware, ESB and Bord G&aacute;is have made an application to the energy regulator to increase both fuel and oil prices in this country.  Age Action Ireland pointed out that it is far more expensive to live alone than to cohabit.  Many older persons live on their own and the inability to afford adequate home heating can result in premature mortality among older persons.  They also pointed out that Ireland has the highest levels of fuel poverty in northern Europe for the category of lone pensioner households.  The Irish National Survey of Housing Quality found that older households are more likely to be characterised by having an open fire, with 25% of older households having no central heating.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>Age Action Ireland asked that the Government would ensure proper measures are put in place in anticipation of these price rises and that the next budget might look at the issue of fuel allowance for older persons to match the increases in energy bills.  Age Action Ireland proposed that energy providers could play their part in easing hardship for pensioners by deferring any increased charges until after the budget to complement what the Government can do, and also that energy providers should work to promote weekly payment schemes for low-income customers to help them to budget for the increased cost of fuel during the winter.</P>
        <P>Age Action Ireland also expressed some concern about the fair deal legislation.   It pointed out that although the legislation is being prepared for the past 18 months, as an organisation it has not been consulted.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to indicate whether that might happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the contributors to this debate and commend the Senators for their interest in what is an exciting area, most certainly for me as the recently appointed Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  I want to return to some of the issues raised by Senators, both last week and today.</P>
        <P>The issue of elder abuse was raised.  It was the main topic for discussion at a conference in Galway last week, as Senator Healy Eames stated.  It is an area that is high on my agenda.  As Senator Healy Eames stated, elder abuse takes many forms &mdash; psychological, physical, sexual and financial.  No doubt it thrives on secrecy and subtlety.  One of my concerns would be to raise the awareness of its existence, first and foremost.  Senator Healy Eames is correct that it <Col N="470"/>is a significant challenge for all of us.  We must acknowledge that the findings to date show that the vast majority of elder abuse cases are carried out at home and by people the person knows and who the person may care about and depend upon.  It is an area that must be handled with great sensitivity.  It was to the credit of the HSE in the region that it highlighted the issue to mark World Day on Elder Abuse.  The large attendance from the stakeholders on that day is a clear indication of awareness and that this is an area on which we must work.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames mentioned Mr. Joe Meade.  The Financial Service Ombudsman is among the many other bodies such as the financial institutions with which we must work to uncover potential areas where elder abuse may occur.  That issue needs possibly more time than the few minutes that both Senator Healy Eames and I have been given today here in the Seanad, but we are still grateful for the opportunity.</P>
        <P>Nursing home inspections was raised on the previous occasion I was here in the Seanad.  I want to give assurances on the levels and numbers of inspections.  In this area the facts speak for themselves.  The HSE has a target of two inspections per private nursing home.  The public ones are not yet inspected but they will be shortly.  On the question of private nursing homes, over 870 nursing home inspections, that is, two inspections per nursing home, were carried out in 2006, all of which were unannounced.  The HSE confirms it completed 812 statutory inspections in 2007 &mdash; 93% of its target &mdash; with the remainder completed in January 2008.  The statutory inspections may result in further follow-up inspections.  In April 2008 the monitoring report documents that 292 inspections were carried out between January and April of this year.  The Health Act 2007 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Among its functions, HIQA will take over the independent inspections of all nursing homes, both public and private, early next year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the expansion of services, nearly all speakers referred to the recognition that must be given by everybody that older people want to remain at home as long as possible.  It behoves those of us in a position to ensure that is done, and that every service and support is provided.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the area of older people is increasing in volume and complexity and I want to place on record the amount of funding that the Government has already put into this area over the past years.  Over 2006 and 2007 the Government has put in an additional &euro;400 million into the largest ever expansion of services for older people.  This has provided overall funding, in terms of current services, for a total of 4,350 home care packages benefiting over 11,000 clients in 2007.</P>
        <P>Some Senators expressed concern about a particular individual in the midlands who was sent home as a stroke patient without any supports.  I would be very concerned on hearing that because it would be the duty of the staff at the hospital as well as the public health nurse to arrange the necessary temporary or long-term home care for that person to be supported at home.  The idea of home care packages was to support people to remain at home for as long as possible.  More than 23 million home help hours have been provided nationally since 2005 with 11.3 million hours in 2006 and 11.7 million hours in 2007.  This benefits approximately 53,000 people per annum.</P>
        <P>The Bill providing for the fair deal scheme is being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General.  The legislation is complex and requires careful drafting to ensure the interests of older people requiring residential care are fully protected.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, intends to publish the Bill as soon as possible following finalisation by the Attorney General and Government approval and to bring the legislation through the Houses of the <Col N="471"/>Oireachtas thereafter.  As the timeframe for bringing the legislation through both Houses is contingent on finalisation of the Bill, more definitive information is not available at this stage.</P>
        <P>I fully acknowledge the situation outlined by Senator Phil Prendergast in regard to women who had to leave work under the marriage ban.  The pensions strategy group invited submissions from the public.  We acknowledge the need for that recognition.  The findings of the pensions strategy group will be published shortly.  We hope deficits in that area will be recognised in the future.</P>

        <P>I have tabled a number of amendments.  Amendment No. 1 deals with students already in the pipeline.  I appreciate the Minister has tabled an amendment but we might compare the two to see the best way forward.  I am concerned about a situation where a person is in the pipeline and sits the Irish examination but where the Bill becomes law in the meantime.  If a person passes the examination and is notified of the result, technically, he or she has not complied with section 3 of the 1929 Act prior to the passing of this Bill.  Alternatively, a person who attends the Irish course in 2008-09 and who fails the examination, under section 1(3)(<i>b</i>), he or she is required to attend Irish lectures a second time because he or she has not passed the examination even though there will now be no examination.  The amendment is really to deal with people in the pipeline.  The Minister has tabled amendments but he might address this issue for us.</P>

	<P>The only issue I raised in respect of this Bill was the element of retrospection and the situation of those who have sat, or are who are about to sit, the Irish examination for the qualification of barrister or solicitor.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment satisfies that request but will he clarify precisely how he sees it applying in practice?  That might deal with the concerns of Senator Alex White.  I appreciate the Minister has tabled an amendment which perhaps resolves the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I overlooked the fact amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, were being taken together and did not address amendment No. 4 which relates to people who did not sit the Irish examination or who sat it and failed it.  It is an attempt to address the situation of people who were excluded from practice because of the compulsory regime in place.  It is not putting it too strongly to say that they were essentially deprived of a right to earn a livelihood as lawyers.  I move this amendment to take account of that and have the matter redressed in so far as is possible.  A basic step would be to provide that such persons can now apply to be called to the Bar or to become solicitors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Regan in expressing my appreciation to the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The Bill benefits from employing that tried and tested means of having matters deemed to be the case, even if they were not in fact the case.  I appreciate the approach of the Minister and his officials.  This Bill will introduce a more honest and realistic regime in the practice of law through the medium of Irish.  It is important that people have the right to have their cases heard in Irish.  The Bill will introduce a more honest, straightforward and, ultimately, more satisfactory regime than that which has existed in the past.</P>

	<P>I thank my colleagues on the Opposition side for their support for the Bill, by and large.  I thank the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for listening to the concerns of my colleagues and for tabling appropriate amendments to clarify some small issues.</P>
        <P>This is an important Bill which recognises the role of the Irish language in the legal profession, which includes both barristers and solicitors.  When I completed the Irish examination, probably in 1974 if my memory is correct, it was basically a sham.  It was simply a matter of coming along.  I remember it as a time when my Gaeilge was fl&uacute;irseach and I knew more than the examiners.  This Bill allows for a more realistic role for the Irish language within the professions, which is very important.  Those who wish to pursue, practice and advocate through Irish should be encouraged and allowed to do so.  The Bill offers a platform for this which hitherto was not there and I welcome it in that regard.  I am delighted it has passed and I thank the Minister for his indulgence and co-operation along with Members from all sides of the House.</P>

I thank Senators for taking on trust that we would revert to this issue on Report Stage and that we were listening.

We will now have available a list of barristers and solicitors capable of practising law in Irish.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House.  This matter is of serious import to many people.  There are aspects of it that are not entirely under the control of the Department or the Minister and I acknowledge that.  It is of serious political concern to the rest of us and for that reason we must have some reassurances from the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>RTE reception, especially throughout the UK, has disimproved due to the changeover from medium wave to long wave.  I stress that I support the idea of that move because long wave reception is much nearer to FM quality.  The problem is that there has been a reduction in the quality and the output.  This has given real concern to emigrant groups all over the UK who have contacted me, and also, doubtless, my colleagues on both sides of this House and the other House.  On a regular basis people have reported to me that the situation is unacceptable.  This House has debated the rights of emigrants and the need to support them on many occasions.</P>
        <P>This matter is of considerable importance to the GAA community in the UK.  I talked to the cathaoirleach of the provincial council of the GAA of Great Britain who is appalled at the <Col N="476"/>reduction in reception.  The thrust of the Good Friday Agreement as it related to broadcasting was that there would be an easier overlap of signals between both countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Most importantly, I cannot get honest clear information from RTE on this matter.  It is not possible to get it.  I know that the Departmental advisors have dealt with this and I wish to put a number of issues on record for them.  First, I have a letter written in 2002 to Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea, signed by a person in RTE.  I will not give names here as there is no point in doing that but the Minister of State can take my word.  I shall send him a copy and leave one for the Cathaoirleach.  The letter informed Deputy O&rsquo;Shea that there was no clear signal reception in greater London as Tullamore medium wave had equal or better coverage.  At this time the question posed was the opposite to the one put now.  When people requested that reception be improved they were told that the medium wave reception was better than, or, at very least, equal to, long wave in the greater London area.  I have this letter and shall let the officials see it.</P>
        <P>In March of this year, in a letter which also came from RTE,  it was stated that long wave is superior in its reach: &ldquo;for example it is difficult to receive RTE medium wave in London but most of the city has good long wave&rdquo;.  That second letter was written to the clerk of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, of which I am a member.</P>
        <P>I am infuriated by being given the runaround by RTE.  If people in that organisation think they will get away with this I tell them they will not.  I shall stick with this issue and embarrass them until we get the truth of it and until we get the type of output to which we are entitled.  Members of the Oireachtas are asked to represent GAA people, emigrants and community groups in the UK.</P>
        <P>I spoke with the Minister two hours ago who gave me leave to refer to his briefing documentation but I shall read first from a letter to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, dated April 13 2008, which states: &ldquo;It is not legal to broadcast power in excess of 62.5 kilowatts at night&rdquo;.  The Minister&rsquo;s briefing document states that the licensed power for night-time operation is 100 kilowatts and that RTE is licensed to operate at that output during the night.  Either the committee or the Minister is being told untruths.</P>
        <P>This is factual material and I will not let this issue get away.  We will have RTE back into the House to explain itself.  The Minister&rsquo;s document informed the Minister and his advisors that RTE operates at night and in excess of the figure quoted.  The committee was told that RTE broadcasts at 62.5 kilowatts.  I do not know how other Members feel about this matter but it will not go away.  RTE needs friends in this House and I am one of those who speaks for it all the time.</P>
        <P>The briefing document also states, in the kind of weasel words that I hate, that the new system RTE has is far more efficient, that while the old system did not give a good signal the new one does, as well as being more efficient.  It neglected to inform the Minister about something I know well, having studied it so much.  The efficiency mentioned was that of power or energy.  It was not efficiency of reception.  The letterwriter did not bother to clarify that for the Minister.  We are being misled on this issue and it is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I also wish to state what it would cost for RTE  &mdash; if one can believe the organisation&rsquo;s own figures &mdash; to broadcast at its licensed output of 500 kilowatt for 24 hours a day.  The cost per year would be the enormous sum of &euro;108,000.  That is what we are talking about here.</P>
        <P>RTE took over Atlantic 252 which used to pump out pop music at 500 kilowatts, day and night, all over the UK and to northern Europe at a time when we could all receive it.  Then it reduced the output and made fools of some of us.  Before the GAA, in this House and in committee I defended RTE&rsquo;s decision to move to long wave on the basis that there would be <Col N="477"/>better and clearer reception.  It would have been so had RTE done the honest thing and broadcast at the licensed output of 500 kilowatts.</P>
        <P>Why should we reduce ourselves to a mere 500 kilowatts in any case?  We should be able to broadcast as far as Brussels at the very least.  Our output should be receivable on long wave in that city and there is no reason why it should not be so.  It is not long ago since I sat in my car in Cherbourg listening to RTE long wave coming in as clear as a bell under the previous transmitter.  There is no reason why the range cannot be extended.</P>
        <P>I could continue to talk at length about this issue and I have a mind to do exactly that.  As a member of the Opposition and an Independent Senator, I do not feel any more strongly about this issue than my colleagues on the other side of the House.  Anyone who has cared about the Irish community abroad and who knows of the lonely emigrants sitting in bedsits will know the broadcasting of GAA and other sports results in the afternoon is part of their community lifeline.  Their cultural roots are reflected in the programmes of RTE, particularly at the weekends and at night.  There are people who like to listen to &ldquo;C&eacute;il&iacute; House&rdquo; on Saturday night, to &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte Isteach&rdquo; with Donncha O&rsquo;Dulaing and to programmes by others who broadcast at night.  Sometimes the audiences for such programmes are larger in the United Kingdom than in Ireland.  What is occurring cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>A completely different reason it cannot be allowed to continue is that RTE transmitters are crucial in the event of a national emergency.  According to our plans, RTE is supposed to be broadcasting at full output during any major national emergency.  However, it has reduced its power output to below the legally agreed limit, that is, to 250 KW or 300 KW.  That it has reduced its potential is unacceptable.  It is telling us it is reducing it to 250 KW.  It is not a step it can take at will and that is why I do not trust it to do what it is supposed to be doing.  My amendment is to require RTE to pump out its signal at the licensed power output at the very least.  I would like the Minister of State to say how it can increase this output.  Who deals with this?</P>
        <P>The main source of interference with RTE long wave reception at night is Radio Alg&eacute;rienne, which is probably broadcasting at approximately 2,000 KW, although its licence is based on the same international agreement as that of RTE, that is, the agreement of 1975.  How long can we put up with this?  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>I am not making these remarks with a view to criticising the Department.  However, I am very critical of what is taking place, of the lack of information and of the difficulty in finding that information.  We need to speak for those who cannot be present to speak for themselves on this issue.  On that basis, I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I spoke at length on this issue when RTE was getting rid of its medium wave service.  We made the case that people abroad tuned into sports events in Ireland and enjoyed a very good reception.  We were told the new regime would result in greater efficiency but this efficiency did not apply to reception.  Deception was evident in RTE&rsquo;s answer to questions on its getting rid of the medium wave service.  It is paramount that RTE have the highest possible power output, as the amendment seeks, with a view to ensuring listeners in Ireland, the United Kingdom and further afield receive the reception to which they are entitled and to which those who pay a licence fee are entitled.</P>
        <P>Conflicting information was received from RTE on this issue and it will have to be sorted out.  If it tells a committee of the Oireachtas one story and tells another to the Minister, it should be hauled in straight away by the Minister and asked specifically for the truth.  Will the Minister of State ensure this as a matter of urgency, such that Members of the Oireachtas will know the exact position, as they and the public are entitled to know?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="478"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Cummins.  We have all received correspondence from various groups, from both inside and outside the State, on this issue.  The points Senator O&rsquo;Toole made are well made, especially on emigrant groups in Britain that have maintained contact with Ireland over the years, largely through the medium of radio.  The loss of the service is considerable to them.  The only contact many of those in bedsits had with home was through the Irish national broadcaster.</P>
        <P>Since RTE is the national broadcaster, its remit is surely to broadcast not only to those who reside on the island of Ireland but also to those nationals who are forced, often through no fault of their own, to live across the Irish Sea.  The service provided to them for years was very good.  Reference was made to the importance of providing a service to those interested in sports organisations, including the GAA.  I agree with this.</P>
        <P>I received a number of e-mails from residents in certain parts of Ireland who are having difficulty receiving a signal, including individuals in west Cork and parts of the south east.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea raised this issue in the D&aacute;il.  The Senator also referred to Radio Alg&eacute;rienne broadcasting at an output strength eight times greater than that of RTE.  This is causing difficulty and the signal is much clearer than that of RTE in certain parts of Ireland.  I support the amendment fully and urge the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
        <P>The nub of the issue concerns the national broadcaster broadcasting to the nation.  I have no problem paying my licence fees and, as with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I defend RTE, but it is badly wrong on this issue.  It has spread disinformation.  I was not aware of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s letters.  There are clear contradictions in the information presented to the committee and the Minister.  This needs to be explained but has not been to date.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a good point on national emergencies, during which transmission is vital.  The point was made to me in an e-mail that fishermen rely on RTE for weather forecasts.  Quite often, they operate some distance from the mainland and are placed in jeopardy if they cannot receive a signal from RTE.  This should be taken on board.  I urge the Minister of State to accept all the grouped amendments and hope he can produce some formula of words that will resolve the problem and ensure RTE can broadcast at full strength such that a clear signal will be received not only by people on the island of Ireland but also by Irish communities in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I subscribe to the sentiments being expressed.  Many of us received a letter from Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael in Britain.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Dear Senators,</P>
        <P LI="1">Re: Broadcasting Bill 2008.</P>
        <P LI="1">On behalf of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Britain and the wider Irish community I would like to express our thanks for the work you are all doing in the Oireachtas in highlighting the lack of reception of RTE Radio especially in and around London.  This is a terrible loss especially for the most vulnerable of our community, the elderly, some have gone to the expense of purchasing new radios when the medium wavelength ceased now all they can receive in the evenings are foreign stations coming in on the long wave 252.</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">This is unacceptable in this day and age with all the modern equipment available we had to accept this type of reception when I emigrated in the sixties but hopefully not in this modern society when you can receive all types of stations worldwide but not RTE.</P><Col N="479"/>
        <P LI="1">As Secretary I am being asked frequently is there anything that can be done therefore we are thankful for the pressure being put by your committee please keep up the good work and maybe someday we not alone will be able to receive a good Radio reception but RTE Television in our homes.</P>
        <P LI="1">Your Sincerely,</P>
        <P LI="1">Tadhg Meehan [runa&iacute;, Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael].</P>
        <P>It is a terrible indictment of public broadcasting that in 2008, someone who until recently was able to access radio and who emigrated in the 1960s now is being deprived of this facility because of a change, which I understand was implemented to make financial savings.  While in general I am in favour of such measures, responsibilities also arise in respect of public broadcasting.  I believe that given the technology available, one should ensure that people can keep some connection with events in their native country through the radio stations.  When this fails, there is an obligation on Members to insist on it to the public service broadcaster, which is funded to a large degree by the population at large.  Were one to poll the population, there would be strong support to use part of that funding to ensure the diaspora, in the closest country to us in particular, can access the radio stations.  It also is imperative that this can be done using radio receivers.  That is essential for people, whether in cars or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I refer to RTE&rsquo;s failure to point this out.  Parts of the Northern Ireland are unable to access RTE radio, which is disgraceful.  An all-island economy is being promoted in many ways and efforts are being made to cultivate co-operation and understanding between both sides of this island.  Surely one way to so do is through the medium of radio.  People can listen to BBC stations on their radios in this part of Ireland and it is incongruous that such access is not available.  My question in this regard is whether the Bill under discussion is the appropriate way to deal with this issue, which is an operational matter.  However, the Minister and the Department must be proactive in redressing what unfortunately has happened when medium wave transmissions were done away with and people were deprived of access to the national airwaves.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for their contributions.  As for amendments Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, relating to the operation of RTE&rsquo;s long wave service, I have considered them as a result of the debate in the House last week.  A number of Members raised this issue last week to express serious concern.  Consequently, contact was made with RTE with a view to clarifying some of the issues raised at the time.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, primary legislation in the main outlines objectives, rather than the specific operating conditions, technologies, standards or parameters needed to support such objectives.  Most people would agree this is a logical approach, given the rapid pace of technological and service development.  Section 114(1)(<i>a</i>) sets RTE the objective of providing a broadcasting service to be made available, &ldquo;in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland&rdquo;.  Section 114(1)(<i>f</i>) sets RTE the objective of providing a broadcasting service to &ldquo;be made available, in so far as RT&Eacute; considers reasonably practicable, to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland&rdquo;.  Section 114(1)(<i>d</i>) gives RTE the objective of co-operating with public bodies and preparing the dissemination of public information to the public in the event of an emergency.  The Bill as drafted sets RTE these specific objectives.  It allows it the latitude to choose the most appropriate economic and technological means to fulfil these objectives and establishes various accountability mechanisms under which RTE accounts for any or all of the decisions it makes.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P>Members have raised concerns regarding RTE&rsquo;s ability to meet its objectives relating to the provision of services within Ireland and abroad.  I believe that RTE takes these objectives seriously.  I should point out that a satellite receiver in Ireland or in the United Kingdom can at present tune in to all four of the principal RTE radio services for 24 hours per day, should one so wish.  RTE also is planning to extend the radio services to the freesat platform, where they will be easily locatable via the BBC freesat electronic programme guide.  This will tie in with the planned provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Is freesat available in the United Kingdom or in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will continue to outline what RTE has to say about it, arising from the discussions and some of the clarifications we sought from it.  This will tie in with the planned provision of the new RTE international television channel and freesat from early next year and will represent an extension of its radio service in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>In respect of emergencies, to which a number of Members referred, it is important to provide for emergency broadcasts over different broadcasting platforms and technologies.  This is important for a variety of reasons.  All Members will agree that relying on a single platform for emergency broadcasts is not secure as it could fail or be subject to interference or sabotage.  Listeners listen to radio over an ever-increasing range of platforms and the main platform is FM.  However, there is an increasing number of listeners over the Internet and satellite.</P>
        <P>I also wish to make the point that Sky satellite and the long wave 252 frequency are the two principal ways to hear RTE radio in Great Britain.  Sky carries all four radio channels and serves listeners on satellite throughout Ireland, Great Britain and the Continent.  The long wave 252 service broadcasts RTE Radio 1 on a single frequency throughout Ireland and, by overspill, into a wide area of Britain.  By the end of this year, RTE plans to introduce a new international and existing radio service at freesat.  The coverage provided by freesat will be the same as on the existing Sky satellite service.  The difference is that freesat is not a subscription service.  Its users only will pay the once-off costs of a dish and the setting up of a receiver.  RTE&rsquo;s four radio channels will form part of this extension of service to Irish audiences via freesat.  For both television and radio audiences, this constitutes an important step forward as it will provide a television service and will extend the availability of radio at a cost that is both reasonable and non-recurrent.</P>
        <P>Consequently, I am not in a position to accept the amendments as proposed by Members.  However, in view of the correspondence to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred, there is a need for some clarification regarding this matter.  While I cannot provide such clarification to the House at present, I will take up this matter with RTE and have it clarified at the earliest opportunity.  However, I am not in a position to accept the amendments as proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response.  However, I repeat that this merely constitutes half-information.  For example, the Minister of State referred to freesat.  He stated the RTE stations will be on freesat and will be available to people who do not have a subscription to Sky.  It can be obtained on Sky without subscription at present.  This kind of half-information is driving me mad.  One does not even need to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to Sky.  All one must do is to install a dish and a decoder and one then can receive the four radio stations throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>I have made this point in the House many times.  While I digress slightly from the point under discussion, what drives me mad in this regard is that although one also can tune in RTE television, it is encrypted.  Consequently, throughout Europe one can erect a Sky dish and <Col N="481"/>decoder at no cost, with the exception of the aforementioned two items, and without a contract, one can tune into BBC 1, BBC 2, BBC 3, BBC 4, ITV 1, ITV 2, ITV 3 and ITV 4, as well as every single station of every small country in Europe, with the exception of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue previously and have been in dispute with RTE about it for the past four years because it insists that our channels should be encrypted.  It will make all sorts of assertions about copyright when all one wants to do is to watch RTE programmes.  Other organisations do this, including regional variations of ITV, such as UTV, as well as the BBC.  If a match involving Celtic is being broadcast on BBC 1 Scotland, one cannot tune into it on television but can do so in some other way.  My point is that the Minister of State must double-check everything he is being told by RTE.</P>
        <P>Many people in the UK want to listen to Irish music, artists, culture and sport.  I sit on the committee with some of those people whose names are on the letter read out by Senator Jim Walsh.  They are disgusted with it all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  On behalf of the Green Party, I am very happy to propose that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is quite limited in its scope, which is deliberate.  There is a much wider debate about the appropriateness of certain psychiatric practices and the model that underpins them.  Those of us who have been involved in the mental health services are very aware that the traditional biological or medical model is increasingly being challenged in the field of mental health.  There is a very strong call for its replacement by a much more comprehensive bio-psycho-social model.   This debate is very important because of the treatments prescribed by each model of mental health disorders.  The focus of the Bill is on a couple of procedures that are currently on our statute books and which the Green Party wishes to see amended.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The scope of our Bill relates to  involuntary procedures that are prescribed under the biological or medical model.  We specifically refer to the practices of psychosurgery and ECT.  Section 1 seeks to amend Section 58 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which concerns use of psychosurgery.  Most of us became familiar with the treatment of psychosurgery &mdash; commonly known as lobotomies &mdash; through the famous film starring Jack Nicholson, &ldquo;One flew over the Cuckoo&rsquo;s Nest.&rdquo;  Public awareness of the procedure has meant that over time, its use has almost completely died out.  It does not appear to have been used in this State over the last 20 years.  However, it is still left on our Statute Book and the option to use it still remains.  We are attempting to delete this section in section 1 of this Bill, and to introduce on Committee Stage a prohibition on its use.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>Section 2 seeks to amend section 59 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for the involuntary use of ECT in certain circumstances.  We are looking for this section to be deleted and replaced with the following wording:&ldquo;A programme of electroconvulsive therapy shall not be administered to a patient unless the patient gives his or her informed consent in writing to the administration of the programme of therapy&rdquo;.<b>  </b>The issue of consent and informed consent is central to this proposed amendment.  The Mental Health Commission rules for 2006, governing the use of electroconvulsive therapy, are specific on the issue of consent.  These rules state that a patient must be considered capable of giving informed consent for ECT, including anaesthesia, unless there is evidence to the contrary.  They also state that capacity to consent must ensure that the patient can understand the nature of ECT, understand why ECT is being proposed, understand the benefits, risks and alternatives to receiving ECT, understand the broad consequences of not receiving ECT, retain the information long enough to make a decision to receive or not receive ECT, make a free choice to receive ECT and communicate the decision to consent to ECT.  Consent must be received in written form.</P>
        <P>However, in part 2, section 4 of the guidelines entitled &ldquo;Absence of consent&rdquo;, it is stated that where a patient is unable to give consent or is unwilling to give consent, Section 59(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Mental health Act 2001 applies.  This section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Where the patient is unable or unwilling to give such consent, the programme of therapy is approved (in a form specified by the Commission) by the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and the programme of therapy is also authorised (in a form specified by the Commission) by another consultant psychiatrist following referral of the matter to him or her by the first mentioned psychiatrist.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A form 16, entitled &ldquo;Treatment without consent Electro Convulsive Therapy Involuntary Patient (Adult)&rdquo; must be completed by both consultant psychiatrists and placed in the patient&rsquo;s clinical file.</P>
        <P>This Bill seeks to prohibit the involuntary administration of ECT to a patient.  We will propose on Committee Stage that during a period before he or she becomes unwell, and following a full and comprehensive explanation of the procedure of ECT, a patient will be asked to sign an advanced directive, giving or refusing consent for the ECT procedure on them at any stage in the future.  We accept that the advanced directive could contain a provision where the patient is empowered to name an individual to make a decision on his or her behalf, in the event that he or she was likely to become unwell.  However, this safeguard would deal with the issue of consent and ensure that the patient was consenting in a situation where he or she understood the implications of the decision, and was not under the influence of heavy doses of anti-psychotic or anti-depression drugs while making the decision.  Why is the issue of informed consent by patients to the use of electroconvulsive therapy on them so important?  Electroconvulsive therapy is a procedure that is primarily used for patients suffering from severe depression &mdash; in some cases psychotic depression.  It is also used for patients with catatonia or mania.  It is certainly a highly controversial treatment and while it is supported by many in the traditional psychiatric profession, it is bitterly opposed by many patients and their families as well as a growing number of mental health professionals.</P>
        <P>According to a recent article by Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Shea in <i>Irish Psychiatrist</i>, October-November 2007, the use of electroconvulsive therapy in Ireland was first officially reported in 2003.  He refers to a study by Daly <i>et al</i> which stated that in 2003 in Ireland, 859 had received this treatment although the use of ECT had varied per region.  The figure was 38.7 people per 100,000 in the Southern Health Board region compared with 8.4 per 100,000 in the South-<Col N="483"/>Eastern Health Board region.  This issue raises two important questions.  Why is it, given the controversial nature of electroconvulsive therapy, that no official records have been available until 2003 for those investigating and concerned about its use?  Why is there such a level of variability between the different health board regions in terms of the use of electroconvulsive therapy?  This is something that must be investigated further by the Department of Health and Children.  I have no doubt that, following our debate today, this type of investigation will occur.</P>
        <P>Most individuals undergo a course of between four and six treatments of electroconvulsive therapy, usually two per week.  The procedure is reported to work quickly, although its effect may not last longer than one month.  The literature reports that it is usual to have a memory blank for the time surrounding a course of electroconvulsive therapy.  The article I referred to by Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Shea makes a couple of very worrying remarks about the use of electroconvulsive therapy.  It opens with a quotation which basically questions whether electroconvulsive therapy should be a treatment of last resort and seems to be encouraging a much more widespread use of it.  There are other comments in the article, however, which should cause concern.  Dr. O&rsquo;Shea says that dementia <i>per se</i> is not a contraindication to the use of electroconvulsive therapy, although confusion among dementia patients after ECT can be severe and prolonged.  He says Down&rsquo;s syndrome patients can also be given ECT and mentions that psychiatrists do not consider age to be a contraindication in giving electroconvulsive therapy.  He refers to a study that predicts an increased use of electroconvulsive therapy in elderly depressives.  Another study he refers to stated that electroconvulsive therapy might actually be under-used among the intellectually disabled.</P>
        <P>There is a passing reference in Dr. O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s article to the possible side-effects of electroconvulsive therapy, such as amnesia, fractured limb bones, dislocated jaw, broken teeth, bitten tongue, myocardial infarction and angina.  There is some reference to cognitive patients who have undergone electroconvulsive therapy and who experienced cognitive difficulties afterwards.  Again, not very much attention is given to that issue in the article.</P>
        <P>I would like to read a short passage from a psychiatrist who has been a very vocal critic of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy, Dr. Peter Breggin.  This highlights why there is a campaign among those who have experienced electroconvulsive therapy and object strongly to its involuntary use in particular.  Dr. Breggin writes:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is impossible to find words that are sufficient to communicate the tragic personal cost to many of the patients who undergo ECT.  In my own experience, spanning more than thirty years, I have encountered dozens of individuals whose lives have been wrecked by the effects of ECT on their mental function ... Many have been left with such devastating retrograde amnesia that they can no longer function as professional persons or homemakers.  Years of professional training and other key aspects of their lives have been obliterated.  Even portions of their past that they can remember may seem remote and alien as if they are watching a movie rather than recalling their own lives.  Often they have been impaired in their ongoing ability to focus or pay attention, to concentrate, to make sense out of complex situations, to remember names and places, to learn anything new, to find their way around and to read and think effectively.  Frequently they have become irritable and easily frustrated, emotionally unstable and shallow in their ability to feel.  Often they feel depressed and even suicidal over the loss of their mental function.  In short, they have shown all the typical signs of close head injury, including frontal and temporal lobe dysfunction.  Often their families have been irreparably damaged by their inability to function as wage earners, husbands or wives, mothers or fathers.  A treatment that can cause such devastation, while producing such limited and questionable results, has no place in the practice of medicine.</P><Col N="484"/>
        <P>Having looked at the research in the area of electroconvulsive therapy in preparing for our Private Members&rsquo; Bill, it seems to me that there is a great deal of uncertainty as to why it is that the ECT procedure is effective at all, where it is effective in some patients.  Given the scientific uncertainty surrounding it, the point the Green Party is making is that its use without the consent of the patient must be prevented until we have the scientific knowledge that can explain how and why it works and on what patients it can be effective.  I move the motion and ask other Members of the House to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This Chamber has a proud history of independent thought and action and I believe we have more freedom in this regard than Members of the other House.  More use should be made of Private Members&rsquo; time which should be in putting that independent thought and action into practice.  Far too often, when motions on the Government side are moved, they are self-congratulatory.  Far too often when they are moved on the Opposition side of the House, they unfairly attribute all the woes of the world to the Government and its actions.  However, this proud Chamber has an opportunity for investigation that I do not believe may be found elsewhere in the Irish political system.  In moving this Bill tonight, I and my colleague, Senator de B&uacute;rca, are trying to use that independence to highlight an issue which otherwise might not get the attention it deserves in terms of public discourse and the need to have appropriate legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>It is clear that greater attention should be paid to whole area of mental health.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, who has moved into his job recently, is discovering this on a daily basis.  There have been moves towards a more humanistic and humane approach to dealing with the issue in our public policy, yet many gaps in provisions remain.  We have a far-reaching and generally accepted policy document in A Vision for Change, yet the legislation on the Statute Book contradicts many of the policy goals it recommends.  In the legislation we are moving in Private Members&rsquo; time the Green Party is attempting to point out where those inconsistencies lie.</P>
        <P>There is a need for wider debate about the whole question of the rights of mental health patients and the discrepancies that exist between the types of treatment and the freedom of choice on offer to people who are being treated for mental health ailments as opposed to that enjoyed by patients suffering from general medical conditions.  We need to have a debate on how people are admitted to institutions and how they are given particular medication, but that is too wide-ranging a subject to deal with in the context of this Bill.  The Bill concentrates on two procedures which are the subject of debate in the medical and psychiatric communities and which cause a great deal of discomfort to those suffering from mental health disabilities.  If the introduction of the Bill further promotes this debate, it will have performed an important function.</P>
        <P>The Green Party wants two sections of the Mental Health Act 2001 amended.  The Bill proposes the deletion of section 58 and its references to psycho-surgery or what is more commonly known as lobotomy.  I accept deletion of the section would be inadequate because it would create a legal limbo.  There is still a need to strengthen the legislation by putting in force a legal prohibition for a practice that, thankfully, no longer is happening on a regular basis.  While it exists on the Statute Book, it represents an unnecessary temptation for those who want a surgical approach to dealing with psychological difficulties.</P>
        <P>The second procedure, covered in section 59 of the Mental Health Act 2001, is more controversial.  There is a debate about the use and extent of electroconvulsive therapy.  Even in its current condition, its use is widespread.  The most recent statistics show that 840 people have <Col N="485"/>been subject to ECT treatment in one year.  The average course for the treatment for an individual averages at four to six incidents in one year.  This means the procedure is conducted between 4,500 and 6,000 times on nearly 1,000 people every year.  That proves a reliance on a therapy that needs to be questioned.  The legislation is purporting to control whether people can opt into the use of this therapy or whether there are circumstances such a therapy can be thrust upon them.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Act specifies the role of the Mental Health Commission in this area.  However, the statistics make no differentiation whatsoever as to whether recipients of ECT have done so on a voluntary or involuntary basis.  That speaks for the weakness of the existing legislation and highlights the need for it to be reformed in a dramatic way.</P>
        <P>Using Private Members&rsquo; time to introduce this Bill and the request to the Minister to take a particular position is an unorthodox use of the Green Party&rsquo;s position in the House.  The Bill is about recognising that a problem exists and the need for an appropriate Government response to have legislation that reflects on an inconsistency for many people who live with mental health difficulties.  I ask the Minister to look on the legislation favourably.  I accept that the deletion of section 58 would create a legal anomaly.  Senator de B&uacute;rca pointed out much needs to be added to the Bill on Committee Stage to make it more acceptable and determine whether these procedures are voluntary or involuntary.</P>
        <P>The concept of advanced consent does not exist in our legal system and needs to be teased out on Committee Stage.  I believe it has validity.  If people are affected psychiatrically, their ability to give informed consent is obviously constrained.  An important legal concept we are willing to put on the Statute Book is for an individual, who knows in advance when they are fully mentally aware of the nature of the treatment, to be willing to accept it at any date in the future.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to initiative a review of these two procedures.  It is the Green Party&rsquo;s intention to ensure this legislation receives as much support as possible from all Members.  The understanding of the Minister will be part of that process.  I am confident that having listened to the arguments the Minister of State will ensure this legislation is improved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the fundamental idea behind and intention of the Bill.  While it is, as Senator Boyle stated, an unorthodox use of Private Members&rsquo; time, it is an interesting exercise which should put this topic on the wider agenda.  It is a controversial topic within psychiatry and among patient advocacy groups and others who take an interest in mental health issues.  The range of views on ECT are evident from the literature on the treatment, particularly that of psychiatrists working on the frontline of mental health services.  There is equally a strong body of literature from patient advocates, expressing enormous concerns about this treatment.  I look forward to the views of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, on this Bill.</P>
        <P>I suggest that a next step in the debate would be to invite interested parties, such as the Mental Health Commission, patients&rsquo; advocates and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to make presentations on the treatment.  Introducing this Bill will mean the topic will come out into the open for more discussion.</P>
        <P>There are considerable regional variations in the use of ECT.  What one finds with such variations is that the criteria for using the treatment are also varied.  While I believe ECT is a rather historic treatment, I must take note that some experts have said it may be a treatment of choice in certain circumstances.  Such circumstances would have to be defined with clear guidelines and the practice would have to be highly regulated.  An informed discussion at the health committee would also allow us to consider recent research on the treatment.</P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>The extraordinary variation in the rate of ECT prescription across the country is a matter of concern and raises questions.  Apparently the Mental Health Commission does not have statistics breaking down the cases where patients voluntarily accepted ECT, consent was given or the decision was made by others such as relatives.  All that type of information must come to the fore if we are to have the necessary debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I was struck also by the work being done by the organisation MIND in the United Kingdom on patient consent, which is at the core of this Bill.  The new UK Mental Health Act 2007 introduces new safeguards for patients.  ECT can be given only if the patient consents and the treatment is appropriate.  In addition, if the patient is over 18, the doctor in charge of treatment or a second opinion doctor must certify in writing that he or she is capable of understanding the procedure and consenting to it.  If the patient is under 18, a second opinion doctor must certify in writing that the patient is capable of understanding and consenting to the treatment.  That would meet what the Green Party is suggesting in this Bill.  That legislation should be examined and taken on board by the Minister to determine if it can be introduced into our legislation.  More detailed points are made by MIND on this issue.  We need a detailed debate on the consent issue.  As far as psychosurgery is concerned it seems extraordinary that there remains a whole section in the Mental Health Act dealing with that, which clearly is inappropriate.</P>
        <P>I want to make some other points regarding mental health.  This discussion is helpful because for too long there has been a stigma associated with mental health.  It may be helpful also to those patients having ECT or who have had it in the past and had bad experiences.  We must talk about issues such as this, examine the parameters and what is happening in the area.</P>
        <P>For too long we have ignored mental health issues and we continue to have major problems regarding mental health services.  Some psychiatrists have expressed concern that if ECT could not be used without the patient&rsquo;s consent, some patients most in need of treatment would not receive any.  There are problems also concerning the capability of some patients either to give or deny consent.</P>
        <P>With modern advances in medication and other treatments some of those concerns might be outdated but I would like some discussion about them because it has been said to me that on occasions the use of ECT can be a life or death situation in terms of the patient&rsquo;s needs.  I have an open mind on that but we must have a discussion about it.  Is this an essential treatment at some point for some patients who might not be able to give consent?  I would like to hear more on that and that is why I suggest we have hearings on it.  I would like to see that happen but the Mental Health Commission immediately should carry out the audit on the use of ECT in Ireland, examine regional variances and, in a very short time, produce a report to update guidelines for those rare and urgent situations, if they arise.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the lack of funding for mental health services.  I am concerned about the &euro;25 million that appears to have gone missing.  The Minister for Health and Children told the Committee on Health and Children some weeks ago that she was trying to find out what had happened to it before further funding was allocated this year.  The Minister of State might clarify the position in that regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding the United Nations declaration on the rights of those with a disability, in its most recent work in this area it has removed the question of force and the fact that any patient could be forced to agree to this treatment.  If we ratify that declaration, and the Minister of State might consider that, it would address the issues the Green Party suggests must be dealt with in this legislation.  That would be a help to Government in terms of taking action in this area if it brings in this measure.</P><Col N="487"/>
        <P>Much more could be said about the mental health services but I would make the point that several child and adolescent units throughout the country are not taking referrals.  They have closed their books.  Units in Laois, Offaly, Kildare and Cavan are telling parents who need an assessment or whose children need a referral for psychiatry that the service is closed and they cannot take referrals.  That is serious.</P>
        <P>I ask the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats in Government to take an interest in that issue, as well as in the issue they have raised in this debate, and examine the overall mental health services, the funding and the service available to people.  While an argument can probably be made that ECT belongs to another era, a child being told they must wait two years for an assessment equally should belong to another era.</P>
        <P>As far as mental health teams are concerned, many teams throughout the country do not have their full multidisciplinary staffing.  I was told today that in many teams people going on maternity leave, for example, are not being replaced.  Many teams are missing members and are unable to give a comprehensive service to patients with mental health problems who are attending psychiatric teams throughout the country.  That is a serious issue and one I hope the Green Party and the Minister would address also.</P>
        <P>This debate is welcome.  I congratulate the Green Party on bringing forward the Bill.  I would like to see it discussed further in the Committee on Health and Children and to have a hearing on the issue.  I support the principles contained in the Bill, with the reservation that we need further discussion on the consent issue for rare cases where it may be seen as an essential treatment.  I want a discussion on whether it is still considered an essential treatment in certain circumstances by professionals in this area.  If that is the case, it will have to be clearly defined.</P>
        <P>There is strong literature from Germany, the United States of America and the United Kingdom indicating that in some very defined circumstances this could be a treatment of choice that would be life-saving.  I put that on the record because I believe it needs further discussion and not to take in any way from the principles behind the Bill.</P>

	<P>I express my thanks to the Leader, Senator Cassidy, and to my colleague, Senator Phelan, for their welcome.  Coming into the House for the first time as Minister of State, I am pleased the issue is related specifically to the area of mental health.  In that regard I thank Senator Boyle and Senator de B&uacute;rca.  It is not unorthodox for either Senator Boyle or Senator de B&uacute;rca to introduce this Bill during Private Members&rsquo; time.  The area of mental health and well-being is an issue to which no party on its own has all the answers.  A number of the points raised, including those by Senator Fitzgerald, are relevant and forward-thinking and it is up to us to embrace that.</P>
        <P>My job in the Department is not to come to the House and stamp a political party&rsquo;s approval on any proposal but to recognise that in moving forward the area of mental health and well-being there are areas we must re-examine and there is room for amendments.  The Bill is timely because the officials in the Department are engaged in drafting amendments to the Act.  This Bill is timely but it was never meant to suggest to the parties in Government that it had all the answers.  It is fair to record also that the need for the amendments was identified in the review of the operation of the Act.  That review is ongoing.  That is not to suggest that the review will go on indefinitely.  It is quite immediate.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>There are several views on aspects of ECT.  I welcome Mr. John McCarthy and other people who have met me privately.  They have quite trenchantly described to me their areas of concern.  I will take on board the concerns of people, matched with the advice from other sectors in the psychiatry profession.</P>
        <P>We are prepared to listen to all the groups as we move on with this debate.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s suggestion that the Joint Committee on Health and Children should be the forum for bringing in people such as the Mental Health Commission, the various advocacy groups, representatives of the psychiatry profession, to deal with the issue of ECT.  It is also timely to state that this information is being collated.  It will be important to study the results which will show the number of patients who have presented, both voluntarily and involuntarily for this treatment.  This data should be studied in advance of any meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
        <P>I also wish to recognise other points made by Senators, such as the issue of the stigma attached to those who present with mental health difficulties.  If I am asked for my views and the policy of my Department, my priority as Minister of State will be to implement change and I hope I will be in the position long enough to do so.  I refer in particular to the area of the stigma attached to mental illness.  I know of many people who will say they are reluctant to present for treatment because it is often given in the old psychiatric hospital system.</P>
        <P>I can state with a certain background knowledge that many people have suffered from the disease of alcoholism and related depressive illnesses.  I have no problem saying that my father suffered with the disease of alcoholism.  He made no bones about it.  In the 20 years when he was on the dry, he took time to try to explain to people the very sensible attitude that alcoholism is the same as any other illness and it was clearly up to the State to provide facilities to ensure that people withdrawing from that illness could seek treatment.  Unfortunately, in the 1960s and 1970s, the only places available, unless one had private money, were in the local psychiatric hospitals.</P>
        <P>I wish to put down a marker for my time in the Department that I want to see support come from the Oireachtas Members throughout the State.  I have already asked for an audit of all the State&rsquo;s assets connected with psychiatric hospitals and attached lands.  Members of the Oireachtas must prove our bona fides in the constituencies.  The funding from securing those assets will go directly back into mental health.  If people have concerns that this funding will be swallowed up in some other part of the HSE, I can assure the House that this funding will be specifically used for the upgrading and modernisation of mental health facilities in the country.</P>
        <P>The report of the Mental Health Commission<b> </b>recommended that acute psychiatric care units should be located throughout the State.  People should be properly housed in psychiatric facilities that are deemed proper for their care.  Adolescent patients are currently housed in hospitals that were built not in the last century but in the one before that.  I am making a policy commitment to remove the stigma by inviting four or five people from each county who have been successful in the arts, politics, drama or sport, who have presented with mental health difficulties, have been properly treated and are back in the workforce to speak about their experiences. This would be a start in removing the stigma.</P>
        <P>I attended a conference in Brussels last week, as did John McCarthy, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  I heard the most telling speech I have ever heard from the former Norwegian Prime Minister.  He stated that while Prime Minister he had suffered from a depressive illness.  He kept this to himself for quite some time but he then realised he could no longer do so.  When he told his advisers that he needed to make a statement about his illness his officials beseeched <Col N="489"/>him to say he had some other illness but he disagreed and told the public about his illness.  As a result of his public announcement about his difficulties, mental health treatment in Norway moved on years beyond where we are today.  I hope we can move on.  I have set out my commitment to work to remove that stigma, to work to modernise the mental health service by providing facilities.  Senator Fitzgerald was a member of the joint committee when we produced the report on the high levels of suicide.  We made 64 recommendations, all of which tie in with the Reach Out programme established by the Government.</P>
        <P>I  wish to assure the House that the Government is firmly committed to the development of our mental health service and to the protection of people with mental health difficulties.  At the end of January last, the office for disability and mental health was established with a remit to bring about greater collaboration across the public service on issues relating to disability and mental health.  This office is cross-sectoral and will deal with different Departments such as the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children.  The office will promote and encourage an integrated &ldquo;whole-of-government&rdquo; approach in progressing the Government&rsquo;s agenda in this area, and will make the political commitment to disability and mental health a reality.  In response to Senator Fitzgerald, it is clear the commitment can be challenged when we hear of a reduction in funding of &euro;25 million and I have to accept what she says.  It is up to the Department and the senior and junior Ministers to establish the reason the HSE removed the &euro;25 million and I have requested this information.  It is also necessary to conduct an audit of where the effects of the reduction in funding of &euro;25 million will be seen.  We must also ensure the funding initially allocated remains intact.  I have requested a meeting with the HSE to seek answers to those questions and I expect this meeting will take place in the next few days.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been significant and very welcome developments within mental health services in Ireland with the launch of A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy in January 2006 and the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001.  We cannot move on A Vision for Change unless we have the capital funding to do so and this will involve the realisation of the asset value into proper modern facilities.  A Vision for Change represents a seven to ten-year action plan for the development of a modern, high quality mental health service which places the person at the centre.  The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services are covered in the report.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Act 2001, which was fully implemented from 1 November 2006, is unquestionably the most significant piece of mental health legislation in Ireland in the past 60 years.  It provides improved safeguards for people with mental illness and ensures the protection of the rights of people who are admitted involuntarily for care and treatment.  This is the kernel of the issue proposed in this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>
        <P>All involuntary detentions are now automatically reviewed by an independent Mental Health Tribunal.  The review is independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention or an extension order being signed.  This brings Irish mental health legislation into line with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 2 of the 2001 Act has extensive  provisions  governing the  use  of involuntary admission procedures and is acknowledged as containing a high level of protective measures in relation to patients&rsquo; rights.  Members will gather from my speech that the overall theme is one of protection.  We must work towards and agree on the degrees of protection involved and that is why I am suggesting, particularly to Senator de B&uacute;rca, that the amendments will quite properly take into account most of the views that have been expressed here today. I do not want to sign off on that as there is a long road to go but we are prepared to accept such amendments.  I am not <Col N="490"/>here to refuse Opposition amendments, nor to ignore the Private Members&rsquo; motion.  I want to establish clearly that it is a matter of us working together towards producing a Mental Health Act of which we can be proud and, more importantly, a legislative measure with which patients and their families can be satisfied.</P>
        <P>The discussion here regarding a proposed amendment of the Mental Health Act is timely as my officials are currently engaged in drafting amendments to the Act.  The need for these amendments was identified in the context of the review of the operation of the Act which was undertaken by the Department of Health and Children and laid before the House in May 2007.  However, while amendments on the lines proposed are not envisaged at this stage, I  am here this evening to listen to the views expressed.  I am open to considering ways in which we can further improve our legislative protection for people with mental health difficulties.  I see that as being the basis for the motion before the House also.</P>
        <P>Our current legislation places a much needed focus on the human rights of people receiving care and treatment on an involuntary basis, and we must be careful at all times to ensure that respect and the promotion of the human rights of the service user continue to be the principles underpinning any legislative developments.</P>
        <P>The proposal before us seeks to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 concerning two particular forms of treatment, psychosurgery and electro-convulsive therapy, otherwise referred to as ECT, which may be administered to patients who are detained involuntarily under the terms of the 2001 Act.  First, let us consider the proposal to delete section 58 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which deals with psychosurgery.  Section 58 currently prohibits the carrying out of psychosurgery on involuntary patients, except where the consent of the patient in writing has been given and the procedure has been authorised by a mental health tribunal.  Section 58 is clearly a protective provision therefore.</P>
        <P>If the proposed amendment were accepted, the administration of psychosurgery would not be prohibited; rather the legislative protection for the patient in terms of requiring his or her consent, and the authorisation of the procedure by an independent mental health tribunal, would be removed.  That is where the difficulty arises.  The proposed amendment, in effect, reduces the protection for persons suffering from mental illness and its acceptance would undermine our achievements over recent years in securing better protection for such vulnerable people.  The place to tease out this matter further could well be the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Psychosurgery is a procedure that is rarely, if ever, used.  Nonetheless, it is important that provisions relating to psychosurgery should be retained in our legislation in order to protect involuntary patients against the arbitrary use of the procedure in the future.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the second element of the proposal, which seeks to amend section 59 to remove the provision which allows ECT to be administered to an involuntary patient without his or her consent.  Our current legislation requires that a patient must consent in writing to the administration of ECT.  However, the legislation provides that where a patient is unable or unwilling to give consent, the treatment may be administered if it has been approved by the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of the patient and authorised by another consultant psychiatrist.</P>
        <P>There are of course diverging views both within and outside of the psychiatric profession on the necessity and-or efficacy of ECT.  Clearly, that is the issue with which we are trying to deal.  However, it remains  a recognised treatment for severe mental illness and is sometimes used to treat persons with severe depression who do not respond to drug treatment.</P>
        <P>A review and meta-analysis which was published in the highly respected medical journal <i>The Lancet </i>in 2003, concluded that ECT is probably more effective than drug therapy.  Of course <Col N="491"/>it can be a feature of severe mental illness that a person&rsquo;s judgment may be so impaired that he or she lacks insight into his or her own condition.  Where a person is involuntarily admitted under the provisions of the 2001 Act for treatment that he or she might not otherwise receive, it is incumbent on the State and treating clinicians to provide that person with the most effective treatment for his or her condition.  A duty of care is expected from the State for people who have been admitted involuntarily, and that is the reason for that provision.</P>
        <P>If the treating consultant psychiatrist is of the opinion, based on his or her clinical expertise, that ECT is the most effective treatment in the circumstances, the law should make provision for the administration of that treatment to those who are not in a position to give their consent, within the necessary safeguards of the 2001 Act.  It could be argued that to do otherwise would be in contravention of the State&rsquo;s duty of care to the involuntary patient.  If somebody is admitted involuntarily, where does the duty of care begin or end?  I believe the State has to exercise that duty of care.</P>
        <P>During the course of the review of the Act which was undertaken by my Department and completed last year, some submissions suggested that the reference to a person who is &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; to consent to ECT should be deleted from section 59.  In other words, where capacity to consent exists, any refusal to accept treatment should be respected, and this right respected by law.  In principle, I would accept this suggestion, but this matter cannot be dealt with in isolation.  Legislation is being prepared which will take into account issues that arise in this debate.  The matter will not be parked or shelved because it is part of the ongoing process of arriving at legislation that will be well accepted.</P>
        <P>Any amendment of the Mental Health Act on these lines &mdash; for example, to delete the word &ldquo;unwilling&rdquo; from section 59 &mdash; would have to be undertaken within a supporting framework of legislation defining legal capacity.  The Office for Disability and Mental Health has already raised this matter in the context of the development of new capacity legislation by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I can assure the House that it will be considered further in that context.  This aspect defines the importance of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health.  It is a cross-departmental issue that requires continued action, not least under my Department&rsquo;s aegis.</P>
        <P>The ethos of the Mental Health Act 2001 was to provide a modern framework within which people who have a mental disorder and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated. The Act provides mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services to the most vulnerable of all can be monitored, inspected and regulated.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Mental Health Commission published rules on the use of ECT in November 2006 and the inspector of mental health services monitors compliance with these rules on an annual basis.  While compliance is important, I take the point made by some Senators that it is also important to have the data to hand, and they are currently being prepared.  The rules require that at the conclusion of a programme of ECT, an ECT register is completed for each involuntary patient and a copy placed in the patient&rsquo;s clinical file.  The administration of ECT without consent must be recorded in the patient&rsquo;s file and a copy forwarded to the Mental Health Commission, which is an important safeguard.  These rules are kept under periodic   review by the commission and can be revised as required.  Any review of the rules governing the administration of ECT should ensure international best practice continues to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission recently published a review of the operation of Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001, as required under Section 42 of the Act.  The report noted that stakeholders in the mental health services have participated in a significant programme of <Col N="492"/>reform in recent years and that commencement of Part 2 of the 2001 Act has brought a greater level of openness to mental health services in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank those contributing.  I especially thank Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca for putting this on the agenda of the House.  I say that genuinely coming from a position, as we all do, of trying to improve mental health services.  It is fair to point out that there have undoubtedly been great strides taken in the development of mental health services in Ireland in recent years, particularly in improving the legislative protection of persons with mental illness.</P>
        <P>While I have reservations about deleting section 58 on psychosurgery, further consideration of these provisions in the Act concerning consent to treatment is appropriate and will be progressed in the context of the development of capacity legislation.</P>
        <P>I want to confirm that we are saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  On the concerns raised, we are preparing amendments.  In the context of the capacity legislation, it gives us the vehicle to take on board what the Senators are saying.  I also see the tremendous sense in properly and openly debating the issue at Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children level, particularly by way of bringing in experts who will voice their positions for or against.  It will also deal with the issue of ECT, especially for elderly patients who refuse to eat or drink.  It must be underpinned by the Government&rsquo;s commitment by way of a duty of care.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for giving me this opportunity.  I again issue the invitation that we will sit down in September or October with all the Members who represent constituencies where there are the older facilities to see if we can come up with a common programme, rather than a Government programme, as to how we can transfer the assets to modern facilities.  I invite everybody to participate in that.  To my mind, that is the way to move forward.  Not everything will be resolved by way of new buildings.  It is equally important to have the back-up professional staff.  I am prepared to take all the advice given to me, particularly by the advocacy groups and, more importantly, by the Mental Health Commission.</P>

	<P>Before I call the next speaker, I take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the Chamber.  I do so as a Tullamore woman and a neighbour of Deputy John Moloney from his native Mountmellick.  I am delighted to see him in the Seanad taking this debate.  I commend him on the honest and personal nature of the earlier part of his presentation.  It is a measure of the kind of man he is and, indeed, an indication of the type of Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children that he will be.  On a personal note, I wish him well in his Ministry because it is the first time he has been in the Seanad Chamber.  I look forward to seeing much more of him here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also a great pleasure for me to be able to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I could not be happier that he has so recently vacated the Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I would agree with both Senator Fitzgerald and the Minister of State that it is an excellent forum where we should seek to have all types of submissions from interested parties right across the divide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As somebody who has worked in the health services for a long time and whose partner has been working in psychiatry for the past 30 years, I have a degree of knowledge of the subject.  This is an opportunity to have a welcome debate.  I am aware that among the Senators there is <Col N="493"/>a wide level of experience in the health services and also psychiatry, and we do not come wanting to the Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mental ill-health is widely varied.  It affects so many elements in society.  Whether it is as a fall-out from taking so-called recreational drugs and the psychotic episodes that might occur as a result, an adverse reaction to cannabis, the age profile of a particular personality trait or the wide umbrella under which mental health issues can arise, there are many aspects to the treatment.</P>
        <P>In my professional life as a midwife, I especially remember one occasion when a poor lady deteriorated into puerperal psychosis and there was a very dramatic positive effect from the procedure, but I also will temper that by saying that I was horrified by my first viewing of patients having ECT.  There is an element of acceptance.  I have a great belief in the capacity of professionals to deliver excellent care and to have different methods, both of specialties and treatments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It will be important in our deliberations in this welcome debate that there would be inputs from all affected parties and, if possible, from people who may have had this particular treatment, and where they found that it was of benefit.  If it was not and they are unable to give a view, that is something we must accept as well.  Patient advocacy groups are excellent in putting cases for people who may not be able to articulate their own response.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the sub-committee on suicide.  In that regard, I have a concern which is somewhat related.  I suppose it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to bring a few items for the Minister of State&rsquo;s shopping basket.  Currently in Clonmel there are lands to the value of &euro;12 million belonging to the former health board and undergoing sale.  I would like to see that &euro;12 million being reinvested in mental health services.</P>
        <P>As has been stated, we are not talking about buildings but about services.  On the issue of whether those resources need to be put into new buildings or into services that will meet the needs of youth, I acknowledge there is a desperate need to have an evaluation system that will fully identify the needs of adolescents where it might be decided that they need admission to a bed.  I am aware that not all young adolescents who need to be evaluated will need inpatient treatment.  In fact, there are many aspects to treatment and to modern methods of research.  There are also many methods of modern drug treatments which are effective and are monitored.  There are blind studies and double blind studies.  There are all sorts of methods of evaluating the effectiveness of treatments carried out.</P>
        <P>I will not delay much longer except to say that I welcome the taking of submissions from interested parties through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is a matter of public record that we would welcome the input from affected and interested individuals, parties, professionals, advocacy groups and, indeed, clients of the service.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, and I wish him every success in his remit as Minister of State.  I say without fear of contradiction that he will make such a difference to the mental health services.  There is already a mind change in many elements of society where mental health services are no longer seen as the aspect of care that needed to be swept under the carpet.  There also will be a great deal of sensitivity towards those who do not wish to have their personal mental issues discussed.  I am always careful when speaking about Clonmel in case somebody asks if I was talking about him or her.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and commend the Green Party on its thoughtfulness in bringing an issue, such as this, the fore.  I am sure that by the time it reaches finality, we will have the fullest information available.  We will be a very informed group, which is welcome.  Anything which improves an outcome or a particular treatment is welcome.  I do <Col N="494"/>not consider it boldness on the part of Senator Dan Boyle in bringing this Bill before the House.  It is a welcome opportunity to contribute to the debate and I thank him for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State on his first occasion in the House in his new role as Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health.  He has a significant interest in, and commitment to, the area he outlined and I wish him well in<?oasys _jy ?>his portfolio.  Like other Members, I have no doubt this area will be the better for his appointment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment that moneys allocated to the area of mental health will be spent in that area.  It has been a constant source of frustration to me and to other Members that when seeking to ascertain where moneys allocated have been spent, we have not been able to reach satisfactory conclusions.  If Members of the Oireachtas vote for a sum of money to be spent in a particular area, it behoves agencies, such as the HSE, to comply with it out of respect for, and courtesy to, them.  We would not allocate the moneys if we did not believe there was a need to do so.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the work he will undertake to ensure the stigma associated with mental health becomes a thing of the past.  I welcome any opportunity to create a greater sense of openness for, and a greater understanding and awareness of, people who experience mental health challenges.  One of the welcome consequences of doing so will be that people who experience mental health challenges will be much more open to seeking assistance and intervention.  Therefore, it is critical we have the services in place to respond to people who will avail of that openness and understanding to come forward to seek treatment.</P>
        <P>Turning to the Bill before us, it is useful to commence by reflecting on the Act it seeks to amend.  The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework within which people who have mental disorders and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated.  It puts in place mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated.  It includes a range of safeguards to ensure the rights of people who are admitted involuntarily for care and treatment are protected.  Its enactment brought Irish law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>Part 2 of the Act has extensive provisions governing the use of involuntary admission procedures and is acknowledged as containing a high level of protective measures in regard to patients rights, including mental health tribunals and legal representation.  Part 4 of the Mental Health Act entitled, &ldquo;Consent to Treatment&rdquo;, contains a range of provisions which govern the administration of certain forms of treatment to involuntary patients.</P>
        <P>The Act also established the Mental Health Commission to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practice and to protect the interests of people detained under it.  It also provided for the establishment of the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services replacing the former inspector of mental hospitals.</P>
        <P>As the Act came into being, teething difficulties were experienced around its implementation.  It has brought about changes in practices, requirements and expectations.  Its implementation has certainly proved challenging for all involved, especially with the establishment of the mental health tribunals.  However, many of the initial hiccups and uncertainties have been ironed out.  While some challenges remain to be addressed, a consensus has emerged that the Mental Health Act has had a very positive impact for patients and that it has ensured that Ireland conforms with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>This Private Members&rsquo; Bill proposes to amend the Act in regard to two forms of treatment which may be administered to patients detained involuntarily, namely, psychosurgery and elec<Col N="495"/>troconvulsive therapy, otherwise known as ECT.  Section 1 of this Bill proposes that section 58 of the Act, which deals with psychosurgery, be deleted and section 2 proposes that section 59 of the Act be amended to remove the provision which would allow ECT to be administered to an involuntary patient without consent.</P>
        <P>Under the Act psychosurgery means any surgical operation which destroys brain tissue or the functioning of brain tissue and which is performed for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder.  This procedure is rarely, if ever, used.  I do not believe it has been used in Ireland since the 1960s.  However, as it still remains a possible form of intervention, it is believed necessary to include provision in legislation to protect any involuntary patients against any future use of the procedure.</P>
        <P>Would it be possible for research on psychosurgery, its use in Ireland and abroad and its efficacy and appropriateness to be undertaken to inform our thinking on any future amendment that may be necessary?  The question which should be before us is whether psychosurgery should remain a possible form of intervention.  Undertaking a review of the area, both in Ireland and internationally, to ascertain its exact use and appropriateness would be very informative.  I agree with the Minister of State that if we were to proceed with the provision in this Bill to delete section 58 of the Act, unintentionally, the effect could be to remove the protection in place for the involuntary patient whose consent is currently required.  The question should be whether to delete psychosurgery as an option and not section 58 of the Mental Health Act.</P>
        <P>In regard to electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, the amendment in the Bill would remove the provision whereby it can be administered to an involuntary patient who is unable or unwilling to consent.  While there are diverging views, both inside and outside mental health services, on its necessity or efficacy, it remains a recognised and legitimate treatment for some forms of severe mental illness.  The evidence available on its necessity and efficacy is mixed, appearing to be stronger in its use for older people where other medical treatment has elicited no effect &mdash; for example, in instances of deep depression.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the Minister of State said, a study published in 2003 in <i>The Lancet </i>concluded that ECT was more effective than drug therapy.  In regard to the Department&rsquo;s review, we could perhaps consider ECT in the context of the capacity legislation due before us.  We should examine the capacity of people to give consent and their right to have it respected and taken on board.  I also ask that the capacity to give consent of involuntary patients be considered for a range of situations and not only limited to the use of electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.  My understanding is that the legislation we are considering which deals with the capacity of consent will be based on the concept of functional capacity and not based on a broad blanket of capacity.  The legislation, therefore, would provide a framework that would allow situational-specific capacity and therefore maximise a person&rsquo;s autonomy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased that we are debating mental health in general.  In the short time I have been in the Seanad I have heard several Senators from all parties raise the issues of mental health, its treatment and the resources required for dealing with mental health in Ireland.  An excellent document was produced in 2006 called A Vision for Change.  The roll-out and implementation of the recommendations of that report is a serious concern for many people involved in the mental health sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Mental Health Ireland consists of many voluntary groups  working with mental health patients and their families and advocates for them on a daily basis highlighting the lack of resources and the issues that affect patients.  I am sure, as I have, many Senators have met these groups in recent years.  They include Aware, The Irish Advocacy Network, Schizophrenia <Col N="496"/>Ireland, GROW, OANDA, Headway Ireland, The Samaritans, BodyWise, The Alzheimer Society of Ireland and Recovery Inc.  These groups advocate on a daily basis and deal with issues such as those we are debating.  The Trojan work of these groups to educate the public and politicians about what it is like to live with, work and treat people with mental health issues should be acknowledged by all legislators and policy makers.  It is important we listen to these groups as they are at the coalface every day confronting the issues.</P>
        <P>On the Bill, it is important that legislators and policy makers keep issues of mental health as the highest priority when debating health in general.  I compliment the Green Party on bringing forward this Bill.  There is consensus across the House.  The general thrust of the Bill is good and it attempts to address some issues of concern to the bodies and patients already mentioned.</P>
        <P>The two procedures specifically mentioned in the Bill, psychosurgery and ECT, have been controversial within the health service and among clinicians and the people that treat mental health patients.  There is a debate proceeding among those sectors.  It is important that we as politicians debate the issues and that we inform ourselves, as much as possible, about the techniques used in mental health treatment.  ECT seems to be a stressful treatment.  I have consulted with people that have worked in this area, whether it is psychiatrists or psychiatric nurses and they have indicated it should be a treatment of last resort, that all other treatments and therapies should be explored, and that it is important that, where possible, the consent of the patient is approved before any invasive treatments such as ECT are considered.  There are concerns about the regional variations of the application of this treatment and this needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to ask his Department to carry out studies into the way ECT has been used in Ireland.  There are obviously concerns about the treatment.  Some people to whom I have spoken suggest it is used too randomly and freely by some psychiatrists.  Others say there is a need for ECT, but that the guidelines and protocol for its use need to be stricter and properly regulated.  I call for clearer guidelines and protocol.  There should be systems which properly inform patients, their families and advocate groups.</P>
        <P>It is also important to get the views of clinicians.  In psychiatry we often hear of a second opinion, so professionals differ in their views too.  We need a wider examination of the treatment system in Ireland.  We need to consult extensively with clinicians, patients and their families and the advocacy groups.  We need proper regulation and monitoring of how ECT has been used and how it is proposed to be used in future.  We need a proper evaluation on how successful it has been.  I am sure some will argue it has been a considerable success, whereas others will say it has not been successful.  A proper evaluation of the success of ECT should be examined.</P>
        <P>It was suggested by my colleague, Senator Frances Fitzgerald, that there is a role for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to examine mental health in general, but also to examine the aspects of mental health this Bill presents.  Some guidelines used in other jurisdictions have been recommended and are generally accepted by professionals and clinicians in the area.  ECT is used for rapid and short-term improvement of severe symptoms after other treatment has failed, or when the condition is considered to be potentially life-threatening.  Some guidelines set down in other areas include the recommendation that the therapy is used for patients with severe depressive illness, types of schizophrenia or a prolonged or severe manic episode.  The decision to use ECT should be made jointly by the individual and the clinicians responsible for the treatment.  Consent should be obtained where the patient is able to give such permission.</P><Col N="497"/>
        <P>There are many areas that need to be examined.  I welcome this debate and the Green Party is to be commended on putting mental health in general on the agenda.  I look forward to further debates on this issue as it is certainly an area we need to discuss.  The report <i>A Vision for Change</i> which was introduced two years ago considers a long-term plan.  We are already two years into that plan and many of the advocacy groups and politicians representing those with mental health issues would agree we are not achieving our targets.  The money and resources that were supposed to be allocated to treat mental health under the recommendations of the report have been cut in the budgets.  There is disappointment in the advocacy groups about this.  The report promised much and if the recommendations were implemented as proposed we could make serious improvements in the treatment of patients.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I sense as a public representative that we are finally lifting the stigma which in the past was attached to mental illness in Ireland.  I acknowledge the role the advocacy groups are playing in educating the public about mental health issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am from County Waterford and there is a institution there called St. Otteran&rsquo;s Hospital which does Trojan work, and I have spoken to staff there.  There are concerns as the hospital is due to be sold.  Promises were made that the resources and money raised from the sale of extensive property would be ring-fenced and re-invested into mental health facilities.  This is only fair, because where mental health patients are returning to the community they will need the financial resources to support themselves.  It is only right that any money raised from sales of lands in psychiatric services should be ring-fenced for the benefit of those patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the Chamber, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his role.  It is unfortunate that several other Members were not here to listen to his contribution.  He spoke with an in-depth knowledge of the challenges that lay ahead for him, and with a passion to resolve those challenges quickly and effectively.</P>
        <P>I congratulate my Green Party colleagues on bringing forward this amendment to the Mental Health Act 2001.  This Act already includes a range of safeguards to ensure the rights of people who are admitted involuntarily for care and treatment are protected and that Irish law conforms to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The amendments proposed this evening set out to further safeguard those rights and to ensure that very invasive treatment procedures are not administered without a patient&rsquo;s consent.  The amendments are most definitely inspired by a desire to protect people with mental health difficulties and they offer us an opportunity to discuss a number of important issues in this Chamber.</P>
        <P>I agree with the thrust of these Green Party amendments and what they set out to achieve.  It is important also to state how this treatment emerged and to set out its history.  The concept of having electricity pass through one&rsquo;s brain is daunting enough to frighten even the most well-informed and well educated people.  It is broadly accepted that the apparent effectiveness of ECT results from the long-term brain damage it causes.</P>
        <P>In 1941, Dr Walter Freeman, the psychiatrist who introduced ECT to America, wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">The greater the damage, the more likely the remission of psychotic symptoms ... Maybe it will be shown that a mentally ill patient can think more clearly and more constructively with less brain in operation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 1942, another US psychiatrist and proponent of ECT, Dr. Stainbrook, wrote:</P>
        <P LI="1">It may be true that these people have ... more intelligence than they can handle and that the reduction in intelligence is an important factor in the curative process.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P FLI="0">He went on to say:</P>
        <P LI="1">Some of the best cures one gets are in those individuals who one reduces almost to amentia [a term used to describe total imbecility.]</P>
        <P FLI="0">During the following 30 years, hundred of thousands of patients of all ages across the globe received electroshock treatments for every type of disorder, including depression, mania, schizophrenia and even homosexuality and truancy from school.  By the end of the 1960s, ECT treatment had almost vanished from the psychiatric scene.  However, it has undergone a makeover in the past 20 years and has regained a huge degree of respectability in some quarters.  Many psychiatrists now consider it an efficient way to relieve severe depression or to break a manic cycle for the manic depressive.  According to ECT advocates, it can restore a severely depressed or manic patient to health in half the time it takes medication to do so.</P>
        <P>Critics of ECT argue it is primitive and outdated.  They also believe that positive results are short-term and that patients who undergo ECT suffer cognitive problems, including significant memory loss and the ability to learn.  They believe what looks like relief is really just the effect of a head trauma.  What is incredible is that doctors still do not know for certain why ECT works to fight mental illnesses.  This often makes the decision to have ECT even more difficult for a patient.  The leading opponent of ECT, Dr. Peter Breggin, a psychiatrist and author, believes that the price is too high.  He describes ECT as playing Russian roulette with your brain.  He believes that the procedure is no more sophisticated than hitting someone over the head with a club.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that there are very divergent opinions within the field of psychiatry, both from doctors and patients, on the effectiveness and the appropriateness of ECT.  There is little information on the use of ECT in Ireland and research is badly needed.  Most recent figures reveal that in 2003, 859 persons in the South had treatments and that 628 people in the North of Ireland had treatments.  Among other problems, there is no information on gender breakdown, age distribution, the number of people to whom ECT was forcibly applied, and, most importantly, the number of fatalities.</P>
        <P>The amendments proposed this evening to the Mental Health Act 2001 do not purport to settle the argument but instead set out to allow the patient the right to decide whether or not to avail of the therapy.  In particular, the concept of informed consent is introduced in this new legislation.  Under the &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; protocol, permission to administer ECT comes following a careful review of the treatment with the person providing consent.  The psychiatrist explains what ECT involves, what other treatments might be available and the benefits and risks of treatment.  The person consenting to the procedure is kept informed of progress and may withdraw consent at any time.  A psychiatrist may not force a patient to have ECT or decide for the patient that it is the appropriate treatment.  He or she must obtain written consent from the patient, or if the patient is too ill to make decisions for himself or herself, from a court-appointed guardian.</P>
        <P>At a time when there is such divergence of opinion on the effectiveness of ECT, even within the field of psychiatry here in Ireland, it is most appropriate to begin a discussion of the issue of informed consent in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The amendment proposed in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill would remove the provision whereby ECT may be administered to an involuntary patient who is &ldquo;unable or unwilling&rdquo; to consent, if two consultant psychiatrists certify that it is required.  Impairment of a person&rsquo;s judgment may be a factor in severe mental illness.  It is reasonable to expect that at some point in the patient&rsquo;s history he or she would have had the mental capacity to decide whether to subject himself or herself to ECT.  I believe that patients should at that <Col N="499"/>time be allowed to avail of the opportunity to make an informed decision on whether they would ever avail of ECT and that that decision should be fully respected by their doctors.</P>
        <P>Again, in a situation where this cannot take place, the informed consent of a court appointed guardian should be sought.  In the USA, for example, the Surgeon General&rsquo;s report on mental health requires a judicial proceeding at which patients may be represented by legal counsel prior to initiation of involuntary ECT.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">As a rule, the law requires that such petitions are granted only where the prompt institution of ECT is regarded as potentially lifesaving, as in the case of a person in grave danger because of lack of food or fluid intake caused by catatonia.</P>
        <P FLI="0">What is paramount here is the inalienable right of a person or his or her guardian to decide whether to subject that person to a procedure that is invasive, traumatic and bereft of utterly conclusive research as to its benefits or otherwise.</P>
        <P>Despite my lack of expertise in this area, my instinct in regard to ECT is that given the inconclusive research in terms of its benefits and having read about and listened to the negative experiences of those who have had this treatment administered, I believe we should seriously consider following some of our European neighbours and severely restrict its use or, following in-depth research and discussion at committee level, as suggested by Senator Fitzgerald, consider banning its use completely as has been done in Slovenia.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta John Moloney, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimhe go dt&iacute; an tSeanaid.</P>
        <P>I commend the Green Party on bringing forth this timely Bill.  However, if it thinks that putting this Bill before the House will appease its conscience regarding mental health it is sadly mistaken.  For too long, our mental services have been severely and chronically under-funded and under-staffed by this Government, of which the parties opposite are members.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House has the broad support of my party.  I commend those people outside public office such as John McCarthy in Cork who have been to the fore in making mental health a topic about which we can all speak and which we can all seek to demystify.  In this regard we are speaking about people and not statistics, people who deserve respect, support and to be nurtured and loved by society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Of fundamental importance in this debate is not alone the nature and type of intervention provided to those with significant mental health needs and illnesses which are severely debilitating for them and which prevent them from reaching their potential in the community but the question of what supports and protection are put in place for those deemed by experts to lack capacity in respect of decision-making and, ultimately, in giving consent to a very intensive intervention which carries with it an array of known and documented side-effects.  Like Senator Cannon, I am not an expert on psychiatry.  However, having researched this issue and having consulted widely on it, I believe the role of ECT is, to say the least, dubious.  It is an outdated practice.  I hope we will ban its use forever.  I welcome what the Minister of State had to say in his speech.  We are only beginning this process and it is important we have this debate.</P>
        <P>There are known risks in regard to ECT, be they cognitive impairment, memory loss, medical complications or physical issues, that need to be addressed.  The central issue of concern for me is not whether ECT should be administered but rather the ability of a person to provide informed and valid consent to a procedure that has well documented side-effects.  People are what we are about.  If we are to have a truly person-centred mental health service we must put people with mental health needs, individually and collectively, at the heart of the decision-making process.</P><Col N="500"/>
        <P>I believe the Minister of State is genuine and sincere.  Since I got to know him in this House I believe he is a man of action and absolute sincerity, whatever about some of the people around him.  I hope he can take this issue, along with disability, and make it a central part of his remaining term of office.</P>
        <P>We must identify and implement strategies that are long term as well as current and focused, which place a strong emphasis on supporting and enabling people to make their own decisions.  The Government&rsquo;s document A Vision for Change is long on rhetoric but short on answers.  Under-funding and lack of resources have become by-words and by-products.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Minister of State&rsquo;s field of intellectual disability, I have been very involved in this area, long before I became involved in politics. In the United Kingdom the Mental Capacity Act has a number of key principles which emphasise the centrality of the individual and the person within that process.  I hope that in the debate on mental health we can take the viewpoint that every adult has the right to make his or her own decision.  People must be supported as much as possible to make that decision before anybody concludes they cannot do so.  People have the right to make what others might regard as unwise or eccentric decisions.</P>
        <P>I repeat that we are talking about people.  For too long Government has forgotten about people, being driven by economic indicators and by profits and, in consequence, the HSE and other areas have become restrictive.  We lose the core of people in community.  A Vision for Change was launched with much fanfare.  We were promised that the sale of all institutions would give us huge amounts of money, that we would have a pot of gold and community-based supports.  What has happened?  What is happening?  Every week we get telephone calls from people who are struggling.  They cannot get social workers at the weekend, or access to the psychiatric wards in Cork University Hospital.  Only two weeks ago I was contacted by members of a gentleman&rsquo;s family who were distressed and at their most vulnerable.  The very organ that was there to support them did not admit the person concerned.  What does that message say to us?  We have never had so much money.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald called for an audit by the Mental Health Commission regarding the use of ECT.  I support that.  She is absolutely right.  It is clear that the practice is outdated and must be jettisoned.  I know and respect where the Minister of State is coming from as he approaches this subject.  He is the driver of the engine and must look at the whole picture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Alternative methods must be clear and agreed by all stakeholders, a word I use in the sense of &ldquo;advocates&rdquo;.  Human rights and human dignity are the issues about which we should concern ourselves.  Let us not categorise people or put them into boxes.  In many ways we all struggle in life and every day we do the best we can.  It behoves us, as legislators, and it behoves Government, as the voice of the people, to represent the people whom we support.</P>
        <P>We are not only discussing ECT, depression or psychosis.  I go back to the point with which I started.  We are talking about people &mdash; our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles, people we know.  We must strive for and, as leader on this issue, the Minister of State must create a mental health service that is responsive to people, rather than to models of treatment or care.  We must recognise the centrality of the person with mental health needs.  Unless we have that person&rsquo;s rights and concerns as our first and foremost concern we will have failed.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill and I look forward to future debate, but we need action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney.  From my experience of him in the past seven years, I agree with Senator Buttimer.  He is a man of action and will want to see the same. I am sure he will not be patient.  I offer my best wishes to Deputy <Col N="501"/>Moloney, his wife, Trish, and their children and I hope he may have every success in this position and be happy in doing the very important job the Taoiseach gave him.   </P>
        <P>I express my sincere gratitude to Senators Norris, de B&uacute;rca and Boyle for offering me the opportunity to speak this evening about the mental health involuntary procedures amendment and about the status of mental health services in Ireland.  I listened to the Minister of State&rsquo;s very passionate speech in which he mentioned the personal circumstances of his father and spoke of his commitment to make changes.  I wish to let Senator Cannon know that although I was not here I was listening.  I listen more often when I am not here.  Many people would have heard the speech this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment in question relates to electroconvulsive therapy and how it should not be exercised without informed consent, in writing, from the patient.  Sections 58 and 59 of this Bill might have led to appalling consequences had they not been highlighted by the Green Party.  In A Vision for Change, the Government&rsquo;s expert policy group document of 2006, section 56 (61) provides definitions and guidance on consent, treatment without consent, psychosurgery, electroconvulsive therapy and consent where medication is given for a continuous period of three months.</P>
        <P>Every human being, whether born with a physical disability, a mental disability, depression or whatever, is entitled to have aspirations and dreams like the rest of us and is entitled to have the facility to fulfil those dreams.  If people are over-prescribed with medication or with electroconvulsive therapy or psychosurgery, this cannot happen.  I have seen this occur with two people who were treated with medication.  One is a genius but has never been able to utilise her brilliance because of being over-prescribed.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister of State, I am a very impatient person and I like action.  In his speech he noted that in recent years there have been significant and very welcome developments within mental health services in Ireland, with the launch of A Vision for Change and the report of the expert group on mental health policy in January 2006.</P>
        <P>I am sure that Deputy Moloney is up to date on the matter but I shall read from the annual report of the Mental Health Commission, published in May 2008 which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Great hopes were expressed in 2007 that the recommendations of A Vision for Change, the national Government policy on mental health, would be addressed in 2007.  While acknowledging that A Vision for Change involves a seven to ten year programme of change and development, the Mental Health Commission was disappointed and concerned at the absence of progress in 2007.  The Commission highlighted child and adolescent mental health services as an area requiring special attention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State does not need me to tell him &mdash; I am sure he already knows &mdash; that there are 3,000 children in this country who are waiting to get assessment by a psychiatrist in the public sector.  If one has money one can meet a psychiatrist the next day or whenever but there are 3,000 children out there waiting to be treated, with up to two years waiting time.  Approximately 300 children are being treated in adult psychiatric wards.  The Minister of State knows that, in a week or two, I will have completed my document on suicide prevention, which I have been researching for the past year.  It is shocking, horrific and frightening that there are children in economically deprived families who cannot obtain psychiatric help.  Every person in this State is born with the right to treatment.  The Minister of State knows this and did not receive his brief cold.  For the past six years, he was a very successful Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  He will not have a slow learning curve and is in the middle of the action.  He wants to make changes in the health service.</P><Col N="502"/>
        <P Just="Left">The recommendations are crying out for implementation.  A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, is lying on a shelf and has not been granted funding.  I produced a report on child care, ageing and ageism and noted there were hundreds of reports on shelves in respect of both child care and ageing.  The same applies to the subject of mental health.  We want delivery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Government receives a report, changes should be made automatically.  The Minister of State is as passionate as the rest of us about making these changes and delivering on the recommendations contained in A Vision for Change.  Dr. John Hillery spoke at the conference I organised on suicide prevention in Citywest Hotel in February and asked me to try to convince the authorities to put in place funding to make the recommendations in the document a<?oasys _jy ?>reality.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State the best of luck.  At the end of his stewardship in his current portfolio, he will want to be able to say to himself and all of us that he made actual changes in the area of mental health.  I know he will.</P>

Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dh&eacute;anamh leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &oacute;n Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; Glas as ucht an Bhille seo a thabhairt chun tosaigh agus deis a thabhairt d&uacute;inn &eacute; a phl&eacute;.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go bpl&eacute;ifimid &eacute; ach ina dhiaidh sin go mbeidh muid in ann bogadh ar aghaidh leis na molta&iacute; at&aacute; sa Bhille.  I am glad to support the Bill and commend the Senators on bringing it forward.</P>
        <P>A few years ago Amnesty International produced an excellent report entitled Mental Health: The Neglected Quarter.  Despite the implementation of the Mental Health Act, improvements in care and improving awareness of the reality of mental ill health, the mental health service is still the neglected quarter of the health service as a whole.  The quarter of the population who will, at some time in their lives, experience mental health problems is still being served badly.</P>
        <P>The <i>Irish Medical News</i> reports this week that lands belonging to St. Mary&rsquo;s Psychiatric Hospital in Castlebar, County Mayo, were secretly sold for more than &euro;1.3 million.  So secret was the transaction that the staff believed the land had been given away.  It now emerges that the land was sold and that the HSE never applied to the Department of Finance to be allowed to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in psychiatric services, including necessary capital projects.  Apparently the money has been lying in the bank since the sale in 2005.  This is just one example and I hope the Minister of State will bear it in mind.</P>
        <P>The promised reinvestment in mental health services is not occurring to the extent required.  There needs to be a spending programme to remediate decades of under-funding, followed by ring-fencing of 12% of the health budget for mental health services, as recommended by the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>Resources are essential and so are rights.  This Bill focuses on particular rights of people receiving treatment for mental illness.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes there should be a statutory requirement to ensure full compliance with the international human rights standards set out in the United Nations document, Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care, issued in 1991.  There should be legislation to introduce statutory rights to equality and self-determination for people with mental ill health, to ensure empowerment of people with mental health needs, to guarantee a right to participation in decisions affecting them and to advocacy, where necessary.  There also should be legislation to introduce a statutory right to timely access to appropriate mental health services.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>On the substance of the Bill, I agree with the provision to delete section 58 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which refers to psychosurgery.  This is a highly controversial procedure and is widely regarded as medically unsound and a violation of the rights of patients, yet it is provided for in Irish legislation.  Clearly, more is needed than the simple deletion of section 58 of the 2001 Act, but that is an issue for another day and one in respect of which the Minister for Health and Children should act.</P>
        <P>I support the change to section 59 of the 2001 Act.  This would ban the use of electroconvulsive therapy on patients without their consent.  It is not acceptable that this procedure, also highly controversial, medically questionable and impinging on patents&rsquo; rights, should be imposed on patients without their consent and on the say-so of two psychiatrists.</P>
        <P>We know that very many people have been damaged by the use of these procedures.  They date from a time when people with mental illness were treated like criminals and subjected to incarceration, often in horrific conditions.  Care of people with mental illness has been transformed for the better but these procedures remain.  It is time to deal with this issue and the Bill addresses that need.  I urge the Government side to support this important amending legislation and to support people with mental illness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, for his open response and the commitments he made to addressing some of the issues raised in the Bill.  Many Ministers and Ministers of State come before us but I was very impressed by the extent to which he indicated his willingness to take these issues seriously and make progress in respect of them.  I thank him for this and for setting out his priorities for mental health services.  He mentioned the removal of stigmatisation, modernising the service and action on suicide.  These are three extremely important areas and I will welcome the progress he hopes to make in respect thereof.</P>
        <P>On the question of whether this legislation is just a concern of the Green Party, it is obvious from today&rsquo;s debate that the concern over these issues is shared by all parties.  I welcome some of the proposals made by members of the other parties, particularly those of Senator Fitzgerald on the need for further debate to allow input by interested parties, including advocacy groups and psychiatric services staff.  I welcome the proposal to use the Joint Committee on Health and Children as an important forum to achieve this.  However, it is important that this is not used as an excuse to delay or postpone indefinitely action in this area.  The proposals will be acceptable to the Green Party as long as they are implemented within an agreed timeframe.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal to carry out an audit of the regional variations in the use of electroconvulsive therapy.  In certain parts of the country, one is four or five times more likely to have electroconvulsive therapy administered than in other parts.  As pointed out, we do not have figures on the voluntary and involuntary use of this therapy.  This information needs to be collected quickly and with urgency.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement that amendments are being made to the Mental Health Act and that the Department will be open to accepting amendments pertaining to the issues we raised today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our Bill refers to the involuntary use of electroconvulsive therapy.  Members have stated we do not understand fully how it works and cannot explain why it works or fails to work.  The psychiatric profession cannot predict for whom it will work, nor can it guarantee that its use will not result in harm.  The testimony of many who have undergone the procedure would suggest that harm can be quite extensive.  We therefore need to take steps to put an end to the involuntary use of the procedure.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>While considering involuntary electroconvulsive therapy, will the Minister of State also consider voluntary consent to the procedure?  A person who is very unwell and on very heavy psychoactive medication may not be in an ideal position to give informed consent to the use of the procedure.  I would like this to be examined.</P>

	<P>I will wrap up.  I also mentioned concern about some of the statements in a recent article published in an Irish psychiatric journal, which supported the appropriateness of the use of electroconvulsive therapy on people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, intellectual impairments and so on.  This issue must be considered.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State appeared to accept the proposal pertaining to an advance directive.  This would allow those who suffer from mental health difficulties to indicate in advance, during a period when they are well, whether they would be willing to accept the future use of electroconvulsive therapy.  This may in part be the way forward in respect of the issues raised today.  Certainly, as far as psychosurgery is concerned, most Members recognise it has not been used in the State for approximately 20 years.  I do not believe anyone would suggest it is a necessary or appropriate intervention and prohibiting its use appears to the Green Party and to me to be the only acceptable way forward.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">In conclusion, I thank the Cathaoirleach for the time that was made available today.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention and other Members for their input.  The Green Party is willing to adjourn this Second Stage debate and perhaps to resume it later, on the understanding that all the steps discussed today will be implemented.</P>

    <Title>Broadcasting Bill 2008: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage. </Title>
        <P FLI="0">Debate resumed on amendment No. 99:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">In page 121, line 25, after &ldquo;licence&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="7">&ldquo;and at all times practicable that RT&Eacute; use the maximum power levels as sanctioned by the ITU and licensed by ComReg in the case of an LF broadcast transmitter serving the island of Ireland and or Irish communities abroad&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Right" el="5">&mdash; (Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole)</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, back to the House and I wish to respond to the points he made.  I intend to state, as succinctly as possible, that under section 114 of the Bill, there is a commitment, as far as practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland.  The object of RTE is to establish, maintain and operate a national television and sound broadcasting service, which should be made available &ldquo;in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland&rdquo;.  I stress this point because the Minister of State and his officials are receiving briefings in which they are being told one cannot broadcast outside the jurisdiction.  While that may be the case, I am <Col N="505"/>reading from the Bill under discussion at present.  Members are considering legislation that requires RTE to broadcast to the whole community on the island of Ireland.  I make this point because in addition to Great Britain, I also refer to Northern Ireland and to northern County Donegal, which has great difficulties in this regard.</P>
        <P>I doubly stress that under this legislation, this requirement pertains to the whole community on the island of Ireland.  It does not refer to the State or to this jurisdiction, but to the island of Ireland.  Someone should remind RTE of this when it claims it has no authority.  I do not care what authority one has, because this is the requirement under the legislation.  The broadcasters in Algeria know how to deal with it.</P>
        <P>In addition, according to section 114(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Bill, another object is:</P>
        <P LI="1">to establish, maintain and operate a television broadcasting service and a sound broadcasting service which shall ... be made available, in so far as RT&Eacute; considers reasonably practicable, to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are the requirements and, as the Minister of State is aware, this is a considered position.  It would be reasonably practicable for RTE to increase its output to 500 kW from the Summerhill transmitter, at a cost &euro;100,000 per year.  That would be the cost, if this issue pertains to money.  Perhaps it is about something else.  I feel so strongly about this matter because one should insist that RTE do this.  Obviously, its definition of &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; differs from mine.  Moreover, in so far as I have discussed this with other Members of the Oireachtas, it also differs from what they would consider to be practicable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another issue to which I wish to advert in this respect is that RTE continues to state it has not reduced its broadcasting output from the Summerhill mast.  It is true that it has not reduced its output since it took back the mast from Radio Tara.  However, Radio Tara was broadcasting at twice the output.  RTE has indicated clearly and proven that the twin 250 kW broadcasting transmitter being used by Radio Tara was not of the best quality.  I agree with it in this respect.  However, I disagree with its decision to replace it with a 250 kW transmitter.  I disagree with its position that, because it would cost &euro;100,000 per year to extend its present range, it is not prepared to do so.  Moreover, while I stand to be corrected and will consider the evidence, I disagree with RTE when it states that increasing the output would not increase significantly the coverage or the reach of the long wave transmitter.  I believe this to be untrue because I am familiar with what was available previously.</P>
        <P>As an aside, since this debate was adjourned at 5 p.m., my office has received three calls from different emigrant groups, two in the United Kingdom and another in Ireland, who were listening to the debate on the webcast and who rang to thank me for my comments on their behalf.  I do not know who these people are.  I simply make the point that it is interesting because RTE is trying to state that on a number of occasions when the service was unavailable and was not being broadcast, no one noticed the difference.  Can one imagine that people are listening to this debate?  I certainly did not alert them to it and have never spoken to those groups previously.  I am aware that GAA groups have a keen interest in this subject.</P>
        <P>This constitutes real politics.  Those who live in the dosshouses of north London or who lack a pension in other parts of the United Kingdom do not carry great political clout.  The people who wish to listen to &ldquo;C&eacute;il&iacute; House&rdquo; or to Donncha O&rsquo;Dulaing on a Saturday night are not the most important people in the world.  Moreover, the GAA community in Britain, who no longer can vote in Ireland, can be disregarded easily.  Thankfully, Irish politicians have never taken that line.  Across all parties, they have been prepared to speak for and defend such people.  It <Col N="506"/>is in this regard that an issue of great significance has arisen.  It also is tied into the legislation and RTE&rsquo;s requirements to broadcast beyond the island of Ireland and throughout the entire island of Ireland.  Clearly, neither point of view has permeated into the deeper recesses of RTE, which continues to raise the issue of jurisdiction.  However, this legislation does not refer to jurisdiction.  It refers to the island of Ireland and to the Irish community living outside the island of Ireland.  Therefore, there are requirements and responsibilities that go with that.  They will not go away lightly and Members will insist that they be noted and acted on.</P>
        <P>In this regard, while I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s good offices on the matter and he should not take this personally, I disagree with his point that such issues should not be included in legislation.  This is the only way one can at least interpret what would be reasonably practicable.  Obviously, my view differs from that which obtains in RTE.  Therefore, I must insist that Members take this as far as possible.  I have put on record issues in this regard and the Minister of State has stated he would investigate them further.  He should ask his officials to get to the bottom of this information in order that Members are in possession of all the relevant information and have a basis on which to make a decision.  At present, the only decision I want is to have a transmitter broadcasting at 500 kW from Summerhill on the long wave.  I want that running at 500kW for 24 hours a day.  I want us then to negotiate an increase in the 500kW allowed under the 1975 agreement, from which we get our licence to do this.</P>
        <P>The terms of the Good Friday Agreement provide for shadow legislation in both jurisdictions, so it would be useful to enter into an agreement with the BBC to have a single broadcasting unit across the two islands.  People from both islands could receive all output from both stations.  That would certainly be in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Se&aacute;n Power)</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his contribution, but I must point out that there is no single transmission system that can meet the needs of all Irish listeners in Britain.  There are always constraints that apply to cross-Border and free-to-air terrestrial broadcasting.  These limits may arise from technical considerations as well as from international regulatory agreements that we have signed.  That is why it is necessary to look to other forms of distribution, such as satellite and the Internet, in which RTE has developed significant services in recent years.  Freesat will mark another stage of progress in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some of the documentation referred to earlier in the debate raises a number of questions, but I am not in a position to clarify them yet.  However, I will endeavour to do so as soon as possible and I will get back to the Senator on them.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

        <P>We should have a long discussion on TV licences, although not now &mdash; Members can relax &mdash; because I do not know how this is done.  I would like to know from the Minister how much we are paying for all the very entertaining advertisements about people calling to the door to check if people have a TV licence and to frighten the rest of us.  Who checks if the chaps in Portlaoise Prison with the plasma screens in their cells have a licence?</P>

	<P>Can people go into the prison and check the position in that regard?  People with no money are ending up in prison because they cannot afford to pay for the licence.  I wonder if the inmates in prison with plasma screens have licences.  That is a fair question and I would like to know the answer to it because the situation is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>Other countries have more sensible ways of collecting TV licence fees.  There is an audiovisual tax in parts of France and other initiatives in other countries.  Spending millions of euro every year in advertising and thousands of euro to keep people in prison for not paying their TV licences and then employing huge numbers of people to check and collect makes no sense.  Payment should be made directly either through an additional tax which people can opt out of or a million other ways.  It is unethical, immoral, uncivilised and unacceptable that people can end up in prison for not having a TV licence.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if we are still required to have a radio licence or if that went some time in the past like the need for a dog licence.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister will make me aware of that.  This system is a nonsense.  The Minister should accept this amendment.  It makes no difference to him.  There are better ways of dealing with the matter.  In the other House this morning the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that approximately a dozen people were in prison for not paying fines.  I do not know how many of those fines referred to TV licences but that kind of situation recurs time and again for people who owe money.  It is unacceptable.  We should move on, take ourselves out of the dark ages and be a bit more civilised, modern and responsible.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is probably barking up the wrong tree because the dog licence is still in being.  I fully support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on this issue.  Sending somebody to prison for non-payment of a television licence is ludicrous.  If somebody was sentenced to just one day in prison I suggest it would cost a great deal more to keep that person in prison than the cost of a television licence.  It is ludicrous.</P>
        <P>On the question of advertising, it is probably costing more in advertising than the revenue we are getting in from television licences because the advertisements appears to be on every few minutes on radio and television.  We must have a more humane system in place because sending people to prison for not paying their television licence belongs to a darker era.  We should consider an attachment of earnings, as suggested in the amendment.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment.  It is nonsensical to have votes on amendments as sensible as the one before the House this evening.  I ask the Minister of State to respond accordingly.</P>

        <P>It is remarkable that it could be possible for somebody to be sent to prison for non-possession of a TV licence.  I do not fully hold with what I believe Senator O&rsquo;Toole is saying in so far as he is critiquing the system around which the licence is required and pursued.  I am coming at this from a point of view of best practice in our criminal justice system.  It is clear that we need alternatives to custodial sentences for non-violent offenders across the board.  We hear much about the way in which our prison system has become a school for criminals, particularly at a time when younger offenders are incarcerated in the same place as older offenders.  We have had debates about that and will have further debates about that issue.</P>
        <P>We must take a more enlightened approach to our criminal justice policy and what Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole have done indirectly is to shine a light on one aspect of that.  Do we really want people who did not have a television licence, some of whom may be younger people, to be exposed to the prison system and the brutality and potential corruption that involves, in so far as many people who go to prison are exposed to it, and come out in some cases in a worse position that when they went in?</P>
        <P>It is time we engaged in fresh thinking about our criminal justice system and alternatives to custodial sentences for non-violent offences, particularly on something as relatively trivial as non-possession of a TV licence.  It is farcical that it could be possible to be sent to prison for that in this day and age.  On that basis I urge the Minister, as Senators Cummins and O&rsquo;Toole have done, to consider accepting this amendment in the light of the common sense that it involves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We had a good debate on this issue on Committee Stage.  I fully subscribe to the spirit of the amendment but it is essential that there are deterrents for people who do not pay their bills.  Many people choose to spend their money on other less necessary expenditure rather than commitments they have to the State.  It is important deterrents are in place.  The Minister gave a good and fair response on the last occasion in that it is an issue that has a broader remit than just TV licences and that it is under review in respect of the Fines Bill.  I would have thought that is a more logical place for the issue to be dealt with but I would support the spirit of the amendment because putting people in prison for non-payment of relatively small amounts of money is, even from an economic point of view, foolhardy.  Presuming the Minister will respond in similar fashion to his response on the previous day, what he is suggesting is eminently sensible and on that basis we should support it.  I look forward to the expeditious preparation of the Fines Bill to allow the matter be dealt with in that legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Walsh.  The idea of sending somebody to prison for non-payment of a television licence is foolhardy.  If we as legislators were to bring in legislation that could allow that to happen we would be fools.  What Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris propose in their amendment is sensible because nobody in this Chamber, including the Minister of State, wants to see people being sent to prison for non-payment of TV licences.</P>
        <P>In his opening remarks Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the comments made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on RTE radio about the number of people in prison currently for non-payment of fines.  He referred to seven as being seven too many.  Why are we introducing legislation today that allows for people to be imprisoned for non-payment of fines or for not having a television licence?  If the Bill is passed &mdash; I presume it will be voted on &mdash; it will be fools who will support it and will include it in the legislation.</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify that we discussed this matter in some detail last week.  We are not introducing legislation to put people in prison.  It is a rather complex matter and people may belittle it if they have a mind to.  </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If one conducted an opinion poll among the Irish people, I believe most of them would not be in favour of imprisoning people for non-payment of a television licence.  Approximately 1.5% of the prison population at any one time are in prison for failing to adhere to a court decision.  This is usually a last resort and is not to be encouraged.  If we are all in agreement that one must have a licence, it follows then that there must be some incentive for people to purchase a licence.  There must be some punishment for those who refuse to purchase one.  It is accepted that the provision will present a certain difficulty for some people but the Bill introduces a system to make it easier for people to pay for a licence.  In cases where a person does not possess a licence, we are giving them plenty of time to make amends.</P>
        <P>The amendment as tabled is really a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This matter can be more adequately dealt with within the Fines Bill which will come before the House in the near future.  We have discussed this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and we are happy that the matter will be dealt with adequately within that Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the House to section 142(1) of the Bill which states:  </P>
        <P LI="1">(1) Subject to the exceptions mentioned below, a person shall not keep or have in his or her possession anywhere in the territory of the State a television set save in so far as such keeping or possession is authorised by a television licence for the time being in force.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will repeat my question.  Have the inmates of Portlaoise Prison a licence for each of their plasma screens?  I note the televisions were returned to them recently by the authorities.  Do they have licences for those sets?  It is a reasonable question and I want to know whether they are being treated in some exceptional manner that does not apply to ordinary people.  I think I am entitled to an answer to that question and then we can move on from there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>

I wish to compliment the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power.  The Minister of State took Committee Stage and was extremely accommodating in taking on board amendments that he felt would improve the Bill.  The House should thank him for that.

	<P>I concur with Senator Walsh in thanking the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, who took on board many of the Opposition&rsquo;s suggestions.  A number of Government amendments took into account the gist of what the Opposition was trying to do in some areas.  Obviously there are a couple of areas with which Fine Gael is not very happy, but there will be a chance for those discussions in another place.  It has been a long day.  I watched the debate on Committee Stage which took three days, and today&rsquo;s Report Stage lasted several hours.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials who have been here all day also.</P>

The huge attendance at their public meeting on Monday night last, 16 June, speaks volumes about the mood across Inishowen on this issue.  The parents, with the full support of the schools across the peninsula, want the right to appeal controversial decisions by the special educational needs organiser to remove or deny the allocation of special needs assistants to their children.  It is remarkable that one person can be given the power to overrule a multidisciplinary team of professionals and deny the support to special educational needs children that their parents and schools seek.  What is even more remarkable is that this person is not accountable to anyone affected by the decision.</P>
        <P>Of course, the impact of these controversial decisions is much wider than children with special educational needs.  Teachers already trying to cope with overcrowded classrooms in many instances are left in an impossible situation of giving the specialised support to children with special educational needs while ensuring the provision of education to the remaining children in the class is not diminished.</P>
        <P>For example, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; school in Carndonagh, the review of special educational needs was conducted by a particular SENO on 16 June 2008.  The review decision confirmed reduced access to special needs assistants for all pupils and the reduction in special needs personnel from five to three, and possibly further to two for the year 2008-09.  At another school, Carndonagh Community School, special needs personnel have been further reduced for the year 2008-09 from six to three.  That involves five to six job losses in the Carndonagh area alone, in addition to the removal of much needed care support from the pupils, teachers and families.  The decision taken following the SENO&rsquo;s one-day visit and observation have caused much grief, exasperation, pain and tears for a school which has worked long and hard at securing and ensuring equitable treatment and access to education for all of its pupils.</P>
        <P>The facts are that yet again, just as with the HSE, we are seeing decision-making and accountability being outsourced by Government.  Rather than parents dealing with a Minister directly accountable to the people on this issue, we must deal with a non-Government body, the National Council for Special Education.  This allows Government representatives to hide behind the body&rsquo;s decisions and failures.  It is not good enough in a supposedly democratic society.</P><Col N="517"/>
        <P>On behalf of the 350 people who turned out in Inisowen, I plead with the Minister to immediately implement in its entirety the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, to ensure the right of these families and schools to appeal controversial decisions taken by SENOs.</P>

	<P>I apologise to the House and to Senator Doherty for my late arrival.  I was at another meeting.  I thank Senator Doherty for placing this matter on the Adjournment.  It gives me the opportunity to clarify to this House the position on reviewing decisions made by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in the context of resource allocation.</P>
        <P>As the Senator may be aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs, and also help to establish special classes where a need has been determined.  The NCSE operates using criteria determined by the Department of Education and Science in allocating such support.  Since the establishment of the NCSE I want to put on the record of this House that it has enabled significant improvements to be made in the delivery of service to pupils with special educational needs, their schools and parents.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will undertake to review any decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parent or guardian, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been seen or to hand at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.</P>
        <P>All schools have contact details of their local SENO.  It is also open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on the website, <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to thank the Senator again for raising the issue and I thank the House for listening to the response.</P>

	<P>Does Senator Doherty have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if the Minister of State is familiar with the situation that pertains in Inisowen but I want to repeat what I stated in my earlier comments.</P>
        <P>All of us involved in politics know that it is hard to engage the public appetite for whatever the cause, but when 350 people turn out to a meeting in a peninsula there is clearly a problem.  We are dealing with a small issue in a number of schools but it has had a wide ripple effect.  The system that exists at present is not able to deal with the issue satisfactorily in the view of the parents and the teachers.</P>
        <P>As I stated earlier, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act would allow a further method of appeal and, if implemented in full, would get away from this idea where we would reach this stage in the first place.  Many SENOs throughout the State are doing an excellent job.  Unfortunately, there is an issue in this regard in Inisowen and I would ask the Minister of State to take that on board.</P>
        <P>While it is not a question, I ask the Minister of State to also listen to the comments that I have made on this matter.  I am supported in this from across the political divide, from Government representatives to ourselves in Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael and others.  It is an issue at the heart of education, particularly for children with special educational needs.  I ask the Minister of State to take that on board and to look at the problem to see if there is anything that can be done at Government level.</P>

	<P>I fully appreciate what can happen at public meetings and the desire of members of the public to have their case heard.  Senator Doherty has dealt with that in terms of the adequate way in which he has put forward that case here this evening using the Seanad and this Adjournment debate.  The Senator need be in no doubt that I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister concerned.</P>
        <P>Again, I refer him to what is contained in the reply in terms of the appeal that can be processed by guardians, parents, teachers and so on.  That appeal mechanism should be used and I encourage the Senator to do so.  However, I acknowledge the facts of the case the Senator presented and assure him I will bring them to the attention of the Minister concerned.  I thank him for raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <adjournment>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 June 2008.</adjournment>
