	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the reason he has issued a directive to Mayo County Council to amend its county development plan and if he is aware of the dissatisfaction of members of Mayo County Council to his directive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to assist local authorities such as Cork County Council and Mallow Town Council in responding to the problems caused by excessive lead in public water supplies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Transport to support the re-introduction of the Cork-Swansea ferry for the 2009 season in view of the huge financial loss its absence has to the Cork-Kerry region.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to prioritise the extension and refurbishment of St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school, Palmerstown, Dublin 20 in light of the very poor existing conditions for students and staff and the lengthy amount of time which the school has waited for such refurbishment and to provide details of when he expects such work to commence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to clarify when it is planned to commence the implementation of the national broadband scheme and the length of time it will take to have the service made available to areas of the country that do not currently have broadband provision including parts of County Donegal.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to publish the report of the Cork Docklands Forum on the Cork Docklands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expand educational development to increase the numbers of non-denominational schools in Ireland, thus avoiding the reinforcing of sectarian divides by separating children according to denominations during their core school hours.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Sullivan, Bradford and O&rsquo;Donovan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   The remaining Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re time limit for the Order of Business; No. 2, motion concerning US agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance, the approval of the adoption by Ireland of an EU Council decision establishing the Europol Police Office, EUROPOL, and the proposal for a framework decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences; and No. 3, statements on the economy.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that No. 1 will be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business, No. 2 will be referred to the relevant committee, without debate, at the conclusion of No. 1, and No. 3 will be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, to conclude not later than 7 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes prior to the conclusion of the debate to make final comments and take questions from spokespersons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  In light of the dramatic events unfolding in the financial world, we should engage in a question and answer session with the Minister who will be present in the House to take the debate on the economy.  Many Members will want to pose questions in respect of current events and I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to ensure the House will not merely take statements but <Col N="3"/>that there will be adequate question and answer session of one hour.  I await the Leader&rsquo;s response on the matter.</P>
        <P>We meet in extraordinary times.  Today is a day on which the Government and the taxpayer have become exposed to financial risk like never before, probably to the tune of &euro;250,000 per person in the country.  It is an extraordinary sum.</P>
        <P>There are 235,000 unemployed people in the country.  Some 46,000 people joined the unemployment list since Deputy Brian Cowen became Taoiseach.  Some 235,000 people are worrying about how they will pay their rent or mortgages and from where their next job will come.  Tax revenues have fallen by &euro;7 billion.  The country is in recession for the first time in 25 years and the economy has shrunk this year.  It is a very difficult economic situation.  There has been much denial in this House over a number of months but today reality is dawning on people.</P>
        <P>We have heard much about bailing out the banks and about what is happening.  It is a far cry from when the banks appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier this year and told us all was well.  Today is a far cry from the presentations given that day in July, which was only a few months ago.</P>
        <P>We have not heard much about what the impact will be on the taxpayer.  Legitimate questions are being posed by people about today&rsquo;s decision to which we need answers.  Many people will welcome the decision as a sign that some necessary action is being taken.  However, the 400 parents I met last night in Palmerstown whose children&rsquo;s school was left off yesterday&rsquo;s list wonder what will happen to the schools building programme and about the lack of transparency in regard to the list.  That is on their minds as well as the bigger questions such as the risk to the taxpayer.  What sort of bad debts are we guaranteeing, to some degree?  What impact will it have on the State&rsquo;s finances?  Crucially, how can we have confidence that the banks will not engage in reckless borrowing once again and put taxpayers at further risk?  These are the types of questions about which people are very concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People are very concerned about regulation.  What happened in regard to regulation?  Why did it fail?  What type of regulation will we have from here on in?  We need to hear about that from the Minister for Finance.  We need to see more joined up thinking from Departments on the broader economic issues.</P>
        <P>I will refer to three areas from which uncertain messages have been coming from Government.  The first area is third level fees, the second is the fact the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could not decide whether there needed to be an investigation into F&Aacute;S and eventually decided there is such a need and, finally, in a matter of life and death, the Minister for Health and Children failed to grapple with the tragedy which seems to have beset breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.</P>
        <P>In this era of the Celtic tiger, we have heard of the needless deaths of women who have not received proper diagnoses in our health service.  It is an extraordinary legacy.  As far as the health service is concerned, what were the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, doing during their tenure in the Department of Health and Children which allowed us to reach this point?  Where were the reforms during that era of huge economic wealth in this country?   We need leadership and joined up thinking.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has a series of questions to answer and we need to hear those answers.  I would like to start today with a question and answer session in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be worthwhile if the House noted and welcomed the new initiative from the library and research service of the House, namely, a digest of each new Bill.  One of the reasons this House wanted such a service was that it would get an unbiased, unprejudiced and neutral view on the legislation and would not have to depend on the explanatory <Col N="4"/>memorandum issued by the sponsoring Department.  It is a very important initiative and should be used by the House. </P>
        <P>After all the populist comment in recent weeks, it is interesting that the people who have been lecturing us for years about having too big a Government, Government interference and a nanny state have been proven to be people not to be trusted.  The House may not be aware of who David Doyle is, but he is Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  He and his officials and officials involved from other Departments deserve our congratulations for coming up with a proposal that is unique, creative and deals with an issue we must address.  We need all the detail on this and for that reason I support and second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposal that we have a question and answer session on it.  This is not something that should just develop into an argument over and back across the floor of this House.  We need information.  When the bankers were in the counting houses and those in the private sector sat on their hands, we saw how useless they were at dealing with a problem outside of that realm.  For that reason, we should always recognise the importance of the public sector.</P>
        <P>I do not welcome this development out of support for bankers.  As far as I am concerned, they should take much of the responsibility for the difficulty in which we find ourselves.  They are the people who invented sub-prime lending, handed out 110% loans way above the value of property, increased limits on credit cards without being asked and who urged youngsters to change their mortgage accounts into current accounts and use them to go on holidays, buy cars, extend their houses or whatever.  They deserve to pay the price now.  I do not welcome this initiative as in any sense a threat to the taxpayer nor as being a support for bankers.  The bankers are now on their knees screaming and we should do unto them as they did unto us over the years.</P>
        <P>I want to hear from Government today how it will make the banks pay for this.  We should get a full list of how it will charge them.  I want to hear there will be a surcharge and levy on bank profits and what the charge will be for insurance cover.  I want to hear there will be no more million euro salaries and that directors&rsquo; bonuses and perks will be taken off the agenda.  I want to hear that the State has seats on the boards of all the institutions mentioned today.  That is the starting position.  We need to move through that list, but more than anything, we need oversight on how these people do their business.</P>
        <P>For the past year we have been looking at what banks have been doing, but we still do not know the element of exposure or their liabilities.  We still do not know the total outline of their risks.  We need to have people in that area to present these facts to us.  In the meantime, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s unique initiative.  Global economies and finance houses are watching in amazement, wondering how it will work.  I do not know if it will work, but I welcome it as a positive move.  I look forward to debating the issue.  It is crucial for every Member of the House to support the view that there should be a question and answer session on the Government&rsquo;s proposals which, I presume, will appear shortly in legislative form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a question and answer session with the relevant Minister on the proposal or decision brought forward by the Government.  With regard to the bail-out as described, it is not entirely clear whether we have a decision or a proposal.  We were told this morning the justification for the decision is to avert a catastrophe, and the word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; was used liberally.  It is a big word, especially when until recently we were told Irish banks did not have liquidity problems and there were no fundamental difficulties with their position.  However, the word &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; has now been used.</P>
        <P>Politicians on all sides have a responsibility to hold back and wait to hear the rationale for the proposal being brought forward and to debate it carefully.  However, the public is entitled <Col N="5"/>to have spelled out to it what momentous catastrophe would happen if this decision were not made.  We are entitled to be told that and not to have to guess at it.  We should be told precisely what would be likely to happen and the consequences of this decision not being made.  What are those consequences?  I do not refer to general issues and suggestions that we should look to what is happening in the United States or that if we do not act the sky may fall in.  I want more detail because the Irish people are entitled to be told the precise nature of the so-called catastrophe &mdash; that is not my word &mdash; which we are seeking to avert.  We can then compare the action that is proposed with the consequences of not taking it.  I support what has been said by others in regard to the level of scrutiny that is needed of the banks and financial institutions if this proposal is to be adopted.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald noted that we are a far cry from the point some months ago when the banks appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  This is the most momentous economic decision that has been taken in a considerable period of time.  Surely an argument can at least be made for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee.  Sometimes we are criticised for having too many committees, but if there was ever a need for an Oireachtas committee dedicated to a central economic question, surely it is now.  There is a compelling argument for a committee to deal with banks and the banking system so that Members of the Oireachtas can be afforded opportunities on a regular basis to scrutinise the banks, understand precisely what is occurring and raise questions about the history of loose and reckless lending and the issue of executive salaries which Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly raised.  Such a committee would also provide a forum through which people can ensure that banks and financial institutions pay for this extraordinary bail-out and what I heard the Minister for Finance describe as &ldquo;succour&rdquo;.  I sat in my car and reached for the Kleenex tissues at one point while listening to the Minister.  I know it is important not to make light of this issue but he claimed that the measures had to be taken in regard to these six Irish banks because they had nowhere else to go for succour.  I had a different kind of &ldquo;succour&rdquo; in mind when I heard that phrase from the Minister and it is the Irish taxpayer who is potentially being turned into a sucker in this.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a proper question and answer session.  It is good that we have scheduled a debate on the economy for today&rsquo;s Order of Business but events have changed dramatically overnight.  In regard to the Order of Business and the role of this House, is this a decision by the Executive or should it be made by the Oireachtas?  I have heard mention of legislation being introduced this afternoon, certainly in the other House and perhaps in the Seanad.  It manifestly appears to be a matter which should be decided by the Oireachtas and not simply a matter of Executive order, so I ask for confirmation from the Leader on what is proposed in that regard.  I strongly support the proposal made by Senator Fitzgerald on a realistic and meaningful opportunity for questions this afternoon, rather than the five minutes squeezed in at the end of statements with which we sometimes have to contend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to concentrate on other issues given the turbulence in the international financial markets and the impact this is having on financial institutions, taxpayers and consumers in Ireland.  I welcome the action of the Minister for Finance on protecting Irish banks because the interests of Irish taxpayers and consumers will as a result be protected in the longer term.  However, the financial sector cannot continue with business as usual and we have to be realistic and accept that the financial markets are no longer subject to the control of any individual government.  We have international financial markets and the current events in the US are having a direct effect on the markets in this country.</P>
        <P>I concur with the call from my European Green Party colleagues in the European Parliament for an EU-wide supervisory authority for financial markets.  They also called for a system of <Col N="6"/>regulation and authorisation of management companies and fund managers.  This is important because the essence of the problem with the financial system appears to be that self-regulation has been the <i>modus operandi</i> to date.  Governments have allowed the situation to arise whereby many of the instruments traded on these markets are not fully understood by the bodies which are supposed to be regulating them.</P>
        <P>My colleagues in the European Parliament have called for debt limits to be placed on hedge funds.  Arising from our recent experiences, that would seem to be a positive move.  I call for us to summon the political will not just to address this issue and debate how to respond to it at a domestic level, but also to use our influence within the European Union to call for and be party to the establishment of an EU-wide regulatory authority that will ensure that problems such as those we are now facing will not occur again in the international financial system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are certainly living in times that none of us would wish for.  Everybody accepts we must safeguard the banking system and everybody is agreed that the limit for deposit protection needed to be raised, as Deputy Richard Bruton pointed out a considerable time ago.  However, we are now talking about a guarantee involving lending by banks.  I support, as have other speakers, the call of Senator Fitzgerald for a proper question and answer session involving the Minister.  Providing unconditional guarantees for senior and subordinated debt is a serious matter.  Does this not equate to supporting all the past poor lending decisions of the banks involved?  That is why we must know the details of the deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must know what protection is available for the taxpayer.  In addition, what sort of provisions are in place for scrutiny involving both the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank?  This is very important.  We also need to know what is being done collectively to strengthen the banking system, perhaps by way of encouraging necessary mergers.  I hope the Leader will be able to provide a positive reply to the request for an immediate question and answer session.  No one can call the markets and we really do not know where we are.  We need more immediate information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his decisive action over the last day.  It is timely and much needed and shows the kind of leadership to which not only this country but also our European counterparts can look with confidence.  I believe it will become the benchmark for small, open-market economies such as ours.  If other countries follow suit, we will begin to establish the floor for which this international crisis needs.  I look forward this afternoon to the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues regarding the economy but, like many colleagues, I believe we should have an exclusive debate on the banking system and its future regulation.  I ask that the Leader focus at his earliest convenience on allotting time to such a debate, perhaps a whole day if necessary.  I understand a banking Bill will come before the D&aacute;il, perhaps later today, and this may be with us in the next couple of days, at which time we will have a further opportunity for discussion.</P>
        <P>We will tease out all these issues further during this afternoon, but I wish to make one final point.  Our banking system is inextricably linked to our economy and to our society.  I pay tribute particularly to the officials who got no sleep last night as they prepared these measures, and to the Minister.  These measures will be introduced in the best interests of our economy and our people, not in the interests of the banks.  It is as simple as that.  I look forward to debating this further throughout the afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As all my colleagues have done, I wish to talk about the economy, particularly the momentous decision that was taken today.  We are all relieved to see some decision being made on the current appalling state of the financial system.  For too long there was a sense that no decisive action was being taken and that things were simply being let slip.  While the Oireachtas was not sitting, it was particularly worrying to see that nothing was being done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a relief that something has been done.  However, I echo the concerns of others on this side of the House with regard to the lack of any apparent <i>quid pro quo</i> for the taxpayer in this bailout.  We need to know the guarantees the State, the public and the taxpayer have regarding the enormous potential risk we are taking on.</P>
        <P>It seems that for too long we have privatised profit and now we are nationalising debt.  Where is the gain for the taxpayer?  Where is the return that may come about?  I would be very interested to hear what there will be in it for the taxpayer.  For too long we have seen what has been called &ldquo;casino capitalism&rdquo; run wild and we are now seeing the terrible consequences.  As others have said those terrible consequences may not have been fully spelt out and it is still rather unclear.  That may be why the US Congress did not pass the bailout Bill despite being urged to do so by their leaders.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In this context I raise before the House a relevant survey released yesterday by TASC, a think tank for action on social change, of which I am a board member.  The survey pointed out the serious inequality in wealth distribution in this country after years of boom.  As we debate this big rescue package it is important that we remember there is still enormous poverty here despite the Celtic tiger.  The TASC survey found that the top 1% of the population owns 20% of the nation&rsquo;s wealth and we rank first among the previous EU 15 countries in terms of earnings inequality.  TASC has shown that people are willing to have a fairer and more equitable tax system, which is what we should debate in the present economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I also commend the Minister on his speedy and necessary response.  I am reminded that this is not the first time governments have bailed out banks with debts that were regarded as toxic.  During President Reagan&rsquo;s era there was a serious problem with the Savings and Loans in the United States.  The matter turned around for the US Government when it took over the loan book and it eventually made a profit on it.  It is also not the first time that a bank has been assisted in this country.  In the Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacle AIB was assisted.</P>
        <P>We will need to take this action and do so quickly &mdash; I have already commended the Minister on doing so.  Further action will be taken.  In the past action was taken quickly to help a bank that was in trouble and subsequent events showed that not only did the Government do well out of helping the bank but that the bank levy gave significant sums.  I am suggesting that the day of the storm is not the day to fix the thatch.  We will get around to regulating the banks and getting our security and more returned.  While today may not necessarily be the day to deal with that specific item, it will be done and I have no doubt that the confidence the Minister has instilled into the economy, which is almost unique in Europe today, may result in a net inflow of funds into the country which will place us in a better position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On an unrelated item, I commend the Standards in Public Office Commission on inquiring as to the source of funding for Libertas.  The McKenna judgment has resulted in absolute equality in time on television and radio, and in column inches in the newspapers, which we all accept.  I have previously suggested that there might have been other funds coming through to <Col N="8"/>Libertas.  It appears that a loan was given that might have been outside the guidelines of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I would particularly like to know if there was outside intervention.  Did some of the far right UK parties &mdash; I include the UK Independence Party &mdash; subscribe?  It is a simple question.  We play on a level playing field.  I have suggested before there was American military intervention.  I do not for a moment suggest it was the American Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This may not be the forum to check that body&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept it is not the American Government or the American army.  However, the military machination in America is privatised and there are many far right groups there.  I would like to know whether they subscribed to Libertas.  It is a simple question that needs to be answered to ensure we all have a level playing field.  I do not for a moment suggest it was the American Government or army.  However, it could be that some right-wing groups in the United States have subscribed.  It is a simple question: have they subscribed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the school building projects the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is including for this year.  As representatives for Westmeath, Senator Cassidy and I, along with our other colleagues, met the Minister in regard to a number of schools, for example, the dance school for Kinnegad and Athlone community college.  There is no mention of these schools, as is the case with a number of schools around the country.  How does the Minister select schools?  Before the last election, there were several announcements made about school buildings being progressed and started in the following few weeks, but sadly nothing happened.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that the Minister had taken on a new brief and had to review a number of the existing projects.  Speaking of &ldquo;succour&rdquo;, what will happen to the schools that need buildings for 2009?  I ask the Leader to invite him to the House for a debate on school building projects, transparency, and how schools are delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to consider allowing time on an ongoing basis to discuss the economy.  As we are all aware, the global financial crisis appears to be changing on an hourly basis.  While a fair amount of time has been laid aside for a debate today, that is not sufficient.  I do not know whether it should take the form of a question and answer session, as has been suggested, but I genuinely believe it should be done on a regular basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt the banks will eventually have to answer questions.  It is not necessary that this should be part of what we are trying to achieve at the present time.  The Government certainly moved very rapidly last night and, in the early hours of the morning, did something which, to many, would seem extraordinary and very courageous.  We also know that if it had not taken those steps we would not have the improved situation in the markets today. That the Anglo Irish Bank alone dropped 40% in its share price yesterday and recovered 40% again today is an indication that the right steps were taken.  Regarding what happened in America, we were all kept on tenter hooks as to whether the administration&rsquo;s finance rescue Bill would pass.  One clear message from the Democrats and the Republicans, so far as I can see, is that at the end of the day the decision not to back the Bill was based more on politics than on any legislative consideration.  I have been encouraged by the united approach that has come about as a result of the Government&rsquo;s decision last night.  I detect the same tone in the House today.  I believe that is exactly what is required at this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before the recess I spoke in much the same way when we did not know the extent of the situation.  The only hope we have at present is to determine whether we can promote a united <Col N="9"/>approach because what we are talking about is jobs, the concerns of small investors, people with deposit accounts and so on.  When we break down the bigger picture we are still talking about the taxpayer and the individual on the ground.  If we are not talking about those, who do we represent?  I genuinely believe we are trying to legislate for the concerns on the ground and hopefully we will be able to come through this problem.  Incidentally, I think we have done better than some of those who would regard themselves as the great powers.  America has not done itself any credit by the manner in which it has procrastinated because it impacts on countries throughout the world who are not as well placed as itself.  We should not tie ourselves too closely to its coat tails.  Last night we proved that we were capable of making an independent sovereign decision.  That is the leadership we need now and such a feeling can be sensed in the House today.</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald called for questions and answers rather than the proposed statements followed by questions and I support that.  Today is an important day with regard to the financial crisis.  None of us in this country can remember a similar one.</P>
        <P>I wish to correct Senator Fitzgerald on one point.  She said that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, had made a decision.  I do not believe the Minister makes the decision, rather that he makes a proposal.  I have not had this confirmed but I imagine the proposal must come before both Houses.</P>

	<P>Let us look at what happened in the United States where it was not just matter of a decision made by the Secretary of the Treasury.  The Secretary had to go before Congress where, regrettably, the representatives turned down the proposal.  Will the Leader tell the House what will happen in this regard?  Is legislation needed as I assume it to be?  If so, will the legislation come to the house and will that happen today?  Perhaps the Leader can answer that as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made a point about the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I am one of the Members of this House who is on that committee.  It is only two months since we invited those six banks to report to the committee.  Five were represented and questioned on exactly the topic under discussion today.  The Committee on Finance and the Public Service exists and had already taken those steps two months ago.  I welcome the chance to ensure the committee continues to do this.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; talked about what happened yesterday.  I agree with the words he used.  I believe we must speak immediately on this matter and we should not spend time on other areas at this stage although the rest of our work must continue.  Let us ensure we ask questions and get answers.  I hope the debate today on the economy will be a questions and answers session rather than the other format.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to one other financial point.  I got some change the other day when I was in France.  This was not a &euro;5 note but a &euro;5 coin.  I had not seen this before and wonder if we are to have such a coin here.  It seems to me that we should move in that direction.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said that the share price of one bank dropped 40% yesterday and wished to see it raised again by the same amount.  However, 40% of a lower figure does not bring it back to where it was before.</P>

	<P>My arithmetic tells me that would be about 84% of where it had been.  This is just a reminder that when we drop 40% we must rise by a much higher percentage to get back to where we were.</P>
        <P>I have a Bill before the House tomorrow and I hope it will get a good debate.  The idea is to open the question of consent for organ donations.  I have a session at 4.15 p.m. today and welcome those Members of the House who are free to come to the audio-visual room to learn a little more about this topic.  It deserves much more attention than it has received in the past.</P>

	<P>I know it is difficult at this time to concentrate on any issue other than the economy.  I agree with many of the points raised by colleagues.  I compliment the Leader and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on making a decision so quickly to protect the banking system and the taxpayer.  This is a very serious time for discussion by all of us and we must think seriously about the situation.  I welcome any debate that takes place so that we can all make our contributions.</P>
        <P>There is another issue, however, about which I have been approached by many young women in Dublin in recent days. It concerns the city area in particular.  The taxi drivers&rsquo; union representative has spoken on the matter and highlighted the fact that there are drivers of cars with bogus taxi signs.  Young women flag these down, thinking they are getting into a proper taxi and then find that it is not such.  This is a very serious issue.  It appears there may be a loophole in the legal situation.  I ask the Leader to find time to put this matter on the agenda in the future when we have more time and less serious measures to consider.  It deserves thorough discussion.  Women are frightened and when flagging down taxis wonder whether it is a real taxi or a driver with a bogus taxi sign.  This is a highly serious issue and I have been obliged to highlight it today because it has been drawn to my attention in recent days.  I acknowledge that Members must deal with other important issues at present and welcome a debate on the economy and the current global position.  However, the Leader should allocate time to discuss this issue, which should be examined by the Minister before providing Members with an update on it.</P>

People have little to speak of, except the banking system, unless they live in Galway and are at risk of lead poisoning.  This is a highly serious matter in respect of people&rsquo;s health, about which they have genuine worries.  Yesterday, a woman in Mervue spoke to me about a recent miscarriage and she now wonders whether it was linked to lead contamination in the water.</P>
        <P>I urgently ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government before the House to explain how he will guarantee the quality of drinking water, both nationally and in Galway.  It is time he pulled out all the stops for Galway and outlined the measures and the clear oversight that now is required.  The council has been caught on the back foot too many times in Galway in respect of cryptosporidium, e.coli and now lead poisoning.  I implore the Leader to ensure this happens soon, as the public has lost all confidence in the quality of drinking water.  Unfortunately, the emergency supply was unsafe last weekend.  Regardless of whether it was safe, people have lost confidence and are buying water, which cannot continue.  This has gone on for too long in Galway, which always is being reactive.  I note this issue has been replicated elsewhere in respect of other public water supplies.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a question and answer session on the economy and the latest dramatic developments.  We live in momentous times and I feel reassured that matters are being handled with dispatch, as well as a sense of urgency and clarity about the precise solutions that are needed to deal with the current crisis.  One cannot overlook the fact that no matter how much one might resent the large salaries enjoyed by bankers and so on, the welfare of the banks is intrinsically and inextricably tied up with the welfare of the economy and our people.  I also compliment Deputy Richard Bruton on his fine contribution to this morning&rsquo;s broadcast of &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  This is a time that calls for a bipartisan approach, which is the sense I am getting in this regard at present.  I commend all sides, not simply the Government, in this respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s comment that the day of the storm is not the time to fix the thatch.  However, when the debate on the economy takes place, it will be important for Members to consider that however important regulation may be, what is being witnessed globally and nationally simply is the inadequacy of regulation alone.  It is clear that a failure of ethics has led to the current global crisis.  People felt themselves to be under pressure to produce short-term quarterly results and bent the rules to do so.  Members&rsquo; discussion for the future of finance in Ireland must examine how to inculcate a culture of virtuous leadership, as of all areas this is one in which the rot can set in from the top down.  People at board level determine the culture within the organisation.  As Warren Buffett stated, it is only when the river runs dry that one realises who has been swimming naked.  It is only when we have these problems that we realise who has been acting inappropriately.</P>
        <P>I hope we will take the opportunity to have a serious debate about ethics and integrity in the areas of business and finance and how we can stimulate better behaviour in them.  The price is too high when there is a failure of ethics.</P>

	<P>I will raise another issue for when we have time for it.  Last year I called for a debate on bioethics and specifically the area of embryo protection.  I am very grateful to many colleagues, both here and in the D&aacute;il, who attended the briefing I organised last term.  At that time I mentioned the developments in Wisconsin and Japan in which scientists had successfully transformed adult cells into the equivalent of embryonic stem cells, which seemed to show great potential in the area of finding future cures.</P>
        <P>One concern was that the method was based on a technique that relied on retroviruses, with this connected to some risks of cancer.  The good news, according to the journal <i>Science</i> published last week, is that a group of Harvard researchers has now managed to successfully reprogramme adult cells into the equivalent of embryonic stem cells without the need for retroviruses.  This opens the even greater possibility of development in the area of adult stem cell research.  It also proves good science need not be at odds with good ethics and we hope for cures that all of us can live with.</P>
        <P>When we get over the current emergency debates, I hope we will have the opportunity to debate developments in bioethics and how we can have a properly ethical approach to the issue in this country.</P>

	<P>I support the request for a substantive question and answer session during our debate on the economy as it would be very helpful.</P><Col N="12"/>
        <P>One fact we have had to deal with as public representatives in our own constituencies over the past number of months arises from the significant number of additional people who are unemployed.  Senator Fitzgerald indicated that 40,000 or so people have become unemployed since Deputy Brian Cowen became Taoiseach.  The issue is the difficulty in the processing of social welfare claims.</P>
        <P>We have many big issues to discuss with regard to economic matters and job creation but 40,000 or 50,000 people have unfortunately become unemployed over the past five or six months.  They are finding it very difficult to have their rightful entitlement to social welfare processed, which is grossly unfair.</P>
        <P>During the reign of Deputy Michael Woods &mdash; perhaps &ldquo;reign&rdquo; is the wrong word but he was there so long we almost considered it a reign &mdash; or period as Minister responsible for social welfare matters, there was great progress in the computerisation of social welfare records.  It resulted in the streamlining of the system and payments were made on time.</P>
        <P>Something seems to have gone wrong within the Department of Social and Family Affairs from a claims processing perspective.  People are waiting not just weeks but months to have unemployment benefit claims processed.  The State is saving virtually nothing because the HSE must come forward with supplementary welfare payments.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader confer with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and try to clear this blockage?  It is bad enough that 50,000 people have lost their jobs over the past five or six months and we hear it on a daily basis in every town and townland.  The least those people could expect is that having been compliant taxpayers and paid social insurance, they would receive their entitlements on time.  We should try to deal with and resolve the problem, getting the computers running again so people, in their time of great need and distress, can at least be assured of their financial entitlements</P>

	<P>I support Senator Frances Fitzgerald on the question of the amendment to the Order of Business.  The point has been made that the banking sector in Ireland is vital to the economy and the standing of the financial services industry in the international financial system.  The Government&rsquo;s action is welcome and it was a very necessary measure.  It was acting <i>in extremis</i> and it has safeguarded the banking system in Ireland.  There are issues of responsibility and oversight but the Government has acted.  The Government acts only when its back is to the wall, when it has no option but to act.  The Minister for Finance acted after Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme in raising the deposit guarantee for depositors in banks.  It was absolutely necessary that he act, despite the fact that our spokesperson on finance, Deputy Richard Bruton, had suggested that more than a year ago.  He acted last night.  It is not a question of leadership, it is a question of no choice.  This action was necessary and it is the banks who designed this policy, put it to the Minister and he had no option but to act.</P>
        <P>I do not think it is a question of leadership.</P>

It is ridiculous to get up here and congratulate him on his speedy performance and actions.  Senator Regan was right.  The man did it because he had to.  The banks came to him begging him to do something about the situation, otherwise catastrophe would have hit us today.  I do not know what they said to him.  I presume, and the markets were signalling clearly yesterday, that a bank here was going to go under if we did not do something very quickly.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Let us not congratulate the Minister on this.

	<P>Let us not say this was a great job done overnight.  It was a last resort.  What has been done is phenomenal in terms of figures.  We have given guarantees of &euro;400 billion to &euro;500 billion.  That probably will never be called on.  It is nearly half of the figure being talked about in the USA, which is $700 billion.  Let us not say it is realistic and congratulate the Minister.  Why in the name of God did he not sack the Financial Regulator?  For the past four or five years, the banks have been allowed, by the Financial Regulator, to lend money on 100% loan, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to, and to lend money to property developers to whom they should not have lent any money, and they have gone berserk. </P>
        <P>There is only one body in this country that can stop that, and that is the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator has been asleep on the job.  It is not the Minister&rsquo;s job to rescue shareholders; I do not give a hoot about shareholders, that is their problem.  When this is over and the shares have rallied, are we going to have the same people doing the same things with the same problem?

That will come up and bite us next week when we realise the depositors are all right.</P>

	<P>To reflect the views of citizens the Fine Gael Party does not propose to hold hands across the Chamber during the debate on the economy.  I ask the Leader to have an open debate.  Last Thursday, Ireland officially entered a recession and yesterday the stock <Col N="14"/>market crashed, losing 13% of its value in one day.  These developments caused the Government to intervene this morning.  If, God forbid, the Minister for Finance had decided last night to have another long lie-in, where would the stock market be this morning?</P>
        <P>The crisis is of the Government&rsquo;s and banks&rsquo; making but they refuse to accept responsibility for it.  Ministers must come before the House for a long debate.  There is no point in me speaking for a few minutes and Government Senators commending the Minister on his speedy response.  The Minister responded before the stock market shut down completely and the economy went bankrupt.  It was a case of falling asleep on the job, rather than responding quickly.</P>
        <P>The House should have a proper debate with the Minister present to answer questions on his actions.  Perhaps he read <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> at the weekend or received press releases from those who spoke of protecting depositors.  On the other hand, he may be making up policy as he goes along.  We need to know what is going on because the Minister and Taoiseach are not inspiring confidence in any of us.</P>

All Senators, regardless of their political affiliation or outlook, want to work together to get the economy back on track.  While all parties should welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intervention early this morning, its purpose is to protect the banks.  We need information on how he intends to protect the citizens and taxpayers who are underwriting &euro;500 billion in debt.  As Senator Ross noted, it is unlikely this debt will be called in.  Nevertheless, as we are making a substantial commitment, we need to know how we will benefit and ensure taxpayers are not caught in the long grass.  What is the <i>quid pro quo</i> for citizens?</P>
        <P>On procedural matters, when is it proposed to take Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill 2008, Second Stage of which is scheduled for tomorrow?</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford raised the processing of social welfare claims.  People in County Donegal and many other areas will be familiar with long queues of people waiting outside social welfare offices as they seek to have their claims for benefits processed.  It is degrading to require people to stand on a public street, frequently in rain, as they wait to have social welfare claims processed.  One social welfare office in County Donegal recently closed its doors to members of the public because demand was so high.</P>
        <P>Last weekend I spoke to three people who visited their local social welfare office to inform officials they had been unemployed, only to be told to return in three weeks if they wished to speak to an officer.  It is deplorable that those who have been working to build up the economy are being treated in this manner by the Government and system.  The Minister should come before the House to discuss the resources needed in the public service to address increased demand for social welfare benefits.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the crisis in the education system at the earliest possible opportunity.  The first day of the new session affords Senators the first opportunity to raise this issue.  Tens of thousands of young children recently returned to school to be educated in prefabricated classrooms. buildings which are falling apart or were once rat infested and classrooms which have windows nailed shut.  The Minister is aware of countless schools across the Twenty-six Counties which have been certified as dangerous by local authority fire officers or include buildings which electrical contractors have indicated are not safe for children to enter.  Notwithstanding these problems, it was announced yesterday that 25 of 1,400 projects on the schools building programme would proceed.  The announcement was a disgrace.  The Minister must come before the House to explain how he proposes to bail out children from prefabricated classrooms and deplorable conditions in buildings which are falling down and provide them the modern accommodation they deserve.</P>

	<P>I, too, echo Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a question and answer session on the commitment the Minister for Finance made on our behalf overnight.  While I concur with previous speakers that the measure is necessary, I feel a little sick in the pit of my stomach about the prospect of such wholesale Government intervention.  We need to ensure any proposed scheme includes safeguards to protect taxpayers.  I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on insurance cover and the bank levy.  The levy was removed several years ago shortly after a former general secretary of the major Government party was appointed head of the Irish Banking Federation.  I assume some form of bank levy will be introduced following the Government&rsquo;s initiative. </P>
        <P>I watched on the monitor in my office a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service with the heads of five or six large Irish banks.  While it is good to have such guests before Oireachtas committees, we should review the manner in which we issue such invitations if they fail to give forthright answers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the summer, we heard a number of proposals from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on increasing loans to first-time buyers and other groups with a view to reinvigorating the housing market and house construction sector.  Will &mdash; as I hope &mdash; this morning&rsquo;s announcement scupper these proposals?  The best way we can help people who want to provide a house for themselves is to ensure those inflated house prices &mdash;  in regard to which we are now seeing the chickens come home to roost with our bailing out of the banks &mdash; would fall a little further.  Rather than the Government intervening again in <Col N="16"/>the housing market, which it did on five or six occasions during the time I have been involved in politics and on each such occasion there was a further increase in house prices, perhaps it could let the market find a natural level.</P>
        <P>Having got on to the housing ladder recently, I find it sickening that we are bailing out the banks which threw good money after bad by approving 100% mortgages and recklessly granting loans to developers in this city and across the country to outbid each other for grossly inflated sites, particularly in this city but also in other parts of the country, and now we are asking the taxpayers to bail them out.  I know we have to do that, but we should have a proper questions and answers discussion on this matter to ascertain what safeguards are being put in place to ensure that taxpayers gets some sort of value for the potential liability to which they are being exposed.</P>

As Leader of the House, I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to put in place, with immediate effect, a guaranteed arrangement to safeguard all deposits, whether they be retail, commercial, institutional or inter-banked, which covers bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt, which is the lower tier two, with the following banks, the Allied Irish Bank, the Bank of Ireland, the Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life and Permanent, the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the Educational Building Society and such specific subsidiaries as may be approved by the Government following consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.

School colleagues who emigrated to Canada and America in the early 1960s because they had no other option showed me their bank accounts on their return home four or five years later and they were paying 5.5% or 6% in interest rates when people here were paying 18%, 20% or 21% and I was paying 22.5% in the Christmas of 1980.  We know how difficult times were then.  I have said on the Order of Business and in other debates in the House that those who stayed here to witness the success of the economy that we have had deserve a gold medal for what we achieved during the past 35 to 40 years.</P>
        <P>Many people in Ireland this morning would like to compliment the Government, the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and everyone associated with giving a guarantee that the few euro people have on deposit following their life-long savings are assured and that everything related to the current and other accounts held by people in business in Ireland has been guaranteed and looked after.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We now go forward to meet the challenge we face.  I must take account of the advice of the father of the House, Senator Ross, on these senior financial issues because he has been dealing with this area all of his working life.  However, I must differ with him in that all my friends who have generated thousands of jobs here over the past number of years have told me &mdash; having been a Member of this House for a considerable time I am probably more senior in age to most Members here &mdash;  that in their lifetime this was the first time that they had seen the banks not lending to the banks, which was a road to disaster.  I look forward to Senator Ross&rsquo;s <Col N="17"/>contribution to the debate on the economy.  I was pleased two weeks ago to place this issue as the first item to be debated on our return today.  I will listen to the submissions of colleagues, particularly that of Senator Ross, on how the banks loaning to the banks will improve the position for all of our people.</P>
        <P>Senators MacSharry and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for an all-day debate on banking.  I can assure the House I will accede to that request.  I will inform the House on the Order of Business on Thursday how I will facilitate the taking place of such a debate next week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join Senator O&rsquo;Toole in welcoming the library initiative detailed in the pamphlet which he highlighted to the House.  It is a great step forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Hanafin raised the issue of the source of funding for Libertas and asked if there was outside intervention in respect of it.  I will pass his views on to the Minister responsible.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden, Doherty and other colleagues requested that the Minister for Education and Science be invited to the House for a debate on school funding allocations and the manner in which financial allocations are prioritised for new school building projects.  I have no difficulty in making time available for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn drew the attention of the House to a new &euro;5 coin he obtained in France.  This change is a move in the right direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the issue of taxi drivers who are not registered.  This is an issue of concern.  We must have confidence in the security of travelling by taxi and in taxi drivers having obtained a licence to operate them from the local authorities.  I will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister concerned and I have no difficulty in setting aside time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames highlighted the difficult position faced by the people in Galway regarding the high content of lead found in the water supply in certain parts of Galway city.  I and many colleagues spent three lovely days in the Clayton Hotel in Galway recently.  We viewed the great progress that has been made in Galway city.  It was an eye-opener.  Galway has changed substantially during the past ten to 15 years.  The difficulty that is being experienced by the people in that city will be given top priority by the Government.</P>

        <P>Senator Mullen called for a debate on stem cell research and all matters pertaining to it.  I have no difficulty in setting aside time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and Doherty outlined to the House the difficulties experienced by those who have lost their jobs in claiming their social welfare entitlements.  First, I must welcome the announcement in Limerick today of 200 jobs.  However, it is not  good enough that those people <Col N="18"/>who paid their taxes now find there is a difficulty in processing their social welfare claims.  I will ensure inquiries are made in this regard.  Senators should advise me of the areas of the country where people are experiencing such difficulties.  I will take up the matter with the office of the Minister responsible immediately after the Order of Business and report back to the House on Thursday morning.</P>
        <P>Senators Pearse Doherty and John Paul Phelan referred to housing matters and inquired when it is proposed to take Committee Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The best information available to me indicates that it is proposed to take Committee Stage of the Bill in three to four weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Jerry Buttimer asked that the Minister for Transport come to the House to discuss aviation matters, especially as they relate to Cork.  I have no difficulty making a request for the Minister to come to the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer also expressed his serious concern regarding job losses.  There are 2.1 million people currently in employment, whereas 20 years ago only 1.1 million had jobs.  This represents a substantial improvement.  Please God we are reaching the stage where we will be able to assist people and improve the position further.  The 200 jobs announced for Limerick earlier today are welcome.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the Seanad and to contribute to this discussion on the current condition of the economy.  I look forward to listening to the views of Members.</P>
        <P>For the information of Members, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will introduce a Bill in the D&aacute;il later this evening which will give powers to the measures taken earlier today to improve confidence in the Irish banking sector.  He will give full details of the proposed legislation and the decision to safeguard the sector and the reasoning behind it.  Members will, therefore, understand that in advance of the Minister&rsquo;s statement in the D&aacute;il, I am somewhat constrained in what I can say on that subject and I will focus mainly on the current condition of the economy.</P>
        <P>Considerable improvements have been achieved in recent years for the majority in society.  Notwithstanding these improvements, it is important to acknowledge we are in the midst of an international economic and financial storm and we are far from immune from its effects.  We must be realistic about what has to be done so that we safeguard the gains made and ensure we are well positioned to benefit from the global economic pick-up whenever it emerges.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In any debate on recent developments in the economy, it is instructive to consider our recent economic progress.  Ireland has enjoyed unparalleled economic success over the past two decades.  The economy has been transformed beyond recognition.  More than 2 million people are now in work while Irish <i>per capita </i>income levels have converged with those in the rest of the developed world.  In fact, since this Government came to office in mid-1997, more than 700,000 jobs have been created and since 1987, employment has practically doubled.  This transformation has been achieved by the hard work and enterprise of our citizens and of those who have come to our shores and has been underpinned by Government economic strategy.</P>
        <P>There have been very real gains but we must acknowledge that the short-term economic environment in Ireland has become much more difficult.  Ireland is not unique in this regard.  Prospects in virtually all the world&rsquo;s developed economies have deteriorated sharply over the <Col N="21"/>past year or so.  This international slowdown reflects a number of factors, including the continued fall-out from global financial market difficulties and rising commodity prices.  Growth in our trading partners has slowed and combined with the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, this has created a difficult trading environment for the exporting sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, we have to cope also with the very sharp correction in the house building sector.  Over time, output will return to more sustainable levels but there is a process of adjustment and a bumpy landing is not pain-free.</P>
        <P>The level of economic activity remains at a very high level, as does the level of employment and income<i> per capita</i>.  The underlying health of our economy remains robust.  We have a dynamic, highly skilled labour force, together with a business environment which is supportive of enterprise and rewards work.  We have flexible markets and a low public indebtedness.  In other words, we are in the relatively fortunate position of being able to face the current stresses of economic adjustment from a position of strength.</P>
        <P>The publication of the national accounts data last week has received widespread attention.  These figures show that the economy contracted in gross domestic product terms at an annual rate of 0.8% in the second quarter of this year and -1% for the first half of this year on an annual basis.  In other words, we have confirmation that we are in recession.  While these figures are poor, they are not surprising.  Other indicators such as retail sales, house completions and labour market data had indicated a contraction in the second quarter.  They are in line with a sharp decline in tax receipts.  In the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget, the Department of Finance is assessing these figures with a view to publishing a revised economic growth forecast for this year and the next three years.</P>
        <P>The sharp slowdown in economic activity is having a considerable impact on our tax revenue and this poses challenges for all of us in terms of what public services can be delivered in the year ahead.  Irrespective of the size of the shortfall in tax revenue this year, we must remember a considerable amount of revenue will be collected this year, and this will be spent on the various services and capital projects required for a modern society.  The Government will address the funding gap in a measured and balanced manner in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>I refute assertions that the Government has taken no action so far.  In recognition of known spending pressures, mainly reflecting the weaker labour market and the resulting increase in the live register, the Government in July announced a savings package of &euro;440 million in 2008 and &euro;1 billion in 2009.  The purpose of these measures was to make certain adjustments within the overall expenditure amounts.  They include &euro;50 million in procurement savings next year, for which I have particular responsibility.  We also made it clear that additional economies would be required in the event that the fiscal position deteriorated further.</P>
        <P>Over the summer months, the poor performance of tax revenue worsened, and it is now clear there will be a substantial tax shortfall this year.  Following analysis of the end-September tax revenues, the Department of Finance will set out its assessment in the normal manner at the end-quarter press conference on Thursday.  September is a key month for tax revenue.  While we do not have full month data yet, early indications suggest that the poor performance in tax receipts witnessed over the summer months is continuing.</P>
        <P>We have brought forward budget 2009 to 14 October.  The budget will reflect the necessary prioritisation of expenditure in light of expected tax revenues.  Without going into details of the budget  today, which have yet to be finally settled, it will set out steps to stabilise and restore balance to the public finances by, among other things, prioritising current and capital public expenditure to reflect the changed realities.  The Government also intends to take decisive action now so as to safeguard our future sustainable growth.</P><Col N="22"/>
        <P>Ireland is better placed than most economies to meet the challenges ahead with our low debt rate, our educated and young workforce, and our low tax environment for workers and business.  We are also undertaking relatively the largest public investment programme in Europe.  The Government will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is in the best possible position to resume trend growth as soon as international conditions improve.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national development plan, launched in January 2007, set out a strategic and comprehensive strategy for investment in the economy over the period 2007 to 2013.  The principal aims of the plan are to consolidate and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s economic competitiveness, to remove infrastructural bottlenecks which inhibit economic development, to educate our workforce, and to build a more socially inclusive society.  The first annual report on the national development plan was published in July 2008 and gives a comprehensive picture of what has been financed and delivered under the plan in its first year. The total outturn for 2007, at &euro;22.4 billion, was very close to the allocation envisaged under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>A modern roads network and efficient public transport are absolutely vital for long-term economic and social prosperity.  Under the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s ten-year investment programme, Transport 21, our major interurban routes, which link Dublin to Galway, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Belfast, will have been upgraded in full by the end of 2010.  We have already made significant progress along these routes.  On the public transport side, important commuter routes into Dublin and Cork and between Dublin and the major cities have been enhanced, and further work continues on these.</P>
        <P>The delivery of Transport 21, and the NDP in general, are dependent on the level of economic growth and the level of resources that are available to the Government over the medium term.  In this context, the Government has indicated that, despite expenditure pressures which have arisen this year, capital expenditure will remain a top priority.  In response to falling revenue pressures, and as part of the current budget and Estimates process, the Government has decided to review all capital expenditure proposals for 2009 to 2011 to ensure that constrained resources can be targeted at investment in core economic infrastructure that adds to our productive capacity.  This should enable Ireland to recover quickly, when the current economic downturn abates.</P>
        <P>As in many other countries, the pick-up in Irish inflation over the past year or so has been driven primarily by the global rise in food and oil prices.  In Ireland, increases in interest rates have also had a direct impact on inflation.  Recent inflation trends have been more positive. The annual rate of CPI inflation eased to 4.3% in August from 5% two months earlier.  On the EU harmonised basis, annual inflation in August was 3.2%, significantly below the 3.8% increase recorded in the euro area, and the third lowest in the European Union over the past 12 months.</P>
        <P>The Department expects to see an easing in the average rate of inflation in the latter part of this year and into next.  Most commentators share this view.  In addition to a moderation in commodity prices, the large increases in food and oil that occurred towards the end of last year will fall out of the annual comparison.  The pass-through of the strong euro will also contribute to an easing in inflation, as will more modest domestic demand.</P>
        <P>In pursuit of moderate levels of inflation, the Government is committed to implementing responsible fiscal policies and promoting competition and increased price transparency through the work of relevant State bodies.  We are also continuing to prioritise productive investment in public infrastructure that the Government is undertaking as part of the national development plan which, over the longer term, will enhance our ability to produce more goods and services.  By improving the economy&rsquo;s efficiency, this should also help to keep inflation in check.</P><Col N="23"/>
        <P>Improving our competitive position is essential to facilitate a re-balancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain our attractiveness as a location for inward investment.  While the external factors referred to earlier, such as commodity prices and exchange rates, have an impact on domestic costs, these are beyond our control.  Therefore, we must seek to control those costs over which we do have influence.  We must also take steps to improve productivity.  Recent months have seen Ireland&rsquo;s rate of inflation fall below that in the rest of the euro area, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>In further support of our competitiveness objectives, the Government is committed to maintaining a low burden of taxation on capital and labour, and has implemented a range of policies aimed at improving competition in product markets and flexibility in the labour market.  At the present juncture, improving our competitiveness position also means ensuring that we do not allow externally-driven price increases to be exacerbated by internally-generated second round effects.  In this respect, the willingness of the various parties to compromise and adopt a realistic approach to wage determination in the recent pay talks is commendable.</P>
        <P>We are also continuing to prioritise productive investment in physical and human capital under the national development plan.  These measures will equip the Irish economy with the skills, infrastructure and operating environment needed so that we can take advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.</P>
        <P>As referred to in the D&aacute;il last week, the Government and the social partners recently concluded a draft agreement as a successor to the first module of Towards 2016.  I endorse the comments made by the Taoiseach when he remarked that a national pay agreement will provide a sense of confidence, certainty and stability in the challenging period ahead, while at the same time providing wider economic and social benefits.  As Senators will know from my time as a Member of this House, I am a strong champion of social partnership.  The cohesion it provides is needed more than ever in critical times.  Here again the Government kept its nerve and played a key role in helping to bring it together and secure our future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No doubt much will be said about the reform of the public sector, to which the Government is committed.  This is an ongoing process which now has even greater importance.  However, the financial turbulence which is a backdrop to this debate has developed within a part of the private sector, but it is the State everywhere that is being called on to provide a safety net.</P>
        <P>A new balance must be struck, so as to try and avoid future disasters of Icarus proportions.  We all understand the importance of markets, but some of the more exotic ones have led us to where we are, and the State on behalf of the citizens has been left with much of the responsibility for retrieving the situation, accepting forced priorities.  It seems clear to me that we need not a weaker State that withers away, but a strong and resilient one that can protect without being overpowering.</P>
        <P>The economic environment has clearly become more challenging, and the openness of Ireland&rsquo;s economy makes us more exposed to global economic developments.  We have benefited substantially from positive developments in the global economy in the past but at present we are clearly being adversely affected by what is happening elsewhere, especially in the United States, and the difficult conditions in the house building sector are not helping.  The Government has taken initial decisive steps to steer the economy through these difficult times and will take further substantial steps with the measures that are to be announced on budget day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was not very different from the one he delivered in this House prior to its adjournment for the summer.  Yesterday, the Irish Stock Exchange crashed by more than 10%, an unprecedented collapse in its value.  It is time the Government awoke to a crisis which is partly of its own making.  Exchequer figures will be out <Col N="24"/>by more than 10% compared with the previous budget, and we are discussing figures involving billions of euro rather than thousands or millions.  The Government got its predictions completely wrong and it will have to do something about it.</P>
        <P>The current buzzword in the financial sector is &ldquo;toxicity&rdquo;, a condition which has crept into the Government.  Ireland has the misfortune to have its own toxic trio, namely, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, all of whom are out of their depth in terms of their responsibility for economic policy.  They are contributing to the toxicity of the economy through their poor and slow judgment.  The people will soon get sick and tired of this behaviour.</P>
        <P>Why does the Government not acknowledge the unbelievable amount of bad debt that has arisen?  Fianna F&aacute;il, which has been in power for the past ten years, the banks and the property developers lulled themselves into this financial crisis.  Irish bank deposits are safe for now but the crisis is not over.  Developers across this city paid between &euro;200 million and &euro;800 million for land which in some cases is now only worth half that amount.  Who is taking up the slack for this money which has to be written off on property?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The developers will simply close their companies and declare bankruptcy.  The banks have the clown that is this Government on which to fall back.  The taxpayer had better not be pushed into another mess in a few weeks&rsquo; time.  The only evidence thus far that the Government understands the seriousness of the current crisis is its guarantee on deposits, a measure which has been proposed by a wide range of people over recent months.</P>
        <P>Although I will not let the banks off the hook, the Government contributed to the crisis.  Banking representatives told the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that they did not believe a Northern Rock was lurking in Ireland and that significant sums of money were being provided through the interbank market to Irish banks.  Given that the Minister of State does not give a hoot about showing courtesy to this House, I ask him to set out for the D&aacute;il the source of funding for Irish lending banks.  Irish banks get their money from deposits and interbank lending.  Some Irish banks have reported that interbank lending was only a percentage of total lending.  If overall lending in the Irish financial market is significantly down, have deposits also reduced significantly or is there something else we need to know?  For some strange reason, investors have fled the Irish banking sector like swallows at the end of summer.  They have simply disappeared and Irish bank shares are collapsing.  Why were investors leaving the Bank of Ireland at the beginning of the summer despite yields of 12%?</P>
        <P>People clearly are aware that serious problems exist.  I will not accuse the Government of lying, but it is not telling the truth or letting the people know what is going on.  The toxic trio are acting under the same delusions that affect many Fianna F&aacute;il Members of this House.  They are not telling the truth to the people but they cannot hide it forever.  They will take the blame because they are not facing up to their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>In regard to the economy, the Minister of State failed to discuss the reforms for which he is responsible.  Government Members have been speaking <i>ad nauseam</i> about these since they were re-elected for their third term.  What problems arise in terms of competitiveness?  Is the Minister of State satisfied that all the issues pertaining to competitiveness are being addressed adequately and that they will not cause our economy to shrink in the future?  In regard to the growth of Irish exports and foreign direct investment, currency exchange and competitiveness issues have arisen.  Little can be done about currency exchange but a lot can be done to address competitiveness.  However, the bland words we hear from Government representatives do <Col N="25"/>nothing to assure us that something is being done.  We want to know the concrete actions being planned.</P>
        <P>At the end of the day, markets can handle both good and bad news but they cannot handle uncertainty or the press leaks and personal opinions which we get from Ministers with responsibility for economic policy.  Is a redundancy package planned for the public service?  Will medical cards be taken from patients over the age of 70?  The Minister for Finance says he will not announce his decisions until budget day but he is adding to the uncertainty in the economy.  Consumers are losing confidence because of the way the economy is being treated by this Government.  It is time to address that issue.</P>
        <P>Regard should be had for those facing negative equity because of what Fianna F&aacute;il has done.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, claimed that anyone who talked down the property market was unpatriotic.  These people are now left with massive negative equity because Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to win the previous general election.  The personal cost did not matter.  How about doubling mortgage relief for the people whom the Government deliberately misled to win an election?  That might reverse the belief that Government Members are merely a crowd of charlatans out to mislead at every turn.</P>
        <P>The Government needs to start acting as if it is in power because toxicity exists in the Irish banking system and further problems are coming.  If our own toxic trio, who have played an important role in causing these problems, do not act promptly, the situation in which we will find ourselves will be much worse.  It is time to ask the banks how bad matters have become because we cannot help if we do not have this information.  We may support the Government&rsquo;s legislative proposals but, like the people, we are becoming sick of being misled and hearing lies.  When the Minister for Finance makes his speech, he needs to tell the people how bad the situation has become.</P>
        <P>When the banks appeared before the Oireachtas committee less then three months ago, they could not have painted a rosier picture.  One would never have believed that within three months the Government would be bailing them out of one of the greatest crises to have affected the banking sector in the history of this State.  If the drip feeding of bad news continues for the next several months, the Government will send us back to the 1980s because consumer confidence will have disappeared.  Business people and those who are financially aware know what is happening because they have been following events.  That is why they have ceased to buy shares in Irish banks.</P>
        <P>Ministers need to get off their high horses and start acting like a Government by being honest with the people.  Fine Gael have put a number of questions to the Minister for Finance.  There will be an expectation that when the Minister comes into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann he will answer those questions and that he will be a little more receptive to the views of those on the Opposition side of the House.  Otherwise, we will have to be far more aggressive with the Government in persuading it to do what is right for the people.  I have heard rubbish talk &mdash; I will use the word &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; &mdash; from Fianna F&aacute;il about a bipartisan approach.  Fianna F&aacute;il has abused every sort of bipartisan approach from those on this side of the House.  I do not think it will be so easy this time.  It is time for that party to start taking the hard decisions and to do the job it was elected to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is always the same when he responds.  He should try a new approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>There was one proposal Senator Twomey made I would recommend the Minister of State bring to the Minister for Finance, which was to double the tax relief for first-time buyers.  I am sure the Government will reflect on that.  I thank Senator Twomey for that long-winded single proposal, with unparliamentary language to boot, which I have never heard in my seven years in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I utterly reject any suggestion that this Government has done anything but act in a measured and decisive way in dealing with the international crisis.  There have been five interventions over recent years.  The first, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, referred in his own contribution in the debate on the economy last week, was fixed contracts for infrastructural projects to increase value for money.  That is something to which I will return later.  We have had social partnership, involving very difficult negotiations.  As I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Toole will know, because he was a champion of it in the past, the success of the past 15 years was established and built on the base of social partnership.  We have achieved agreement on that.  We have brought forward the budget to 14 October, which is to be welcomed.  Also to be welcomed is the increase in deposit protection to &euro;100,000 which was announced last week.  These four things were followed by the announcement that legislation is being prepared to guarantee banks.</P>
        <P>This is not a reaction, as I heard on the Order of Business earlier, to any television or radio show or to suggestions from journalists.  I am glad to say the officials at the Department of Finance and the Ministers in our Government have the competence to be able to act in the interests of our economy.  This is not bailing out the banks; it is a set of measures that is being introduced.  I appreciate that we all look forward to hearing a little more detail about its various aspects, as I am sure we will in the banking Bill which is to be introduced in the D&aacute;il later today and presumably in the Seanad tomorrow.  However, we are assured it will represent value for money to the taxpayer who, as was rightly pointed out on the Order of Business today, may be taking on an element of risk, and that it will be based on commercial terms.  This does not constitute a bail-out but a transaction.  The banks will pay for these guarantees, and rightly so.</P>
        <P>I do not have any pity for banks that have presided over reckless lending, but there is no indication that banks in Ireland have involved themselves in the &ldquo;ninja&rdquo; lending that was common in the United States, which was completely reckless and which involved lending to people with no jobs and no capability of paying back.  For the most part that has not happened here, <Col N="27"/>as far as we know.  Yes, there is exposure to developers, and yes, there will be losses in that regard, but I am hopeful, if not confident, that our banks are capitalised to the extent that they can sustain such losses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is business.  If they are not, it will be reflected in their share prices.</P>
        <P>What the Government has done today is to take decisive action.  It has given an example to the rest of the world.  That is the international sentiment on what the Irish Government has done.  The British Government immediately stated it was watching what was happening here, and the Opposition in the UK has said the same.  We have seen a bounce in the markets today.  That gives certainty to the investor and it is also of advantage to our banks.  As other speakers said, they get their funding from two sources: deposits and interbank lending.  Banks throughout the world would like to lend exclusively to Irish financial institutions on the back of this guarantee.  That is welcome.</P>

	<P>We will hear all the details, as the Senator well knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the details.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a bail-out; it is, effectively, a transaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>A rescue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there will be a levy or charge for that, which we will hear about in due course.  However, it will be at market rates.</P>
        <P>As I said on the Order of Business, I congratulate the Minister on his decisive action.  The officials who were up all night trying to prepare the legislation deserve our gratitude.  In this regard we are unlike the United States where there has been dithering over recent months.  The partisan wrangling that went on there yesterday was a disgrace and unhelpful to the world.  The US, as well as many other countries, can look to what the Government here has done and take similar actions which, as I said on the Order of Business, I believe will help to establish a floor to this international crisis from which we can begin to stage a recovery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey mentioned the appearance of representatives of the banks at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which I am a member.  So much has occurred in the past three months.  Last week the bank Wachovia was taken over by Morgan Stanley.  Today it was itself taken over by Citibank, and Morgan Stanley by Mitsubishi.  By lunchtime yesterday five banks around Europe had to be bailed out.  Things are changing so fast that equal <Col N="28"/>fluidity is required in dealing with them.  States must be agile and flexible.  Our Government has shown that in its actions since last night.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned social partnership, the early introduction of the budget, which will contain a number of measures I will mention in a moment, and the developments of last night and today.  We look forward to that legislation.  As I said, this is not a bail-out of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is in the best interests of our economy and our people.  It is not just in the interests of the banks.</P>
        <P>The next two weeks, as we prepare for the budget on 14 October, may be the most important two weeks in our modern history.  Given our changed economic circumstances, we must cut out all the fat &mdash; anything that has been allowed to develop &mdash; across all Departments, State agencies and areas under State control.  All fat must be ruthlessly cut out.  We must try to maximise income from all quarters during the next period without, if possible, increasing personal taxation.  We must look after the most vulnerable, in the tradition of Fianna F&aacute;il in government, and ensure that in these more difficult days, with high commodity prices internationally, we look after those who are most in need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not doing that at the moment.  It is cutting out disability allowance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Really, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, this is an unusual level of interruption.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated, it is important we maintain a certain level of capital expenditure.  We must try to maintain momentum to the greatest possible extent.  There are positive aspects of the Labour Party ten-point plan, which I mentioned earlier, on which the Minister could reflect.  We should consider the national development plan and prioritise the projects that will contribute to and enhance our competitiveness.  In this way we will ensure that when the upturn comes, as the Taoiseach and other Ministers have been saying, we are positioned in the best possible way to take maximum advantage.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State pointed out, we have a low taxation base, high employment &mdash; although in recent times there has admittedly been a rise in unemployment, which is likely to increase in the short term &mdash; and a low rate of debt.  This is positive in the context of having the right fundamentals when the upturn comes.  If we need to increase borrowing, which clearly we need to do up to approximately &euro;5 billion, I believe we should consider borrowing from our pension reserve.  It would be better to pay interest to ourselves and for the benefit of the Irish people than to a third party.  That should be considered and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to take that proposal to the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his ministerial colleagues.</P>
        <P>Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank speaking last week in Dublin likened the European Union at 50 years of age to an individual going through a mid-life crisis.  It is in need of a diet and an exercise regime which should result in a slimmed down revived figure.  This is an excellent analogy for our public services.  With <Col N="29"/>that in mind, I express the personal opinion that we should have a voluntary redundancy scheme across the entire public and Civil Service.  It would be a positive move and could be financed by way of advanced profits from the Central Bank.</P>
        <P>The next few weeks will be vital.  I welcome the opportunity that this debate gives to people to put before the House their suggestions as the budget is being prepared in these most unusual times.  The Government has the capability and determination to lead us through these crises and build the blocks that will lead to the next Celtic tiger.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and I wish him and his colleagues well as they prepare the budget measures on all our behalves in the weeks ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House.  In all honesty, as one who has admired the contributions he has made, his speech today was one of his weaker contributions.  It is not a day to come in and tell us we must also take steps to improve productivity or that we must be committed to implementing responsible fiscal policies.  That is not today&rsquo;s business &mdash; it is everyday business and is always the business.  I am sorry the Minister of State rejected a question and answer session, which was not intended to pin him to the wall on any issue.  I know he is constrained as he said at the beginning.  However, I wanted to hear him say the Government had come to a conclusion that was announced at<?oasys _jy ?>6.50 a.m. this morning and to outline how it came to it.  He should have outlined the options it explored and possible alternatives.  All I wanted was the opportunity to buy into it.  I am still listening to hear that and I hope I will hear it later this evening.  In responding to the debate the Minister of State might open up some more and take us through effectively the pain the Government went through.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I agree with the point the Minister of State made about social partnership.  As he said, he has been a consistent champion of social partnership.  The most important statement in his speech was when he said the financial turbulence, which is the backdrop to this debate, has developed within a part of the private sector and the State has been called to provide the safety net.  That is the crucial point and explains why I am prepared to be open and supportive of the proposals coming to us.  I would be happy if the Minister of State takes the following message regarding the public sector to the Department.</P>
        <P>On the Order of Business I made the point that we owe a great deal to the Secretary General, David Doyle, and his team for working with this.  This is a creative and progressive proposal.  I cannot say whether it will work.  However, I certainly welcome it as being mould breaking.  As Senator MacSharry said, no other economy in the world has made such a proposal.  In terms of the general principle, I want it to work and I hope it will work.  I look forward to seeing the details later today.  The Minister of State could have used the occasion &mdash; perhaps he still can &mdash; to open up somewhat more on his personal views.  It is easy for him to speak before the Bill is published in terms of how he sees things and how he feels it would go and what led him to that position.  The message today is that the banks have let us down.  The free market just did not work.  I would ask the Minister of State to do this every time we get this matter to debate.  The free market has failed miserably.  That does not necessarily mean the market fails.  It is the free aspect, the unregulated unrestrained greed that drove it that has been the problem.  It is a question of how we should regulate it.  Towards the end of his speech the Minister of State said we needed to protect &ldquo;without being overpowering&rdquo; which is the key.  It is light-touch regulating but it must go right into the heart of the matter.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance has handled the matter extraordinarily well in convincing its political masters to move this forward.  I do not know on whose initiative this was proposed, but it is important that it is there.  I have been quick enough to criticise the Department of Finance over the years.  I hope I am also quick enough to give it credit, as I often do, when I <Col N="30"/>believe it has taken such an important step.  The proposal is unique and creative after the appalling decisions of irresponsible bankers.  Senator MacSharry mentioned the sub-prime market.  While it appears we have not been exposed to that market, it is really annoying that we still do not know &mdash; this is why I do not trust the bankers &mdash; the level of exposure.  We do not know the level of risk or what we are buying into.  Perhaps the Minister knows from his meeting last night.</P>
        <P>Representatives of the banks appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service a few months ago and assured us.  However, they are not to be believed.  The Government needs to be absolutely sceptical of anything it hears from the bankers.  These are the people who gave 110% loans to mortgage applicants and increased borrowers&rsquo; credit limits.  I had to contact my bank to advise it I intended to close my credit card account if it increased my credit limit again without asking me.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State and I both spoke in a debate here a few years ago when the banks proposed a daft idea of inviting people to convert their mortgage accounts into current accounts in order that they could use them to extend their debt.  That was an appalling thing to do.  Although the consumer director of the Financial Regulator, Mary O&rsquo;Dea, spoke against it at the time, it simply went ahead.  The regulator did not have the power to block it.  We need to remember this is exactly what they did to the farmers in the 1970s.  They shovelled out money to them to build milking parlours and other things they did not need.  When credit became tighter they threatened to take their land and took them to court.  The same thing is happening all over again.  It comes around and goes around.  It always will be cyclical.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the proposal to improve the situation for first-time house buyers, who are not the issue here.  Every time we have done anything for first-time buyers it has gone straight into the pockets of builders.  I do not want us to do that.  I thought the Minister of State might have mentioned the following in his speech.  The most critical thing was the Minister for Finance getting clearance from Europe for borrowings over the 3% cap under the<?oasys _jy ?>Maastricht treaty for buying into the euro system.  That was an important anticipatory move.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s proposal.  This is the first time I have said this.  I have agreed with the position of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, in establishing the pension fund.  I had been on the Commission on Public Service Pensions and had been very much in favour of establishing a pensions fund.  When that was established it was done on the basis that we would hit a pensions exposure crisis in 2011.  The demographics in the country have changed significantly since then and if we are to hit a crisis in pensions it will occur much later than 2011.  It does not make sense to borrow if we have the money ourselves.  We should consider taking it out.  I know the Labour Party has held that position for years.  I did not agree with it previously, but I agree with it on this occasion because times have changed and circumstances alter cases.</P>
        <P>In that regard also, credit should be given to the Labour Party for its recent publication.  It is the way forward to take those items from the national development plan and build the infrastructure we need to ensure we develop and not to sit back.  We need to take a further risk in that regard to ensure those aspects of the national development plan that are crucial to the development of the economy are taken on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I begrudge every cent to the bankers.  It is crucial that the decision of the Government should not be seen as a bank-rolling of the banks and of the bankers.  On the Order of Business Senator MacSharry referred to the economy.  The economy is the people, it is nothing else.  My first lecture in economics said the economy was well-educated healthy people.  That is why the point has been made by Senator Healy Eames and others not to pull on support for education <Col N="31"/>and health.  The economy is the ordinary person, the small shopkeeper, the farmer, the small contractor and people who can only operate if they can access credit.  If the Government&rsquo;s thinking behind this morning&rsquo;s move is to ensure that Irish banks can draw down credit then that makes sense for them do it.</P>
        <P>I do not want anything made easy for the banks.  When we see the legislation I hope the charges will be penal.  The bank charges for money at present are very high.  I checked with a bank this morning and found that the APR for A level risk borrowers is 9% per year.  The level of charge is extraordinary.  In moving forward there is a need to distinguish between the market and the free market.  We need to see a market which is active but regulated.  As well as a penal charge we need to look at the boards.  I said earlier that I assume the Government will demand a place on the board.  I assume and propose that the boards of all the financial institutions which have had to be baled out will be dissolved.  If they had any sense of honour they would resign.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government needs to call for a dissolution of the boards, re-establish them and put back on them the good people.  We need to ensure that all bonuses, directors&rsquo; perks and &euro;1 million salaries per year are done away with immediately and the level of due diligence and oversight of the way the banks do their business is made clear.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2000 in the US makes chief financial officers of large companies subject to criminal prosecution and imprisonment in the event of their acting recklessly and carelessly.  Significantly, we do not have such legislation.  I have a vested interest in this as a member of the audit and accounts supervisory authority.  We need to ensure that the directive on global accountancy standards is brought forward quickly and that the quality assurance demands in Commissioner McCreevy&rsquo;s recent speeches are included in that.</P>
        <P>It is a fact that the Minister of State and I disagreed on an issue previously.  I ask him to recall his speech on credit unions some years back and to read it again.  He was not right.  There was a run on a number of credit unions a couple of weeks ago and they almost closed down until the Government included them in the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee.  That was the point we made.  We did anticipate that.  The Minister of State and I disagreed on it.  It was bound to happen at some stage and it happened on this occasion.  The Government&rsquo;s intervention on the credit unions has been hugely important but I want to know how it will work.  At that time we said it could happen in two ways, either as a separate stand-alone system of support and guarantee or parallel to the one for the banks.  It is an indication of what it is that can be done and what it is that can be anticipated.  That was anticipated.</P>
        <P>I began by praising the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance has known for almost ten years that there is a problem with the credit union legislation.  It  continues to promise to change it and to introduce a new Bill but it has not happened.  It is a classic example of why procrastination can be a problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to the September tax returns.  Those returns are important.  The October and November tax returns for the self-employed are much more important.  Every year at this time I telephone a couple of bosses of middle-size accountancy firms around the country and ask them what their returns will be.  They have always been accurate.  For what it is worth, I contacted two of them this week and asked what they expect their returns to be to the Exchequer from their self-employed people at the end of next month or early November.  They both said separately, without one knowing what the other had said, that there would be a 25% drop.  That is significant and a much greater drop than the Government expected.  I <Col N="32"/>hope it is not true but the indicators have been right previously.  There is much work to be done.  I look forward to seeing the legislation and discussing it later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a possibility that legislation will be introduced in the D&aacute;il today and this House will be called to examine it later.  As it is likely to be on the content of the issue that exercised many Members on the Order of Business and in the debate to date, I would not like to contribute much to that until we have that debate.  Given that we had been scheduled to debate the economy today, we should look at the wider applications and return to the issue of whatever Bill will be put before us later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was present on a radio programme last Sunday with Alan Dukes, the former leader of Fine Gael and Minister for Finance, who was introduced by the presenter as the last Minister for Finance who led this country into a recession.  He quickly corrected the presenter by saying he was the last Minister for Finance who led this country out of a recession.  I make that point because we can look at the same facts in different ways.  The nature of politics and particularly the issue of economics within politics is subject to many interpretations.</P>
        <P>As one who has been an Opposition spokesperson on finance since I was a Member of the other House and continue to hold that portfolio on behalf of my party, there are many things I have said since 2002 about which I do not take any joy on being proven correct.  Our economy has suffered as much as many other western economies by an unhealthy belief in bubble economics, that because things were good that they always would be good and that what underlay the particular economic success had a sustainability into the future.  We know now that is not the case and that a mythology has been built up not only here but elsewhere in the world about the nature of economics and the nature of wealth itself and we have to deal with the situation as it has transpired.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reality of where we stand internationally has still to be worked out.  Much of the Government&rsquo;s response is about dealing with many other governments and the day-to-day ramifications of what is happening elsewhere in the world.  The decision of the US House of Representatives not to agree to its rescue package, whatever its rights and wrongs, indicates not only a financial system that is gone awry and whose influence in the world is far too heavy and has implications for all of us in other countries that should be less than what they are, but shows a political system that, as of now, is not willing to face up to that reality.  I do not intend to get into political name-calling about the present political leadership of the US but it is clear that the lack of maturity in a country that has been a democracy since the late 1700s is impacting on the rest of us in a way that we need to take stock of and come up with our own common sense responses.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In regard to the specific issue exercising both Houses today, in a general way the approach being suggested is a more successful one.  The US is proposing to get out of the hole it has dug for itself by buying toxic debts, the worst of the bad debts that exist from their financial institutions, debts that I believe are irredeemable and will never have a value again.  The approach in the United Kingdom has been to buy each financial institution as and when those institutions get into difficulty, each of which carries a cumulative cost for their own taxpayers.  The approach in Belgium and the Netherlands has been to adopt a bit of both &mdash; giving guarantees to one of its largest banking groups, the Fortis group, while at the same time claiming a significant shareholding in that bank.  The Government&rsquo;s proposal &mdash; I do not believe it is a knee-jerk reaction &mdash; which people will see when legislation becomes available later today is one that has been given detailed consideration over a considerable time.  The Bill to be put before Members later is weighty and detailed.  It predates any changes that would have occurred as a result of falls in international stock markets and the <Col N="33"/>actions of the US House of Representatives.  On these grounds there must be recognition that an Irish solution to an international problem may be the one that actually works.  In the first instance we must communicate the necessity to restore confidence within the economic make-up of this country.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>One thing must be said about the economic growth generated in the past ten to 15 years.  Much of that growth may have been built on sand and in economic terms there may have been too much emphasis on the construction industry, but the accumulation of the wealth instilled a national confidence and an ability to achieve an economic independence we did not have before.  The difficulty in the present debate is the combination of factors which are largely global.  If we succumb to a discussion based on lack of self-belief, the hole we are in will get deeper and much of what we gained through becoming a wealthy nation will be lost.  I have an inherent belief in the ability of the Irish to achieve a valid society and economy.  We should think not only of how we will get out of the current situation but how we can plan for a future in which there still is a strong Irish economy.  It is stronger than many which are in difficulty and we should plan how it will become even stronger.  The challenge for all of us as legislators is how we can use that strength for the benefit of the people.</P>
        <P>Ireland has slipped into a technical recession.  Our economy has decreased in value over the past year by 1% and the likelihood is that with current factors that it might go to 2.5% by the end of the year.</P>

        <P>I appeal to all Members of this House to recognise that, given the global context of what we are involved in, we cannot rely on outside assistance to get us out of these difficulties.  There is a need for cohesion and a degree of bipartisanship.  I do not say that the Government should be above or beyond criticism regarding many economic decisions.  Where these relate to the very fabric of how we operate as an economy, however, there is a responsibility on all of us to put our best foot forward.  We must be honest with the people as to what we can achieve and how we can get to where we should be, under current circumstances.  I look forward to a more detailed debate this evening on whatever legislation will be presented to us.  It is an important first step in making that recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I was going to do the Minister of State a disservice by saying that was probably the worst speech I have heard from him in his time in either House but I believe that my colleague, the leader of the Green Party in this House, has just surpassed him.</P><Col N="34"/>
        <P>Senator Boyle, in fairness, is somebody who usually has a good commentary on finance even if I do not agree with him.  Seamus Heaney&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;Whatever you say, say nothing&rdquo; comes to mind, however, with the Senator&rsquo;s contribution of today.  Senator Boyle&rsquo;s speech was generic, had no specifics and did not really contribute very much.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation in which we find ourselves is unprecedented.  The Minister for Finance has acted because he had no choice.  He was backed into a corner.  Nobody has said this in the House but we know we are all thinking it.  The reality is that if the Minister did not act there are certain institutions in this country that would be in trouble.  It is as simple as that.  We have all heard the rumours and the discussion on this, and that is the situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle said that perhaps this Government has found an Irish solution to an international problem.  It is the &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; bit that worries me.  There were other options.  The Government has decided to go down this road.  It is a matter that concerns approximately &euro;400 billion and it is a huge gamble.  What if it does not work?</P>
        <P Just="Left">How did we get to this stage?  I wish to look into the area of regulation and we must do this very quickly.  We had a banking system that gave huge loans to developers across the country and lent sub-prime mortgages.  There was a real change in the area of credit cards and people were encouraged to change their type of banking in order to maximise their type of exposure.  It is as simple as that.  We all watched when the banks were with the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service answering questions.  I know I did because I was intrigued and one could not get into the room.</P>
        <P>I propose that we all read the transcripts and go to the chief executives and chairmen of the boards of all those banks, take out what they said a few months ago and ask them to comment on what they stated that day.  As far as I am concerned there are two options available.  The first is that those bankers were not telling the truth, the second is that they were not competent enough to know what was happening.  It is as simple as that.  Either scenario is terrible.</P>
        <P>All the institutions that are being bailed out should be brought in front of an emergency committee.  I refuse not to use that phrase &ldquo;bailed out&rdquo;.  Whether that committee should be the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is for the Houses to decide.  Perhaps it should be that committee.  The bank representatives should sit down and be interrogated again.  They should be told they have an opportunity to explain how we got to this scenario.  If we do not learn from this the possibilities will be much worse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What are we going to do concerning this bail-out?  How will the Government ensure that the Irish taxpayer is not exposed to a huge risk?  The difficulties are endemic and something must be done.  We must look seriously at the option of having someone sit on the boards of all these institutions.  That condition should be non-negotiable and I do not believe we should even debate it.  The Government should guarantee such an action.  If there is some excuse for not doing so then legislation should be introduced to cover it.</P>
        <P>There is a recent US model which deals with circumstances such as these, in respect of executive pay, and we should examine it.  In that model the executives of banks are not allowed to pay themselves enormous salaries of $1 million, etc.  It is outrageous that the banking sector can pursue strategies of the kind it has done over the past number of years, paying its members in this way.  In similar fashion, we must find out what sort of dividends the banks propose to pay in the coming two years under this deal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope that penal charges will be adopted for banks that are to come under this cover.  It is absolutely essential that the banking institutions do not feel that they are getting away with <Col N="35"/>some type of stroke.  What methods has the Government put in place to guarantee that the banking sector and those banks involved will reform properly, will change their ways and will not take undue risk and gamble under the terms of this bail-out?  We need answers to this today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is preposterous that we do not know this before we vote.  Are we postponing the inevitable?  We are guaranteeing deposits and I know that interbank lending is the other side of this issue.  What will happen if a bank goes under?</P>
        <P Just="Left">What will happen across Europe and the world when different governments implement their own methods of bailing out institutions?  What will happen, were the pitch to be levelled and a bank to fail?  What will be the result?  What will be the consequences for each taxpayer and member of the public, were one of the institutions that is being bailed out to go under?  These issues must be discussed in the coming hours as these are unprecedented times.</P>
        <P>As for the debate on the wider economy, Members have debated this issue a number of times.  I will not go into the statistics again, except to note the comments of my colleagues on the Government side, such as Senator Hanafin, who is present, or Senator MacSharry, who also speaks on the economy.  Each time they have spoken, they have predicted growth rates, unemployment levels etc. for this year that have been completely inaccurate, as the variables have risen or fallen.  Although Opposition Members have been accused of talking down the economy, as Ireland officially is in recession at present, I cannot be accused of talking it down any more.  Ireland is where I thought it would end up, were the Government&rsquo;s policies to be pursued.  Unfortunately, taxes are down by &euro;7 billion and unemployment has grown hugely to 285,000 people.</P>
        <P>The phrase today used about the toxic trio by the Fine Gael Party probably is a little unfair, because toxicity gives the impression that such people cannot be touched.  Unfortunately, the toxic trio must be touched because were they allowed to stay in their positions, Ireland would be left in a bad way.  I refer to a Taoiseach who was the Minister for Finance who turned around the economy in an unbelievable manner within a couple of years, a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who does not appear to have any meas on her portfolio and a Minister for Finance who only reacts when he must.  While huge international factors affect the economy, they are not solely responsible as many domestic reasons have caused Ireland to be in its current position.  Bringing forward the budget does not solve anything and in many ways is a political stroke.  I agree with previous speakers that an issue arises in respect of bringing forward the budget date to a time when the November tax returns and the self-employed tax returns, which it is likely will fall significantly, are not yet in.</P>
        <P>When the Government speaks on the economy, it often focuses exclusively on public finances.  From my perspective and that of the Labour Party, it is time to diversify from that practice, as it merely serves as a smoke screen from behind which attacks on the public service in particular are contemplated.  A plan is needed for economic recovery.  It is well-known that until 2001, Ireland had a growth-led economy and from 2001 onwards, a bubble in the construction industry was being built.  We were eating our own flesh and it was not sustainable.  We had an over-dependence that was interlinked with a loss of competitiveness and consequently, we must move on.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my party has put forward a number of proposals.  I note very few proposals have been put forward by the Government side.  However, I will mention a couple that are available in a document that has been issued by the Labour Party within the last 24 hours to <Col N="36"/>demonstrate it has been acting on this issue and to avoid accusations from the Government that it does not make such proposals.  The national development plan in its entirety must be reconsidered.  While it comprises many aspects, I suggest that if we are to develop the high technology and high value fields, the broadband infrastructure is one area that must be considered.  I have been speaking on this subject since I entered this House.  I worked in this sector and know people who have emigrated to the United States, who are known as silicon Paddies, because they cannot expand any further here.  Ireland has a problem with the development of small and medium enterprises into larger enterprises.  They cannot do so and are choking.  While the educational standards are present, the requisite investment techniques and infrastructure are lacking.</P>
        <P>Moreover, if improved value for money in respect of public spending is to be considered, although certain quangos should be examined, the issue of the tier of middle management that has been introduced by the Government also should be investigated.  If Ireland is to pursue the correct economic strategy, there must be diversification from, and stimulation and redirection of, the construction sector.  While it has concentrated on one sector, I argue it should be directed towards schools and a national insulation scheme as so doing will achieve several results.  There will have been investment in education for the future and future energy savings will be made.  Moreover, one will recover one third of what has been spent through taxation and in addition, approximately one fifth will be recovered through savings on social welfare payments to those who would be employed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I was proud of the manner in which Deputy Brian Lenihan acted so quickly as Minister for Finance to deal with what was an emerging major difficulty.  This was not the first time he has done so.  His first act as Minister was to ensure that the &euro;100,000 limit was extended to all account holders with the Irish banks.  His second act took place last night when he underpinned the Irish banks&rsquo; financial security and in so doing, underpinned the Irish economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fianna F&aacute;il has claimed successes in the past and in response, the Opposition often has ascribed to external factors the causes of the benefits accrued.  That being the case, the present problems have been visited upon us by what happened in respect of sub-prime lending in America, particularly when one considers the abuse of the system by senior financial houses in the United States.  Many of the questions that have arisen today pertained to what will be done regarding the pay of bankers and the highly paid staff.  What will be done in respect of the bonuses that were paid to people who sold on assets and securities that clearly were not worth what they stated?  The assets and securities in question amounted to trillions of dollars and have affected the world&rsquo;s financial security.  It is as simple as that.</P>
        <P>I occasionally receive an offer from Nigeria that is extremely hard to resist.  The offer is that if I provide my account number, untold sums of millions, which are held up somewhere at present, will be deposited within my account.  While I have not handed over my bank account details, had I so done I still would have lost less than these people who work in international financial services without accountability or proper regulation.  These are the people against whom the Minister rightly acted to protect the economy.  I refer to a catastrophic fall of 7% on Wall Street, the highest ever.  However, the Irish stock market, which reflects confidence, had rebounded by 7% by 4 p.m. today.  The Minister made the right choice.  It is time for accountability for those who sold the aforementioned ninja mortgages, that is, mortgages to people with no income, no job and no assets because white collar crime is not victimless and jobs will be, and are being lost.  Moreover, confidence and financial security also are being lost.</P><Col N="37"/>
        <P>This is not the first time we have been obliged to bail out a bank in Ireland.  I suggest that rather than bailing out the banks, they are being underpinned and people are being provided with a guarantee.  In fairness to the Irish banks, none of the sub-prime difficulties that have caused this crisis have been experienced here.  I mentioned 100% mortgages, which clearly were wrong, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  However, it was pointed out correctly that they represent only 5% of the total Irish mortgage book.  The Minister received advice last night from both the governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator that the correct action to take was that which he subsequently took to underpin the Irish financial markets and one can only state he did the right thing.</P>
        <P>The Minister will make his Budget Statement next month.  I am also certain that no matter how difficult that budget may be, the less well-off will be protected.  I am also confident those in the greatest need will find targeted supports in that budget, which is a consideration today.</P>
        <P>I suggest that in the forthcoming budget it is time to take a break from putting the 1% away for a rainy day.  I support my colleague, Senator MacSharry, in stating we should look to use that fund to promote the national development plan.  We must continue to be seen as an economy that will grow, invest and drive forward.</P>
        <P>This goes back to the plumber on his way to my house to fix the faucet.  If it takes him 40 minutes by road or whatever method of transport he is using to get there and 40 minutes back, I have to pay for it as it is his chargeable time.  We must ensure everybody in business in this country has proper roads and facilities, with networks such as the previously mentioned broadband, as well as all the proper facilities necessary for doing business.  We must continue with the national development plan, or in other words, finish the motorways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Government will take a positive view and there is room available.  We can modulate the surpluses and deficits when this situation passes.  We had previous crises after the dotcom bubble and 9/11, which we got through.  That two-year slump was within this decade and we will get through this slump as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Having looked after the less well-off and ensured business is ready again, we will be in prime position when world economies stabilise, as a free and open market, to benefit again.  That is where we continue to take credit, by putting in place advance factories, promotion abroad, a suitable tax regime and the training for people looking for employment.  In other words, we are still well placed for when this situation passes, as it will.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the US Congress will put through the necessary changes for the $700 billion package.  As has previously been stated, support does not come unconditionally.  There is a two-year limit on the guarantee given for Irish banks and the offer is not open-ended.</P>
        <P>We have had previous experience with ICI.  For many years, Irish banks subsequently paid a significant levy, far greater than any outlay initially undertaken by the Government.  Changes are certainly required in the Irish financial services sector and it must be regulated and improved.  Unfortunately, the main difficulties lie abroad and we have seen the dominoes fall.  The fact is that no Irish bank has been nationalised.  The Benelux countries have undertaken to fortify Fortis and two banks have been nationalised in England, namely, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock.  In the United States we have seen AIG supported by the Government, as well as another bank whose name I cannot remember.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding these events, no Irish bank has gone under.  The sound fundamentals spoken about to us in committee exist and the domino effect is not of our making.  We were told Fianna F&aacute;il needs to make decisions or changes but we made the necessary decisions today.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House on our first day back in the Seanad.  I hate to start by saying I was really disappointed with his speech and that he did not go into some of the detail of the guarantee being given by our taxpayers to the banks today.  This measure is unprecedented in our history and the biggest blank cheque we have ever written.  The Minister of State gave us no grace and the taxpayers of the country no information.  The detail is needed, although I realise we will have more information when the legislation is published.  It would have been nice to get something now and I believe the Minister of State has been briefed.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the Leader of the House did not grant us a lengthy question and answer period.  This was unparliamentary as answers are needed.  Why squash our allowed speaking time into ten minutes?  What is the Minister of State afraid of?  He must have the required detail.</P>
        <P>This morning we learned of the State&rsquo;s guarantee of &euro;400 billion for six Irish banking institutions.  Nobody is saying measures were not needed because, clearly, if one of the big banks such as AIB or Bank of Ireland went under, it would have destabilised and threatened the entire economy.  Essentially, the Government has now taken a domestic decision that represents enormous exposure for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I heard various Members on the opposite sides of the Houses today blame it all on the international picture but such an argument is not true.  Irish stocks are being hit badly for more reasons than what was occurring in the international arena because the market did not believe what the banks said.  The banks spoke the language indicating they were fine but we now know the action required from the Minister for Finance in the early hours of this morning was a much-needed rescue plan.  The Government acted because it had to.</P>
        <P>Bearing this in mind, we have relief at this point.  There are no free lunches and all loans will need to be repaid.  What I want to know on behalf of the taxpayer and Fine Gael are the terms and conditions of the State guarantee.  What has been achieved by the Government to provide a State guarantee amounting to &euro;400 billion to six of our national banking institutions?  This is huge, as it represents four times our national income in any year.  The US Congress is having difficulty putting through measures that would amount to just 6% of one year&rsquo;s national income.</P>
        <P>We must remember that it is ultimately the taxpayer who is providing the State guarantee to our banks.  These are private banks which have speculatively loaned money and now need to be rescued.  As I stated, we are all in agreement that some measures were needed but was this the best alternative at this time?</P>
        <P>What is in this measure for the taxpayer?  We must know the details of the insurance provided to the taxpayer and the types of fees which the banks will pay to the State for this guarantee.  These fees should be punitive and the people and I hope the State makes money from it by giving such a cast-iron guarantee to our banks.  The banks have been merciless with the people, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, when they decided to call in loans in the past.  Now their very customers &mdash; the taxpayers &mdash; are bailing them out.  Let us hope the State makes money.</P>
        <P>I heard figures from various economists today indicating we could make up to &euro;1 billion.  We need to know exactly what we are getting from the banks in the course of the next two years.  If hard cash is not available, it should be provided in the form of equity in the banks.</P>
        <P>Before the Government gave this guarantee, what information did it have on the assets and liabilities of these banks?  Are we covering bad loans that will never be recovered?  Was this <Col N="39"/>action a <i>carte blanche</i> without any <i>quid pro quo </i>for the taxpayer?  I would not need to ask the Minister of State these questions if the Government addressed the matter upfront today.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, tighter controls must be implemented by the financial and banking regulators to prevent future bad practice and poor lending practices to individual borrowers and businesses.  If there is not adequate regulation, there may be another false bottom in the economy, such as we have seen in the past two years.  The Government and the banks have been warned by the ESRI and numerous Irish-based economists but those warnings were not heeded.  The Government and the banks colluded to provide huge loans, in excess of 100%.  What about the home owner, the first-time buyer who bought in the past two years?  They are the ones who are really in trouble and are now experiencing negative equity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard talk from the CIF and from the Government today that measures would be included in the forthcoming budget regarding first-time buyers.  The best measure is to do nothing.  First-time buyers are bound to gain; they have no worries in a falling market.  To intervene would hamper that.  As has been advised by numerous economists, let the property market find its own levels.  For too long it has been over-inflated and over-heated.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report mentions public service pay and shows that &euro;1 billion has been spent on overtime, weekend pay and allowances.  What is the Government doing about that?  This is outrageous.  A sum of &euro;1 billion represents one seventh of the budget deficit.  Why is the Government letting this go on?  I spoke to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee today and requested an investigation into that.  Three quarters of that &mdash; &euro;712 million &mdash; has been incurred by the HSE, with four individuals between them receiving and amount of &euro;600,000.  One person received &euro;170,000, another received &euro;150,000, another &euro;140,000 and another &euro;120,000.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>We have seen global turmoil in the world economy and markets in recent days.  A couple of weeks ago we thought it was beginning to sort itself out.  When the American Government could not pass a budget to deal with the crisis in America, that put a lot of pressure on the European and Irish economies.  Our economy has huge inward investment from America and we depend substantially on that.  When America gets a cold, we get pneumonia.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important that we consider why we took the decision we did.  It was important to protect the ordinary small investor and person who had money on deposit in the banks.  We also had to support small businesses in the banking service.  All those businesses employ many people and if the credit situation were allowed to get worse we would find ourselves with huge unemployment queues at the dole office.   The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan and his <Col N="40"/>team took the right decision, and the right decision was taken for the guarantee.  We have now created a template for the rest of the European Union to follow.</P>
        <P>We did not go down the route of nationalisation.  Nationalisation would not have been the answer.  We have given the full support of the Irish Government to guarantee the banking situation in this country.  We have to examine at a commercial level the guarantee we have given, and how banks will pay for that guarantee.  I agree with some of the criticism here; they have not got all the answers.  I did not hear anybody coming up with solutions.  We can all play the blame game but that will not solve the problem.  We need people who are thinking outside the box, who have solutions.  The Government has taken action and we did not have to go to Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; to ask permission.</P>
        <P>We are elected to govern and lead, and that is what we are doing.  The solutions we have found support the banking system, which we will need to ensure we get out of our recession.  Without a strong banking system we would not have support to ride out a recession.  We need to stimulate the economy.  How are we going to do that?  We have an opportunity to do that in the forthcoming budget. Small businesses are the backbone of this country and they must be encouraged.   People who employ 50 people or more must be given something in this budget.  We need to produce new skills.  The skills we have now may not be relevant for the 21st century.  We need to develop the new green industry, which we have taken on board as part of our Government agreement.  The green issues are very important and there can be huge development and job creation in that area.  We must upgrade our housing and retrofit.  A &euro;9 billion development programme could happen.  The Labour Party has mentioned this and I agree with it because I raised the matter here about three months ago as part of support for the building industry.  We relied far too much on the housing industry, which was building more than 90,000 houses a year, which could not be sustained.  This is a sustainable programme under which we could reduce our oil and gas imports, for which we pay dearly. If we do not have properly insulated, double-glazed and retrofitted houses, we are letting the energy out through the roof.  It is as simple as that and it costs us money.</P>
        <P>The budget needs to address the reasons for the recession and the solutions must ensure we have people to take on the jobs when they are created.  I concur with the Minister that this is a time for housekeeping and that difficult decisions must be taken in the budget.  I believe people are willing to accept such decisions.  We will work to ensure the budget is fair and the elderly and less well-off do not suffer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senator Feargal Quinn when he comes to the House.</P>
        <P>This debate will pre-empt somewhat business scheduled for later in the evening.  It is difficult to discuss the economy in a general manner without referring to specific developments in the past few hours and days.  While I do not wish to be politically partisan because we all need to ensure the problem we face is resolved, it is utterly ridiculous for Senators to congratulate the Minister on his speedy response to the crisis and state it is part of the global problem.  That is not the case.</P>
        <P>For several months, the specific problem we face has been out of the control of the Minister and Government.  The stock markets, hedge funds and those unpopular people, the clever analysts of the world, spotted something pretty rotten in Ireland.  The Irish banking shares, to which previous speakers have referred, have been among the worst performers in the world this year and last year.  Those who analyse stocks of this type decided Irish banks were vastly <Col N="41"/>overvalued and did so at a time when we consistently boasted that we did not have the problems being experienced in global markets.  Bank chief executive after bank chief executive congratulated themselves and claimed Ireland did not have a sub-prime problem.  In doing so, they implied that the Irish banking system was somehow unique and safe and they had been clever enough not to get involved in sub-prime lending unlike the foolish, dreadful Americans, Brits and others.  That, they said, was where they problem lay.</P>
        <P>The world did not believe their claims because those who deal in shares and examine banks&rsquo; balance sheets and behaviour decided the problem here was worse than in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and elsewhere.  They shorted Irish bank stocks &mdash; a perfectly legitimate course of action &mdash; because they disliked the Irish story and the manner in which Irish banks were behaving and lending much more than they disliked the activities of many of the American banks.</P>
        <P>To take a specific case, we witnessed an unprecedented series of events on the Irish stock market yesterday.  We must remember that selling short was not allowed yesterday, which means one cannot blame short sellers or hedge funds.  International holders of funds dumped Irish stock at any price, despite their lack of exposure to the sub-prime problem.  The reason for this course of action was that they, like the Minister for Finance, anticipated a catastrophe in the Irish banking system because they knew we could not continue to survive and were as vulnerable as anyone else.  The Minister&rsquo;s response was to take the action he took today.</P>
        <P>After the collapse of talks in Congress yesterday, God knows what would have happened this morning, not just on the stock market.  We should not give a fiddler&rsquo;s about shareholders.  As the people who take the risk, they are the first on the firing line.  If they lose their money, it is tough, but they were not the only people who were set to respond.  It is abundantly clear that a big run on the banks as well as a major movement of funds would have taken place this morning.  People had already moved substantial funds &mdash; we are unable to learn what are the numbers because they are not being released &mdash; from the ordinary, supposedly secure banks to An Post, while those with larger sums of money had invested them in short-dated Government stocks, which are a safe haven.  They moved funds to places which were guaranteed.  There was a complete loss of confidence among consumers and international holders of Irish stocks and the entire investment community decided there was something wrong with Irish banks.</P>
        <P>What was wrong with Irish banks that the measure taken by the Government this morning became necessary?  The Government side is making a great virtue of the decision and arguing it will be a template for the world.  I heard on radio this morning that other countries will copy Ireland by taking the courageous step of guaranteeing all deposits.  We are taking this action because we have been forced to do so.  Without it, there would have been a run on one or other bank.  The decision to guarantee deposits of up to &euro;100,000 was not considered sufficient because those with deposits in excess of that threshold &mdash; the big punters &mdash; had decided to move their funds around.  For this reason, we responded with the measure announced this morning.</P>
        <P>What did people see that they did not like?  What was so special about the Irish banking system that was so bad?  The whole world is exposed to the paralysis in the banking community in terms of interbank lending.  Although the problem is common to all banks, no other banking system has lost the confidence of the international community to the same extent as the Irish banking system.  What gave rise to this loss of confidence?  What people saw and did not like was that we had gone bananas lending to property developers.  They saw the Irish property market tanking, the banks having taken an extraordinarily high proportion of their security <Col N="42"/>from property and refusing, initially at least, to regard these as bad debts.  Those who analyse bank balance sheets decided that if the banks wanted to tell big porkies about their bad debt provision and adjust their profits accordingly, they would sell their shares and make money.  No one believed the banks, as became clear two weeks ago when Bank of Ireland announced it was halving its dividend for the year.  While I am open to correction, I understand this has not happened since 1929 and never happened to an Irish bank.  The announcement was made because the bank was worried about its capital base and it had to preserve its capital.  The signal went out to the world that the banks in Ireland had behaved irresponsibly and were beginning to pay the price.</P>
        <P>What is important here is not to lay blame but to solve the problem today and ensure the Bill presented tonight includes guarantees that the Financial Regulator is put in irons and the Government insists he enforces much stricter lending criteria.  The regulator, as I stated on the Order of Business, should be fired because he allowed these developments to take place.  The business of lending to a small number of property developers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and huge tax breaks being given to them is insane and unique to Ireland.  The Financial Regulator knew this was happening, that certain banks were lending huge sums of money to a small number of people who were taking reckless decisions, encouraged by a Government that was looking after them with tax breaks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just come from a Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting where the Minister for Finance brought us up to date on the decision made during the night.  He stressed this decision was to protect the life blood of our economy.  It is not about protecting the management of the banks and the chief executives; it is about keeping our economy moving and sending a message around the world that we are in business.  He told us we have received congratulations from the Federal Republic of Germany complimenting us as a small country on making a swift decision.  This decision is not about protecting the big shots running the banks but about keeping the show on the road.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether Senator Ross heard Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme last week, but I found it frightening as I listened to it.  Such was the  irresponsibility shown by Joe Duffy that I wanted to run out to the bank and withdraw the little money I have in it because I was so afraid by what I heard.  Senator Ross may not realise that the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Allow Senator White to continue without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not.  I wish to address a number of points.  The message that was signalled by the decision today is important because many Irish people are panic-stricken and afraid of what is happening in the country.  Therefore, this was a first-class decision, intended not to protect the banks but to maintain our economy.</P>
        <P>As an entrepreneur, business person and co-founder of Lir Chocolates, I record that this recession in Ireland and globally should serve as a wake up call to our dependence on the people and their companies who export goods and services or compete with imports on our domestic market.  They are the real anchors of our economy and the source of the purchasing power which has sustained the building boom and the expansion of new shopping centres <Col N="43"/>throughout this island.  We were mesmerised by the boom in consumer spending, much of it fuelled by credit cards, borrowing and by the massive profits to be made on a property deal.  If one could sell a quarter of an acre for &euro;250,000, why would one be a fool and try to make a living by going down the hard road of starting a business or manufacturing or developing a new service for export.  I have been there and done that.  I know the reality of what is involved.  Connie Doody, myself and all our staff have worked 24-seven for 16 years to sustain our company.  It sticks in our guts that people could make fortunes over the sale of a quarter of an acre of land.</P>
        <P>We have become complacent over the basic fact that at the end of the day our massive imports and foreign holidays must be balanced by our exports of goods and services.  I have said that not today nor yesterday but previously in this House.  One indicator of that complacency and failure to distinguish the crucial economic role of our exporters was manifested in local authorities in Dublin and elsewhere imposing the same development levies on the manufacturer and exporter as on the builder of a shopping centre or multi-storey car park &mdash; the same levies were imposed when they were not producing anything.  Without the exporters we would not have the purchasing power to buy the dazzling goods, mainly imports in those same shopping centres, or to pay the expensive charges in the multi-storey car parks.</P>
        <P>That great Irish man, Dr. TK Whitaker, when speaking recently on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the occasion of 50th anniversary of the publication of the ground-breaking economic development plan, which he masterminded, said that restoring Ireland&rsquo;s trading competitiveness was the number one priority.  I have said that over the years here, but nobody was listening.  When the economy was booming, the steady erosion of our competitiveness went largely unheeded.  Now that we have to fight our way out of a recession and global crisis, in addition to restoring stability to our public finances, there is no more urgent priority than restoring competitiveness in our economy in order that our manufacturing and trading companies can compete and our tourism industry can recover.</P>
        <P>All the indicators of the loss of competitiveness have been charted in unambiguous terms by the National Competitiveness Council and Forf&aacute;s year after year.  Some of the reality checks, as spelt out in the Forf&aacute;s annual report for 2007, include the following conclusions.  General price levels here are among the highest in the EU 15 and this situation is worsening.  Labour costs are increasing across a range of sectors at a rate well above the EU average.  Non-pay costs, including renting or buying property, and professional services such as legal and accounting services are also more expensive in Ireland.  I had to obtain advice on two ocassions from legal companies here which are below the radar and are not seen as <i>b&ecirc;tes noir</i>.  The fees legal companies charge are immoral.  There is no accountability.  They can charge what they like and they are not on the radar as villains of this piece.  These are fairly startling conclusions by official bodies not given to hyperbole and I am acutely aware of how difficult it is for exporting companies, such as Lir Chocolates, to succeed in the face of such handicaps.</P>
        <P>The recent national pay agreement, agreed in principle, marked some recognition of the need to restore our competitiveness, but I believe there should be a pay freeze across the board for everybody for the next two years.  We need a pay freeze for the next 24 months to get back to a sense of reality.</P>
        <P>We are aware of the energy the Government is putting into preparing the budget.  I am thrilled and proud of my Government for the decision it made during the night to protect the banking system.  I am proud and delighted a decision was made.  Senator Quinn was not here when I began my contribution but I said this decision is not to protect the big-shots who run <Col N="44"/>the banks or the managers; it is to keep our economy on the move and to show the world that we are still in business.</P>
        <P>After the budget on 14 October I would like the Government to devote similar energy and focus to restoring competitiveness and to make it realistic for people to compete internationally.  The small and medium size businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy, must be able to compete internationally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate even though it must be conceded that the developments in the past 24 hours have shifted the debate from a broader economic statement to a preview of the legislation the Government is due to bring forward in the next hour or two and the impact of that legislation.  I presume we will have an opportunity in the coming hours to speak on that matter and, therefore, I will try to confine my remarks, within reason, to the economic debate.  This is a debate we urgently need and it would have been helpful if we could have had it a number of weeks ago. </P>
        <P>While I am pleased the Government decided to bring forward the budget by some weeks it may be just a political signal, although I hope it becomes a strong economic signal.  We must concede that nobody should be surprised by the stark economic figures and facts that face us currently.  It was flagged in advance by many commentators &mdash; some economic, some political &mdash; and notwithstanding what Government sources would now like to pretend, it is far removed from being an entirely international crisis.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is approximately 18 months since we commenced in full the debate about the 2007 general election campaign.  There was a mantra coming from Government sources, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il sources, at that time that all economic wealth and job creation stemmed from Fianna F&aacute;il, that it was not an international boom but a domestic one brought about, maintained and retained by the economic policies pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments for the past ten or 15 years. The idea was presented that the economy would not be in safe hands if the Opposition took hold of the chains of Government and that Fianna F&aacute;il alone could somehow lead the country forward.  Now, however, the economic indicators have changed dramatically and there has been a sharp increase in unemployment, with between 40,000 and 50,000 people losing their jobs during the past seven to eight months.  We are now being informed that the origins of the current crisis are international and in no way domestic.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>We must face facts and consider what we can do to reverse the trend and ensure a return to real growth.  The end of the property boom was flagged in advance by many people.  However, the Government chose to ignore the signals and the public &mdash; of which we are all members &mdash; took the soft option.  From a political perspective, no one decided to cry wolf.  As a result, we find ourselves in the current situation.</P>
        <P>With regard to how we should move forward, competitiveness and the control of inflation must be placed at the top of the agenda and genuine public service reform &mdash; not the type of fire brigade action proposed by certain commentators &mdash; must be considered.  Senator Mary White made a valid point in respect of wage restraint.  No one favours such restraint.  Members are public servants and, like everyone else, we want our salaries to increase.  However, we must ask whether we can afford to pay such increases at present.  If it is a case of job creation and employment retention versus wage increases, we must err very much on the side of wage restraint.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>I appreciate that in moving forward with the social partnership process that has operated for the past 20 years, there was pressure on the Government and employers to strike a deal.  I am concerned that some aspects of that deal may be unaffordable and that the so-called benefits relating to it might be offset by job losses.  Retaining existing employment and creating new jobs must be placed at the top of the agenda.  In the context of job creation, Ireland is obliged to compete in the wider international market.  I refer here not only to our EU partners but also to the emerging countries of eastern Europe, nations in the Middle East and far eastern states such as China and India.  We must maintain a competitive economy and ensure we tread very carefully regarding wage costs, charges, levies, etc.  I am concerned that what passes for a partnership deal may not be in the best interests of the country at present.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers referred to the end of the property boom.  Senator Healy Eames made a valid point to the effect that introducing new measures to boost the housing market may result in a continuation of what happened for far too long, namely, house price increases.  She also stated that perhaps the best thing we might do, especially in respect of those trying to get on to the property ladder, might be not to intervene further in the property market.  Prices are dropping and people who took out mortgages between three to five years ago are concerned and disappointed.  For new entrants trying to get on to the property ladder, however, the fall in house prices is a welcome development.  We must be cautious with regard to intervention.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance will deliver his Budget Statement in two weeks&rsquo; time and I hope he will place competitiveness and the control of inflation at the top of the agenda. During the past two to three months, when it was finally recognised that the Government was facing serious economic difficulties and that major shortfalls were occurring, many of the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues indicated that savings would be made across Departments.  I hope such savings can be made from an administrative perspective.  If these savings can now be made so readily and easily, it is disappointing that no one considered making them one, two or three years ago.  Everyone, particularly the Government, became carried away with the idea that the boom years would continue.</P>
        <P>Spending across Departments increased dramatically in recent years.  There is no doubt that the value of money which should have been achieved was not forthcoming.  If the current downturn in the economy forces us to face reality, we may perhaps benefit from it in the long term.  If it puts competitiveness and value for taxpayers&rsquo; money at the top of the agenda, that would be a welcome development.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the political rumours doing the rounds, I hope the Minister for Finance will not introduce taxation increases.  Evidence from the 1970s and 1980s shows that such increases do not help to create jobs or produce a winning economic formula.  Taxation levels must remain as they stand or, if possible, they should be reduced.  We should also reduce levies and charges to make industry competitive and allow taxpayers to spend their money.</P>
        <P>We will be rehearsing this debate in two weeks&rsquo; time in the aftermath of the budget.  I look forward to the debate that will take place later this evening, at which point we will gain a greater understanding of what the Government&rsquo;s proposals, announced early this morning, will mean for taxpayers and the financial institutions.  During the past five or six years, particularly when one considers the amount of money available to it, the Government lost the plot in economic terms.  We are now suffering the consequences of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Last night, I prepared a script which I intended to deliver today and which contained proposals which were identical to those <Col N="46"/>announced by the Minister for Finance at 7.10 a.m.  I will jettison my script, therefore, and deliver it during the debate that is due to take place later this evening.</P>
        <P>We must consider the challenges we face and the direction our economy should take.  Last month, I visited Vietnam for the first time.  The history of that country is very interesting.  The Vietnamese fought a war against the French which began in 1946 and which ended shortly after the siege of Dien Bien Phu in 1954.  Following this conflict, the country was divided.  The north Vietnamese then fought another war against the Americans, which finally came to an end after 20 years or so in 1975.  Since then, Vietnam has been a communist state.  From 1975 to 1997, this proved to be a disaster.  The economy was dead and the country remained poor.  As a result of their objectives, the Vietnamese did not appear able to get anything off the ground.  Some 11 years ago, however, the Vietnamese recognised the benefit of maintaining their communist state and also embracing the notion of the market economy.  Vietnam&rsquo;s economy is now booming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The enthusiasm and entrepreneurship displayed by the people there and the way the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product is booming provides evidence that despite the judgment of previous Vietnamese governments and against the backdrop of all the lives lost in the two conflicts to which I refer, the market economy is working.  I come from a business background and the Minister of State can understand why I might believe in the market economy.  My belief in such an economy was strengthened no end by my visit to Vietnam.</P>
        <P>We must take a positive approach to the position in which we find ourselves and rely on the market economy.  I thank God the partnership deal was agreed last month.  However, I read a report last week which indicated that even though there is a guarantee of a pay rise of a certain amount over a certain number of months, a large number of companies will inform their employees and the unions that they will not be able to honour that pay rise without letting staff go.  People will be obliged to make a decision.  If they want to receive their increases, then 10% fewer individuals will be in employment.  People will be obliged to make their decision.  The balance of those will be made on the basis of economics because it will be a market economy.  In many cases, the unions and their members will decide they would prefer not to accept that increase if it would maintain jobs and this brings us to the one area which is so important and which was touched on by Senator Mary White, namely, competitiveness.  We must maintain competitiveness if we are to keep this economy going.</P>
        <P>Looking back at what happened in the past, I was very impressed by Frances Ruane who wrote an article a couple of weeks ago in which she talked about TK Whitaker, what happened in 1958 and what was achieved.  TK Whitaker also recognised that success would not be protectionism.  Let us ensure we look in a very positive light at how we succeed in this area.</P>
        <P>There was a real crisis in 1987 and the country came together.  I was delighted the then Opposition said that if it was the right thing to do, it would support it, and I heard some sounds of that today.  Senator MacSharry is in the House today and his father was entrusted with responsibility of cutting the costs of running this country.  That was done very quickly.  I gather that at the time, the Taoiseach of the day, Charles Haughey, said to his Ministers not to bother coming back to him if they did not come back with anything less than a 10% cut in their expenses and in the costs of running their Departments.  For the first time, people believed that would work.  What happened in 1987 under the former Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, was that within a very short period, the economy began to turn because we took very tough decisions.  Those sorts of decisions will have to be made once again.  We will have to do something about ensuring we cut our costs.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>I was delighted to read the headline words of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, today.  He said that when the upturn comes, we must be ready.  Let us take that into account.  Whatever costs we cut, let us ensure that in doing so, we recognise the economy will turn reasonably soon and that we should be ready for that.  However, let us ensure we do not cut costs in the very areas on which we will have to rely in the future, especially in the area of education.</P>
        <P>I will not go in the direction in which I heard so many others go.  I listened to a politician on radio the other day who had come in to solve the problems of the economy but who continued to criticise what happened in the past ten years.  The person was asked over and over what he or she would do now but refused to answer the question.  There are measures we can and must take.</P>
        <P>I was very impressed by the debate between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.  Senator McCain made a mistake when he talked about Ireland having an 11% corporation tax.  It was a slip-up as he should have said 12.5%.  However, I was delighted he made it because I thought perhaps this is very time to consider something like that which would attract the world&rsquo;s attention.  A few moments ago, Senator Paul Bradford talked about not increasing tax.  I am talking about increasing the tax take by reducing the tax percentage.  This is the very time to do something dramatic like that.  We are not talking about less money but about more money for a lower percentage.  Sums would have to be done but it is an area to which some consideration could be given.</P>
        <P>This is the very time to be courageous and to have a belief in the future and to say we can do something about it.  I did not know until the other day that in 1929 after the Wall Street crash, the Rockefeller family decided it was the time to build the Rockefeller Center in the centre of New York.  It did so because it said it was a time to encourage and show it had a belief in the future.  They are the sorts of steps we should take now.</P>
        <P>When we come to make decisions in the next two weeks, let us ensure we make decisions which take the long term into account and not only the short term.  We have the ability to borrow now and we may have to do so but we should not let it spiral as it did many years ago.  I believe there is a consensus across the board and that the Opposition and Government will support the right decisions, as was done with the Tallaght strategy back in 1987.  Let us ensure we take the steps which take the long term approach and that we do so from a positive point of view rather than one of doom and gloom.  This is the time to look forward to the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is taking place in the face of great financial turbulence.  I was going to say it was unprecedented but if one goes back to the 1929 Wall Street crash and the subsequent years, I am sure there is a precedent there.  The real challenge is to ensure we do not end up in the situation in which they ended up.</P>
        <P>This time the problems in America are mirrored across the world, including in Europe, because of the globalised economy.  It raises serious questions for regulatory authorities and for central banks across the globe.  There were so many innovative but, none the less, artificial financial products on the market and the concept of some of those products was mind-boggling.  It is easy to say that with the benefit of hindsight but one would have expected the expertise within central banks and regulatory authorities at least to have anticipated some of the difficulties now being encountered.  Having said that, it is a question for another day because the issue, as I see it, is about containment and the restoration of the banking sector.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance on the initiatives taken.  They are courageous and are not without creating certain exposure and risk but they are essential.  The Minister was right to follow the lead of Britain and the United States in respect of banning <Col N="48"/>hedge funds and short selling because that was bringing pressure on an already strained marketplace.  Guaranteeing deposits was an essential measure and the manner and speed with which he did so was good.</P>
        <P>I heard the Opposition spokesman on finance speak today and it is good there was liaison between the Opposition and the Government, a point to which I will return.  In a time of serious challenge to the State, it is very important that politicians can show some unity of purpose, which is being done.</P>
        <P>There are a number of broad issues, including the banking and construction sectors.  The construction sector is in the middle of this problem internationally.  The too easy availability of credit and low interest rates over a long period perhaps over-primed the construction sector and caused exposure in that area.  There is a need for people to be able to access property.  Historically, this country has had a high rate of home ownership of which we can be justifiably proud.  It compares favourably with that in the rest of the world.  With falling prices, we should try to marry the need for property with the over-supply of it because for as long as over-supply remains, it will be a serious drag not only on the construction industry but on the economy generally.  Economists have said &mdash; I am sure they are correct &mdash; that in doing that, we must ensure we do not artificially buttress property prices because that would only prolong the time before we return to growth.</P>
        <P>Another area at which we must look is public expenditure, which there is no avoiding.  We have seen significant growth in public expenditure in the past decade.  I have worked most of my life in the private sector.  At a time of plenty, the ship tends not to be trimmed as tightly as it might otherwise be and, no doubt, areas of fat build up within the system.  This happens in the private sector as well and is not unique to the public sector.  In the private sector, however, competition ultimately tends to ensure that if this is not trimmed and reined in, business will be lost.  This triggers attention to it.</P>
        <P>There are also areas of waste and wasteful and unnecessary expenditure.  We are in a position now where we are forced to look at reducing current public expenditure by 10% to 20%.  This cannot be achieved painlessly.  It will be difficult to achieve this, but we will not have the receipts in the short term and may not have them in the medium term.  In this regard, I welcome the serious attention this area is getting from the Cabinet, Departments and our Civil Service. In the past our Civil Service structure was very good at meeting the challenges and laying the foundations for the success we enjoyed over the past decade or more.</P>
        <P>I see this as a defining moment for our economic well-being and a defining moment for politicians, which brings me back to a point I made earlier about unity of purpose.  Being a small island, we have a very open economy and are very exposed.  We must send an important signal, therefore, that there is unity of purpose among the political establishment.  I do not wish to make undue comment on the other House, but l heard much negative criticism of the debate there last week due to the lack of quality debate and the partisanship shown.  This contrasts with the approach taken on the issue by the Opposition spokesman last night and today.  It behoves the Government and all parties to knuckle down and face the issue.  They must realise they face a challenge that is more serious than their well-being as parties and work together.  The people will detect whether they work together in unity and succeed.  People are concerned about their economic future, jobs and everything else and the last thing they want to see is partisan politics being played out.  What happened in Congress last night was an example of what should not happen.</P><Col N="49"/>
        <P>We need close liaison, on a formal basis, between the central banks of the EU member states and the European Central Bank.  The challenges we face require a cohesive approach that will signal to the market and speculators that a serious and determined approach is being taken to ensure we weather this crisis in a way that will lay the platform for future growth in each member state.</P>
        <P>The situation also poses a challenge in respect of the social partners.  They need to realise that unemployment will, inevitably, increase.  The question is to what extent and how this will affect union members.  It is important therefore that the social partnership structure shows some flexibility as the situation changes month by month or week by week.  There should be some disposition among both the private and public sector to extending the pay pause should the need arise in the national interest.  If everyone keeps their eye on the ball, we will come through this situation and look back on it in a few years as a time of great difficulty but a time when we got back to some of the more important fundamentals of the economic life of the State and a time when we put the country on a better footing for the next one or two decades.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  We are, however, having it in somewhat unreal circumstances in so far as the Minister of State had to come in and give a presentation that did not address what is happening today and was unable to address the decision that has been taken by Government or go into detail on the reasons for it because the legislation is being published this evening.  We do not have the details of the legislation and are not addressing the crisis of the day and the decision apparently taken at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. last night.  It was not necessarily a brave decision but was an essential one forced on the Government by the potential of catastrophic circumstances and a catastrophe in our banking sector.  If our banking sector collapsed, that would have a catastrophic effect on our economy and result in the appalling outcome of hundreds of thousands of unemployed people.</P>
        <P>We do not know if the decision the Government has made will be the solution or will deal with the situation.  The amount in question, &euro;400 billion, is a significant sum and we must hope it will inspire confidence.  Confidence is a moveable feast in the economy and in banking and is affected by a range of factors.  We do not know by what factors confidence in the Irish economy will be affected but we must hope this decision will give the kind of confidence that will lead to economic growth.</P>
        <P>I wish the Government had listened to many of the suggestions made by Fine Gael over the years.  I want to put to bed the suggestion we did not offer alternatives nor suggest a range of initiatives that would be positive for the economy.  We did so on numerous occasions.  I have heard calls today for support from the Opposition.  We will be responsible in the current situation.  We want to support our economy and do not want to see it collapse because of the situation in which the banks find themselves.  We will give our support in a guarded way, however, and will raise the key questions that need to be raised.</P>
        <P>Many questions arise from the Government&rsquo;s decision, not least of which is what happens to the banks not included in the agreement?  What impact will the decision have on Ulster Bank and the other banks?  Will the Minister of State address that issue and explain how the Government intends to deal with it?  It is a key issue.  Many people are employed in those banks and confidence in them must be maintained.  How will that be done?  Will the agreement or decision the Government intends to put forward in legislation tonight be compliant with EU competition law?  There are serious questions in that regard.  What will be the response of the EU to the decision that has been made?  What is the total exposure to the Irish taxpayer as a result of the guarantee to the banks?</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>The &euro;400 billion amounts to approximately &euro;250,000 per citizen of an underwrite to the banks.  People are very concerned about this and these figures are extraordinary to the ordinary man or woman in the street.  As far as they are concerned, they see a banking sector which has behaved disgracefully in many instances now being underwritten.  We all understand the reason for this; it is essential for our economy.  Make no mistake, however, about what ordinary people think about it when they see their sons or daughters landed with a 30 or 40-year mortgage on property bought at an inflated price and who are now in negative equity.  They will not feel very happy about this underwritten guarantee to the banks.  We can understand the reason they would not be happy.  They may understand the greater good that may come out of it but they certainly will be sceptical when they see the amounts bankers were paying themselves, the rewards that were given and the type of lending and trading in derivatives that took place.  There is an understanding that we must keep our economy going and this seems to be the price to pay.  However, it is a high price for Irish taxpayers who are entitled to ask what returns they will get from the arrangement.</P>
        <P>It is crucial for us to know the regulations and financial oversight which will be put in place because it is clear, as speakers on the Government side have acknowledged, that the oversight and regulatory regime has failed completely.  The people who had responsibility for this ought to be called to account.  What new arrangements will be put into place and what guarantees will the Government receive?  What sort of monitoring will be conducted on behalf of taxpayers subsequent to their underwriting of this enormous sum of deposits?  These are key questions.  There is an onus on the banks to ensure their behaviour is prudent, measured and considered.  Reckless borrowing and derivative trading must become a creature of the past.  How will taxpayers be protected?</P>
        <P>I spoke on the Order of Business about a meeting in St. Bridget&rsquo;s school, Palmerstown, which I attended along with hundreds of parents.  For the past ten years, this school has sought funds for a refurbishment and an extension.  The pupils attend the school in the most appalling conditions imaginable.  Thus far, &euro;300,000 has been spent on prefabs and &euro;350,000 on architectural fees for the planning application.  The building is ready for redevelopment and the children have moved into the prefabs.  It is difficult to believe that any child in this country must endure the sort of conditions experienced by St. Bridget&rsquo;s pupils, yet the school did not receive funding yesterday.  There has been no clarity as to why that school was left out whereas 15 others were given money for refurbishment.  I raise the issue in the context of this economic debate because I ask what impact the bail-out will have on the services we want to provide in our schools and hospitals.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael made a variety of suggestions on how this Government ought to have behaved over recent years, which we published in a document entitled Recovery through Reform.  Senator MacSharry stated earlier that we have not put forward alternatives, an accusation which I want to bury.</P>

	<P>Deputy Bruton has been putting forward alternatives for several years.  He has addressed repeatedly the issues of reform of the public sector and evaluation of public private partnership projects.  He has spoken about the need to save money by limiting quangos.  We have proposed a reduction in the rate of VAT from 13.5% to 12.5% to stimulate the building and tourism sectors.  We have advocated the publication of a credible anti-inflation strategy.  We have discussed the kind of funding needed for next generation broadband.  We <Col N="51"/>have made suggestion after suggestion to the Government but it has not listened.  It has introduced inflationary budgets, including the most recent one, which have meant that the public finances are out of kilter.  No money was saved for the rainy day we are now experiencing.  We pointed out what needed to be done and we find today that the Government is looking to us for support.  Fine Gael will be constructive in its support but will certainly be asking the questions I have outlined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>We are living in unusual and unpredictable times.  We all recognise that conditions have changed utterly.  The global turbulence we are experiencing and the statements by legislators, economists and leaders in various fields indicate an uncharted and difficult future.</P>
        <P>For a considerable period there was tremendous optimism in the Irish economy.  Over the past decade, this great country has witnessed unprecedented improvements in quality of life and economic activity.  Activity and progress touched every home and all parts of the country.  Everyone enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity.  Hardly a family or a region missed Ireland&rsquo;s economic boom.  There were success stories, achievements, confidence and optimism at every level.  Ireland boxed above its weight on the international stage.</P>
        <P>Too much attention is being devoted to diagnoses of our economy and the international currency crisis.  The sad message coming from certain quarters is that the lights have gone out and there is doom and gloom everywhere.  We are expected to knuckle down, buckle up and enter hibernation.  There is too much detailed analysis of the international and Irish currency and stock market difficulties by Members of this House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, will be able to provide an appropriate explanation of the analysis of various experts in these fields, so the energy of this House should be focused on what we can influence and on promoting economic and financial activity rather than on criticism of fragmented thinking with no real attempt to confront the issue or make positive suggestions on restoring our former confidence.</P>
        <P>Do players remain in whom we can have confidence?  I have confidence in those who have attracted foreign direct investment to this island in the past, such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the other structures which we have put in place to ensure success in very competitive markets.  I also have faith in Government policy regarding low wages, the low cost, knowledge-based economy and investments in infrastructure.  The Minister of State might indicate for us the additional moneys which will be spent in 2009 on projects such as Transport 21 and the national development plan.  I still have confidence in the structures and players, not only in the State and semi-State sector but also in the innovative private sector.  This is the team which has been so successful for such a prolonged period, when other players who were competing strongly with us were unable to reach our level.  Unless the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, has some news of which I am not aware, or information on some great change coming down the track &mdash; that the team is gone, the players are gone and it is time to put out the lights &mdash; I still have strong confidence and belief in the capacity of the people.</P>
        <P>I have listened with interest to people talking about irresponsible bankers and 100% loans.  I question the value of sending out this message, especially in the global telecommunications age in which we live.  People who are considering investing in Ireland may pick up these messages and conclude there is a problem here.  If there were asset tests on certain projects, we might not like the answers, but if we keep to our game plan, we will be able to get from A to Z and obtain the results we had intended to achieve at the outset.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>In July of this year I approached the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to obtain the 2007 report on the financial stability of the Irish banking sector.  The reference is 2008/4313.  I wish to express my gratitude to the staff of this service, particularly Liam Morris, who carried out much of the work.  He indicated to me that the paper would provide an overview of the Irish banking industry, describe the economic impact of the sector and the financial soundness of the industry, and assess the likely impact of the global credit crunch on the sector.  The paper outlines the structure of the Irish banking system, which is made up of two distinct groups: banks that focus on the domestic economy and those that focus on international financial services.  I will not go through the paper in great detail, but I wonder how many minutes I have left.</P>

	<P>There are approximately 500 banks on the register of credit institutions.  In recent years the Irish banking sector has enjoyed great competition, with approximately 60 institutions operating in the retail banking market.  I will cut to the chase.  The most significant economic impact of the sector is that it provides the capital necessary for business to function and to invest for expansion.  I express my appreciation to the banking sector for all it has done in assisting the economy in recent years, the benefits of which we have all enjoyed.</P>
        <P>Each year the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland publishes the financial stability report, which is an assessment of financial stability in the domestic financial year.  The conclusion of the CBFSAI at the end of 2007 was that &ldquo;the Irish financial system&rsquo;s shock absorption capacity remains robust and the system is well placed to cope with emerging issues&rdquo;.  The CBFSAI monitors a series of financial soundness indicators, FSIs, of the banking system.  These are used to measure the sensitivity to market risks of Irish banks, along with their asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity and earnings and profitability.  Based on the FSIs, the risk-based capital ratios used to assess the solvency of Irish banks are above all benchmark levels.  Furthermore, non-performing loans and bad debts represent less than 1% of total loans.</P>
        <P>There is one figure I will put on the record, because time and again people have mentioned irresponsible bankers giving 100% loans.  There is no doubt there are 100% loans.  However, this research paper states that only 2% of mortgages in the mortgage book were at loan-to-value ratios of over 92%&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We speak quickly in Cork.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House.  The economy deserves to be the primary focus of our debate today, given what has happened in recent times.  However, the Government has lost sight of the fact that people matter.  People are affected by mismanagement and bad government.  That is what has happened.  We had a debate about the banking service when I tabled matter on the Adjournment about Bank of Ireland.  We are now in a state of economic turbulence and this Government, including the Members on the Government side, conveniently blame Wall Street and the global crisis.  What the Minister of State forgets is that Main Street meets Wall Street in the home of every single Irish citizen.  There are families who are struggling.  These are not political words; it is the reality.</P>
        <P>While out canvassing last night in Ballyphehane in Cork, I met people who were worried, anxious, struggling, concerned and making choices.  I am not talking about choices about foreign holidays but about heating, school uniforms and books and so on.  These are ordinary people.  Let me put it in context for the Minister of State.  A woman came to me last week who had an adult child who was paralysed and required full-time care.  This woman was told by a bureaucrat to restrict her child to four nappies and control her incontinence.  That is not the fault of Wall Street or the banking sector but of the Government the Minister of State represents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The taxpayers have propelled us into an economic spiral of success under the Celtic tiger, but they are not being rewarded.  Life is cyclical.  As the old clich&eacute; goes, the wheel comes full circle.  A boom is followed by a recession.  However, the Government did not plan for a rainy day.  It squandered money on electronic voting machines and crazy plans for Abbotstown.  The tent at the Galway races is the epitome of where it has gone wrong.  People are affected by the Government&rsquo;s inability to govern and by the waste of money on decentralisation.</P>
        <P>I wish to address a fundamental point about the national development plan that the Minister of State made in his speech.  I agree that infrastructural provision is crucial for our country.  My question is about the lack of Government initiative with regard to the Cork docklands.  Will the Government give a commitment to the people of Cork that it will fulfil the promises it made in 1997, 2002 and 2007 to the people of Cork regarding funding for bridges and tax incentives?  Can it deliver to the people of Cork, or will Cork be a victim of mismanagement and reckless government?  The people of Cork deserve to be given an answer tonight.  I am here as an ordinary person representing the people of Cork.  I am not a shareholder.  I do not have millions in banks.  We need answers and we need leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that a motion was tabled in the Lower House last week calling for an urgent debate on the economy and it was rubbished by the Government and dismissed out of hand by the Taoiseach as playing games.  Vindication of the urgency of a debate on the economy has been provided in the past 24 hours.  We all know and those on the Opposition side of the House accept that it was necessary for the Government to act.  All we are dealing with here are the safeguards required in terms of taxpayers&rsquo; money, oversight, <Col N="54"/>proper regulation of the banks and ensuring that with this guarantee the banks do not attempt to double their debts and take risks at taxpayers&rsquo; expense.  They are all serious issues.  This is not to cramp the Government&rsquo;s approach in dealing with a crisis.</P>
        <P>However, it highlights another issue that is symptomatic of the Government&rsquo;s approach on economic policy &mdash; its inaction, reaction and lack of ideas.  The series of measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are exactly the same ideas proposed by Deputy Bruton to cancel ministerial and higher public service pay rises, cut the number of Ministers of State, announce a list of agencies to be rationalised and release up to &euro;400 million from the failed decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>The next measure was the increase of the deposit account guarantee to &euro;100,000, a proposal, which although made by Deputy Bruton more than a year ago was only acted upon when prompted by the crisis reflected in Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme.  The Government has known, as has been pointed out from many sources, that there was a fundamental problem in our banking system that needed to be addressed.  However, it only addressed it when it was too late at the 11th hour.  It then took a measure that was not thought through and the full implications of which we do not know and neither does the Government.  That is what we must address tonight.</P>
        <P>This side of the House, as will be the case in the Lower House, will be constructive in all this debate.  Rushed legislation is always very dangerous.  Even at this late stage, we would like to ensure we get this one right.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Buttimer as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  There is no doubt the economic challenges the State faces in the coming period are substantial.  However, with well thought out, responsible policies they are not insurmountable.  Simply bringing the budget forward is not enough.  The Government needs to take charge and recognise that the buck stops with it when it comes to running the economy.  A Government response to the current situation which seeks to address the shortfall in public finances by resorting to cutbacks in public services is simply not acceptable.  Our public service is already characterised by a lack of capacity and quality.  Of all the countries in Europe, only Estonia and Lithuania have lower public service spending than us.</P>
        <P>Opposition parties are correct to blame Government mismanagement for our present predicament.  However, those of us in Opposition also have a responsibility to propose solutions as to what we would do.  While waste and duplication must be eradicated, let us not kid ourselves that there is a black hole in public spending.  It simply does not exist.  Government spending is nowhere near the level at which it needs to be to reverse the deficits that were allowed to build up in our social and physical infrastructure.  We need to use innovative thinking to stimulate the economy and build the revenue needed to fund our public services appropriately.  We need to offer responsible solutions as to how the Government can dig itself out of this mess in the short and medium term while protecting the most vulnerable who have so often in the past become the target of Government cuts.</P>
        <P>To stabilise the economy we urge the Government to use the budget in a number of ways.  We want job creation prioritised.  In particular we want an immediate retraining programme provided for construction workers to get them into renewable energy retrofitting in other industries.  We want the Government to address our underperforming export market.  Approximately 90% of our exports in 2006 came from foreign-owned companies based here rather than <Col N="55"/>indigenous industry.  A well-known American economist has commented that we had not so much a Celtic tiger as an American tiger trapped in a Celtic zoo.</P>
        <P>We want the national development plans in social and affordable housing and school buildings to be frontloaded, which would re-employ the construction workers and contribute revenue as well as keep people off the dole queues.  The Government needs to take action to reduce the cost of living pressures on the low paid and those dependent on social welfare by establishing an inflation package and awarding social welfare increases.  It is imperative for the Government to introduce a set of proposals to reduce the cost pressures on small businesses, including fast-tracking companies legislation to reduce the regulatory burden while protecting workers&rsquo; rights.  In all of that we need a fundamental reform of the tax system.  If we have sensible well thought out policies, we can dig ourselves out of the hole in which we find ourselves.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators for contributing to the debate.  At the beginning of the debate I believe Senator Twomey alleged that I had a lack of respect for this House.  I have sat through a debate here and listened to everyone for three hours without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I found it a stimulating debate with many different angles.  Inevitably with the financial crisis coming on top of the economic difficulties, many of the contributions dealt with the financial events and decisions of the past 24 hours.  While I do not wish to pre-empt in any detail later discussion on that topic, I will say a few words none the less.  The action taken by the Government earlier today to guarantee the retail, wholesale, dated-term debt, secured borrowings and interbank deposits of the six domestic credit institutions followed the advice of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  In taking this action the Government is acting first and foremost in the interest of the taxpayer and the small saver and depositor to support the stability of the financial sector, which is essential for the stability of the economy.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Buttimer and many others who made the point that there have been many very worried people, not just in the past 24 hours but also in recent weeks.  In many respects we are in uncharted territory.  The action needed to be taken now because global problems over how credit institutions are funded have led to a lack of liquidity across the global financial environment, which has meant that Irish institutions have had difficulty raising the funds they need to lend to customers.  In a normal environment when borrowings on the wholesale money markets where banks lend to each other fall due for repayment, they would either be continued or new loans taken to replace them.  However, with the credit crunch new funds are no longer available.</P><Col N="56"/>
        <?oasys _fp ?><TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to give a &euro;400 billion guarantee to six of the main banking institutions would allow the banks to go to the international markets now and raise funds.  It is not the intention that the taxpayer would be liable for any shortfall in the future.  Money has not been handed over to the banks and as the Taoiseach said earlier in the D&aacute;il, the facility will come at a price for the financial institutions and a fee reflecting commercial reality will need to be paid by any of them that seek to make use of the guarantee.  This relates to the liability side of the institutions&rsquo; balance sheets.</P>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the situation of Ulster Bank and one or two other related institutions.  That is a question I will deal with.  On the previous announcement of the &euro;100,000 guarantee on deposits authorised by the Financial Regulator, this applied to foreign-owned banks with branches in Ireland, including Ulster Bank, First Active, and IIB.  The broader guarantee does not apply to those banks because they are all supported by large overseas parent banks.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with one or two points raised in the debate.  I appreciate the distinction Senator O&rsquo;Toole made between the market and the free market.  He was right to draw attention to the importance of the clearance the Minister received from Brussels to exceed the 3% borrowing limit in the current circumstances because obviously that would have put impossible constrictions on it.</P>
        <P>I also liked Senator Boyle&rsquo;s phrase about an unhealthy belief in bubble economics.  It is funny in some ways as this has been going on from time to time back to at least 300 years.  Humanity seems to have difficulty in learning and, unfortunately, these things repeat themselves too frequently.</P>
        <P>Last Wednesday, the <i>Financial Times </i>published a survey which showed that the eurozone as a whole is in recession.  The point being made is that Ireland is the first country to announce it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State made a point when summing up that I did not hear clearly but I would like to have it put on the record again.  The fact of the matter is that today, the action by Government has eased the access to credit for the banks and it has cheapened the cost of credit and money to the banks.  Therefore, the banks are actually better off <Col N="57"/>than they were this morning because we have covered their risk.  I think the phrase the Minister of State used was that they would pay a fee reflecting commercial reality.  That is what I head the Minister of State say and I would like him to put it on the record again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is on the record.  Is it the Government&rsquo;s view, because the cost of money to the banks is cheaper, that from tomorrow morning effectively the cost of borrowing to the consumer should also be reflected in cheaper borrowing?</P>
      </Speaker>

I thank him for doing do and look forward to discussing the Bill later.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>We appreciate the move by the Government today and remind ourselves that it is a bail-out by taxpayers for the banks.  When will the Government come forward with a plan to provide security for those ordinary people in debt to the banks, those who have lost their jobs, are mortgaged to the hilt and are facing courts in regard to repossession of their homes?  When will the Government provide a plan to bail them out?  Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to work through the night to insure against their losses because these are the people who have most to lose?  Is that issue on the Government&rsquo;s agenda?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously any actions in regard to that issue will have to await the Estimates and the budget.  So far, I would heavily qualify that the repossessions have been relatively small.  There was a reference in a number of contributions to negative equity.  Negative equity mainly affects people who, for one reason or another, may need to sell.  For people who intend to hold on to their property, if they are there for the medium or the long term, it is very likely the negative equity will cease to be negative at a certain point along the line.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House.  In this motion I refer to the County Mayo development plan which was adopted unanimously in County Mayo on 6 May.  Subsequently a ministerial directive of 11 July effectively stopped the plan in its tracks by asking Mayo County Council to vary the plan under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  </P>
        <P>I respect Deputy John Gormley as an excellent Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I regret that my first motion to him on the Adjournment puts me in an adversarial position to him.  I must tell the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, that the entire membership of Mayo County Council is outraged at this move.  To a man, the councillors are determined to resist the directive and seek the re-instatement of the original plan.  The Minister has made an unusual move that I believe has been used only twice.  It places the county manager in an invidious position because he is legally obliged to carry out the instruction of his Minister and is also similarly obliged to carry out the instructions of his members.  This was expressed in their unanimous adoption of the plan.</P>
        <P>There are two separate issues at stake.  First, rural depopulation in County Mayo has been well documented.  Some 75% of the county is in the CL&Aacute;R area.  I do not pretend to know everything about the county but I come from County Kerry where I spent 20 years as a councillor.  I am sure there is little difference between the two counties.  They have similar problems and experiences in trying to settle people in single rural homesteads, as is the case in all rural areas.</P>
        <P>Obviously, this is an area of conflict.  The members of Mayo County Council acted very responsibly in adopting the plan.  It was done legitimately and they went through all the procedures.  They did not have to accept every item put before them by the planners and this was their prerogative as elected members.  In fairness to them, they were very careful about any changes they made to the original draft in order to ensure that items such as water quality, road safety, heritage sites, etc., were safeguarded.  It was not as if they behaved irresponsibly. <Col N="59"/> They had the local knowledge and they are the people best placed to know what is good for their county.</P>
        <P>The second issue at stake is possibly even more significant.  Where is local democracy in this matter?  To the credit of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, he has been proactive in seeking better local government and he is committed to devolving powers to local representatives, for which we applaud him.  There is an inconsistency here, however, because this situation represents the opposite.  Local representatives made decisions about their local areas but an interventionist Minister told them he does not accept their decisions and that they must return to the drawing board.</P>
        <P>A delegation will soon come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding this matter.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity to meet that delegation and enter into dialogue with its members.  Without dialogue there will be no progress.  This is a serious issue for County Mayo and also for public representatives and councillors all over the country.  I believe that the Minister is a reasonable man and I hope he will take on board the points I make and that common sense will prevail.  It is not a free for all and people on the ground in County Mayo do not want any such thing.  I believe this intervention may have been misjudged and should be examined again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan for raising this matter.  I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who is busy with the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have a duty, when making development plans, to ensure that the future development of their areas is based on sound planning principles.  In his role as statutory consultee on development plans, the Minister wrote twice to Mayo County Council during the preparation of the county&rsquo;s development plan, highlighting significant concerns about the proposed rural housing policy which was introduced by way of amendment to the draft plan.  He was also concerned about the lack of mechanisms for the phased development of residentially-zoned lands across the county which would support, rather than undermine, the strategic development of the linked hub of Ballina-Castlebar as designated in the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>Expert advice was provided to the members over the course of the plan&rsquo;s consultation processes.  This included the strategic environmental assessment of the draft plan, advice from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and from other Government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Roads Authority, and from Mayo County Council&rsquo;s own planning and environmental staff.  The advice was set aside by the members when they adopted the final plan even though all of these issues and concerns were endorsed by the county manager in his report to the members.  By deciding to ignore these concerns, the council failed to secure a proper planning and sustainable development strategy for County Mayo.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy designated Castlebar-Ballina as a linked hub for the region in order to direct growth to these towns and develop critical urban mass which would attract industry, commerce and residential development.  This designation was reinforced in the west regional planning guidelines.  To promote the development of these towns, it is essential that the county development plan contains effective mechanisms to focus and channel adequate development and population growth into the hub.  The adopted development plan contains no such mechanisms.</P><Col N="60"/>
        <P>It is vitally important that the development of rural areas takes place in a balanced and sustainable manner.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s 2005 planning guidelines on sustainable rural housing recommend that the location and extent of four rural area types should be identified in development plans, namely, rural areas under strong urban pressure, stronger rural areas, structurally weaker rural areas, and areas with clustered settlement patterns.</P>
        <P>This classification facilitates a well-balanced and sustainable approach through the tailoring of policies which respond to the different housing requirements of urban and rural areas and also to the varying characteristics of rural areas.  The original draft development plan put forward an approach to rural housing that was in accordance with the guidelines.  It struck a good balance between facilitating any housing proposal on suitable sites located in those parts of County Mayo experiencing persistent population decline, and directing pressure for urban-generated housing in the environs of the main towns in County Mayo towards zoned and serviced land capable of accommodating long-term and integrated development.</P>
        <P>However, this approach was abandoned in the adopted development plan in favour of an unstructured and unplanned approach to rural settlement policy.  This unmanaged and unsustainable approach to rural housing has serious and far-reaching implications for future settlement patterns in the county and would impact on the environment and water quality.</P>
        <P>In all these circumstances, the Minister determined that he had no choice but to issue a direction requiring Mayo County Council to vary the development plan.  This was in order to prioritise and phase the development of residentially-zoned lands in the Castlebar-Ballina hub over other locations in the county.  It would also apply the appropriate planning policies as set out in the guidelines for planning authorities in sustainable rural housing by reverting to the reasonable and pragmatic rural settlement policies and mechanisms devised and approved by Mayo County Council itself in the draft development plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for his comprehensive reply.  I accept that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, is well-intentioned in all he is doing and is trying to protect the interests of the people of the county.  Although there always has been a healthy tension between planners and councillors, which is as it always will be, the Minister&rsquo;s intervention adds a new dimension.  County Mayo undoubtedly has a particularly dispersed population.  It is a big county and the local Deputies and councillors are best placed to know what is the balance in this regard.  Nevertheless, with the arrival in Leinster House shortly of a delegation from the county, an opportunity will arise to open dialogue that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, should accept.  Certainly, this is a hot issue for the councillors in County Mayo and it has been picked up by councillors nationwide, who will face the electorate next year and who also must answer to the people.  I hope some dialogue will get under way and I sincerely thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>

    <Title>Water Quality. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for providing me with the opportunity to raise with the Minister of State this evening the matter of the recent problem in the town of Mallow, in which a public water supply was deemed to be dangerous from a health perspective due to excessive quantities of lead.  The problem was detected last Friday when Cork County Council, as part of its ongoing monitoring work, ascertained that in an area of the town of <Col N="61"/>Mallow called Beecher Street, the water supply serving a number of houses was dangerous due to an excess quantity of lead.  The mains water supply was being provided through the old type of lead piping and a number of houses that obtained water from that mains source were found to have excessive quantities of lead in their domestic supply.  While I acknowledge that not all the houses on the street were found to have excessive lead quantities in their domestic supply, a number were.  Obviously, the council was obliged to take immediate action and did so very rapidly and successfully by providing an alternative short-term water supply source to the local residents.  It now has taken the correct decision to replace the lead piping and it is to be hoped this work, which is about to commence, will be concluded in the next week or two.</P>
        <P>The matter was of great concern to the local community and is of concern to other communities within the town of Mallow.  Cork County Council and Mallow Town Council now are investigating the water supply in other parts of the town because it is possible that some areas, particularly where water schemes were put in place before the 1970s, also have systems using lead piping that may have contamination problems.  The Minister of State will appreciate that in Mallow, as in Galway and other towns throughout the country, lead contamination of the water supply is a cause for concern which must be responded to.  The immediate cost to Cork County Council in responding to this difficulty probably is in the region of &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000.  However, that may cover only the first phase of the solution because if other parts of the town are found to have a similar problem, it will be necessary to put in place a solution.  The Minister of State will appreciate that all local authority budgets are under financial stress at present and although such an issue must be remedied and paid for, it constitutes a financial burden on the council.</P>
        <P>The office of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should work with the local authorities in the Mallow area, namely, Cork County Council and Mallow Town Council, to attempt to resolve the problem.  It also should work with any other affected local authority nationwide.  The lead contamination of water in Mallow, Galway and, apparently, in a number of other towns demonstrates clearly that a national audit of water schemes and supplies is required to ensure the quality of drinking water is not simply of a reasonable standard but is of a standard that is beyond doubt from a health perspective.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, also should avail of the present opportunity to advise users of private water sources that they should have their water systems checked out to ensure the water they consume is safe.  A campaign, possibly led and financed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to put in place such a scheme is probably required.</P>
        <P>My immediate concern, however, relates to the town of Mallow.  I congratulate the officials of Cork County Council on, and thank them for, their speedy response.  They set about the detection of this problem and once they succeeded in so doing, they began to resolve the matter and that work now is under way.  The county council has been very up-front in this regard and its actions have been lauded by the people of Mallow, who appreciate its initiative.  Ultimately, however, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a responsibility to ensure that all local authorities follow best practice and investigate all water sources that are being used for domestic supply, as well as to ensure that such supplies are beyond reproach from a health perspective.  In addition, hundreds of thousands of people use non-public water supplies that come from private sources and such people also must be encouraged to check their water sources and wells to ensure there is no contamination of any description.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this Adjournment matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who I understand is speaking in the D&aacute;il on the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Bill at present.</P>
        <P>The Minister regrets this issue has arisen with a small number of public water supplies, namely, 23 out of a total of 944.  However, he understands the concerns of those directly affected and trusts the problems will be resolved quickly by the local authorities involved.  In the meantime, it is important for the local authorities, working with the Health Service Executive, HSE, to ensure that all consumers have up-to-date and accurate advice and information regarding their water supplies.</P>
        <P>The Minister has put in place a rigorous supervisory framework to ensure good quality drinking water is a primary goal for county and city councils and that effective mechanisms exist to deal quickly and effectively with problems where they arise.  Local authority drinking water supplies now are subject to supervision by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the agency has been given the necessary resources to follow through with its new enforcement powers.  Each local authority now is required to ensure that any failure to meet quality standards in its water supplies is investigated immediately to determine the cause.  The authority also is obliged to inform the EPA promptly and to consult with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Since March 2007, the EPA has been notified of lead exceedences in 23 of the 944 public water supplies.  In four of these cases, namely, Galway city, Bruff, County Limerick, Ballintra, County Donegal and Mallow, County Cork, the HSE has recommended that health advisory restrictions be notified to consumers.  The EPA can issue such directions to the local authority as necessary to prevent or remove any health risk. Failure to comply with such a direction is an indictable offence and subject to heavy penalties.</P>
        <P>Under the EPA&rsquo;s published guidance, where non-compliance is caused by the interaction of water with a local authority&rsquo;s pipework and fittings, the authority is required to take action to secure restoration of water quality either by replacing the affected pipework or by providing additional treatment to prevent or remediate the adverse effect on water quality.  With regard to Mallow, the Minister understands Cork County Council has indicated the water pipes will be replaced in a street where the water supply contained lead in excess of the limit.  Where non-compliance is caused, or contributed to, by a consumer&rsquo;s pipework and fittings, the local authority is required to advise the consumers on action they can take to reduce exposure to the hazard.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Gormley, is satisfied there are effective arrangements in place, both to detect problems with drinking water supplies as they arise and to ensure that prompt and effective remedial action is taken.  Less than 1% of water supply samples have shown lead to be present in excess of the current standard.  It is essential that this small number of cases, and any other similar instances that may emerge in the future, are dealt with urgently and effectively and the Minister hopes the comprehensive framework now in place will ensure this happens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the Cork to Swansea ferry link as I am seriously concerned because we are now facing into a third year without this ferry service.  I recall in 1989 that we were without a service in the southern region, which led to a significant economic backlash for freight, tourism, etc.  In Cork and Kerry in particular we are largely dependent on tourism.</P><Col N="63"/>
        <P>In that period 1989-90, I was chairman of Cork County Council, as well as being a Senator.  With the help of local authorities such as Cork County Council, Kerry County Council and Cork City Corporation, as well as Government input, the ferry service was restored.  I cannot emphasise enough that this lack of service amounts to a loss of approximately &euro;50 million or &euro;60 million each year.  In 2007, the operator of the ferry service sold the ship, which was regrettable, with a sincere view to providing another ferry.  This has not happened.</P>
        <P>To take an example, my local golf club &mdash; I am not a great golfer by any means &mdash; has seen its green fees down almost 50%.  Restaurants in the peninsular areas of west Cork, Beara, Mizen, Sheepshead and all over south Kerry have suffered because this ferry, in operation for the past 20 years, is no longer in operation.  It is critical that it be restored.</P>
        <P>I have been told that because of competition laws, the Minister cannot interfere or give a financial injection but we are now facing a three-week window of opportunity to get this boat afloat.  I acknowledge that currently, the mayors of Cork County Council, Kerry, Cork city and those in the Cork port authority are combined in a unique effort to try to get this service back up and running.  In 2007, when the service stopped initially, people did not realise the financial consequences &mdash; both for tourism and freight &mdash; to the region.</P>
        <P>From an environmental perspective we can consider carbon footprints in the context of the Kyoto agreement.  It would be much better if a large ship carrying many freight vessels and cars could be used to ferry people from Wales and many parts of England to the southern region of this country.  Tourism to Cork and Kerry is critical.  Many people from either Wales or parts of England have retired to west Cork and they would have used the ferry frequently.  I emigrated and lived in London for a while so I have used the ferry over the years.</P>
        <P>I urge that the Minister responsible intervene in the matter before it is too late.  I understand this has much to do with tourism but technically, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has responsibility.  Time is of the essence in the matter and what we need to bring the ferry back is security of tenure over five or seven years.  This would mean people in the southern part of this country, mainly Cork and Kerry, can be assured of the only ferry available.  The services in Rosslare and D&uacute;n Laoghaire do a fine job for other parts of Ireland but the loss of this ferry in Cork is immense.  I cannot stress this enough and I urge that action be taken.</P>
        <P>If financial support cannot be provided, surely the Ministers for Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism could act as facilitators to add weight to the case being made for the restoration of the ferry service.  If we are to be without the service for three years, having regard for the economic downturn we are facing, the loss of tourism to this region will have significant consequences for bed and breakfasts, hotels, guest houses and restaurants.  We cannot sustain that pressure for another year.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan for raising the matter.  I know he has a deep interest in this ferry service and has spoken about it before.  The Swansea Cork Ferries Company suspended its service in 2007.  I can fully appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in the region in response to this development.</P>
        <P>I understand a number of interested parties and stakeholders have been in discussions with the Port of Cork Company about the possibility of commencing a new passenger and freight service out of the port.  The Port of Cork carried out a commercial examination of the route, which indicates that subject to procuring a suitable vessel, the service could be feasible on a year-round basis.  The Port of Cork Company will do what it can to facilitate the resumption of the service.</P><Col N="64"/>
        <P>It is important that the market offers a diverse range of maritime links in and out of the State.  This is vital to facilitate trade and tourism.  I hope that the efforts being made will show that the service is commercially viable and that it can be resumed as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>There are some other general points regarding recent developments in the maritime sector.  The Department of Transport has responsibility for national ports policy, which provides a framework for the provision of commercial port infrastructure and services that are efficient, effective and adequate for the needs of our trading economy.  In addition, the Minister for Transport is the primary shareholder, as the Senator knows, in the ten State-owned port companies, including the Port of Cork Company.  However, he has no role in the day-to-day operational matters of the company.</P>
        <P>The principal objectives of Port of Cork Company are to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour.  Current policy is to require the ports to operate commercially, without Exchequer support, and to provide adequate in-time capacity for the future needs of the economy.  I am aware there has been great disappointment in Cork lately with the recent decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the Oyster Bank project, which left many people surprised.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s matter is basically concerned with the ferry service and I hope the talks under way will bring about a positive result.  I note the Senator&rsquo;s concerns and I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, further about the matter.</P>
