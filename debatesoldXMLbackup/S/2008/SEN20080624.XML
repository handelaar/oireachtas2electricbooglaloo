	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to confirm his commitment to the western rail corridor, the single public transport project in the west, and his commitment to the funding and the timeframe for delivery of the project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Malley of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to discuss the prospects of a competitive bus market in the Dublin region.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the existing pension provision for members-workers of Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports under the DAA and to outline the plans he has to avert strike action on 2 July.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by Senators Healy Eames and O&rsquo;Malley as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Buttimer as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.  It is a matter for the DAA.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week in the House I raised the urgent need for a plan of action from the Government to address the economic situation.  I asked what was the <Col N="370"/>Taoiseach&rsquo;s assessment of the current economic situation and what was the Government&rsquo;s plan.  We still have not heard anything.  What we have heard is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, feeling sorry for himself and talking about the building boom coming to a shuddering end.  We have had no economic plan, no outline of how the Government views the situation or how it intends to address it.  I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business today to discuss this important matter facing the country.</P>
        <P>Last week also I outlined the serious situation on the economic front, the collapse of public private partnerships, the rapid and sharp decline in the housing market, the Health Service Executive losing &euro;1 million a day according to its own estimates, and cutbacks in front-line services, home care packages, speech therapy and general practitioner services.  Schools have been promised accommodation but now schools throughout the country want to know what has happened to those promises.  A school in my constituency, Scoil na Camoige, has been left in sub-standard accommodation and it was promised a new school last year.  Where does that promise stand now?</P>
        <P>I note today a most serious report from the ESRI, and the editorial in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times </i>refers to the reality of a recession being in front of us.  The recession is real, not technical.  What is the Government doing about it?  Where are the plans?  Where is the discussion?  We want the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to come to the House to outline how they intend dealing with the situation.</P>
        <P>We have stated on numerous occasions over recent months that the Government has been in a state of wilful denial of the seriousness of the economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time the matter has been raised by us, we have been told it is due to the international situation.  It is instead the result of huge waste across a range of projects and appalling mismanagement over recent years.  This needs to be discussed in this House as soon as possible.  I ask for a debate in this House before the summer recess on the economic situation.</P>
        <P>On a different topic, I ask the Leader to bring the concerns of the House about the situation in Zimbabwe to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to highlight the all-party motion which was passed by the House.  It is an appalling situation in which the opposition leader can no longer contest the election because of fears of violence.  We want this country to make every effort at international meetings.</P>
        <P>My requests today are for an amendment to the Order of Business to have a discussion on the economic situation so that some reality can be injected into our discussions, and for the Leader to raise the situation in Zimbabwe with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">C&uacute;pla uair i rith na bliana, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; leis an Leader gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar staid na Gaeilge agus polasaithe Gaeilge.  In particular I have pointed out the discrepancy between support for Gaeltacht schools and for gaelscoileanna or Irish schools outside of the Gaeltacht.  Gaeltacht schools nowadays must invite in extra Irish teachers because there are so many children arriving at Gaeltacht schools who do not have Irish from home.  They are being provided with Irish language classes at the beginning of the school day.  At the same time, Irish language schools in the Galltacht, outside of the Gaeltacht areas, have a more advantageous retention ratio for teachers.  This makes no sense.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn gach taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt dos na scoileanna sna Gaeltachta&iacute; chun a dh&eacute;anamh cinnte de go bhfuil gach seans acu an Ghaeilge a fhorbairt sna h-&aacute;iteanna sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an seans c&eacute;anna <Col N="371"/>acu is at&aacute; ag na gaelscoileanna.  Ba ch&oacute;ir don Aire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta n&oacute; an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta teacht isteach anseo chun a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil an seans c&eacute;anna ag scoileanna sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Why is the same support structure not available to Gaeltacht schools as for Irish schools outside the Gaeltacht?  It makes no sense.  It might have made sense at a time when every child coming into a Gaeltacht school had Gaeilge &oacute;n gcliabh&aacute;n acu.  N&iacute; mar sin at&aacute; an sc&eacute;al a thuilleadh.  B&iacute;onn ar na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; an Ghaeilge a mh&uacute;ineadh &oacute; thosach do gach leanbh a thagann isteach.  Ba ch&oacute;ir, mar sin, go mbeadh taca&iacute;ocht ann d&oacute;ibh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also wish to raise another issue, which I have raised previously.  It concerns the matter referred to by Senator Fitzgerald.  Whatever about the party political issues that arise in this respect, I suggest in a non-political way that we need to know where we are going on this matter.  Senator Fitzgerald made one point that goes without argument, which is that the Taoiseach should tell us exactly where this matter is going.  I am speaking as someone who has been involved in the social partnership process over the years.  There was much discussion about whether the social partnership process could continue in good times and if we needed it.  I do not know what the answer to that question would have been, but it is certainly the only way forward at present.  Social partnerships cannot bring this forward without a clear political decision.  There must be political leadership in this regard.  The Taoiseach must put his cards firmly on the table and outline the problem.  He must also state whether he wants another national agreement as part of the solution or if he wants to go another way.  Let us get the cards clearly on the table, however, and see the scale of the problem.  Let us investigate and map the various options available to move our way out of it.  Let us find the compromises and agreements within the social partnership model that will bring matters forward.  There is no point in flagging stuff on the front pages of newspapers day after day with unions saying they will not agree to a pay freeze, employers saying we must have a pay freeze, and the Government saying nothing because Ministers are worried about their positions.  Let us put the matter on the table in order that we can deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>There is no problem that does not have a solution, but solutions will be found only when people are given the information in order that they can then chart the way to a solution.  It is not rocket science, it just means assuming leadership, grasping the matter and moving forward.  It also means putting responsibility and pressure on every group in the country and then finding a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In order to have any relevance, this House needs to debate the ESRI&rsquo;s recently published quarterly economic commentary.  I support, and am happy to second, Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business to provide for such a debate.  We are talking about the first recession in this country for 25 years.  We are not talking about speculation but about a clear forecast of an increase in unemployment and emigration.  Two significant aspects of the current situation emerge from the ESRI report.  First, the current recession is almost entirely home-grown.  That is the factual position as outlined by the authors of the ESRI report.   The alibi, explanation or excuse &mdash; that it concerns external, overseas factors &mdash; that is sometimes given in this House is not true.  Therefore, we must leave that aside because it has been proven to be incorrect.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course economic circumstances are a cause.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator O&rsquo;Malley wishes to read the ESRI report she may not like it, but we are talking about factual material which we need to understand before we can have the debate.  The factual material, which is not speculative, points without question to the reality that this is a home-grown recession caused by developments over which this country, and the <Col N="372"/>Government in particular, have substantial power to change.  Members on the Government side may not like it but we need to face the facts first and then have the sort of debate Senator O&rsquo;Toole seeks.  </P>
        <P>Second, the ESRI report&rsquo;s commentary makes demonstrably clear that we blew the boom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government did that. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We had an opportunity to do otherwise.  We had years of self-satisfied, smug commentary from the Government, including from the then Taoiseach, about cranes in the sky, saying that everything was going to be great.  We missed the opportunity, however.  I want a debate on this report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot hold the debate now.  The Senator can make all those points if the Leader agrees to have such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>People might not like this but I am entitled to make the point.</P>
        <P>We blew it in the sense that we passed up the opportunity we had to set down the basis for dealing with a downturn when it came.  We did not do that.  We simply decided not to do it.  We did not fix the roof of the house when the weather was good and now we must face the bad times.  Clearly we need an opportunity to debate this in the House.</P>
        <P>If I can reflect back on what is sometimes regarded as the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Angola moment when he was upset about having to deal with the Department of Health and Children, it would appear now that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is having an Angola moment about having to deal with the challenges in the Department of Finance.  They need to get together quite lively to put together a clear proposal on how we will proceed in the matter.  They first need to face up to the fact that it would be unthinkable for them to go ahead and take pay increases in the face of a situation where they demand that people face pay cuts.  Clearly, we need a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, attended last week when the Christian Brothers order transferred its land banks throughout the country to an independent trust.  It would be remiss of us in these Houses if we allowed that go without commenting on, and giving due credit to, the Irish Christian Brothers for the contribution they have made to Ireland over the past 150 years.  Generations of young Irish boys would never have got an education but for the selfless service of many people of that order.  I would like the House to join me in complimenting them on that and to see that this initiative will continue in a different way the contribution that they made previously to society.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator Fitzgerald for a debate on the economy, not today but before the summer recess.  Undoubtedly, there is a need for the Members to have an opportunity to discuss this important issue.  There is also a real danger.  There are people around, many of whom are in the media, who almost wished we had a recession in order that they would have something negative about which to write.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important for us to be responsible.  If we try to talk down the economy, we are doing an injustice to young people who expect better from people of a more senior age in these Houses who are cosseted by being members of the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell the Minister for Finance this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Read today&rsquo;s editorials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are issues such as inflation and the public finances.  One such issue, on which we ourselves can give a lead, as I stated in the House three or four weeks ago, is pay restraint in the public service.  It is my belief that we should consider an 18-month pay pause, right across the economy generally but definitely in the public service which has benefited enormously in the past decade when times were good.  It is important now that we play our part and that we do not just leave it to those in the private sector to take the pain of what is happening in the economy.  I support the call for a good constructive debate on the economy in the course of the next few weeks, something to which the people are entitled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague Senator Fitzgerald and second the proposed amendment to the Order of Business for a debate the economy.  It is only eight months since we held a debate on housing in the Chamber when Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe attended as then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing.  At that time it was outlined to the Minister of State the excessive dependence on the property and construction industry that had been indulged in by the Government for the past ten to 15 years.  All the eggs were put in one basket.  Any economist or anyone with a financial brain will say one should not put all one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket. <Col N="374"/> However, that is essentially what this Government has done for the past ten to 15 years.  It has depended hugely on the construction industry and when that went flat, everything else went with it.</P>
        <P>All of today&rsquo;s newspaper editorials indicate that there is a recession, something which is frightening for the younger generation, about which Senator Jim Walsh spoke.  Many of those young people are now laboured with the large mortgages propagated by the high cost of construction which was not controlled by this Government.  It is high time we had a serious debate about our economy and the serious challenges facing citizens.  Schools are half built and half of pupils attend classes in prefabs.  The health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That can be dealt with in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>These are the issues facing the people but we do not have the answers to them.  The Government is sitting on its hands.  We call on the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to come to the House to show real leadership in terms of how we propose to deal with these challenges.</P>
        <P>I refer to the health service and palliative care in the south east.  Someone who is terminally ill should be afforded privacy and dignity in their dying days.  The south east does not have a hospice to provide citizens with that fundamental dignity.  Before the last general election, promises were made by Government that funding would be allocated for the provision of a hospice in Waterford.  That funding, however, has been re-allocated to other areas in the health service and all kinds of excuses are being made.  That is a scandal affecting those people who are most vulnerable.  The Government needs to wake up and show real leadership.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I raise the old chestnut I have raised from time to time.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the fishing industry?  Unfortunately, the industry is in deep crisis.  There is a major problem and some fishermen are on the verge of bankruptcy.  We can talk about the rising cost of fuel, other costs in a tightening economy, such as payments for boats, etc., but in my lifetime &mdash; I come from a coastal community &mdash; I have never seen the industry so swamped.  It is swamped with regulations and it is sinking fast.  Unless something is done in the coming weeks rather than months, the fishing industry will collapse.  Trawler men have said to me they face deep financial crisis.  Recently a man told me a ten-day trip cost him &euro;18,000 in fuel alone and that the five crewmen on board got &euro;25 per day.  They would have received more than that 40 years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fishermen recently protested and they were against the Lisbon treaty, which I can understand.  I plead with the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the fishing industry for which I called approximately six weeks ago.  I know many industries face issues but the one industry which is facing wipe-out and is sinking fast is the fishing industry.  It is like the perfect storm.  I would like an immediate response.</P>
        <P>The Minister is in Luxembourg but teetering around the edges and telling us the Cawley report is the panacea is like throwing crumbs at a bear.  I cannot emphasise enough the seriousness of the situation.  The coastal communities will rebel.  What we saw in Clonakilty a couple of a weeks ago will have been small scale compared to what will come down the tracks if something is not done.  Places like Killybegs, Castletownbere, Kilmore Quay, Dunmore East and Rossaveel will be ghost towns in a couple of years if we do not do something.  The industry is crying out for help and Members of both Houses and successive Governments have ignored the fishing industry for the past 30 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I raised the question of a person whose human rights were seriously violated with the collaboration of official agencies here.  I did so at his request and followed the etiquette of the House by not putting his name on the record.  He has since attempted to get this case taken up by our courageous journalists, financial and otherwise.  However, not a single one has taken it up with the exception of our own Jimmy Walsh who, as usual, was splendid in the matter.  I wish now to say to those investigative journalists, &ldquo;Let them start investigating&rdquo; and I will tell them and the House on the record his name is Mr. Frank Mulcahy and he was the head of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want any person named, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do it at his request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is out of order in naming people who are not present in the House and I do not want it to continue.  I have made this clear on numerous occasions and if Senators are going to persist with this I will not call them on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s feelings, but I am sure he will understand mine where a man cannot get justice because of the gutlessness of the media and it uses this as an excuse.  I have now removed that excuse from them with the permission of the person involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to raise the question of rendition, which emerged in Amnesty International&rsquo;s report.  I am asking for a discussion on this matter and an end to the characteristic, continuing and deliberate dishonesty by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It has been made clear that on three instances, which I and others have put on the record in this House on numerous occasions, aeroplanes involved in an unbroken rendition circuit used Shannon Airport with the complicity of our authorities.  It is like somebody who is asked, &ldquo;Why did you poison your wife?&rdquo; and the answer given is, &ldquo;I never took a hatchet to her in my life&rdquo;.  It is deliberately answering the wrong question in order to obfuscate.  Let us stop it, because that kind of hoodwinking of the public is exactly what happened when the vote on the Lisbon treaty was lost.  The truth would not be told and Mr. Sarkozy is still at it.  I understand he is coming here.  I hope he gets a robust response here and I hope somebody tells him that we have had enough Marie Antoinettery about the place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;and then drop them in what is characteristically and diplomatically called the <i>merde</i>.</P>
        <P>All Senators received the circular about the amount of correspondence and so on we receive.  The material in my hands is what I got in terms of reports and the same in terms of letters.  Why are we getting so much rubbish?  Why do we not do something if we are worried about the environment?  This volume of material is not going to help.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>

        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, in his call a debate on the fishing industry.  We have a real crisis on the western seaboard which has been substantially ignored because the rest of the country seems oblivious to it.  However, on the western seaboard and indeed in all our coastal communities there is a serious crisis.</P>
        <P>On the economy generally I call, as so many of us have in recent weeks, for a rolling debate on the economy.  We have been living in changed economic circumstances for several months now.  It is no surprise to see the information contained in the ESRI report this morning.  I refute the idiotic suggestion that this problem is entirely home-grown.

	<P Just="Left">I would like to support the call made by my colleague, Senator Alex White, for a debate on the economy.  Unlike the previous speaker, I believe this is a domestic problem, in the main, that has been created by this Government.  While it is easy to suggest <Col N="377"/>that people are talking up or down the economy, it is time to deal with the reality.  It is easy for those on the other side of the House to laugh it off.  That will not help young people with big mortgages.  It will not help small and medium-sized enterprises, which we purport to support.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>We have to deal with the reality.  We are in a recession.  That is the fact of the matter.  The good growth rates we enjoyed between 1995 and 2001 were based on exports and a sound economy.  The reality is that between 2001 and 2008, we were living in a false economy, based on a cosy relationship between Fianna F&aacute;il and the construction industry.  That is the reality.  Everybody here knows that, irrespective of whether they will admit it.</P>

	<P>That relationship was facilitated by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance.  We have had a huge multi-billion turnaround in the economy.  It is obvious there are external factors.  The reality, as this report shows, is that this is being caused by mostly domestic factors.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The previous speaker asked for suggestions.  I have some suggestions.  It is obvious that the new Minister for Finance will argue that cutbacks are needed in certain areas of the national development plan.  We look forward to hearing what he has to say in that regard.  I do not see how the national development plan can be cut.  When the Minister is taking such action to facilitate the economy, perhaps he might finally outline what he will do to roll out broadband services and give workers new skills.  He needs to make some positive statements on those matters.  I do not know what the Government plans to do in those two key areas to turn around the economy.  It needs to deal with the damage it has caused since the turn of the century.</P>

        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have repeatedly asked the Leader for a debate on the aviation industry, not just in the context of Cork Airport.  Union members working for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airport authorities have voted to take industrial action from 2 July next on foot of their concerns about deficits in pension provisions.  Industrial action would have a profound effect on the travelling public and on workers at various airports.  The Minister, who might not have responsibility for the Dublin Airport Authority, gave certain commitments when he took office.  I want a debate on aviation matters.  We have not had such a debate.  The aviation industry is in huge crisis, not least because of the cost of fuel.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to the House for an urgent debate on the national development plan and the programme for Government.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, the ESRI report was published today.  Let us cut out the bull &mdash; the reality is that ordinary people are suffering.

	<P>I support my colleagues on this side of the House who have called for a debate on the economy.  It is clear we are in recession.  We have had enough of the patronising words of those on the other side of the House who suggest we are talking down the economy, and that we should not do so because it is harming the economy.  It is clear who has caused the harm.  It is interesting that Government speakers are trying to blame the current state of the economy on the international context.  They were not slow to take credit for the boom years.  When we had the boom, they did not point out that it had an international context.  It is clear the Government has blown the boom, as other Senators have said.</P>
        <P>I would like to be constructive, as the Minister for Finance asked us to be in his moment of self-pity last week.  I suggest we should have a debate on what to do about this problem.  Are there obvious ways in which the Minister for Finance could save the Exchequer money?  As others have mentioned, an obvious way to do that would be to reverse the roll-out of the decentralisation programme.  The programme, which has run into the sand, in effect, is costing the Exchequer a large amount of money without any discernible benefit.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we should examine crime policy as an area in which money could be saved.  That is especially relevant this week, as we debate the enormous super-prison site in Thornton Hall in north Dublin.  We have seen the move in recent years from a due process model of criminal justice to a crime control model.  That costs a considerable amount of money and the benefits to us, and to victims of crime, are minimal and have yet to be proven empirically.</P>
        <P>We can look at ways of saving money and improving the economic situation but I do not think we need to hear either whingeing from the Minister for Finance or pomposity and patronising from the Government on this.</P>

When we discussed the economy the Leader and his colleagues generally referred to the past ten years and the level of growth.  The reality is, as with so many other things, that Fianna F&aacute;il has been caught out on this issue.  It is now official because the report comes from the ESRI, not from Fine Gael, although it confirms what we said.  We do not talk down the economy but if we refuse to debate and analyse it no lessons are learned and no measures will be taken to correct the situation.</P>

	<P>In conclusion, it is the primary responsibility of the Government to manage the public finances.  It cannot do everything but it has a responsibility to manage that area.  When we see a budget surplus of &euro;6 billion in 2006 and a deficit of &euro;3 billion this year, that is not good management.  That is where&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I agree that we must debate the economy and we should do so quickly though perhaps not today, because the ESRI report came out only today.  I fear, from <Col N="380"/>words used in the House already, that we are talking ourselves into a bigger recession than we might otherwise have had.</P>

	<P>We must be careful not to do that.  We need optimism but also realism.  Things have changed in the 25 years to which the ESRI report refers.  We no longer have control of our interest rates in the way that we had control of our currency 25 years ago.  We have greatly benefited from the euro and control from the European Central Bank but we do not have our own control any longer.  We must debate these changes and very soon.</P>
        <P>In its programme for Government the Government included a referendum for children&rsquo;s rights.  The Minister of State for Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, seemed to suggest last week that such a referendum might not take place.  I do not know if there has been a change of mind and perhaps it makes a lot of sense to solve this problem, or attempt to do so, by legislation rather than by referendum.  I ask the Leader if we might have a debate on this issue.  It is under discussion at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children but I believe it is also worthy of debate in this House.</P>
        <P>As an employer for many years, I would have liked to have known about what is called &ldquo;soft&rdquo; information.  I had not heard the term before but soft information applies to grave doubts about the suitability of persons to be in charge of children although they may not necessarily have been found guilty of an offence.  An employer would like to know there are such doubts.  I can understand the difficulty that arises and it is worthy of debate.  We are here to protect children&rsquo;s rights and to determine the best way of doing so.  There is not full agreement between the different parties but it is possible to achieve, be it by way of referendum or legislative change.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Westmeath is known as the lake county and has serious problems with the manner in which its stocks are being poached.  I have made this point several times before and &ldquo;poached&rdquo; is the nicest word I can use.

We have talked the talk and now it is time we walked the walk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would welcome an early debate on the fishing industry.  The Leader has already indicated he is disposed to having such a debate and I therefore thank him.  Perhaps the debate on the problems affecting the inland counties of Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath and Cavan, Senator Wilson&rsquo;s county, which has many fine lakes, can be held in tandem with that requested by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan.  This would be useful and I hope it would lead to positive proposals to address the problems, especially those affecting my own county.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I participated in the Dublin Pride parade in Dublin on Saturday.  It was a very enjoyable experience and very good humoured, but there were several references to the hope that the civil partnership Bill would be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Members had a good debate in recent months on the Civil Partnership Bill and there seemed to be consensus around the House on the importance of introducing this legislation, which forms part of the programme for Government.  I ask the Leader of the House to provide an <Col N="382"/>update to Members on the status of the legislation&rsquo;s preparation and when they can expect to see it brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The other issue I wish to mention is the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which are continuing, and the issue of agriculture.  While there was much discussion on this issue during the run-up to the recent referendum, the World Trade Organisation negotiations continue.  This morning I noted reports in the national media that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, has made it clear that neither he nor the Irish Government is happy with the implications for agriculture of some of the recent positions taken in those negotiations.  I wish to emphasise that as a country that had and still has a strong agricultural base, we must be proactive at a European level in highlighting the vulnerability of the agricultural sector as the issue of food production and food security move to the top of the agenda.</P>
        <P>Together with the looming energy crisis, the issue of food security will be immediate and the European Union must ensure it retains its capacity to produce its own food.  One must examine the world trade system and must take issue that food is treated within it in the same manner as a manufactured product, that is, simply as another commodity for trading.  I ask the Leader of the House, to whom the same request has been made in recent weeks, to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the House to address the issue of the ongoing negotiations, their future impact on the agricultural sector and the position Ireland is taking at an EU level to try to protect our capacity for food production in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s points on food security.  Members have been calling on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House for some time and I hope the Leader can arrange such a discussion before the summer recess.  It would be apt and timely to so do.  A number of issues have arisen, particularly regarding the production of bio-fuels and the consequential impact on the price and availability of food around the world.  It now is a moral question in that as a First World community, we have pumped resources into the development of bio-fuels at a time when many people throughout the world still live in hunger.  These two positions cannot be reconciled and Members should have a debate in this regard.  When does the Leader believe the Chemicals Bill will come before the House?  While it was scheduled for today, I understand it is still before the other House.  Perhaps the Leader will indicate when the debate is due to take place.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point raised by Senator Coffey regarding palliative care and the lack of provision in the south-eastern region.  I also agree with Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, who raised the issue of fishermen, as he has done on a number of previous occasions, and a debate should be held in this regard.  Although I do not come from a coastal community like other Members, the fishing industry should be protected.  No other industry has lost out more since Ireland&rsquo;s entry to the European Union and a debate on this issue should be held as soon as possible.  Moreover, as part of that debate or perhaps in a subsequent discussion, Members should debate the ongoing increase in the price of fuel, which I also mentioned last week.  This has knock-on effects for fishermen, for contractors of different sorts and, obviously, for hauliers.  The latter are considering taking drastic action which, were it to happen, would have highly detrimental effects nationwide.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I join with Senator Fitzgerald and nearly everyone else who has spoken on the Order of Business who has raised the issue of the economy and the need for a debate on that subject.  Members have been calling for such a debate for months.  I was spokesman on finance for almost four years during the lifetime of the last Seanad and at every possible opportunity, I raised the economy&rsquo;s over-reliance on the construction sector.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was Minister for Finance for most of that period and his then Minister of State is the head of <Col N="383"/>the Construction Industry Federation at present.  They repeatedly came before this House, denied that Ireland was over-reliant on anything and stated that everything would continue rosily into the future.  It is appalling that the Government has moved from the position of the past 18 months, in which it denied we have a problem, to the remarks of Deputy Brian Lenihan last weekend, when he sank to new depths of self-pity in his position as Minister for Finance.  If anybody is in danger of talking the economy into recession, it is the Minister with his shocking comments last weekend.  I urge the Leader to have that debate before the summer recess.  If possible, we should have it this week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other colleagues in calling for a debate on the economy.  I especially support Senator Frances Fitzgerald&rsquo;s point that the most urgent item on our agenda is today&rsquo;s ESRI report.  It confirms everything that we had privately suspected and feared for some time.  Owing to the domestic factors highlighted therein, we need to know urgently the Government&rsquo;s proposals for our way out of this.  Have the highlighted talks between the Government and the banks taken place?  If not, when are they taking place and what is intended to come from them?  There will be complete stagnation if the banks freeze up, so there must be agreement.  The Government and the banks must be on the one wavelength, with an agreed agenda between them.  That is the most immediate of the urgent matters that need to be dealt with.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Quinn that we must be realistic.  We do not want to talk ourselves into anything worse than what might happen but the ugly truth is that cranes are disappearing off the skylines throughout the country and building sites are shutting down.  Unfortunately, that is the reality on 24 June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support fully the call for an urgent debate today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to share in a debate on the economy, and the Leader should facilitate it as urgently as possible.  There are two facets to this.  Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to food production and food security, but I would go further and point out how prescriptive we have become.  I met a man at a function to commemorate the golden jubilee of a wedding last weekend, and he spoke about not being able to rear a duck, kill a goose or kill a lamb without having them tagged.  This is overly prescriptive and with the way our economy and the cost of food are going, it is something we should examine.  People feel downtrodden and this is a reflection on the way they voted in the Lisbon treaty.  They voted because they are fed up with being told what to do.  This man told me that soon we will have to ask permission to go to the toilet.</P>
        <P>Economists say that oil will cost $200 per barrel by Christmas, yet there is an idea out there that people in rural Ireland will not be able to cut turf.  This is the other facet to the debate on the economy.  If the Government had listened to the people of rural Ireland before the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, their fears could have been allayed that these issues were not part of the treaty in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s call for a debate on the fishing industry.  I raised the issue last week and I hope the Leader will facilitate such a debate in the next few weeks.  It is an industry on its knees at the moment and we need to be seen to support it.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s point on the World Trade Organisation talks, especially the proposal from Peter Mandelson to reduce the production of food through agriculture within <Col N="384"/>the EU by 21%.  This proposal is occurring at a time when a child dies every 30 seconds in the world from hunger.  I do not agree with proposals like these and I get the feeling from the Minister and the Department that they are not in agreement with them either.</P>
        <P>It also would be timely to have a debate on agriculture prior to the recess.  I was not going to contribute on the issue of the economy.  Listening to the debate, however, I believe we are trying to talk ourselves into a recession.</P>

I have given my word to the House that this is going to take place.  Now that the ESRI report is out today, we shall give the Minister for Finance the opportunity to come to the Seanad for a lengthy debate.  I have no difficulty in holding a half-day debate in the House on the economy.  It is something to which each one of us wants to make a contribution.  I do not want to get involved in the pros and cons of what has been said.

	<P>No shouting and roaring from the other side, please.  Senators Norris and Fitzgerald quite correctly have asked me to raise the matter of Zimbabwe with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the context of the agreed all-party motion.  I certainly will do that on the conclusion of the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole highlighted the difficulties being experienced with funding for Gaeltacht schools.  This is urgent and I shall convey the Senator&rsquo;s serious concerns to the Minister immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh offered his congratulations to the Christian Brothers on the magnificent contribution they have made and asked that the House be associated with it.  I join the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, and everyone else in congratulating the Christian Brothers on the 150 years of tremendous service they have given the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senators Paudie Coffey and John Paul Phelan made a plea for the palliative care unit in County Waterford.  I certainly can pass that on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, MacSharry, Glynn, John Paul Phelan and &Oacute; Domhnaill called for an urgent debate on the fishing industry.  As I said to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill last week, Senator Glynn the previous week and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan many weeks ago, this is a debate that must take place before the summer recess.  This industry needs urgent attention and support, and it is one area to which each one of us can make a contribution.  I have no difficulty in responding to Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s request, and this matter will be given all the time needed for views to be aired as soon as the Minister returns from Luxembourg.  I understand the Senator is meeting the Minister tomorrow in this regard.  I have given a commitment to Senator Glynn on fish stocks in the midlands.  This could be included in the debate on the fishing industry.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on rendition.  I have no difficulty in having time set aside for such a debate but the difficulty is there are only three weeks to the summer recess.  He might consider raising such a debate in Private Members&rsquo; business.</P><Col N="386"/>
        <P>I must differ with Senator Norris&rsquo;s comments on the French President, Mr. Sarkozy.  As far as I am concerned as Leader of the House, Mr. Sarkozy is most welcome in our country.  When France holds the EU Presidency in several weeks&rsquo; time, he will be welcomed as any other president has been.</P>

        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on the aviation industry.  I have already said a debate can take place on this issue.  He also called for a debate and update on the national development plan.  This is very timely and should take place, hopefully, before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn called for the Minister to clarify the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights.  I have no difficulty with a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca asked when the civil partnership Bill will be published.  I understand it will be published shortly and certainly before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Senators John Paul Phelan and &Oacute; Domhnaill called for an update and debate on agriculture and its importance to the economy, particularly food processing.  Such a debate would be timely and I have no difficulty in setting aside time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>The Chemicals Bill will be on the Order Paper next week.  Senators John Paul Phelan and McFadden called for a debate on energy costs and the rising price of oil.  Senator McFadden pointed to difficulties in the midlands with turf-cutting.  The agreement on allowing domestic turf-cutting to continue is supposed to expire in the next 12 months.  With oil costs going through the roof, this should be extended for at least another ten years.  I support the pleas of the midlands Senators on this matter.</P>

    <Title>Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the Electricity Regulation (Amendment)(EirGrid) Bill to the House.  The Bill, which was initiated in the D&aacute;il in April, forms a key part of the Government&rsquo;s priority legislative programme and underpins a number of key elements of the Government&rsquo;s energy policy.  The Bill provides for an expanded role for EirGrid, the national transmission system operator, as a strong independent State company.  It also underpins the development of electricity interconnection generally.  In this context, the early enactment of the Bill will facilitate the delivery to schedule of the east-west electricity interconnector with the United Kingdom by 2012 at the latest.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes some minor amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 in this context, which I will refer to as the 1999 Act.  To ensure consistency with provisions for other licensing activities, a new subsection is inserted into the 1999 Act to provide that a person operating an interconnector without the appropriate licence is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or term of imprisonment.  For example, it is already an offence to supply or generate electricity without the appropriate licence.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides clarification of the position of interconnectors with respect to the transmission system.  The 1999 Act provides that the cost of interconnectors would be recovered through transmission system charges.  This Bill provides that those costs are only to be recovered in the case of a regulated interconnector, such as the east-west interconnector, or in <Col N="388"/>circumstances where the Commission for Energy Regulation determines that it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
        <P>The new provision facilitates the development of merchant interconnectors, which are privately funded and developed. Merchant interconnection projects are financed through charges for the use of the interconnector rather than being compensated through transmission system charges.  These new provisions are in line with the European Union regulations in respect of merchant and regulated interconnectors.</P>
        <P>As I have mentioned, the Bill expands the statutory functions of EirGrid in respect of electricity interconnection.  I will briefly outline these functions.  As the fully independent transmission system operator, EirGrid plc is licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, the independent energy regulator.  Since it became the licensed operator for the transmission system in 2006, EirGrid has developed into a dynamic player in the Irish electricity market.</P>
        <P Just="Left">EirGrid&rsquo;s current statutory functions as transmission system operator include the operation, planning and development of the Irish electricity transmission system; the development of opportunities for interconnection of the Irish transmission system with other systems, with a view to ensuring all reasonable demands for electricity are met; the critical task of monitoring and reporting on security of electricity supply and generation adequacy; and the independent operation of the single electricity market in co-operation with EirGrid&rsquo;s Northern Ireland equivalent, SONI.  This Bill provides that EirGrid may construct, own and operate an interconnector subject to the grant of the appropriate licence and authorisation by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provisions already outlined, on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, this Bill restates certain provisions of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000, SI 445 of 2000, under which EirGrid was established.  Restating these provisions in primary legislation provides the strongest possible underpinning for EirGrid&rsquo;s new role.  At the same time, the Bill revokes the corresponding provisions in SI 445 of 2000 to avoid duplication.</P>
        <P>The restated provisions relate to subsidiaries of EirGrid and borrowings and capital expenditure by EirGrid.  These provisions are restated in slightly amended form and include an increase in EirGrid&rsquo;s borrowing limit to a total of &euro;750 million.  The increased borrowing limit provides EirGrid with the financial leverage and scope to develop its expanded role and progress a challenging agenda.  The issues of climate change and energy security are urgent and imperative priorities for Ireland, the European Union and all governments worldwide.</P>
        <P>The achievement of the ambitious national targets we have set for ourselves in terms of emissions reduction, renewables and energy efficiency improvements present key challenges for the electricity sector.  At the same time, this sector has recently entered a new era with the establishment of the all-island single electricity market.  At this time of unprecedented change, EirGrid has an increasingly important strategic role to play.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the publication shortly of EirGrid&rsquo;s Transmission Development Strategy 2025, which will be critical in identifying how we can support the increasing penetration of renewable energy generation and address the technical challenges in terms of the development and operation of the electricity transmission system.  It will contribute to our continued economic, social and regional development.</P>
        <P>For the longer term, I have commenced a process to examine the transfer of the electricity transmission assets.  I expect that EirGrid, as a key State stakeholder, will provide an important input into this analysis and process.  With regard to electricity interconnection, EirGrid is progressing the development of the second North-South interconnector in co-operation with the <Col N="389"/>Northern Ireland authorities, which is due to be completed by 2012.  The publicly expressed concerns in regard to this and other essential transmission system developments underline the complexity of the task facing EirGrid in the coming years.  In this context, I commissioned an independent study on the relative merits of constructing and operating overhead transmission lines as compared with underground cables.  The study focuses on technical characteristics, reliability, operation and maintenance factors, environmental impacts, possible health issues and the cost of both types of electricity infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In anticipation of the enactment of this Bill, EirGrid is advancing the development of the east-west electricity interconnector.  The Government attaches the highest priority to this project which will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness as well as providing increased potential for the export of wind-generated electricity.  I will expand on just a few of the potential benefits to Ireland from interconnection with the UK market.  With regard to the security of our electricity supply, the generation adequacy report is produced annually by EirGrid and sets out the forecasts for both the supply of and demand for electricity over a seven-year period.  The most recent report has identified a need for additional generating capacity over the next seven years to maintain security of supply.  East-west interconnection will afford Ireland direct and secure access to the British energy market where, I am advised, there is significant generation capacity available to enhance security of supply on this island.  In addition, the United Kingdom is developing interconnectors with mainland Europe to contribute further to security of supply and market integration.</P>
        <P>In this context, I am pleased to note a breakthrough earlier this month at the Council of Energy Ministers&rsquo; meeting in Luxembourg, where broad agreement on the essential elements of the internal energy market package was reached.  This package will contain new measures to ensure further co-operation among transmission system operators across the EU and for the further development of regional energy markets.  Another significant benefit of the east-west interconnector is that it will enhance the competitive environment in the Irish electricity market by allowing third party access in a fair, consistent and transparent manner.  This, together with the all-island single electricity market, should, over time, exert downward pressure on electricity prices.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is a primary objective for Government.  Reliability and competitively priced energy supply is critical for future economic growth.  Government policy is geared towards delivering a supportive, sustainable energy environment for enterprise and for consumers.  Structural change in the energy sector and delivering essential strategic energy infrastructure are among the priority commitments for the Government.</P>
        <P>In terms of fuel diversity, the introduction of the east-west interconnector will be a major benefit by providing an external source of electricity that will reduce our dependency on gas-powered generation.  At present, a significant percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity needs are generated from gas, some 60% overall.  The east-west interconnector will help therefore to decrease our exposure to price movements and geopolitical instability factors in international energy markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another key potential benefit of the east-west interconnector is that it will help support the increased penetration of renewable generation, especially non-dispatchable wind generation, in the Irish market.  Reserve supply is required to provide backup for wind generation at times when the wind is not blowing.  The east-west interconnector will provide the capacity and stability required and will increase the extent to which renewable generation can be accommodated on the transmission system.</P>
        <P>The east-west interconnector will offer potential opportunities for export of Irish wind-generated electricity.  In times of high wind generation, surplus power would be shared with Britain.  In times of low wind generation, power would be imported from Britain.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>The Government has set ambitious targets for progressively achieving 33% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020, with a target of 15% for 2010.  The recent all-island grid study shows the possibility of up to 42% of electricity being provided from renewable generation by 2020.  The all-island grid study also identifies the east-west interconnector as a key enabler for delivering our ambitious national and European Union renewables targets.  It is to exploit these crucial benefits that the Government has attached such a high priority to the delivery of the east-west interconnector.</P>
        <P>In this context, I wish to advise the House of the significant progress to date on the delivery of the east-west interconnector.  In 2006, the Government requested the Commission for Energy Regulation to arrange the design of a competition to secure the construction of a 500 MW interconnector with the United Kingdom at the earliest possible date before 2012.  The Government also decided that the interconnector would, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and would be owned by EirGrid.  To oversee and ensure completion to schedule, a high level co-ordination group has been established under the chairmanship of the Commission for Energy Regulation and comprising representatives of EirGrid and my Department.  I am advised that work on the project is progressing well. EirGrid, overseen by the CER, is finalising a competition for the design and construction of the interconnector.  I am also advised that the contract for design and construction will be completed by the end of September this year when the successful bidder will be announced.</P>
        <P>EirGrid is also advancing work on route selection, planning and foreshore authorisation and technical specification of the interconnector.  Woodland, County Meath, will be the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system.  EirGrid has also obtained a formal connection offer from the UK national grid for a site at Deeside in Wales, which it has accepted.  In addition, EirGrid has carried out a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.  Based on analysis of this work, the final route to link the two connection points will be determined.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides a clear signal of the Government&rsquo;s support for the project and I trust I can count on the support of Senators for its provisions and smooth passage.  As outlined, the Bill also will provide EirGrid with the legislative underpinning to advance to the next stage of the east-west interconnector project and ensure there are no delays to timely delivery.  I am advised that the end of September 2011 is targeted for the completion of construction work, with the end of March 2012 targeted for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.</P>
        <P>In a European context, greater interconnection between member states is a key priority for the European Union to ensure the effective operation of the internal energy market.  The importance of the east-west interconnector project has been formally recognised at a European level and it has been designated a project of European interest, which is the category of projects with the highest priority at EU level.  The fact that the east-west interconnector is included in the EU trans-European networks priority interconnection plan underlines its strategic importance.  The priority interconnection plan proposes specific measures for the progressive completion of critical energy infrastructure projects.  As a tangible measure of support, funding totalling more than &euro;2 million is being made available under the EU trans-European networks programme to advance the study phases of the east-west interconnector project.</P>
        <P>As a peripheral island nation, Ireland strongly supports the progressive development of European regional electricity markets underpinned by greater interconnection.  This project is a natural progression from the development, in co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities, of the all-island energy market and the launch of the single electricity market in <Col N="391"/>November of last year.  My Department, the CER and EirGrid, along with their UK and French counterparts, are actively working towards the development of a regional electricity market as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s initiative to develop regional energy markets.  This initiative will be underpinned by greater interconnection.  The current focus is on the delivery of the second North-South electricity interconnector and the new east-west electricity interconnector no later than 2012.  At the Government&rsquo;s request, EirGrid will also undertake cost benefit analysis and feasibility planning for further interconnection with the UK and potentially with Europe in the longer term.  This analysis will take account of any proposals to develop interconnection on a merchant basis.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important measure in the delivery of critical objectives in the energy area, including enhanced security of electricity supply, greater competition and increasing use of renewable energy sources.  I look forward to listening carefully to the views of Senators on this important legislation and to their assistance in progressing it into law.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate the Second Stage of this Bill, the purpose and aims of which must be widely supported.  On the enactment of this legislation, EirGrid will be able to construct and maintain an interconnector to transport electricity.  The Bill&rsquo;s intent is a simple one.  Two interconnectors have been proposed under the Bill &mdash; an east-west interconnector and a North-South one.  The aim of these is to reduce our dependency on non-renewable sources and to generate more than 40% of our electricity requirements from alternative renewable resources by 2020.  EirGrid has two proposals: an 80 km long 400 kV power line between Kingscourt, County Cavan and Turleenan, County Tyrone, and a 58 km long 400 kV power line between Woodland, County Meath and Kingscourt, County Cavan.</P>
        <P>The proposed latest completion date of the EirGrid east-west interconnector is 2012.  This will link the Irish transmission system to the British system.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy and the European policy, this interconnector will secure Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to reduce our dependency upon other sources of energy as well as promoting the use of more indigenous renewable energy resources, which is most welcome.  It is vital that we have in place a viable and sustainable infrastructure to cope with rapidly decreasing non-renewable resources.  The Government now has an opportunity to be innovative and forward thinking as globally depleting energy supplies take effect.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Government must act to ensure Ireland does not become economically isolated.  This interconnector would link us geographically to Britain, which in turn would provide us with a connection to Europe.  This could be vital to our sustainability in future years.  Ireland will benefit greatly from the EirGrid east-west interconnector.  Most importantly, it will give us a guarantee of direct supply.  As recently as last week there was a threat to our electricity supply, but the interconnector will enhance our growth in renewable energy resources.  It could promote greater competition, allowing Ireland access to the larger British market which would have a positive impact for consumers.  However, the Government must assure the public that this interconnector is reliable, sustainable and provides competitive electricity supplies.</P>
        <P>Currently, Ireland has limited indigenous reserves of fossil fuel and is largely dependent on supplies from Russia and the Middle East.  The absence of an interconnector to Britain, however, leaves us at the back of the queue.  More is needed immediately.  We must be prepared to commit Ireland to a future that ensures our energy security.  We must secure our supplies.  The Minister must avail of every opportunity to improve our connectivity with the rest of the world and not just Britain.  I welcome the fact that the Minister referred to this point in his speech.</P><Col N="392"/>
        <P>These plans have been discussed for more than eight years, yet we are still debating the issue.  Surely EirGrid could have these interconnectors finished before 2012.  The private sector company building the interconnector between the Netherlands and Norway, which is almost 600 km long, can do it in three years.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give EirGrid the capabilities to undertake and manage projects such as the proposed east-west interconnector and the North-South interconnector.  This Bill would also enable EirGrid to own its own assets.  In his speech, the Minister referred to company&rsquo;s ability to take out or extend a loan to the value of &euro;750 million.  EirGrid itself proposes to take responsibility for running the lines for the east-west connector from Rush to Batterstown in County Meath.</P>
        <P>As regards the Bill&rsquo;s overall provisions, the Minister referred to EirGrid being responsible for financing the project.  However, I am concerned that consumers will ultimately have to pay the price.  I understand that, through this Bill, the Minister is legally providing for EirGrid to borrow to finance the project.  At this stage, however, it is unclear how he intends this infrastructure to be funded.  Will it be partially funded by money borrowed and raised by EirGrid, topped up by public moneys, or will it be integrated into consumers&rsquo; electricity bills, thus pushing costs even higher than they already are?  I would welcome some clarification of these matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is worth noting that in the past five years UK electricity costs have been consistently 8% to 15% cheaper than here.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point also.  Many Scandinavian countries have lengthy connections.  For example, Norway has 4,000 MW of interconnection with its neighbours and these lines are mostly underwater.  This contrasts with Ireland&rsquo;s 400 MW of connectivity, which is unacceptable and appalling.  If we want to put Ireland at the heart of the green revolution, it is no use utilising green sources of renewable energy off the west coast if the resulting electricity is then brought to the east and north-east using non-green, outdated technology that puts people&rsquo;s lives at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not convinced that EirGrid&rsquo;s performance on the North-South interconnector to date is in any way encouraging.  We must carefully monitor and control EirGrid.  In the past, EirGrid has shown a serious capacity to delay projects so I ask the Minister to be careful not to create another monster like the Health Service Executive or the National Roads Authority.  Will the Minister take total control of this agency and all of its functions?</P>
        <P>At this juncture I would like to speak about the ESB, which as we are all aware is in public ownership.  As a past employee of the ESB, like my father before me, I regard it as one of the most efficient of our semi-State companies.  It has turned around its fortunes in a time of serious competition.  Since the ESB&rsquo;s inception more than 80 years ago, the company has been very efficient.  We owe it a big debt.  I take heart when I note that practically all the personnel in EirGrid are former ESB employees, which is a good omen for the future.</P>
        <P>A group called the north-east pylon pressure campaign, NEPP, has been established to challenge and oppose any decision to plant high-power electricity pylons.  The group&rsquo;s concerns are serious and ought to be heeded.  The route that EirGrid has announced as a possibility would run from the existing substation at Woodland near Batterstown to a new substation near Kingscourt, which would join the Cavan-Tyrone power line.  There are two other proposed lines which have also been opposed by local residents who may be affected.  These people are voicing serious and genuine concerns which EirGrid must listen to.  The primary concern is about health risks which the pylons and power supplies may pose.  People are worried about their safety and that of their children while farmers are also worried about the adverse effects on livestock and lands.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P Just="Left">We have come a long way since last October when EirGrid first announced this project.  The company rejected the option of putting cables underground because, first, it was not technically feasible and, second, it would cost ten or 20 times more than putting them overground.  However, the concerns that the north-east pylon pressure group has raised cannot and should not be ignored.  As a result of its research and campaigning, the proposal to put the power lines overground has been discredited.  It is now accepted that it is possible to carry the electricity over a long distance underground.  This is being done in many countries around the world, so there is no plausible reason to prevent Ireland from doing so.  The issue of whether that electricity is alternating or direct current is an engineering red herring introduced by EirGrid to muddy the waters in this debate.</P>
        <P>The north-east pylon pressure group comprises decent, honest and concerned people.  They are representative of the people of the north-east on this issue, yet I am sorry to say that they have been treated disgracefully.  Their letters have not been answered nor have they received any response to requests for a meeting.  I ask the Minister to address this issue and meet them.</P>
        <P>Legislation has been proposed by the EU which would force companies such as EirGrid to put any such power lines underground.  While a date has yet to be set for legislation of this sort to come into effect, the Government could and should take the initiative by putting the power supplies underground.  In the Lower House, Fine Gael has put pressure on the Government to seek advice from independent consultants on the viability of placing the power lines underground.  If the Government had done this from the outset, the concerns of the people would have been addressed and these interconnectors could be built by now.  The delay is unacceptable and the approach that the Department has taken heretofore is disappointing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The consultants, Ecofys, are currently carrying out their investigation of the merits of underground versus overground and I look forward to analysing their findings, which will be published in July.  There are serious questions over their capability and their degree of independence from the Department.  I await their findings with an open mind.  The proof will be in the quality or otherwise of their report.</P>
        <P>I will finish because I have run out of time.  Overall, I support the Bill but I would ask the Minister to keep a close monitoring eye on EirGrid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire, an Teachta &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Riain go dt&iacute; an Teach inniu chun an Bhille t&aacute;bhachtach seo, an Bille um Rial&aacute;il Leictreachtais (Leas&uacute;) (EirGrid) 2008, a phl&eacute;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a very important Bill, as the Minister rightly underlined in his speech to the House.  It is interesting that in recent times at committee level, as Senators Joe O&rsquo;Toole and Martin Brady will be familiar, we have had both EirGrid and IMERA making submissions on interconnectors to us.  It is a welcome development.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill must be placed against the background of the energy market.  In this country we have had unprecedented economic growth over more than a decade and that has given rise to a considerable increase in electricity demand, which has been outstripping generating capacity.  The demand is projected to grow by 4% to 2010.  I hope that will materialise even though we seem to be in a period where economic growth has reached a plateau.  That is an issue for another debate.  In many ways all areas of infrastructure were being stretched when we were experiencing double-digit economic growth and that is the experience of every country that has had a such rapid increase in its economy.  It will do us no harm, provided we take the necessary prudent and cautionary measures to ensure that we do not slip into serious recession, for us to plateau for a period and then have more sustainable levels of growth.  Of course our growth rates in the future will be from a much higher economic level than we have had in the <Col N="394"/>past and therefore the quantum of the economic growth will be quite significant even if the percentages appear in lower single figures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have had a low level of international interconnection.  The Minister pointed out that North-South developments constitute a major step forward in creating an all-island electricity market.  Indeed, we are developing that in other ways in the economy as well.  That will be ultimately to the betterment of the people on both sides of this unfortunate partition on the island.  We are seeing the benefits in many areas and that will grow exponentially as it develops in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Historically, there has probably been significant underinvestment in the electricity network.  We have a high dependency on imported fuels, which has made us vulnerable to international fuel prices and which has contributed in part to the high electricity costs.  Unfortunately, our electricity prices are the second highest in Europe and are 50% above the EU average.  That is not a situation with which we should be comfortable or about which we should be complacent, and it is something we need to address.  If industry and jobs here are to be maintained and to grow into the future, competitiveness is an important issue for the economy and for many of those industries, not to mention householders, energy costs are a fairly significant factor.  The moves we are making in that direction are all positive and the interconnector is an important part of that.</P>
        <P>It is significant that Ireland is ranked among the three most expensive countries in Europe in terms of electricity costs for industrial consumers.  I hope the steps being taken on the renewable side will generate cost efficiencies.  Renewables will be good for the environment, but also it is important that we get a benefit from cost efficiencies in order to achieve the competitiveness to which we aspire.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our geographic isolation is a significant factor in all of this.  There will be not only North-South connection, but, indeed, once the east-west one is established, bearing in mind that England will also be connecting to mainland Europe, it is hoped there will be considerable benefits.  I noted that the Minister in his speech spoke of a regional development involving France, Britain and ourselves and that there can be some benefits, and economic savings, arising from that as well.</P>
        <P>Apart altogether from the cost implications, the fact that we are a peripheral island and that we are subject to imported fuels makes us vulnerable to security of supply.  It is important that steps are taken in that regard as well.  We saw within the past few years the issue arising from decisions by Gascom to curtail the supply to Europe of Russian gas being more or less politically rather than commercially motivated.  Being on the west coast of Europe, we need to be particularly conscious of that vulnerability and try as far as possible to obviate a situation where we are without supply.</P>
        <P>Competition is an essential feature of all of this as well.  The interconnector brings that also to the table in that it will allow us trade in electricity.  Indeed, the potential for market opportunities for export, should we find ourselves in that position in the future, is also there to be exploited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would be hopeful about the growth in wind energy.  There must be great potential for wave energy, if it can be harnessed economically and the technical mechanisms necessary can be achieved.  On a recent delegation with one of the Oireachtas committees to Brussels, we met a number of EU Commissioners.  The Energy Commissioner informed us that off the south-west coast of England there are fairly advanced studies being done.  In these Houses Members have raised previously a project off the Galway coast where people are endeavouring to develop technology that can harness wave energy.</P><Col N="395"/>
        <P Just="Left">Given that the sea is all around us &mdash; Dominic Behan was thankful for political reasons for that &mdash; for commercial reasons I hope in the future we will look to it as being a great asset.  It is not an asset we have exploited to anywhere near its potential.  It is totally underexploited, as many of our fishermen will tell us.  I listened with interest to what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan had to say on that earlier.  It is an area to which we could give much more emphasis and increased focus.  I understand that some part of the technical area surrounding this will entail high-voltage direct current transmission across the Irish Sea and this will involve conversion stations to convert from AC to DC on either side of the interconnector.</P>
        <P>EU regulations, as both the Minister and EirGrid pointed out, require full third party access to the interconnector.  In recent weeks and months there have been debates on Europe and the pros and cons have been enunciated by the different sides, but this is an area in which the European Union has been a very positive catalyst for generating transnational connectivity.  That is required to facilitate the effective implementation of the policy in place and to ensure consumers across the Community, including those on peripheral islands such as ourselves, will be beneficiaries of that common market in the trading of electricity.</P>
        <P>The Minister said the development of this interconnector by EirGrid is on target to be achieved by early 2012 and that it will have a 500 MW capacity.  It is important we allow private interconnectors.  If we can generate competition, there is no reason the public sector cannot be as good and efficient as the private sector.  If, however, a public or a private sector monopoly emerges, in general, the public sector will accumulate certain inefficiencies while the private sector will probably involve itself in profiteering.  It is essential we have competition in the area.  Within the regulations, there is a requirement for third party access on a fair and transparent basis.  The Commission for Energy Regulation will regulate and ensure there is a level playing field.</P>
        <P>We should try to achieve a less dominant contribution from the ESB to the overall capacity, which we have talked about for some time and which there has been great difficulty achieving.  I believe that is due to technical difficulties apart from anything else, and perhaps lack of investment because investment in energy requires significant capital.  There might be an opportunity through the interconnector to do that.  If it is done on an equal and fair basis, would it fit with that objective?</P>
        <P>If my figures are correct, this imported electricity will save us 2 million tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> per annum.  That is not an insignificant contribution to what we are trying to achieve in that area and is a very positive aspect.  The main thrust, however, should be to try to achieve lower prices for the consumer, whether commercial or private, in order that prices are closer to the EU average.</P>
        <P>Some 60% of our electricity is generated by gas, although this move will assist in reducing that.  Gas is a very clean fuel to use to generate electricity but it is also a primary source of energy.  We are using a primary source of energy to generate another one.  On the face of it, that seems wasteful of our energy resources.  I welcome the fact it will decrease but we will need to decrease the amount significantly to achieve the benefits we should get from gas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well with the legislation.  I am probably the only Member of either House who has a problem with it.  Having said that, nothing I have to say reflects in any way on the excellent people who operate EirGrid, whom I have met.  My problem with the Bill has nothing to do with them as I hold them in the highest of regard.  They are diligent, decent people who are good at their work.  That is not the issue nor is it a reflection on the Minister.</P><Col N="396"/>
        <P>I am looking down the line at what will happens afterwards, as I am required to do as a legislator.  I do not trust the unknown people who in 20 years&rsquo; time will be in charge of what the Minister is now in charge of.  My problem with this Bill is that we are bundling up and neatly packaging something which can be sold off the next time a Government has a problem.  That will happen and people will regret it.</P>
        <P>I saw the Minister nodding in agreement with Senator Jim Walsh on the question of carbon savings.  I do not believe the Senator is correct in that regard.  It will not be a carbon saving and there will be no gain because it is within Europe and I do not believe it will count.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that issue in his response.</P>
        <P>I have seen the development of the ESB over the years.  I have been a major supporter and at times a great critic of it.  What saddens me about this debate is that I am looking at a company, a management and a workforce which have been extraordinarily flexible.  The workforce has been reduced from 14,000 people less than 20 years ago to fewer than 8,000.  It did that in the interests of efficiency and of delivering.</P>
        <P>It is not that long ago since this was one of the cheapest electricity markets in Europe.  Some time after 2002 I argued that the price of electricity was being artificially forced up to invite in Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s friends in the private sector and to make it competitive for them.  I still have grave doubts about how it works.  I do not trust the private sector in this area and believe it will bury us.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the concept of a grid or the authority we are giving to EirGrid.  However, I would like to see EirGrid as part of an integrated system within the ESB.  The problem with discussing this is that the debate has not moved on.  What we are doing today is as important as the construction of the Ardnacrusha power station in the 1920s.  However, one would have great difficulty convincing the people of that.</P>
        <P>The Minister and I know that generation is no longer the name of the game.  We could stop generating as soon as we have this set up.  The real issue is that EirGrid will buy and sell.  Of course, it is open to the private sector, and so it should be.  If the private sector can produce as cheaply as the ESB, then it will be in the marketplace but so far, it has failed to do that and that is why it has not exactly been rushing into it.  It is quite extraordinary in that sense why people are missing that point.</P>
        <P>There are three aspects to this, namely, generation, the national grid and the network.  The network is what I call the bit that brings the power from the grid to houses.  In any other country where this has been done, it has created a problem.  I said to the Minister last year before he was appointed that in New Zealand, where they did exactly this, the grid company refused to pay the costs of connection to the network in the capital city of Wellington which was left without power, on and off, for approximately six weeks.  That happened in the past ten years as a direct result of the privatisation of the grid.  I know the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is not privatising the national grid, but his actions would allow it to be privatised very easily in future and there is no strategic reason for this.  I am not approaching this from any &ldquo;ism&rdquo; or philosophy.  There can be no strategic reason for letting go the reins on EirGrid.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s position and I agree on this point.</P>
        <P>This is a significant problem.  Throughout Europe, there is a significant concentration of power in the generation and transmission sectors.  The big player, effectively, is Electricit&eacute; de France, EDF.  It is buying companies throughout England and the UK and is looking at options here.  The company was mentioned in the House several times recently and it is examining developments in north County Louth and so on.  There is nobody scrutinising this.</P><Col N="397"/>
        <P Just="Left">A classic example of this lack of scrutiny is that the people of counties Cavan, Monaghan and north County Meath are concerned about the high tension cable planned for the area.  I will return to this topic later.  I guarantee that the Deputies and Senators from north County Dublin and north County Wicklow still have not woken up to the fact that similar high tension cables are planned to come across the Irish Sea and will come ashore in north County Dublin and north County Wicklow.  There will be a new variation of thought on this matter and I believe it is worth examining.</P>
        <P>I do not understand some of the technicalities and I would like to know more.  I understand the power in these cables will come across under the sea as direct current, DC, and that it must be changed to alternating current, AC.  I previously investigated the possibility of putting underground the remainder of the cable as DC and this requires a substation &mdash; I suppose it is called an inverter &mdash; to change the current from DC to AC.  The substation needs to be very large and many would need to be constructed.  In the meantime I have discovered the option of high tension light, which is a lighter version requiring a smaller conversion or inverter substation.  I would like this option examined for the people of Cavan-Monaghan and north County Meath.</P>
        <P>It seems the conditions required for installing high tension cable in the North are different from here.  In the North the distance between private residences and the cable is a certain number of metres whereas, the last time I checked, the required distance here was less, but I am open to correction on this matter.  At least, we should not worsen the situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I saw people on the 9 o&rsquo;clock news holding up fluorescent tubes which began lighting up underneath the high tension cable.  Any normal person would think it is significant that the tubes are being lit in these circumstances and that there must be implications for him or her.  Such a reaction is normal and this issue does not affect me directly.  This matter is worth examining.  We should put underground any such cables within an agreed distance from private dwellings or from any conurbations or villages and so on.  This guarantee should be given and factored into the costing.</P>
        <P>I discovered a similar situation recently in the south of France where there are two huge lines under construction between France and Spain over the Pyrenees.  The Minister will be delighted as a member of the Green Party to know these huge pylons are being constructed straight over the beautiful mountains up one side and down the other, with nobody being listened to along the way.  There has been significant opposition to this by the group, Non &agrave; la tr&egrave;s haute tension, THT.  The mayors of all towns in the affected areas by the Pyrenees are opposed to this.  The last time I checked I saw an announcement stating EDF, which is the company involved, is conceding a degree of underground cabling.  I wish to know if this is the case because if it is, it undermines some of the arguments that EirGrid and the Minister have been offered to date which make the case that this is the method of choice throughout Europe.  We need to be reassured about developments.  What we should have is an integrated system, where the generation, transmission grid and the network are all part of one body and that one of these cannot be packaged and let float off.</P>
        <P>Irish people do not realise that nearly 2% of power here is nuclear-generated at present.  There are people discussing the merits of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the nuclear debate.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has asked previously for a debate on the nuclear issue and I have no objection to this.  However, people should recognise the developments that have been made in the area of nuclear fusion as opposed to fission and the possible options for generating power in the future in a safer way to now.</P>
        <P>At present, EDF has been supported by its Government in devious ways and in ways not clearly recognisable.  They have done what our Government could not do under European <Col N="398"/>legislation.  EDF now owns the two main connections from Russia through to western Europe and extending down to the Iberian peninsula.  It is buying and selling power every day at trough rates in eastern Europe and selling it at peak rates in western Europe, because with the two or three hour delay, this is how it works.  I do not know whether other members of the House are aware that the price of electricity changes with every hour of the day.  EirGrid will buy and sell power hourly, not daily, weekly or monthly.  It needs extra power available at various times.</P>
        <P>I wish to hear more about the elements of storage.  I understand EirGrid will also have responsibility for Turlough Hill power station, which I welcome.  The station in Turlough Hill pumps up water during trough times when demand is low.  Instead of selling the power to houses it is used to pump water and when it is needed, the water flows down running the turbines and more electricity is created.  There is approximately an 80% return on power generated.  In other words, for the amount of electricity used to pump up the water, we can sell approximately 80% afterward, so there is a 20% loss.  I do not know why more has not been done in the area of hydrogen storage which provides a 100% return and I believe more could be done with storage.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of smart metering and the support for micro-generation is not happening quickly enough.  I do not understand the reason it is possible to get a grant for installing solar panels but not for a micro-generator or a wind generator.  We should examine these options and they should be connected to the national grid.  I agree with the comments of Senator Jim Walsh in this regard.  Those generating power should be able to supply the grid whether it comes from solar panels, wind generation or other sources.  There is much to be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not the elements in this Bill which concern me but what could be done with our work.  This could be a very nasty piece of work allowing for the loss of control of our electricity supply.  It does not matter how much power is generated if its flow cannot be controlled.  One could own 24 Ardnacrusha-type power stations but if a privatised EirGrid in the future indicated it did not want power from those sources on a given day because it was buying power from EDF in Berlin or Russia or somewhere else, then they are of no use and I do not think people recognise this.  This is the reason I want the system integrated so that if we are generating power, we can use it.  Senator Walsh may not be aware that the market could be opened to the private sector, but this does not mean the power would be bought.  Our sources of power might be connected but there will not be any sale if the EirGrid of the future decides it wants to buy from EDF or from Spain.  There has been no debate on this matter.  I have not met one person in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas who understands that simple point.  Such people think power generation is important, but it is utterly unimportant.  When this Bill is enacted we could close down every source of power generation in the country and we would not even notice.  I am concerned we are setting up something which would allow this as a possibility in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in his opening contribution stated this Bill was an important part of Government energy policy and an important priority within the Government&rsquo;s set of priorities, and that the existence of the programme for Government shows its commitment towards energy in general.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important one.  Some of its general principles have been examined by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  Its essential principle was agreed in a previous Act which provided for a stand-alone distribution company as opposed to a generation company.  Some of the fears expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole continue to be real.  I agree that the electricity distribution system is a vital piece of infrastructure.  I do not believe there will be any political demand, in the short to <Col N="399"/>medium term, for the privatisation of this country&rsquo;s electricity grid system.  Any movement in that regard should be met with great reluctance.</P>
        <P>The Bill outlines how the electricity grid can be added to.  Some such projects are under way.  The development of the North-South interconnector has not been without controversy.  The development of an east-west interconnector is being considered.  It is possible that an interconnector between Ireland and continental Europe will be developed in the near future.  I would like to address each of those three projects.</P>
        <P>It makes eminent sense, in the context of the all-island electricity market, that we develop a North-South interconnector.  The infrastructure that will accompany the interconnector has been the subject of a great deal of controversy.  The Minister acted wisely when he initiated a survey.  The survey may not provide the answers that would please the public in the areas concerned.  We should constantly strive to ensure there is public confidence in the system.  It is no secret that Green Party public representatives in counties like Louth and Monaghan have expressed their reservations publicly.  The Minister and the Department face a difficult task in squaring that circle.  I am sure the final result will be the development of an interconnector that provides the electricity needed by everyone on this island and an electricity market from which we all can benefit.</P>
        <P>We should also look forward to the development of an east-west interconnector.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion that Ireland&rsquo;s use of a certain amount of electricity from the British market, a certain percentage of which is generated from nuclear sources, means that we use a certain amount of nuclear-generated electricity each year is based on a mathematical assumption.  An alternative way of looking at that equation is used in this country&rsquo;s electricity generation market.  Some people sign up to Airtricity services on the basis that they will receive electricity from renewable sources, even though they are aware that the electricity in question comes through an electricity grid that does not distinguish between renewable and other sources of energy.</P>
        <P>Matters will become more problematic if a third interconnector is developed, this time between Ireland and continental Europe.  It is likely that such a connector would be between Ireland and France, which has an electricity system that is 80% derived from nuclear sources.  In such circumstances, we would have to ask ourselves questions of the type Senator O&rsquo;Toole has raised during this debate.  It is much more difficult to distinguish between electricity generated from nuclear and other sources in a country like France in which nuclear power is such a predominant policy choice.</P>
        <P>I would like to comment on some other issues relating to the electricity grid.  The Minister is still trying to deal with a challenge in that regard, although the ESB&rsquo;s 20-year investment programme might help him to overcome it.  I refer to the ability of new participants in the electricity generation sector, especially those producing electricity from renewable sources, to become active participants in accessing the existing grid.  Those who are involved in the renewable sector, or want to get involved in that sector, find it difficult to connect the power they produce to the grid.  One of the benefits of the quick enactment of this Bill will be the development of a new way of addressing these problems.  The past reluctance to facilitate new arrivals on the market seems to be dissipating.  Such reluctance, which stemmed from a form of engineering conservatism, should not be part of our energy future.  Many people in the system continue to take a conservative approach to new ideas.  They feel that systems that worked in the past should continue to be used in the present.  They think that any attempt to accept innovation will cause problems in the future.</P>
        <P>If we are to develop a post-oil economy, we will have to adopt diverse approaches to technology.  Political responses to new technology need to be encouraging and accommodating. <Col N="400"/> While the Minister has been proactive in that regard, much needs to be done to address the deep-seated prejudices that exist in certain organisations.  Such bodies need to adapt to meet the new realities.  I hope this Bill represents an attempt to address such issues.  It has my support, and that of my colleagues in this House, on those grounds.</P>
        <P>The final issue I wish to discuss is the ability of EirGrid to meet its infrastructural needs through its own and other resources.  It is obvious that decisions about the future of public expenditure are being taken at this time.  The Government has prioritised certain infrastructural projects.  There are many enabling mechanisms in this legislation that will allow EirGrid, as a stand-alone organisation, to address its own financial needs in the financial markets.  That should be encouraged on one level because infrastructure is needed and the company&rsquo;s financial load needs to be organised properly.  I am concerned that part of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s argument will prove to be true if EirGrid does not need to meet a certain proportion of the cost of the infrastructure that is to be developed in the energy sector in the years to come.  If the company has the ability to meet the financial commitments associated with the establishment of new infrastructure without assistance from the Government, it will be able to put more distance between itself and the Government and thereby have the ability to control that infrastructure in the future.  I ask the Minister to respond to that suggestion at the end of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation.  I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and the subsequent contributions of colleagues on all sides of the House.  The Bill, which has been strongly welcomed in general, will continue to be necessary as we make further progress in the interests of securing our energy supply.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that we are debating electricity supply and distribution, in the context of our co-operation with other countries, a week or two after the great debate on the Lisbon treaty referendum.  It is possible that interconnectors will mean that we get electricity not just from the United Kingdom but also from continental Europe.  The debate on the possibility of connecting our electricity system with that of other countries is an indication of our interdependence with our neighbours in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, regardless of our decision on the Lisbon treaty.  We must all work together on issues such as energy supply and climate change if we are to make progress.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions of this legislation.  I am pleased that powers will be devolved to EirGrid to allow it to make progress with the system of electricity supply.  A limited degree of progress has been made with the North-South system.  We are now providing for similar progress to be made with the east-west scheme.  The general political consensus in this House in that respect is the sooner, the better.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that security of electricity supply is of significant importance to the economy of this island.  If we are to preserve and expand economic activity, we will need to have a reliable, consistent and guaranteed source of electricity.  There have been a number of stories.  Senator McFadden spoke about the most recent threat to our electricity supply.  We have to recognise that our electricity supplies have been threatened over the past five or six years, during which time there has been an enormous increase in this country&rsquo;s economic activity.  The electricity blackouts of the 1970s resulted from the oil crisis and the lack of generating capacity.  It was a question of supply rather than demand.  In recent times the threat of electricity blackouts has stemmed from the great physical demand for electricity in this country.  It is a good thing that there is such demand but it is worrying that on a few occasions, apparently, we almost reached the point of having the lights literally go out, if I may be excused the pun.  Having the intercon<Col N="401"/>nector up and running and providing a consistent and constant supply is good for industry and for the country.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>This debate is welcome. I support the proposals and acknowledge that the ongoing need for energy security and supply must be addressed but we must also try to keep attention focused on the other side of the equation &mdash; energy conservation.  That is never as popular a subject for debate as are energy generation or regeneration from renewables, nor does it get the same attention.  We could do much more about energy conservation across every institution in this State.  We need only look at the 25 light bulbs burning in this Chamber, presumably none being of the modern energy-saving nature.  In every house and office much more progress could be made in the area of energy conservation.  That needs further attention from the Minister and from the Government because it is a big part of the equation in respect of long-term energy supply.  I ask the Minister to address this matter in the future by way of legislation or regulation.  We need strong rules regarding saving of energy in so far as it can be done domestically, commercially and in industry.</P>
        <P>The Bill mentions the interconnector and I support the concept.  The fact that we are now to import energy from the United Kingdom and possibly thereafter from Europe brings to the fore the question of electricity generated by nuclear power.  A number of my colleagues mentioned this point.  It is good that we have reached the stage of maturity in this country that we can have a sensible debate on nuclear power.  Perhaps we tiptoe towards it but the country has changed greatly and so has technology.  Our economy and society have changed since the great debate, or non-debate, about Carnsore Point in Senator Walsh&rsquo;s county back in 1977 or thereabouts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 1978 to 1979.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>On that occasion Ireland said a big &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the concept of nuclear power but now when we are on the verge of importing further supplies of nuclear-generated electricity from the United Kingdom, it is incumbent on us to have a mature debate on future possibilities in respect of electricity generated in this way.  The Minister has indicated on several occasions a willingness to open that debate, which would be helpful and welcome.  We cannot run from the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is one side of the technology of electricity generation.  On the other side there is generation from renewable sources and micro-generation, which was referred to by several speakers, including Senator Walsh.  We must encourage and facilitate the maximum amount of domestic generation of electricity.  I think in particular of farms in rural Ireland where the physical capacity exists to permit a small windmill-type process.  I am not an expert in the technology but undoubtedly this capacity exists.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out that grant aid is available, although now somewhat reduced, for certain energy projects such as solar and geothermal generation of heat.  It would be helpful, even if on a trial basis, if the Minister were to consider some type of grant aid to allow a limited number of people and households to generate their own supply of electricity.  If electricity can be generated domestically and locally from environmentally friendly sources, which in most cases would be wind, that is a win-win situation.  We should welcome it and try to put it in place.</P>
        <P>The solution to our broader energy needs will not come from one source alone and the interconnector will play a significant role, possibly the major role, in years to come.  There is the possibility to maximise the number of people who generate their own sources of electricity and that should be encouraged.</P><Col N="402"/>
        <P>I know that there has been a difficulty concerning the buying back into the grid of locally generated electricity.  I am not entirely up to speed on the regulations and legislation in that regard.  Perhaps some progress has been made but if not, we should try to advance that part of the equation.  In cases of which I was made aware, a number of people were put off from considering the generation of their own electricity.</P>
        <P>My comments are more broad than they are deep but I welcome the legislation and look forward to progress being made by EirGrid.  I appeal again to the Minister to scrutinise the issue of energy conservation in a fresh way and also to look at possibilities for local and domestically generated sources of power.  Our country is surrounded by waves of a substantial nature and it appears that we are blown away by winds almost every second day.  There must be many answers to our energy problems right here and these must be harvested to the maximum extent.</P>
              </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of this Bill and am glad to see it going through the Seanad.  I especially welcome it because it establishes EirGrid as a separate entity.  This was something that had to be done.  I listened to previous speakers who worried about the possible privatisation of the power industry.  They have nothing at all to fear.  That is partly why EirGrid had to be separated from the ESB and established on an independent basis.  The grid is vital to the distribution of energy and therefore must remain in public ownership.  Although competitive forces have worked in other areas and, by definition, provide better results for us, true competition could not occur in this country until the grid was separated from the generating capacity provided by the ESB.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Others may argue &mdash; Senator O&rsquo;Toole was of this opinion to some degree &mdash; that competition has been detrimental to the energy market.  I agree with them in some instances.  The power market is completely different from any other kind and is not subject to the usual market criteria.  I do not believe that what we were required to do in terms of liberalisation as a result of European Union directives has worked in this country.  Unfortunately, it has scared off any notion of competition within the power generation sector.  That is not a good thing.  The Bill gives that strength to a newly established EirGrid.  Many players in the energy sector were concerned that it was only lip-service and that EirGrid was not to be separate from the ESB, but it is finally established.  I know that EirGrid itself was keen to ensure it would be seen as entirely independent.  It is an important step in the future development of our energy market that this should be the case.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P Just="Left">I particularly welcome the establishment of an interconnector.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point that this is as significant as the setting up of Ardnacrusha which I believe was in 1923.  The interconnector provides us with the ability to develop our wind capacity.  Without the required investment, it would not be possible.  Having observed the energy market closely over the past five years and noted the moratorium on wind projects, I realise the grid did not have sufficient capacity.</P>
        <P>Part of the reason for the increase in electricity prices is the investment required to make up for the lack of investment in the past.  Energy prices, including electricity prices, were kept at an artificially low level, which suited us, but this has now caught up with us.  We need to make the investments that need to be made in the grid, particularly as we are connecting with Britain and further into Europe through the interconnector.  It is a vital infrastructural component because it deals with the big problem of security of supply.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>I very much look forward to us talking about having an interconnector extending directly to Europe because this would not only allow power to be supplied to us, as a peripheral nation, but would also allow us to sell power back to Europe, particularly given our wind capacity.  I have no doubt that we will be able to generate more electricity and, as a consequence, funds for ourselves.  The necessary investment is very timely and particularly important.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the forthcoming publication of EirGrid&rsquo;s transmission development strategy to 2025.  This is also very timely.  The Minister did not refer to micro-generation, of which he is a fan.  We are all becoming more energy savvy.  I refer not only to farmers but also to those constructing their own houses, on which one can have one&rsquo;s own windmill.  We could sell electricity to the grid but we will not be able to do so unless the necessary investment is made in the grid.  I hope the transmission development strategy will take cognisance of the considerable possibilities that exist.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security invited EirGrid to a meeting to discuss the interconnector relatively recently.  I am worried about the financing of the project.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole alluded to this.  It will be more difficult to finance it than originally envisaged but we cannot afford to let it slip.  In the past, when economic circumstances were a little tighter, we failed to invest in fundamental infrastructure.  I hope we have learned from this and that the interconnector project will not suffer as a consequence.</P>
        <P>I am worried about the cost to the end user.  Investments by EirGrid have increased the price of electricity.  People are very conscious of the increases in their domestic bills and it is also a major problem for industry.  I know from multinational companies in particular that the cost of electricity in Ireland is a major worry.  It is now higher up on the agenda and we need to be very careful about it.  We will price ourselves out of the market if we do not keep an eye on rising costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill provides us with an opportunity to consider our direction regarding energy development.  It is always good to have the opportunity to think about what we are doing and where we are going.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not mention micro-generation in his contribution.  I accept the Bill&rsquo;s scope does not extend beyond interconnection but, as is the way, all these matters are tied together.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its swift passage and implementation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  We can remember the times when electricity supplies failed, not only when I was growing up but also later.  In the past 40 or 50 years, we have been very fortunate in that when one turns on the switch one knows there will be electricity available.  When one goes abroad one notices the hotels one stays in always have candles beside the beds because they are so used to the supplies failing.</P>
        <P>My father had a holiday camp in Skerries and installed a generator in the 1950s because he knew he had to rely on electricity for various reasons.  On the odd occasion, when all of Skerries went black and my father&rsquo;s holiday camp had bright lights, it was generally assumed he had some political pull.  This was because he was the only person able to have an electricity supply regardless of its availability elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We all believed the candles were for romantic reasons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps they were.</P>
        <P>The idea of providing for the transfer of ownership of the electricity assets from the ESB to EirGrid is one we must accept on the basis that there will be competition, thus lowering the <Col N="404"/>price, as Senator O&rsquo;Malley suggested.  I am a little confused in this regard.  I read about the Competition Authority welcoming the move because real competition was necessary but it seems real competition sometimes becomes almost more important than the price.  This has happened in the electricity market recently in that the price sometimes had to increase in order to encourage competition.  This seems to be operating back to front.  Competition is essential and should lower prices but, in order to attract other operators, we sometimes allow prices to increase rather than decrease.  I question the increasing of prices to create competition, of which I am fully in favour and which I advocate.  The process should be the other way around.</P>
        <P>On Wednesday, 18 June, the European Parliament voted in Strasbourg in favour of legislation to force big power utilities to sell off their distribution networks.  The MEPs believe such a move would boost competition in the European Union&rsquo;s energy markets in that taking control away from powerful groups would encourage new entrants.  The vote does not mean such a law will be passed but industry sources said some days ago that it could influence the EU Council of Ministers, which has the final say on the issue, to favour introducing such a law.  Some member states, particularly France and Germany, which are home to big power companies such as E.ON and EDF, are opposed to the move.  If a law were introduced in the Union to make markets much more liberalised, would it not leave utilities in Ireland vulnerable to takeovers by energy companies such as the giant Russian company Gazprom?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the construction of an interconnector between Wexford and Wales.  I was impressed by the target completion date, which I read was originally 2010.  The Minister referred to a completion date before the end of 2012.  Is this a realistic target?  When will it be decided whether the Government plans to permit EirGrid to borrow all the money required?  Will it rely on taxpayers&rsquo; money to partially fund the project as part of an arrangement involving a private operator building an east-west interconnector that will provide an alternative energy source?  Will the Government be able to afford the project and how does the State intend to assist in the funding of the interconnector?  This will clearly have an impact on EirGrid&rsquo;s borrowing requirements.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford urged that we include nuclear energy as part of the future debate.  While it is not under discussion at present, I have a daughter who lives in France and I was highly impressed when I saw her electricity bill because it states the source of the energy and how much of it came from nuclear power.  A substantial proportion does so in France, as approximately 70% of its electricity comes from nuclear power.  While I do not argue in favour of nuclear power, the debate should be opened.  I recently heard the Englishman, Professor Robert Pickard, speaking in favour of the nuclear power although the figures he provided were horrific.  As far as can be ascertained, even if one buries nuclear waste in deep caverns, it will last for 300,000 years.  Clearly, a major problem exists, not about nuclear power as such, but how one manages to get rid of the waste afterwards.</P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I have been impressed to hear discussions on micro-generators and whether enough is being done in this regard.  I heard a man speaking on radio last week about using the water and rivers in County Donegal to produce power.  He had three or four sources of electricity coming from micro-generators attached to small rivers and streams in his own locality.</P>
        <P>I refer to two other points that were raised.  The first pertains to watching our energy costs and the move to more efficient lamp bulbs.  As an aside, it is interesting to note that although steps in this regard have not yet been taken in this House, perhaps they will be.  However, the trade defence instruments used by the EU have delayed the importation of efficient lamp bulbs <Col N="405"/>from China and elsewhere.  This is to protect the lamp bulb industry, probably in Germany or wherever it is located.  While I believe we must get that balance right, not enough has been done in the aforementioned area of energy conservation.  If that is the case, the trade defence instruments that are in place to protect European industries clearly are not acting in the best interests of such conservation.</P>
        <P>As for the other issue I will touch on, I appeared on the &ldquo;Tubridy Tonight&rdquo; television show almost two years ago and was asked whether, were I to go into business now, I would go into the same business as I did 40 or 50 years ago.  I replied I would not and that were I to do so now, areas I would consider would include energy conservation and the creation of new sources of energy.  Having mentioned this, I was amazed by the volume of information that reached me via the post and otherwise.  It came from people who were investing heavily, and in a highly entrepreneurial fashion, in wave, tidal, solar, wind and a number of other technologies I had not even thought of previously.  Clearly, some will achieve a breakthrough and will enable us to benefit therefrom.  I am confident that Ireland should continue to encourage and to invest.  Moreover, when investing in education and in science and technology in particular, we must ensure we do so in many different ways.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by a company from University College Cork that has developed a lamp bulb with so many benefits that the company has managed to sell it worldwide in different ways.  While such enterprises are small, they are based on science and technology and Ireland must continue to encourage that.  Our options should include ensuring that we encourage people to take up science and technology.  While there has been a drift away from such subjects in schools, it may be possible to so do as I have heard recently that the provision of more points for maths and other subjects might encourage students to choose such options for their leaving certificates.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied by the Bill&rsquo;s introduction and believe it constitutes the correct way to proceed.  Members should encourage the Minister and the steps being taken in this regard.  However, the cart must not be put before the horse, as the objective is to benefit Ireland, its citizens and those who will invest in Ireland in future.  It is to ensure the presence of a reliable and price-conscious network with automatic competition that will facilitate price reductions and will encourage industry to come to Ireland and use its electricity.  I thank the Minister for his comments and his encouragement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome both the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, and the Bill.  While I agree with the Bill&rsquo;s contents, like my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, I have some reservations regarding EirGrid and the ESB <i>per se</i> in the future.  Although the Minister indicated earlier there would be no question of privatisation, Members have heard that previously in respect of Telecom &Eacute;ireann, which is about to gain its fourth owner within the space of a few years.  The result has been that customers have received poorer services at increased costs and a considerable number of staff were shed.  I am fearful in this regard because as Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, when the going gets rough, the easiest thing to do is to sell off the family silver, forget about it and to allow someone else mind the shop.  This is one of my main concerns.</P>
        <P>Some of the principal benefits of the interconnection include the enhanced security of supply.  I believe significant capacity is available in the generating market in the United Kingdom to provide security of supply through the interconnector for Ireland.  In addition, the United Kingdom is developing interconnectors with mainland Europe to further contribute to security of supply and market integration.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley raised the question of prices, increases to the customer and so on and this is a matter about which Members must be highly vigilant.  One should put the customer first but there is little if any mention of the customer <i>per se</i> in this Bill.  As for customers, the people in counties Cavan and Monaghan and elsewhere in that region who are complaining should be listened to.  I concur with previous speakers that they should be listened to because they are customers who believe their livelihoods, in respect of milk supplies from cattle and other animals, will be affected by this issue.  If this is the case, they should be facilitated in some way.</P>
        <P>While I am not love bombing Senator O&rsquo;Toole, he mentioned other sources of energy in the House, one of which is water.  Years ago mills operated in abundance throughout the country but in the northern part in particular, including counties Cavan, Monaghan and Armagh, which kept going factories, tanneries and mills.  This type of energy is available and is ready to go and consideration definitely should be given to harnessing it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the long-term sustainability of EirGrid, which is a semi-State company.  As Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Quinn have noted, unless one invests in the infrastructure, customers will receive a poorer service.  This happened in other companies, such as Eircom, where the infrastructure has been stripped down and no investment has taken place.  Members must be vigilant in this regard.  While one could delve into many more aspects of this Bill, in general I welcome it.</P>

	<P>I thank Members for the highly constructive debate on this Bill.  In particular, I thank them for their expressions of support for the Bill and their appreciation of the significant benefits the interconnector may bring in respect of enhanced competitiveness, improved security of supply and increased penetration of renewable generation, an issue to which a number of Members referred.  It is unusual to bring before the House a Bill for which there is such widespread support and this is greatly appreciated.  I wish to assure Members that all possible steps are being taken to ensure the east-west connector is expedited and that the costs will be minimised.  The issue of increasing energy costs is of key importance and the Government is committed to increasing competition in the electricity and gas markets as the best way to mitigate higher energy tariffs in the long term.</P>
        <P>I wish to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to retaining State ownership of strategic energy infrastructure, including the transmission and distribution networks and the east-west connector.  Senator Brady has expressed some concern in this regard.  We had a certain experience with Eircom, to which the Senator referred, but we have no intention of going down the same road this time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators raised technical issues on putting transmission lines underground.  The Minister dealt with this.  We set up an independent body to carry out a study on this and its report will be published very soon.  While the interconnector may not reduce the amount of carbon provided at EU level, it may assist us in lowering the cost associated with carbon.  The Bill also provides that the costs may be recovered through transmission charges.  Under the oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation, EirGrid is working to ensure the burden for energy consumers is minimised.</P>
        <P>The competitive process to select a developer for this project is not yet complete, so the details of the financial package for the project have not yet been finalised.  I hope we can address this issue in greater detail at some stage in the near future.</P>
        <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  As in the D&aacute;il, there is support on all sides for the Bill and Members seem happy to see the Bill go through the Houses as quickly as possible. <Col N="407"/> I am sure they will be co-operative in facilitating that.  I look forward to further discussion of the Bill on Committee, Report and Final Stages.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am concerned about what has happened to the bus market in Dublin in light of the fact that a private operator is being forced to stop services next week.  What has happened is the kind of thing that the Government has promised to deal with over the past ten years.  A private company had been successfully providing a service that was not provided before &mdash; from Lucan and Rathfarnham to the city centre &mdash; and commuters had become very dependent on it.  Dublin Bus claims it has been operating within the guidelines, and it may be the case that is has not exceeded them.  However, it is clear that there is not a level playing field.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus operates its buses with certain subsidies, affording it certain advantages.  It is contrary to any principles that it would exploit those advantages to crush a competitor, but that is effectively what happened this week.  I do not think we can stand over this kind of practice.  When the Minister was in the House dealing with the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, I expressed my concerns about the need to update the 1932 Act.  He indicated that the Bill was a priority for him, but that he would get around to the Act later.  I accept that everything cannot be done in one day, but what signals are we giving Dublin commuters and private providers by allowing this kind of thing to happen?</P>
        <P>I know the Minister is not pleased by the way Dublin Bus has conducted itself in this matter.  The company may be technically correct in operating within the regulations but there is no way the State wants public money to be used to chase a private operator.  Companies should go after business and this service was originally instigated because Dublin Bus chose not to provide the service.  In my own area of Dalkey, we have a service to Dublin Airport, known as the Patton Flyer.  It is long overdue but Mr. Patton was obliged to operate beyond the law because he was waiting for two years to obtain a licence.  It is not correct that the process should take that length of time, and the Department needs to look at it.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness in the transport industry has worked very well, especially in the aviation industry and shipping.  Why should it not be the case for buses as well?</P>
        <P Just="Left">From every viewpoint we need to improve public transport, including from a climate change, transportation and congestion point of view.  We constantly talk about how to get people to use public transport.  Initiatives such as the Luas, the DART and improvements to the latter have encouraged people to use public transport.  However, when a private operator is supplying a good reliable service and then the public operator comes in behind to try to crush him or her, that does not serve a purpose for anybody, and least of all the reputation of public transport.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P Just="Left">It has been a struggle to get much of the direct information from Dublin Bus concerning the commercial viability of particular routes.  A way around this has been through integrated ticketing, where one could clearly see what are the margins on particular routes.  The State should be applying the subsidy where it is needed and to whom it is needed.  We should not support bus routes that do not need a subsidy.  It is like drawing teeth, I know, getting this information from Dublin Bus.  In truth, however, it is not good enough that we have had to wait.  This is the very information by which we can make informed decisions with regard to where we need to apply a public service obligations subsidy so that we can provide a better public service on particular routes.  I accept the Minister is seeking to get this done.  However, this week we reached a crisis in terms of what happened this week with Circle Line.  I hope it proves to be a catalyst in developing change.</P>
        <P>I also hope the Minister of State will be able to demonstrate to commuters that we value them and want them to use the public bus service.  Consumers do not care who owns the bus or who is running it, as long as it is reliable.  I should like to believe we can depend, deliver and develop a competitive bus market for the commuters of Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for raising the matter.  On behalf of Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I am glad of the opportunity to outline to the House the arrangements planned to upgrade bus services in the Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Bus services are and will remain the predominant mode of public transport in the Dublin area.  More than 147 million passengers were carried by bus in the greater Dublin area in 2007, while 28.4 million were carried on Luas and over 20 million on the DART.  The challenge now is to decide how best, building on the achievements to date and in the context of legislative reform, we can ensure that the optimal arrangements are in place for the planning and delivery of bus services in the greater Dublin area with a view to achieving further expansion and enhancement of public bus services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of priorities have been identified in the Agreed Programme for Government in this area.  The programme contains a commitment to expedite the establishment of a Dublin transport authority, which will have the necessary powers to ensure the delivery of the integrated public transport system envisioned under Transport 21.  The Senator will be aware that the Dublin Transport Authority Bill has been discussed in this House and is currently before the D&aacute;il.  Hopefully, it will be completed by the summer recess.</P>
        <P>The Bill establishes a comprehensive framework which will give the new Dublin transport authority the power to procure public passenger transport services through the making of public service transport contracts.  Section 48 of the Bill envisages that the DTA may enter into contracts following open tendering in respect of public bus passenger services, as well as metro and light rail services.  It also provides that public bus and rail services can be secured by means of direct award contracts.  However, section 52 provides that direct award contracts will only apply to the continued provision of the services currently being provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the future growth in the market for subvented public bus services will be pursued by way of open tendering in accordance with the new EU Regulation 1370/2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road.  All contracts will be framed against the background of EU law, will set strict standards of operational performance and customer service and will contain penalties for non-performance.</P><Col N="409"/>
        <P>The provisions of the Bill seek to maintain a balance between the need for transport services, including bus passenger transport services, that are the subject of a public service obligation and the licensing of private transport operators who provide commercial bus transport services and are licensed under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932.  It will be a matter for the DTA to procure the provision of public transport services and in so doing to determine whether or not a public service obligation should be applied in respect of particular services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, to facilitate the optimum provision of services by providing a level playing field for all market participants, both public and private.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will follow the Dublin Transport Authority Bill in subsequent legislative proposals to be contained in a public transport regulation Bill.  The new Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State bus companies.  The new bus licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU PSO regulation.  It is envisaged that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, and that the powers to grant licences in the greater Dublin area will be given to the Dublin transport authority.  Pending regulatory reform, the Department of Transport continues to licence applications from private bus operators within the Dublin region, as per the old legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is confident that the Dublin Transport Authority Bill when enacted will facilitate an important initial step in the reform of the bus market in the greater Dublin area to the benefit of both public and private operators and, of even more importance, in the interests of the travelling public in general.  This will be followed in due course by the next phase of the bus reform programme in the public transport regulation Bill.  That is basically what Department officials have been doing.  They have been working on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, which will soon be enacted.  As soon as it is, full attention will be given to reform of the 1932 Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What happened last week regarding Circle Line was unfortunate.  Mr. Morton has made a number of allegations.  It is not the first time he has made them.  There have been numerous complaints to the Department, which were relayed to Dublin Bus.  Dublin Bus would deny the allegations and it is not for me to adjudicate on how much validity was in the complaints.  Circle Line believes that Dublin Bus put many services on the routes where it was unnecessary.  However, the city is developing and evolving and it is difficult to be a Solomon on some of these issues.  When the Dublin Transport Authority Bill is passed and the new legislation is introduced, reforming the 1932 Act &mdash; about which we have been talking for decades &mdash; this will provide for new services into the future over and above any expansion of bus services in the city.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bus will be very important in the city in the future, particularly when the construction works on the metro and interconnector lines are under way.  In the event the bus will be king for a certain length of time, because there may not be room for everyone on the road.  Bus services are and will remain very important to the city.  The passing of these two Bills will hopefully mean the problems that arose last week will be a thing of the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I agree with him in regard to the role and importance of bus transport.  Buses represent good value for money and new bus routes and services can be quickly implemented.  Particularly in these tightening econ<Col N="410"/>omic circumstances, we will be dependent on private operators to provide bus services.  It is not necessary to have public buses on a route; it does not matter who provides the service.</P>
        <P>Changing the 1932 legislation has been talked about for a long time.  The Road Transport Act was produced in 1932 to curtail bus services because they were in competition with the railways.  In such a dynamic economy, it is appalling such restrictive legislation is still in use.  As the Minister of State said, our duty is to the consumer and Dublin&rsquo;s commuters.  Dublin Bus has done itself a disservice.  The Minister of State is not best pleased with how the company conducted itself in this matter.  This cherry-picking practice will not be tolerated and Members, now wise to it, will watch developments carefully.  I look forward to the swift implementation of the amended 1932 Act and a dynamic bus service, not just in Dublin, but across the country.</P>
