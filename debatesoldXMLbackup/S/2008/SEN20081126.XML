      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, the director general of F&Aacute;S, Mr. Rody Molloy, fell on his sword, such was the public outrage about the information that had come into the public domain over the weekend and in recent weeks.  It was an outrage which was felt very deeply by the public.  We all heard people&rsquo;s reaction to the information that became public.  It was an outrage that the Taoiseach and, indeed, the Green Party, did not seem to share.  It appears the Taoiseach, on Monday, defended what was happening.  The details that emerged pointed to enormous mismanagement of a State agency.</P>
        <P>Reflecting on this, it seems to be fascinating that a public servant, rightly, falls on his sword on the basis of such revelations, but we never see a Minister taking responsibility for serious decisions that have impacted on people&rsquo;s lives.  The Minister for Health and Children continues to hold her seat in Cabinet, despite the withdrawal of the cervical cancer vaccine and the deaths of women around the country through misdiagnoses, with the HSE clearly not being managed properly in its new incarnation.  The Minister for Education and Science continues to hold his seat despite the appalling withdrawal of frontline services.</P>
        <P>The last e-mail I received last night was from a principal in Lucan who had received a letter from the social inclusion section of the Department of Education and Science.  He said it put the tin hat on the damage that has been caused to his school.  He was referring to the withdrawal yesterday of the home-school liaison teacher who has been in the school since 1990, on top of other losses in the school.  Every county throughout the country is getting letters such as this, yet the Minister for Education and Science maintains his seat at Cabinet.  I could go through every Department and it seems there is never accountability from Ministers such as we saw last night in the case of a public servant.  This is exemplified by the lack of debate in this House, by the fact that we have not had a debate on the economy in the Seanad.</P><Col N="413"/>
        <P Just="Left">A report is due today on public sector reform.  I insist that report is discussed in the House this week or early next week.  It appears the Taoiseach is setting up a committee of four to decide on cutbacks.  Is that the right mechanism?  Can we have a discussion here about the mechanism the Government is using to decide how to handle critical decisions in the public service on cutbacks?  The example I have given is the most recent one in my constituency, but I could quote many others.  These cutbacks impact on frontline services again and again.  We have seen the waste in F&Aacute;S and there must be a better way to manage the public finances, even at a time of cutbacks that impact on frontline services.  May we have a debate in the Seanad?  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Minister for Finance should come to the House to discuss the economy, as was promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much concur with the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  For the record, I am someone who has defended the public service all my life, but that does not mean that I am opposed to public sector reform, rather I am completely and enthusiastically in favour of it.  The problem is encapsulated in the example given by Senator Fitzgerald of cutting back on home-school liaison in a disadvantaged area.  As far as the public is concerned, that is grand in that it is a cut in public service.  That is how it will be interpreted by the media, even though everyone who looks at it will know it is a bad idea.</P>
        <P>Overspend is as bad as underspend.  Underspend is as bad as overspend.  My problem with setting up &ldquo;Bord Snip&rdquo; is different from that of other people.  My difficulty with it is that it will simply look at budgets and cut back.  We need cross-cutting in this regard.  For example, I have raised here on numerous occasions the whole question of the building section of the Department of Education and Science.  It has caused hassle to Members on all sides in both Houses of the Oireachtas and in every community that is waiting for schools, not knowing how matters will work out.  I do not understand why schools are not built by local authorities.  I have never seen a county development plan to which the planning section of the Department of Education and Science has made a contribution.</P>
        <P>In places such as Balbriggan, for instance, many houses have been built but there is no school.  Nobody asked why that is the case.  Savings could be made if local authorities built schools, because they are in touch with local needs.  They are guardians of the county development plan and they will know what other public buildings are needed.  If a school is built, a football pitch and a public library should be built beside it which the school and the local community can use.  The planning section, architects etc. can be involved in that.  That is what I mean by reform, where a public sector is developed that is leading edge, competitive, productive and shows the way.  That is what it was always intended to be and nobody in my position could possibly speak against that.</P>
        <P>However, time and again we have been presented with ridiculous cutbacks which are saving money this week but we are losing out in terms of quality.  The public wants better education, health and crime fighting services etc., but it also wants cutbacks in the public sector.  It is difficult to have both, especially without increasing taxation.  However, it will not be achieved by setting up a board that will look at merely cutting back on budgets.  It can be done by cross-cutting across the public sector, seeing where one initiative might help another, without duplication and where planning is an integral part of the exercise.  However, I do not believe anybody is ready to do that.  I am ready to engage with that.</P>
        <P>These are the matters we should be discussing and we should put pressure on governments to make them respond.  I ask everybody, when talking about the public sector, to think about their local teacher, nurse, garda, civil servant etc. who are demoralised at the moment by talk of being let down by senior people in F&Aacute;S and in other organisations, by which they have been <Col N="414"/>embarrassed.  That is the issue with which we need to deal.  We need to distinguish between the service and those who misuse it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, wish to raise the issue of the public service.  Mr. Rody Molloy was right to resign and took the honourable option.  In a time when we have not seen that from many people, especially in politics, it is good to see honour still exists and we did not see enough of it during the Celtic tiger years.  If it is coming back into vogue for a person to resign because he or she believes it is justifiable, it is a good thing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am concerned about the numerous attacks on the public service and we need to be clear on what we are discussing.  I agree with many of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s sentiments.  We need to talk straight and say that what happened in F&Aacute;S was wrong.  There may be issues in other agencies.  I raised the fact in this House that there is a plethora of tourism agencies and in many cases people do not know the differences between them.  I often hear people referring to &ldquo;Bord F&aacute;ilte&rdquo; or the &ldquo;tourist board&rdquo; instead of the relevant agencies.  There are overlaps there which need to be looked at in the context of reform, and I am sure there are others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When we discuss public sector reform, which I am enthusiastic about, we need to be realistic and refer to the OECD report which was debated in the House recently and which stated that the centre in our public service is quite small with large numbers employed in front-line services.  Let us be realistic.  Does anyone in this House advocate that front-line services be cut?  I do not and I would thoroughly oppose such a move.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to look at it in a holistic way and need to ensure the plan that is introduced and the &ldquo;Bord Snip&rdquo; looks not just at cuts but also at how we can operate more efficiently with the people we have.  There are issues at the centre that need to be dealt with.  I referred to some agencies and I know of many quangos for which this Government is responsible and may need to be looked at.  There is an issue with management in the Health Service Executive that needs to be dealt with.  We need to be realistic and ensure the morale of those who work and do a good job for the public is maintained because it is very unfair that they are taking a bashing, as it were.</P>
        <P>As someone who worked in the public service for nine years I encourage interchangeability between the public and Civil service.  I am convinced that there are many good people in the public and Civil service who feel stymied and blocked in their career progression because of the way the public and Civil service are constituted.  Any change in that would be progress.  It will not be easy because the plethora of State agencies have different pension schemes, terms and conditions from the Civil Service.  This issue was a particular problem in the flawed decentralisation programme where many people could not change and the Government realised this after making the announcement.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge that tonight the first national volunteer awards take place.  There are 1.5 million people who volunteer for their chosen charities and other activities and it is important that this House acknowledges their contribution.  They are fantastic people, I advocate their work and they should be rightly acknowledged tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will be well-disposed towards a debate on public sector reform in the light of the publication today of a Government report.  Such a debate is necessary.  Some of the things said have already been highlighted in the OECD report and should form the context of such a debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people mentioned the positive aspects of that report but there were many negative aspects.  It discussed the artificial distinction between the Civil and public service, the lack of mobility between the public and private sector and within the public sector itself and the <Col N="415"/>development and existence of restricted practices.  All of these need to be examined and eliminated if we are to have a public sector that operates at the highest level.</P>
        <P>Regarding the resignation of the director general of F&Aacute;S and what was said yesterday on the Order of Business, the right decision has been made.  My party issued no statement indicating support and anyone who heard me on the Order of Business yesterday could hardly think I had confidence in the situation pertaining in F&Aacute;S.  We need to go further.  The revelations that brought about the resignation of the director general need to be looked at in the context of the board of F&Aacute;S.  There is a need to question all activity in State agencies and see if these practices exist, to what extent they exist and who should take responsibility for them.  If that means public accountability, that is what it means.</P>
        <P>We should be grateful these stories are coming out.  They need to be responded to and represent something that no one in political or public life can accept.  The sooner we have such a debate and inform better standards and practices in public life, the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Fitzgerald, that we have a debate on the economy with the Minister for Finance present.  We also need a debate on public sector reform, which I believe it has been indicated will be granted.</P>
        <P>We had a resignation and the right action has been taken in light of the circumstances but the question arises on the corporate governance practices of the board of F&Aacute;S.  There are other related issues and questions within other agencies.  It is disgraceful that this State board, when dealing with the Committee of Public Accounts, blacked out information.  How prevalent is that practice?  I assume someone else will appear before that committee tomorrow to answer those questions.</P>
        <P>The practices within all State agencies and boards need to be looked at urgently.  I would like to hear from the Leader on this matter as there many other issues and one does not want to focus on something specific.  There are other practices in other agencies which are highly questionable.  Accountability has been missing and perhaps the Leader could tell the House what is intended regarding the political accountability of these agencies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader of the House to arrange a debate with the appropriate Minister on the availability of skilled workers due to the downturn in the building industry and to raise with the Minister the need for a survey on the availability of those skills.  They could be utilised in the provision of hot water in schools through the use of solar panels.  I carried out an initial survey of 3,300 primary schools and my initial results are that 82% have only cold water in their bathrooms and toilets and 12% have hot water.  In 1,000 post-primary schools approximately 53% have hot water and 41% have only cold water.</P>
        <P>It is a basic requirement for the proper management and control of hygiene in schools.  Most students come from homes that have hot water to wash after going to the bathroom and they now have to use facilities of a lesser quality at school.  We could use the summer works scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and demonstrate the green agenda to young people, that hot water can be provided through solar panels without any cost.  I received numerous representations during my survey from schools on staff numbers and prefabs and in a situation where there are difficulties in schools this may not be the most appropriate survey.  However, it is a question of matching skills, availability and the needs of the people.  This would be a worthwhile exercise in the interest of the health and well-being of pupils and teachers throughout the <Col N="416"/>country.  Furthermore, there are job opportunities involved for the manufacture of solar panels and wind turbines.  There are tremendous opportunities and manufacturers should look at the opportunities presented now through this wonderful Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The British Government decision yesterday to reduce the VAT rate to encourage more spending will act as a further incentive for people south of the Border to travel north to buy goods affected by that VAT rate.  The rate does not apply to basic foodstuffs.  One company to which it applies and to which we lose much business is IKEA.  It opened last year in Northern Ireland and I understand significant numbers of our people travel to it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As I drove along the M50 the other day I saw the new IKEA in Dublin.  It appears ready to open, but cannot open yet because the planning permission given to it must wait until the work on the M50 finishes.  Approximately &euro;20 million in VAT could come to us if that store were open and 500 people would be employed.  Therefore, there is a real incentive for us to look again at the situation regarding the planning, which will probably delay the opening of the IKEA store by a full year and affect Government income from VAT and income tax from 500 jobs.  It would be worthwhile to look at the situation again and I urge the T&aacute;naiste to do so.  She is probably working on this, but she should inquire whether we can do something and overcome the problem.</P>
        <P>I am aware there will be much pressure on incomes and on the moneys we have to spend in the coming years.  An interesting document was presented yesterday entitled: Global Development: what can you do? Starting points for Members of the Oireachtas.  I will read one paragraph:</P>
        <P LI="1">As a TD or Senator, you have the opportunity to help shape Ireland&rsquo;s future.  Similarly, you are in a unique position to support Irish efforts to improve the lives and opportunities of poor and marginalised communities overseas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I mention this document because we will be under severe pressure for money over the next few years and there is a danger the support we give to the Third World will fall.  We are still a rich country and still have more people employed than we had three years ago.  We are regarded by these people as wealthy and should be aware of that.  Let us ensure Members of both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il have a look at this booklet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There has already been mention of public sector reform.  I welcome the announcement to be made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance today.  Hopefully, it will chart a way forward towards improving cost effectiveness and efficiency throughout the public service.  The announcement is predicated on the OECD report, but many people were disappointed with that report and the lack of impetus in it to achieve real reform of the public service.  We need a culture change at middle management level in the public service so that those at that level see management of human and financial resources as a significant part of their role.  In that way we maximise the potential of people and get best value for money.  It would be good to have a debate focused on this area.</P>
        <P>There has been much mention of F&Aacute;S in the House.  I have some sympathy for the former director general, Rody Molloy.  I do not condone the expenses culture within the organisation, but it is only symptomatic of what is happening across the public service where people are entitled to travel first class or business class.  Why is this?  I worked in the private sector for many years and in that time I do not remember ever travelling business class.  I went abroad a number of times and travelled economy class.  I would choose to travel economy because the <Col N="417"/>astronomical cost of business or first class is not justified.  We need to change the culture and this is just one example of an area where we can effect economies.</P>
        <P>I worked with people in large public companies with the clear cut policy of travelling economy class unless travelling long distance with an important business meeting on arrival.  In such cases people need to arrive in good shape to be at their best for their meeting.  Those companies had a common-sense approach to travel.  We need to inject this attitude across the range of public sector activity.  Many people in the public sector would welcome this because they want to be part of a dynamic organisation.  I hope all sides will support the efforts of the Taoiseach &mdash; who has been strong on this over the past 12 months &mdash; and the Minister for Finance who have the responsibility to ensure the implementation of cost-effective measures.</P>
        <P>I hope the public service unions will rise to the game.  They have not done so to date, unlike their counterparts.  Some of the unions straddle the public and private sector.  In the private sector in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a complete sea change in thinking by senior personnel and those in the unions because they realised the job security of their members was at stake unless they had flexibility, productivity and a modern approach to running businesses.  We need that in the public service.  Nobody need have fears in that regard, except those in the service who never intended to do the work in the first place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The lesson from the F&Aacute;S debacle is a lesson for the Government.  It is the issue of value for money.  Although he reversed his opinion yesterday, the Taoiseach, in standing by the expenditure initially, shows he has not appreciated the issue of value for money.  The lesson for him and the Government is to stop paying lip service to the issue.  They must stop commissioning new reports and establishing new committees and do something about ensuring value for money in public expenditure.</P>
        <P>With regard to the debate on the economy, one of the most important issues is whether the Government will intervene in the recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  This is a legitimate issue for debate in this House and the Oireachtas in general.  The Minister should come to the House and give his views on the issue because we do not want a situation where we are bounced into new emergency legislation and crisis measures without any dialogue, debate or scrutiny of the thinking behind such measures.</P>
        <P>Currently, private equity funds are circling the banks, but these do not appear to have credibility as a solution.  The Minister will have to face the challenge of State intervention.  David McWilliams has suggested that if it must come to it, the nationalisation of the banks would be better than the types of schemes being mooted over recent days.  I ask the Leader to encourage and invite the Minister to the House to discuss the issue.  We are aware that with regard to discussions and considerations of the best option for the Government, economy and country, it is the Cabinet that must decide such issues.  However, I believe the Minister will come back to this House with new legislation.  Therefore, it is a legitimate issue for debate and I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come in to address it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss the issue of the recapitalisation of the banks?  The banks have stated clearly they do not need recapitalisation, but commentators suggest they might need it.  There is a question of what type of recapitalisation might be required and who would provide the capital.  I am aware there is talk of some hedge funds being involved.</P>
        <P>I would not be in favour of a hedge fund taking an equity stake in any Irish bank.  I would much prefer State involvement or, failing that, European involvement, or even involvement by some of the ethical sovereign wealth funds.  For example, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund already invests in Ireland through Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Cement Roadstone <Col N="418"/>Holdings and Ryanair.  Obvious spin-offs and beneficial trade could emanate from allowing a sovereign wealth fund to invest in a strategic asset in Ireland.  However, it may not be in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest to have another scenario like Eircom.</P>
        <P>It is not good for any Member to comment on rumours and yesterday there were discussions that a former leader may have made representations.  As a councillor, I often was asked to make representations on behalf of a particular person for a house, only to be asked subsequently by someone else to do the same thing.  In such circumstances, one makes representations to the best of one&rsquo;s ability on behalf of everyone who seeks the house in question.  I see nothing wrong with a former leader giving assistance to people.  However, imputing negative or incorrect motives for so doing does not do this House a service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come before the House because a serious issue has developed as a result of cost differentials north and south of the Border.  Although no VAT is levied on food, it is significantly cheaper north of the Border.  Two further changes have taken place recently in respect of goods north of the Border.  First, VAT rates have been reduced in the North and, second, sterling exchange rates have declined significantly.  If and when the economy is rebooted, I suggest we work in tandem with the British Government.  Moreover, adopting similar VAT rates would have the positive effect of having an all-Irish dimension.  Taking the opportunity to reboot the economy in such a fashion would help the Border counties and might appeal to people&rsquo;s fervour for their country.  Nevertheless, many people still will cross the Border if a bottle of whiskey costs &euro;14 less in the North.  To be realistic, we must take practical steps and must be able to move quickly.  I believe the Government has the capacity to move and to do the right thing, without being caught by ideology, in respect of what is practical and good at all times for the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It probably is a little late to ask for a debate on F&Aacute;S.  We should have had such a debate some time ago.  The Seanad is particularly strong on post-mortems but not on anticipating or discussing topical issues.  However, I ask of the Leader to allow time to address this or an allied subject rapidly.  While I welcome the resignation of Rody Molloy, it would be wrong to happily regard him as some sacrificial lamb who can be thrown to the wolves after which the issue is over.  Others may be equally culpable and should be answerable to a House of the Oireachtas or an Oireachtas committee.  I am talking about boards.  I refer to a serious issue, to which Senator Fitzgerald referred, regarding the boards of semi-State bodies.  Those who serve on such boards are well paid, with five figure sums and more, and it is extraordinary how they behaved in this case.  Members are entitled to ask how they behaved and whether they behaved properly or represented the taxpayer properly.</P>
        <P>The boards of semi-State bodies are appointed by the Minister.  The boards seem to be extraordinarily and cosily happy with what is going on and do not appear to be very critical.  One never knows what goes on because the minutes of boards never are released to the public.  I am not sure whether the Committee of Public Accounts or the Seanad should not seek those minutes and ask that they be seen by the public to ascertain what was happening.  If the people in question knew what was happening, they should have stopped it.  It appears that at least one member of the board of F&Aacute;S travelled very expensively; he made a transatlantic return trip that cost &euro;7,300.  If board members did not know this was going on, they also are culpable because they ought to have known.</P><Col N="419"/>
        <P>One must ask the reason social partners constantly and automatically are appointed to certain State boards.  Is it simply a nice little gig for them as they sit there, receiving &euro;10,000 plus a year, rising to &euro;20,000 plus a year for the chairman?  It appears as though they nod through expenses or do not know about them, attend board meetings every month and then go home.  It seems that these people did not know what was happening.  One former board member stated on radio yesterday that he was not aware of such practices.  If that is the case, he also is culpable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>F&Aacute;S is riddled with political appointment and has been politicised and protected for years.  There are signs that the Government again is appointing its cronies to semi-State bodies and State agencies, which simply is unacceptable.  This kind of disease will infiltrate, if it has not done, other semi-State bodies and similar situations will arise, although perhaps not on the same scale.  This issue must be attacked on a very large scale.  It no longer simply pertains to F&Aacute;S, it is a matter of politicising semi-State bodies and removing politicisation from the political arena.  Certainly, one must ensure that such appointees are checked and double-checked and are subject to some scrutiny and accountability by which they are not simply appointed by Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Dublin&rsquo;s successful bid to host Euroscience Open Forum in 2012, which will provide a tremendous opportunity to showcase the progress Ireland has made in the fields of science, technology and innovation.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current international market turmoil in the financial services market, Dublin now is well established as a centre for international financial services activities, with the world&rsquo;s leading names established here.  However, one strategic issue warrants Government support, that is, a world-class payment system that facilitates business and personal banking requirements.  As Members are aware, electronic payments are the most efficient, effective and secure means of payment.  I ask the Leader to outline the role that is envisaged for the Government, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator in promoting and facilitating a highly efficient world-class payment system that will meet the rapidly changing needs.  I refer in particular to communications infrastructure regarding the availability of broadband speed and so on.  Perhaps the Leader will provide a briefing to Members in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two further issues that mainly pertain to the capital in which I reside, Dublin.  First, I refer to the recent rate increase on Dublin business houses, at a time when everyone is under pressure regarding the economy, and its impact on the city.  Second, will the Leader outline the schedule for the proposed metro for Dublin city as well as the impact of and support that prevails for this development?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the calls of my colleagues for a debate on public sector reform.  I empathise with the front-line staff in many of our public agencies, many of whom are demoralised by the prevailing comments in this regard.  It is not their fault as they try to deliver services on a daily basis.  However, it is the idea of the public service, its bulk and management that requires attention and Members certainly should have a debate in that regard.  There are examples of reform that has been undertaken by agreement with unions and workers and I will cite one.  The ESB is one of our largest semi-State organisations and while some people <Col N="420"/>criticise it, I give it much credit.  During the years of the Celtic tiger, it went from a workforce of more than 12,000 to 7,000 and introduced considerable efficiencies.  It connected unprecedented levels of domestic and commercial users and proved that there is a way to reform efficiently through agreement.  I compliment the ESB on doing so and hope that model will be used by other State agencies.  It would be a worthwhile debate in the House.</P>
        <P>There are concerns regarding specialist services in Waterford Regional Hospital, a group A status hospital serving a region of more than 450,000.  There is a threat to many of the specialist services and I will give examples.  Only one vascular surgeon serves the region because, while a second post has been approved, the Health Service Executive has not advertised it.  There has been a drain of consultants from the hospital.  For example, it has lost one dermatologist, three orthopaedic surgeons and one cardiac surgeon in the past year or two.  People of this status leaving because the HSE is not managing the situation and appointing full-time replacements is a blow to the hospital&rsquo;s morale and its development.  It is not good enough that temporary consultants operate in a regional hospital with group A status serving an entire region.  Patients and the hospital are suffering and there is a lack of confidence in the situation.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate this important issue, which affects an entire region?</P>

	<P>Since the budget, there have been constant calls for debates on the economy and education.  Why has the Leader not acceded to them given they are serious issues?  I express my outrage and congratulate Senator Ross on his good work in unveiling a sickness at senior management level in the public service.  I could not believe my ears when I heard Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s interview on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s show the other day.  It was a throwback to the interview given by ex-Commissioner, Mr. P&aacute;draig Flynn, on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I have since heard calls, as I am sure the Leader has, for Mr. Molloy to be sued for abuse of public money.  This might be right or wrong, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Some 4,500 people at junior certificate level and 2,100 people at leaving certificate level are given spelling and grammar concessions during those exams.  These concessions are difficult to get because many of those involved are dyslexic, meaning that there is a significant difference between their intelligence and their performance in terms of spelling and grammar.  Today, a confidential report has indicated that the withdrawal of the <Col N="421"/>concessions is under consideration.  It would be an outrage.  Without the concessions, these children would fail.  In particular, the withdrawal would kill the Irish language.</P>

	<P>As others have mentioned, people travelling to the North to shop pose a significant problem along the Border.  There are tailbacks into Newry and we have heard stories of people leaving overcrowded shops in Enniskillen for health and safety reasons.  This serious matter has been worsened by the reduction in the UK rate of VAT and the corresponding increase in our VAT rate.  It has implications for jobs in small businesses along the Border.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader, a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, suggest to the Cabinet a support package for small businesses along the Border because they are in trouble?  Price control must be kept in mind and we must ensure there are no abuses or disincentives to business, but there must be a support system.  If VAT rates cannot be harmonised &mdash; it is probably pie in the sky in the short term &mdash; something must be done, whether in terms of rate supports or other practical measures.  Jobs are being lost, businesses will close and there will be ghost towns along the Border this Christmas.  It is a serious matter.</P>

She thanked him for his many years of public service in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and as the director general of F&Aacute;S for the past eight years.  She stated that his major contribution to the development of F&Aacute;S included significant changes in the organisation as the State&rsquo;s employment and training agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and developments therein.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a good proposal on local authority and county development plans and various inputs into schools building projects, including sites for new schools, community involvement, playing pitches and other elements of a successful community.  I support the proposal and will endeavour to arrange time for a debate in our busy schedule, but legislation takes preference, especially the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>I noted the contributors to last week&rsquo;s important debate on agriculture.  I am sure Senators will also wish to contribute to the debates on F&Aacute;S and the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly referred to the first national volunteer awards today.  I join him in congratulating everyone who has made the event possible.  In excess of 1.8 million or 1.9 million people are actively involved in volunteerism.  The Irish have been noted for their great community spirit, be it in terms of local organisations of all kinds or turnouts at funerals and removals.  Volunteerism is of the utmost importance, particularly during an economic downturn.  Now that people have more spare time, they can be encouraged to enjoy their quality of life in their communities.  I commend everyone involved with the first annual national awards ceremony for volunteers.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden requested a debate on the possibility of solar power being used in schools.  As the Senator indicated, only 12% of primary schools have hot running water.  The proposal he put forward is good and I will communicate his views to the relevant Minister.  I am sure the Senator will raise this matter again when the House engages in a debate on the economy next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred the new IKEA store being built in north Dublin.  He stated that work is being delayed as a result of stipulations in the planning permission relating to the project.  The Senator also indicated that the Irish Exchequer could benefit to the tune of &euro;20 million per year in VAT income from this store.  This is a major issue and I will communicate the Senator&rsquo;s views to the relevant Minister following the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also referred to a particular document which indicates the difference that can be made by Deputies and Senators.  Members on this side of the House have not yet received copies of this document.  Perhaps the Senator might assist us by ensuring that copies are circulated.  The proposals contained in the document appear to be good and I would like to be in a position to support the call made by the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin requested that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, come before the House to discuss both the difference in the cost of particular items north and south of the Border and how we might promote the all-Irish dimension in respect of this challenge.  I have no difficulty in arranging a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>As Senator Quinn did yesterday, Senator Callely welcomed the fact that Dublin city has been chosen as European city of science for the year 2012.  I congratulated all involved on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  This development represents a tremendous opportunity for the country and for the city of Dublin, particularly in the context of the interest to which it will give rise.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely also referred to the roll-out of a world-class payment system which facilitates business and personal banking requirements.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views in this regard to the relevant Minister.  I share his serious concerns, and those of Dublin city business groups, regarding the appalling increase of 3.3% in respect of rates and services.  In the current economic climate, everyone should  provide an example.  There should be no increases of any kind &mdash; regardless of whether they relate to ESB or Bord G&aacute;is, wages or whatever &mdash; during the coming 12 months.  There should be a pay pause in the national interest.  Everyone must play his or her part in providing assistance to those who need it during the economic downturn.</P><Col N="423"/>
        <P>Senator Callely also requested an update on the metro.  I will communicate with him directly in respect of that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey referred to special services at Waterford Regional Hospital.  In light of the raft of legislation the House must process in the coming weeks, if the Senator is willing to raise this matter on the Adjournment, I will arrange a debate on it with the Minister for Health and Children following the Christmas recess.  If Senator Coffey wishes to make progress on this matter, I strongly urge him to consider doing so by means of the avenue to which I refer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Charities Bill 2007 to the House.  Throughout the <Col N="424"/>progression of the Bill through the D&aacute;il there was a broad acceptance from all speakers that it was necessary and welcome. There was a healthy and constructive debate on all Stages, which resulted in the enhanced Bill that is presented to the Seanad today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, may I have a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The absence of a proper regulatory framework for the charities sector has been a matter of concern to this and previous Governments and to the charities sector.  It is fair to say the sector welcomes appropriate regulation as a lack of regulation leaves it potentially open to abuse.  The charities sector depends to a large extent on public confidence.  It is estimated that currently more than &euro;2 billion passes through charities in Ireland, yet there is no oversight of this vast sum of money.  The Bill seeks to address this situation and to ensure that charities are subject to an appropriate level of scrutiny, but not to the extent that the resources of the charity that should be spent towards achieving the charitable purpose are expended on regulatory compliance.  For this reason &mdash; I will highlight where the relevant measures are included &mdash; the Bill has been drafted to provide proportionate regulation, principally in recognition of the fact that the majority of charities operating in Ireland are small organisations operating on a largely voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>I will now go through the Bill in more detail, focussing particularly on what might be regarded as the key provisions.  Part 1, while largely technical in nature, contains a number of key provisions.  Sections 1 and 2 are quite standard in that they set out, respectively, the Short Title and the definitions of terminology contained within the Bill.  Different provisions of the Bill may be commenced on different dates, which will assist in developing the regulatory regime in a structured and strategic way.  It is not anticipated that the Bill will come into force immediately after enactment.  In other common-law jurisdictions, such as Scotland, it has taken some time &mdash; approximately two years after enactment &mdash; for the regulatory framework to be put in place on a statutory basis and a similar scenario is likely here.  Key definitions in section 2 include a &ldquo;charitable organisation&rdquo; and an &ldquo;excluded body&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill.  These definitions will form the basis for determinations of charitable status by the new regulatory authority that is to be established.  Section 3 is a most important section as it specifies the purposes to be regarded as charitable by the new authority.  Every charity will be required to have been established for charitable purposes only.  I will briefly outline how these purposes have emerged.  The purposes listed in the Bill are based on what are known as the Pemsel categories of charitable purposes.  The preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses 1601, sometimes known as the Statute of Elizabeth I, contained a list of purposes or activities which the State believed were of general benefit to society and to which the State wanted to encourage private contributions.  To date there has been no definition of &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; in statute law.</P>
        <P>The list in the preamble to the 1601 statute, which has formed the foundation of the modern definition of &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo;, has developed entirely through case law.  Case law has interpreted this as giving rise to four categories of purposes and these are the four categories listed in section 3(1) of the Bill, with some necessary contemporary interpretations.  The Revenue Commissioners have referred to these categories when deciding whether an organisation is eligible for charitable tax exemptions.  Section 3(10) sets out in greater detail than has been done before what are to be considered &ldquo;other purposes that are of benefit to the community&rdquo;, which is the fourth Pemsel category.  In enshrining these &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; in primary legislation for the first time, the Bill is seeking neither to narrow nor to broaden the purposes that have emerged through case law over the years.</P><Col N="425"/>
        <P>As well as being required to be established for a charitable purpose only, section 3 provides that charities will need to show that there is a public benefit to their activities.  This is a longstanding requirement of charities.  This provision is to deter charities being set up to benefit only a limited number of persons who may have a personal connection with the founder of the organisation.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, and uniquely, there has been a presumption of public benefit for religious charities, which if retained would have effectively tied the hands of the authority in dealing with applications particularly from newer religious organisations that have emerged in recent years.  To counteract this, on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il this automatic presumption was removed and replaced by a rebuttable presumption.  Quite simply, the authority would not have been in a position to refuse an application for registration from any organisation claiming to be advancing religion.  This is not acceptable particularly in a context where so many new religions and churches are being established.  However, this provision should not affect existing religious charities which will be automatically deemed to be registered, as I will explain later.</P>
        <P>Section 4 is a technical section allowing the Minister to make regulations under the Bill as enacted while section 5 provides that the authority shall be funded from the Exchequer.  Section 6 allows for a mandatory review of the operation of the Act after five years in operation.  This Bill is the first step only in the regulation of charities in Ireland.  This review will allow the opportunity for any issues relating to the regulatory system that may have emerged &mdash; I am sure some will have &mdash; to be identified and addressed.</P>
        <P>Section 7 clearly separates the functions of the new authority, which will be to consider the charitable status of organisations, from that of the Revenue Commissioners, which will remain fully responsible for deciding whether an organisation is eligible for charitable tax exemptions.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is a technical section that excludes organisations that are involved in securitisation activities from the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill was never intended to comprehend such organisations which play an important role in the Irish financial services sector.  It is considered that placing an additional layer of administration on such organisations might damage Ireland&rsquo;s position as a suitable base for such organisations and threaten jobs in the sector.  These organisations do not fundraise directly from the public, and are essentially dormant for the majority of their existence.  Section 9 sets out the arrangements for the servicing of documents under the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 10 sets out the penalties for both summary and indictable convictions for an offence under the Bill.  Members will note the strong penalties applicable to those convicted on indictment in particular.  This is intended particularly to deter serious white-collar crime within charities.  Members will also note that costs arising from successful proceedings may be recouped by the authority.  Section 11 refers to the elements of the Charities Act 1961 that are repealed by this Bill.  The detail is in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>I move now to Part 2 of the Bill, which provides for the establishment and operations of the new charities regulatory authority.  Sections 12 and 13 empower the Minister to set an establishment day for the purposes of the Act, on which day the new charities regulatory authority is to be established.  The new authority will be the centrepiece of the regulatory framework.  Section 14 sets out in detail the functions of the new authority.  I will focus on some of these in particular.  The authority will be an independent body and will obviously have strong regulatory powers, the specifics of which I will detail later as they emerge in the Bill.  However, it will also have a supportive role for charities themselves in recognition of the fact that most charities in Ireland are small volunteer-run entities.</P>
        <P>A key function will be to increase public trust and confidence in charities, as enhanced public confidence will benefit the charities sector as a whole.  It will also have a role in disseminating <Col N="426"/>information on charities, and of particular importance in this context it will be required to establish and maintain a register of charities.  This will be the key interface between the public and the authority and will be of critical importance in increasing transparency.  It will also enable donors to make more informed decisions as to which charities they choose to support and to verify the charitable bona fides of any organisation.  Quite simply, if an organisation is not on the list, it is not a registered charity.  Finally, this section also provides that the functions of the authority may be undertaken by any member of staff authorised to do so.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides that although the authority may be independent in the performance of its functions, the Minister of the time may require it to comply with certain Government policies.  These policies would not relate to the day-to-day operations of the authority under the Act, but to general policy areas such as staffing, recruitment, procurement etc.  Section 16 clarifies that the authority will be funded from the Exchequer.  Section 17 is a standard but necessary provision allowing the authority with the consent of the Minister and Minister for Finance to borrow money.</P>
        <P>Section 18 is a technical provision allowing the authority, where it has incurred costs in managing, preserving, administrating or recovering the property of a charitable organisation, to recoup such expenditure from the estate and funds of that organisation.  This is merely an enabling provision and it would not be envisaged that it would be invoked in all such cases.</P>
        <P>Section 19 relates to the appointment of the chief executive officer.  The Minister will have the option of appointing a chief executive officer in advance of the authority itself being set up to prepare the groundwork for the authority.  Subsequent CEOs will be appointed by the authority with the consent of the Minister.  CEOs cannot hold any other office without the consent of the Minister.  Following on from this, section 20 sets out that the CEO will be responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the body and in that context will be accountable to the authority.  The CEO may make recommendations to the authority.  There is a reserve power in section 20(4) allowing the authority, where the CEO position is vacant, to appoint another member of staff to act as CEO.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Section 21 allows the CEO with certain limitations to delegate with the agreement of the authority one or more of his or her functions to a member of staff of the authority.  Sections 22 and 23 copperfasten the accountability of the CEO to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 22 relates to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Section 23 outlines that the CEO is also answerable to other committees of the Oireachtas apart from the Committee of Public Accounts.  Section 24 allows for the appointment of staff for the new authority and that the pay, and terms and conditions of employment shall be subject to the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Section 25 allows for the transfer of staff from the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland, which will be dissolved, to the new authority.  It specifies that the terms and conditions applicable to such employees shall not be affected by the transfer, unless any such change has been discussed and agreed with the relevant union or association.  Previous service with the dissolved body will be also reckonable under the relevant employment legislation.</P>

        <P>Section 26<b> </b>is another standard provision in legislation of this type.  Here, the authority will be required to introduce a superannuation scheme for its employees, and any such scheme will have to be approved by the Minister and laid before the Oireachtas.  Any disputes in regard to superannuation benefits shall be adjudicated on by the Minister for Finance.  In the event of a person who transferred to the new authority becoming eligible for superannuation benefits before the authority has introduced its pension scheme, the section provides that such benefits shall be calculated on the basis of the criteria that applied immediately prior to the dissolution of the office of commissioners.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that the new authority will work closely with other regulators and law enforcement bodies. <b> </b>Section<b> </b>27 accordingly allows for disclosure of information by specified regulators, law enforcement bodies, or other organisations as may be prescribed by the Minister, relating to possible offences under this legislation, to the authority.</P>
        <P>Section 28 is the converse of section 27 in that it allows the authority to share information with other regulators and law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the State, where it suspects an offence has been committed.  Any such information may be used only for the purpose of detection, investigation or prosecution of an offence.  The new authority will be expected to approach its business in a planned and strategic way.  Therefore, under section 29, it will have to prepare on an ongoing basis a three-year strategy statement, which the Minister will lay before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Sections 30 and 31 require the authority to prepare annual accounts and an annual report, respectively.  The annual accounts will be subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Both the accounts and the annual report are to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 32 is a more general information-sharing provision than that contained in section 28, which is principally offence-related.  Such information must be required by the relevant body for the performance of its functions.</P>
        <P>I am endeavouring to ensure the authority will adhere to the principle of joined-up government and the avoidance of dual regulation.  Section 33 allows for administrative, non-binding co-operation arrangements between the authority and other relevant regulators.  Such arrangements are intended to minimise the potential for duplication of activities and enhancing the consistency of decisions across the various regulatory frameworks that are in place.</P>
        <P>The Bill will apply to charities based in other jurisdictions that operate in Ireland.  EU or EEA charities will not be required to have a place of business in the State.  It is considered, therefore, that section 34, which allows for information sharing and co-operation with regulators in other jurisdictions, will prove extremely useful.  Ministerial approval will be required for any such arrangements, and the Minister shall also prescribe the foreign statutory bodies concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 35 enables the authority to consult those who are affected by the performance by it of its functions.  As a follow-on to this section, section 36 provides for the establishment by the authority of consultative panels.  It is envisaged that such panels will play an important role in developing proposals for consideration by the authority and engaging with the sector.  The section also sets out the administrative arrangements and conditions that will apply to any such panels established.  Each panel will be required to submit an annual report to the authority.  This report shall be published on the Internet, as will any observations or proposals made by a panel relating to its terms of reference.</P>
        <P>Section 37 enables the Minister to request the authority to establish a consultative panel to consider specific matters of relevance or interest to him or her.  Equivalent terms and conditions will apply to such panels as would apply to a panel established by the authority other than at the behest of the Minister.</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P>The Attorney General has, up to now, had a role as the &ldquo;protector of charities&rdquo;.  Such a role might involve initiating legal proceedings in defence of charities, participating in proceedings brought by others, or carrying out certain functions under the Charities Act 1961.  In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, in the context of a new statutory regulatory framework for charities, with a strong yet supportive authority as the centrepiece, it has been agreed that it is no longer essential for the Attorney General to have such a role.  Therefore, section 38 transfers any relevant functions that were previously vested in the Attorney General to the new authority on establishment day.  I thank the current Attorney General, Mr. Paul Gallagher, and his predecessor, Mr. Rory Brady, for their personal and positive engagement in the development of this Bill over recent years, and I also thank their officials.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill sets out in greater detail how the authority will regulate the sector in practice.  A key measure is the establishment, for the first time, of a register of charities.  This is provided for in sections 39 and 40.  This register is to be available to the public, including by electronic means.</P>
        <P>Section 40 provides for any organisation that has qualified for charitable tax exemptions to be automatically deemed to be registered as a charity.  This approach arose from my amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and is designed to ease the administrative burden for the charities themselves, and for the authority, which would otherwise have had to deal with a huge volume of applications for registration within a very short period.</P>
        <P>Under the arrangements set out in section 40, organisations whose charitable bona fides have been already examined and accepted by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; it is estimated that there are in excess of 7,000 such organisations at present &mdash; will not be required to submit to the new authority the full range of material normally required from new applicants.  Any relevant information may be provided by Revenue, or requested by the authority from the charity, if necessary.</P>
        <P>Organisations that do not hold charitable tax exemptions will be required under section 39 to apply directly to the new authority for entry onto the register and to provide the information listed in subsection 39(5).</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members will note references in sections 39 and 40 to charities established in the State, charities established in another EEA state and charities established outside the EEA altogether, in the context of their providing information on their principal place of business to the new authority.  For clarification in this regard, my legal advice is that it is not appropriate to insist that charities established in the EEA, although operating in this jurisdiction, have a principal place of business in Ireland.  It is possible to insist on charities from outside the EEA having a principal place of business here.  Therefore, there is a need for differentiation in terms of information to be provided by Irish charities and their EEA-based counterparts.</P>
        <P>In the case of new applicants under section 39, the authority will have to make a decision as to whether the applicant is a charity before entering it onto the register, inform the applicant of its decision and state the reasons for its decision where an application is refused.  It will be an offence for an applicant to knowingly provide false or misleading information to the authority.  Any organisation on the register must inform the authority when any of the particulars relating to it entered on the register cease to be correct.  The authority will be responsible for maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the register.</P>
        <P>As part of the joined-up approach to regulation, the authority will have to inform the registrar of companies whenever a company applies for entry onto the register, as the Bill makes special provision for co-operation between these two bodies to minimise dual filing and regulation.</P><Col N="429"/>
        <P>Section 41 makes it an offence for anyone to promote, or collect moneys, property or gifts for, a charity that is not on the register.  This also applies to companies that are charities but which are not registered.  The exception to this is where a decision is awaited in respect of an existing charity that has applied for registration under section 39.</P>
        <P>Section 42 allows the authority to refuse to register an organisation where its name is the same or very similar to that of another charity on the register, where the name is considered misleading for the public, or where the name is considered offensive.  The decision of the authority is subject to appeal.  This section also provides that a registered charity cannot change its name without the consent of the authority.  The authority may refuse to accept a name change for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is critical in the interest of public confidence that the register accurately reflect the charities operating in the jurisdiction, and only charities.  For this reason, the authority may remove an organisation from the register where, having consulted the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it forms the view that the organisation is an excluded body.  Similarly, an organisation can be removed from the register for changing its name without the consent of the authority, or for failure to comply with the various accounts, audit and provision-of-information obligations contained in the Bill.  Where the authority forms the view that an organisation is not a charitable organisation any longer, or that a charity trustee is no longer eligible to hold such a position, it can apply to the High Court for consent to remove the organisation in question from the register.  Whenever an organisation is removed from the register under section 43, the authority will enter onto the register a statement to this effect, and the reasons for its removal.</P>
        <P>Section 44 allows the authority, in similar circumstances to those covered by section 43, to remove from the register organisations &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; to be registered under section 40.  It is important that the authority have the necessary powers to treat both categories of charity in an equitable way.</P>
        <P>Section 45 sets out the process of appeal for bodies whose application to register has been refused, or where a body is removed from the register.  Appeals will be heard by the charity appeals tribunal, and the decision of the tribunal will be binding on all parties to the appeal, including the authority itself.  The Minister is also given a reserve right of appeal against a decision by the tribunal.</P>
        <P>One of the major difficulties facing the public these days is the problem of differentiating between genuine charities and other organisations that are not so altruistic.  In this context, a matter of significant public interest has been the door-to-door collections of clothes that are presented as charitable, but whose charitable bona fides are questionable.  These lucrative collections, though not currently illegal, have impacted greatly on donations of clothes to genuine charity shops.  Section 46 is intended to address the practice of non-charities creating a perception that they are charities.  Usually, such charities would be careful to avoid describing themselves as charities, but this section will make it an offence for any non-charity to describe itself or its activities in a way that would cause members of the public to reasonably believe they are charitable, irrespective of whether they actually use the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that a charity must be established for charitable purposes only.  Any organisation that only partially supports a charitable cause, while retaining a profit for itself would not be permitted to register.  This section also requires any registered charity, unless specifically exempted, to describe itself as a registered charitable organisation in all public documents or in any other documentation that the Minister may prescribe.  It will be much easier for the public henceforth to differentiate between charities and non-charities, and to make more informed choices in terms of donations.  Section 46 also makes it an offence for a person to mislead the public as to where an organisation was established.</P><Col N="430"/>
        <P>Section<b> </b>47 requires charities, apart from those incorporated as companies that already have such an obligation under company law, to have available, on an ongoing basis, proper books of account  for inspection by a person so authorised by the authority.  It shall be an offence not to do so.</P>
        <P>Section 48<b> </b>places an obligation on charities, apart from those incorporated as companies, to prepare an annual statement of accounts in such form as may be prescribed by the Minister.  Similarly, it shall be an offence not to prepare this statement of accounts.</P>
        <P>Section 49 requires the Companies Registration Office to forward to the authority the annual return, as required under company law, of any company that is a charity and any documents attached thereto.</P>
        <P>Section 50 places an obligation on charities, again apart from those incorporated as companies, to have their accounts either audited, in the case of charities with income or expenditure in excess of a threshold, which the Minister may prescribe, or examined by an independent person, in the case of smaller charities below the threshold.  An &ldquo;independent person&rdquo; may be so prescribed by the Minister, and the nature of the examination shall be a matter for the authority.  This graduated approach is intended to alleviate the burden on smaller charities.  However, there is a reserve power where the authority considers it necessary or where a charity has failed to meet its obligations under this section for the authority to direct any charity to have a full audit or itself appoint an auditor.  Where the authority incurs any costs arising from such an audit, they may be recouped from the charity concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 51<b> </b>allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of the duties and operations of auditors or independent persons under the previous section.  It shall be an offence for any person not to co-operate with an auditor in respect of any such powers vested in him or her by the Minister.</P>
        <P>As Members will expect, the authority will have a particular interest in the charitable activities organisations on the register.  Section 52 provides that all charities, including those incorporated as companies, will have to provide an annual report on their charitable activities to the authority.  The nature of the annual report will be prescribed in regulations by the Minister.  I am committed to prior consultation with the sector on this matter.  In general, charities will be required to submit their annual report, annual statement of accounts and the auditor or independent person&rsquo;s reports together to the authority.  In the case of companies that are not required under company law to annex their accounts to their annual return to the Registrar of Companies, their annual report under this section should be submitted with their company law accounts directly to the authority.</P>
        <P>Section<b> </b>53 requires a charity to provide any information that the authority requests in writing to enable it to fulfil its statutory functions.</P>
        <P>Increased transparency is one of the key aspects of the Bill.  Section 54 requires the authority to make available to the public the annual report and any documents attached thereto.  Given that the majority of charities fundraise from the public, it is considered that this provision serves a public interest.  However, it is not considered that the same public interest applies to private charitable trusts which do not fundraise from the public, such as those set up by philanthropists.  Therefore, although the authority will hold information in respect of such private trusts, it will not be available to the public.</P>
        <P>Charity trustees play a key role in the operation of charities and the Bill puts in place certain provisions relating to the role of charity trustees.  Section<b> </b>55 lays out the circumstances under which a person may become disqualified from acting as a charity trustee.  These include where <Col N="431"/>a person has been convicted on indictment of an offence, has been imprisoned or where serious specified financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, have arisen.  Any person so disqualified may apply to the High Court for an order allowing him or her to act as charity trustee again.  In the public interest, the authority is also required under this section to establish and maintain a register of disqualified persons.</P>
        <P>Section 56 renders it an offence for a disqualified person to act as a charity trustee, though any actions undertaken by such an individual whilst so serving will remain valid.  Any costs occurring to the charity or any benefits accruing to the disqualified person as a consequence of their actions shall be repayable to the charity.</P>
        <P>Section 57 deals with the scenario where a person within a charity acts under the direction of a disqualified charity trustee.  It shall be an offence for a person to so act unless he or she had reasonable grounds for not knowing that the person was so disqualified.  On conviction under this section, the person will also cease to be qualified to serve as a charity trustee.</P>
        <P>Section<b> </b>58 follows from sections 56 and 57 in that it provides that a disqualified charity trustee convicted under section 56 shall be personally liable for any debts accrued by the charity as a consequence of their actions while illegally serving as a disqualified trustee.  The same applies to a person convicted under section 57 of knowingly acting for a disqualified charity trustee.  However, this section allows for the court to grant relief from such personal liability where it is considered appropriate.</P>
        <P>The sections that follow deal with the reporting of offences or suspected offences.  Section 59 contains a provision requiring relevant persons to report to the authority in writing where he or she, in the course of carrying out their duties, forms the opinion that an offence under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 has been, or is being, committed.  A &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; includes an auditor, a charity trustee, an investment business firm or a person involved in preparing the annual report.</P>
        <P>Section 60<b> </b>is a technical provision allowing for qualified privilege in respect of any report prepared under the previous section.  Section 61<b> </b>protects persons who report a suspected offence under either this legislation or under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 from civil liability once they have acted in good faith.</P>
        <P>Under section 62,<b> </b>specific provisions are in place to ensure that an employee may not be penalised by his or her employer for notifying the authority in good faith of a suspected breach of the legislation within the organisation.  There shall also be a presumption in any employment-related proceedings that the employee acted in good faith unless otherwise proved.  It is important, however, that persons are not permitted to deliberately make false statements to the authority and section 63<b> </b>makes it an offence to do so.</P>
        <P>Part 4<b> </b>of the Bill sets out the investigative powers of the authority and the rights of the authority to seek documentation from charities.  Under section 64, the authority may appoint an inspector to carry out investigations and to report to the authority on the investigation.  A later section, namely, section 71, provides that any such report may be evidence in any proceedings arising.</P>
        <P>In section 65,<b> </b>charitable organisations, including trustees, or other persons believed to be in possession of relevant information, are required to co-operate with any investigation in terms of appearing before an inspector and providing documentation or records to an inspector on request.  Where reasonable grounds for concern exist, the inspector may also request records of bank accounts held by a charity or a trustee.</P>
        <P>Section 66 provides that any report, or interim report, submitted by an inspector to the authority may be sent by the authority to specified persons or organisations, or published in full or in part.</P><Col N="432"/>
        <P>Under section 67,<b> </b>any expenses incurred by the authority in relation to a successful investigation may, subject to an order of the High Court, be repaid to the authority.</P>
        <P>Outside the specific context of an investigation, the authority may from time to time require books, documents or records from a charity or from a person believed to be holding such records and section 68<b> </b>makes the necessary provision.  It will be an offence not to co-operate with such a request for information from the authority, although section 72 provides that legal privilege will apply to the production of certain documents under this part of the Bill.</P>
        <P>The authority may also, under section 69,<b> </b>apply to the District Court for permission to enter and search premises where a charity does not comply with a request for information under the previous section.  It shall be an offence not to co-operate with such a search.  Any documents taken by the authority will be subject to certain restrictions in terms of their subsequent use and may only be passed on to the specific &ldquo;competent authorities&rdquo; listed in the section.</P>
        <P>In my opening comments I said that the Bill is founded on the principles of reasonable and proportionate regulation and enforcement, given that so many charities are small and volunteer-led.  It is not always appropriate to issue proceedings for what may only be minor, or unintended, breaches of the legislation.  In this regard, under section<b> </b>73, the authority will have the option to impose intermediate sanctions on an organisation rather than initiate full proceedings.  Examples of such scenarios include where an organisation has failed to comply with its reporting or accounting obligations under the legislation.  Such intermediate sanctions might involve the removal of an organisation from the register until it complies fully with its obligations or entering a statement of the contravention on the register.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, the authority will take on the role of &ldquo;protector of charities&rdquo;.  In this context, section 74 allows the authority, where it considers that a charity or its property is at risk and where it is considered to be in the best interests of the organisation, to apply to the High Court for either an interim, interlocutory or permanent order to, for example, suspend, remove or even appoint a trustee.</P>
        <P>In the case of a dispute concerning a decision of the authority, Part 5 provides for an extra-judicial appeals mechanism, to be known as the charity appeals tribunal, to help to avoid the costs associated with going to the High Court.  This dispute resolution mechanism is intended to be accessible by all charities, irrespective of their size.</P>
        <P>The provisions relating to the tribunal are set out in sections 75 to 79.  It will have five members and membership will include persons with a legal background and persons with expertise relating to charities.  The Bill allows the tribunal to develop its own procedures, subject to ministerial consent.  Its proceedings will generally be in public, although a &ldquo;non-disclosure&rdquo; provision is available if required.  Decisions of the tribunal may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
        <P>The new authority will also be required to carry out the functions under the Charities Acts 1961 and 1973 currently carried out by the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland, which is to be dissolved on establishment day.  Part 6, consisting of sections 80 to 87, contains fairly standard technical provisions which allow for the transfer of statutory functions from a dissolved body to a new authority.  They deal with, for example, the transfer of land or property and the transfer of any business in hand to the new authority from the commissioners.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and pay tribute to the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  The chairman, the Honourable Mr. Justice Francis D. Murphy, and his fellow commissioners have made a great contribution to public service in Ireland by willingly <Col N="433"/>providing their considerable expertise without charge to the State for many years.  One of the significant challenges facing the new authority will be taking on the role of the commissioners.</P>
        <P>On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I added two new sections to the Bill relating to charity trustees.  The first, in section 88, will allow trustees and persons personally connected with trustees to receive remuneration in respect of non-trustee services provided to a charity.  The second provision, in section 89, allows charities to take out indemnity insurance in order that charity trustees are not personally liable for any losses accruing to the charity as a consequence of the performance of their duties.  Both new sections were broadly welcomed.</P>
        <P>As regards the remuneration provision, charity trustees are not currently permitted to receive any remuneration from their charity for non-trustee services provided.  Under my amendment, a trustee may provide professional or other services unrelated to their trustee role to the charity, perhaps for a fee less than the going rate.  Certain controls are in place to prevent abuse of the privilege but the bottom line is that remuneration may only be paid where it is in the best interests of the charity and it must not be for trustee services.</P>
        <P>The fact that charity trustees are currently potentially personally liable for any losses accruing to the charity as a consequence of the performance of their duties acts as a disincentive to potential charity trustees by leaving voluntary charity trustees exposed to an unreasonable personal risk.  The provisions of section 89 seek to address this issue and thus encourage citizens to take on the role of charity trustee.</P>
        <P>Part 7 updates certain provisions of the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962.  As Members will appreciate, the nature of fundraising has developed considerably since 1962.  For example, the concept of collecting &ldquo;promises of money&rdquo; through direct debits or standing orders did not arise in 1962, whereas it is now very important to charities in providing a steady and secure income stream.  Sections 90 to 93 in Part 7 will bring this method of fundraising within the collection permit regime administered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the first time, as well as enhancing the security and transparency of collections generally.  This will serve the interests of legitimate charities and increase public confidence. These sections try to ensure that charities, irrespective of the method of fundraising used, whether cash or non-cash, have reasonable access to permits.  The definition of the word &ldquo;money&rdquo; in the 1962 Act has also been broadened beyond mere notes and coins.  Another development in the area of fundraising has been the practice of selling items or tokens for a specific price.  The Bill will also address this matter.</P>
        <P>Given that fundraising practices of charities are constantly developing, the regulation of the operational aspects of fundraising does not always sit well within the rigidity of primary legislation.  To address this issue, my Department is developing with the sector an approach to regulate, through non-statutory agreed codes of practice, the operational aspects of charitable fundraising.  However, section 94 gives the Minister a reserve power to make statutory regulations on fundraising should the non-statutory approach not succeed.</P>
        <P>The final section of the main body of the Bill, section 95, exempts social finance lenders from supervision under the financial services regulatory elements of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007.  They will instead be regulated by the authority, thus avoiding dual regulation.</P>
        <P>The First Schedule sets out the legal status of the authority, the appointment of members of the authority and the procedures to be followed by it.  The authority will have a minimum of nine and a maximum of 15 members.  At least three members will have a legal background and provision is also made for persons with experience of charitable work to serve as members.  Members will be appointed by the Minister with the approval of the Government.</P><Col N="434"/>
        <P>This Schedule sets out how and why members of the authority might be removed from office.  It shows how conflicts of interest involving members or members of staff should be handled and allows the authority to establish committees to assist and advise it or perform functions that might be delegated to it.  The Second Schedule is purely technical.  It is a table showing legislation that is repealed by the Bill.</P>
        <P>Members will appreciate that this Bill is substantial.  I express my thanks to the House for the opportunity to give what was perhaps an unavoidably lengthy overview of the legislation.  Senators agree, however, that the work of charities is too important to be left bereft of any real scrutiny and that this is very necessary legislation.  As I stated, the Bill was welcomed by all sides in the D&aacute;il and the debates were positive and constructive.  I acknowledge the contributions made by Deputies Michael Ring and Jack Wall and colleagues who stood in for them.  Many of the contributions were technical and required a great deal of work.  The debate was highly constructive and I am confident Senators will engage in the forthcoming discussions on a similar basis.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis as ucht an cuireadh chuig cruinni&uacute; le h-oifigigh an Roinn Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.  The consensual approach taken by Opposition parties in the D&aacute;il will continue in this House.  While the Fine Gael Party welcomes the Charities Bill 2007 in principle, as noted by Deputy Ring, my party&rsquo;s spokesperson in the Lower House, we have certain reservations.  I, too, will raise anomalies in the Bill, for example, the absence of provisions on the promotion and advancement of human rights. </P>

	<P>This is a glaring omission.  This legislation has been a long time in gestation and reform of the charities sector is long overdue and necessary.  I hope it will add to and enhance legislation in this area and, most important, protect those involved in the charities sector.  As someone who is involved in sport and charity, I welcome the Bill.</P>
        <P>While this legislation will, if passed, introduce stronger regulation, questions still need to be answered.  I hope the provisions outlined by the Minister of State will not be as draconian as they appear.  While those involved in the charity sector broadly support the Bill, they have reservations and seek clarity.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to paid officials and volunteers of charitable organisations and those engaged in charitable activity across the country.  The thousands of charitable organisations which hold flag day and church gate collections do immense work and deserve great praise.  I hope the Bill will enhance their work.  Fund-raising, as the Minister of State has indicated, has changed considerably, but the needs of charitable organisations and those who represent them have not, mainly because of the failure of successive Governments to look after them and because of the manner in which society has evolved.  The role of a regulator must be to provide help and assistance for those involved.  While there must be transparency and accountability, there needs to be advice and a consensual approach from the regulator, not a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; overseeing matters.  I know from talking to the Minister of State that this is not his wish either.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will adopt a consensual approach to the Bill, but we shall make known our reservations and reserve the right to table amendments on Committee Stage. The regulation of the charities sector will create a regulatory framework within which charities may operate.  There is no doubt, from talking to various organisations, that this will transform the sector which, as the Minister of State indicated, has been largely unregulated.  I mentioned transparency and <Col N="435"/>accountability and charitable organisations need to adhere to these objectives, for the sake of the bodies themselves and the people with whom they work.  The establishment of a charities regulator will bring about change.  This must not mean, however, that fees or large amounts are levied on charitable organisations which will now be protected from rogue operators.  It is accepted that existing structures need to be strengthened and we need to monitor and regulate charities.</P>
        <P>I know from personal experience that many charities aspire to high standards of fund-raising and they will welcome the changes outlined in the Bill.  However, there is some concern that the extra layer of structural regulation will involve a compliance cost factor.  I hope that will be examined and that excessive fees will not be the result.  Controls on fund-raising are overdue.  We are all aware of flag days and church gate collections for different charitable events that are largely unchecked.  There is, however, one issue that needs to be addressed in the Bill, under section 91, which deals with the duties of collectors.  I understand the premise here is based on creating public confidence, instilling accountability and the tightness of control.</P>
        <P>The Irish Cancer Society, to take one organisation, hosts a national daffodil day.  Under the Bill before the House collectors for that organisation must have a sealed box to collect the money.  I have spent many a Friday collecting for this organisation, as have many of my friends.  A fee is charged for the daffodil emblem, the daffodil or the lapel pin.  However, under the legislation, as proposed, this daffodil day cannot continue, which poses a problem for the Irish Cancer Society.  I am merely giving this as an example.  The society takes in an inordinate amount of money on that fund-raising day, but that must now stop, according to the Bill as it is currently constituted.  That is wrong.  If a person has only &euro;1, he or she cannot buy a daffodil that might cost &euro;2.   Collectors cannot be given a float by the charity concerned, which has thousands of collection points across the country on a particular day.  That difficulty needs to be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister of State does not intend to thwart the efforts of that or other similar charities and I hope we can come up with a way to have a national collection day with, perhaps, the regulator nominating a particular day for a specific charity.  Other charities that offer items that people may buy, such as the Irish Kidney Association and the ISPCC &mdash; with its holly day &mdash; will be similarly affected.</P>
        <P>In my opening remarks I mentioned the promotion of human rights.  There has been a reluctance to include this issue in the Bill and I am not sure why.  I was hoping the Minister of State would accept that organisations that promote and advance human rights should be included, under section 3, which sets out clearly what constitutes the purpose of benefit to the community.  Surely the advancement of human rights falls into that category.  In England, Scotland and Wales the advancement of human rights is inserted in the charities legislation.  The Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Charities Act for England and Wales, both include the advancement of human rights and the promotion and advancement of equality and diversity as provisions under charitable purposes status.  Why can this not be done here?</P>
        <P>An amendment could be inserted under section 3(10), as the Minister of State did in the other House, under the heading of environmental sustainability.  Perhaps the Greens were more worried about the environment than about human rights.  I do not know and I am not saying that, but&mdash;&mdash;-</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Senator&rsquo;s human right. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I do not understand the reason in this case, and I ask the Minister of State to examine this again on Committee Stage.  Human rights, as Senator Norris I am sure can say more eloquently than I, are of major importance and benefit to the community.  I <Col N="436"/>have had representations from the Irish Council of Civil Liberties and a host of other organisations which make very pertinent and strong claims.  Under the provisions of the Bill, such an amendment could be inserted.  I should like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on how its continued exclusion may be justified as an express category of purpose that is of benefit to the community.  I look forward to his response in that regard. </P>
        <P>Turning to the issue of protection of directors, trustees etc., I listened carefully to the Minister of State&rsquo;s address in this regard and noted what he said.  However, this week I met members of Respond who raised serious concerns about the Bill, and claim it fails to provide specific protection for voluntary directors.  They say that if an organisation such as Respond enters into a contract with a body such as the HSE, for example, and there is a withdrawal of funding, the trustees are liable for any deficit.  I know that indemnity for trustees is provided for in the Bill, but I remain unconvinced in this regard, to be honest.</P>
        <P>The exclusion of sporting clubs is a contentious point, with the Federation of Irish Sports calling for the inclusion of sporting organisations under the legal definition of a charitable purpose.  Again, this is an area of benefit to the community, as people donate, bequeath legacies, leave money in wills etc, to such organisations.  If, for example, a person leaves money to a charitable organisation, it goes straight to the body concerned.  However, if it is left to a sporting club, a tax must be paid on it, which I believe is unfair &mdash; since sporting clubs are of major benefit to the communities they serve.</P>
        <P>I also want to refer, as Deputy Michael Ring did in the other House, to the issue of bogus mass cards.  I realise the Minister of State is examining this area and I hope he might table an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage.  The Irish Missionary Union has been very proactive in this regard.  The impression given is that the money for mass cards is given to a charity or direct to a beneficiary, but this does not happen, as the Minister of State knows.  There is deception in this regard, and that needs to be addressed.  Commercialisation of masses is not of benefit to the people involved, and I look forward to the response of the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
      
        <P>Prior to this Bill being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas, many organisations spoke to Members, and I want to pay tribute to them for their assistance and help.  There are issues to be addressed.  I hope this legislation will provide assistance for charities, for training on compliance issues and an easier regime.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Regarding the Competition Authority, the Minister of State has said appointments will be made by the Minister with the approval of the Government but can we have the election of representatives of charitable bodies to it?  Inclusion Ireland is one such example which encompasses many charitable organisations providing services for those with a disability.  I am worried, given the propensity of Governments to appoint their own to boards, that we will lose valuable people from charitable organisations.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, as I am sure he will appoint very good people, but if one looks at the scope of Government appointments, in the last ten years they have been predominantly Fianna F&aacute;il members, with some members of the Progressive Denmocrats and the Green Party.   I am concerned about this.</P>
        <P>The promotion of human rights is of importance, as is the collection on Daffodil Day.  These are of huge concern, not just to my party but to many others.  I will table an amendment to section 91 of the Bill, and also one on the human rights issue because having spent many days<b> </b>fund-raising we need to protect organisations which offer an emblem or a token.  I do not understand why the issue of human rights is not dealt with in the Bill.  It is a grave mistake.  In the budget the Government cut the allocations to agencies and I wonder if we are eroding the <Col N="437"/>importance of human rights issues by stealth.  I hope we are not.  I do not mean to be cynical but the advancement of community would benefit from having the issue of human rights dealt with in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his work on the Bill and his courtesy in providing for a briefing.  I also pay tribute to his officials who were very courteous and helpful.  There is a consensual approach.  I do not agree with everything included in the Bill and have some reservations, but welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  Having spent years as a member of boards, I know there is a need for regulation, accountability and transparency and that many charities which have not had these are worried and have a right to be so.  If we are dealing with money and people, we need accountability.</P>
        <P>This is very important legislation which is long overdue.  There will be a consensus approach on this side of the House.  I look forward to the next Stage of the Bill when we can tease out anomalies.  We will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus oifigigh na Roinne.  N&iacute;l aon amhras ann ach go raibh an soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a thug an tAire d&uacute;inn ar an mBille thar a bheith cabhrach.  Thugas faoi ndeara go bhfuil an Chomhairle curtha i gcr&iacute;ch.  T&aacute; sin soil&eacute;ir sa Bhille freisin.  Molaim an tAire St&aacute;it as Bille chomh ilghabh&aacute;lach le seo a chur ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill which has been in gestation for some time.  All those involved in the charity movement had hoped to see their concerns on certain issues addressed in it.  I welcome the broad consultation which has taken place.  There are approximately 7,000 charities registered in Ireland which gives us an idea of how extensive the sector is.  It mirrors and reflects the attitude of the broader community towards charitable organisations.</P>
        <P>I compliment and acknowledge charities which during the years have filled many gaps in humanitarian practices and ensured vulnerable people have always received support.  That has been the tradition in Ireland for many years.  The Bill does not obstruct but provides support, much of which is necessary.  A good deal of the legislation in place is archaic and we have moved on, even on the issue of a common currency.</P>
        <P>There have been some unfortunate cases that did not bring glory to us as a people or the charity movement.  They had to be attended to and regulated for and I am glad that has happened.  From what the Minister of State said and looking at the Bill, we acknowledge established charitable organisations but must also recognise that new charities will come into existence as needs emerge.  The legislation does not just take account of the <i>status quo</i> but must also provide for what might happen in the future.  That is important.</P>
        <P>The number of staff in the regulatory authority will be between nine and 15.  That is the correct number because it would be wrong to have a situation where there would be 25 or 30 staff based on representative arithmetic.  It is important to have three legal representatives because there are many legal issues involved.  I hope, however, that it will not be necessary to use some of the powers being given to the regulatory authority.  I am glad to note that subsections with a consultative nature can be established within the authority.  They too will have to operate within certain restrictions because they will have to produce reports.  They will possibly be specialists in their own right and be able to reflect on a situation that might arise.</P>
        <P>It is right that charities report on their activities each year.  It does entail extra administrative work but also focuses the mind, which is important for charities.  When one is obliged to produce an annual report, it provides an opportunity to consider if the aims and objectives set have been met, how effectively they have been achieved and if a redirection is needed in the following year.  It is also good that there is accountability.</P><Col N="438"/>
        <P>I am glad smaller charities will not be subject to the same level &mdash; I mean this in the best sense &mdash; of bureaucracy.  This is very important because we hear that voluntarism is being challenged more than it was, although it has been stated that approximately 1.8 million people are involved in some way in voluntary activity, which does not surprise me.  There is also a danger that volunteers might consider that once they provide a service, they are under a spotlight and that matters might be reported on by the media.  If an extra burden were to be added, many volunteers might leave the sector and there would be a gap.  I am glad the Bill has been thought through to this extent.  That is important for many reasons.</P>
        <P>Obviously, there will be penalties involved.  However, even with penalties, there is always a possibility of appeal.  I notice there is provision for a particular case to go to the High Court with regard to whether the charity can remain on the register.  It is important to have such provisions because often we end up with what we regard as gilt-edged legislation, but when we try to operate it subsequently we discover the difficulties with it.  I am glad, therefore, the potential difficulties have been thought of in advance.</P>
        <P>The concept of a register of charities is long overdue.  Many of us have been confronted with whether we were donating to a bona fide charity.  As has been mentioned, this happens in particular with regard to clothes.  The collection of clothes is a lucrative business.  When people read the leaflet dropped to their houses seeking donations of clothes, they are often not 100% sure whether the collection is for a genuine charity.  In most cases it probably is not so.</P>
        <P>It is only right that promoters of a charity who take a major portion of the income for themselves should not be allowed on the register of charities.  Everybody has doubts about contributions to such charities.  People wonder how much goes to the charity and how much goes to the sponsor and on administration.  Covering this area in legislation will ensure people no longer have doubts in their minds.  I always feel sorry for charities that collect legitimately but are confronted by public doubts about the money collected.  Perception and confidence are vital to uphold the work of charities and ensure their success.  Many millions are lost to charities each year because people doubt that when they put their hands in their pockets to contribute or donate clothes the moneys raised go to the cause for which it is intended.  The provisions of the Bill can only be helpful in this regard.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point about the Irish Cancer Society.  We have had a briefing on that issue.  While one can fully understand why sealed boxes are necessary, will the Minister of State expand on this issue?  As Senator Buttimer said, there could be hundreds or thousands of people involved in collecting for the society and it might not be feasible to provide them with floats.  However, when selling an item, if they have sealed boxes they may have to go into shops to get change for people.  I am unsure how we can balance this with public confidence in regard to the sealed box.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.</P>
        <P>As a person who generally speaks on the issue of human rights, I take up the same point raised by Senator Buttimer.  While we do not have an implicit definition of a charity, something we have not had in the past either, the &ldquo;greater good of the community&rdquo; seems to be an inherent element, as was mentioned in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  The term &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;, which is all-embracing and expansive, brings the greater good of the community into focus.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?  Not a day passes in this House but an issue of human rights is raised, particularly on the Order of Business.  Full marks to Senator Norris who is at the forefront in this regard.  The area is so extensive there may be need for separate legislation, but I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment in this regard.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the trustees of a charity, I am delighted to see the suggestion that the organisation should or could take out indemnity insurance.  Is this compulsory or is it a matter <Col N="439"/>for the organisation to decide?  Indemnity insurance is important because the responsibilities arising for trustees as a result of this legislation are so great.  This area must be clarified because it is something trustees will be concerned about.  We must be sure volunteers are not exposed to legal action as a result of the legislation because they are fundamental to the work of the charity.</P>
        <P>On the issue of bogus collectors, I am glad we have covered what might be called &ldquo;holding out&rdquo;.  Bogus collectors are particularly careful not to use the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; in their literature.  However, when one reads between the lines, that is the implication.  I am glad this is covered so that if by implication they represent themselves as a charity, there is a mechanism to deal with that.</P>
        <P>I am delighted the current 7,000 registered charities will automatically transfer to the new regulatory authority.  If that were not the case, we would have a logjam and might wonder in years to come why so many elements of the legislation had not been implemented.  There are two major strengths to the transfer.  First, it recognises the establishment of the new regulatory authority and, second, it presupposes that existing registered charities will not need to go through the same administrative requirements as previously.</P>
        <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to make my points.  I support the Bill and am delighted it has cross-party support because it is necessary for the work of charities to continue.  The Bill is timely and the Minister of State and his officials have done an excellent job on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill.  As indicated, it is a substantial Bill.  There is no need for the Minister of State to apologise for his lengthy introduction to it because it was necessary.  This is the first regulation in a long time on the issue.  The Minister of State cited a statute of Queen Elizabeth I, which was a long time ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will be constructive, as have been my colleagues.  However, in addition to welcoming the main provisions of the Bill, I am concerned about some concealed effects it may have.  Senator Buttimer referred to most of these concerns.  It seems we have been briefed by similar organisations.  It is important the public&rsquo;s trust and confidence in charities is sustained.  Once or twice over the past ten or 20 years, this confidence has been knocked, but by and large the charities involved have subsequently regulated themselves satisfactorily.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister has looked at the question of religious organisations.  I take it that includes the Church of Scientology, the Moonies and such groups.  They need to be looked at carefully and I have no difficulty with that.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether there will be a relationship between the newly established body and the dormant accounts fund and the national lottery fund?  These two funds disburse significant amounts towards charities.</P>
        <P>Everybody will welcome the charities regulatory authority, the register of charities, the exclusion of specifically political lobby groups from the definition of charity, charity trustees and the clarification of their responsibilities in law, and the regulation of street collection.  That has been necessary for a long time.  I do not mean to blow my own trumpet, but I support many charities by way of a cheque payment.</P>
        <P>I regularly send them a reasonably fat cheque on foot of a harrowing photograph.  One immediately receives a note of thanks that includes an even more harrowing photograph and one&rsquo;s heart is bled dry.  This is fine and I can put up with that.  Sometimes however, I pass eight different individuals or charities.  How can as many as three different charities be collecting on Grafton Street on the same day?  It demeans the process and there must be some regulation in this regard.</P>
        <P>However, the principal matter I wish to examine today is precisely the point first raised by Senator Buttimer and then alluded to in his gracious way by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  I refer to the <Col N="440"/>astonishing absence of human rights provision from the Bill, which is very sinister.  If the Minister of State does not believe the leading organisations in this area are seriously concerned, he should look at the Gallery, in which distinguished people from practically all such organisations can be seen at present, including representatives from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Free Legal Advice Centres, Front Line and Amnesty International.  They are not present because they consider the debate to be entertaining but because they rightly are very concerned.  The promotion and protection of human rights must be included in this Bill&rsquo;s provisions and I have tabled an amendment in this regard.  I am sure Members on this side of the House will fight strongly for it.  Moreover, I appeal to the decent humane people, such as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who has a distinguished track record and has taken quite a few risks with regard to matters such as the Iraq war, about which he was outstanding, as well as the Green Party Members, to use their leverage on this issue.  The Green Party has spoken about this in the D&aacute;il and the Minister of State should listen to them.</P>
        <P>While Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is delighted with the Bill and Senator Buttimer has expressed some concerns, I am suspicious and will explain why.  I look at the budget and recall the comforting words, to quote the Communion service, of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who stated that one of the three aims of his budget was to protect &ldquo;those who are most vulnerable in our [country]&rdquo;.  Three weeks ago, when attending a photo opportunity at the AIB Bank Centre, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">This photo should serve to remind us all that we can never become complacent about the role Ireland must play through the United Nations and the European Union in resolving conflicts, preventing international crises and ending abuses of human rights, especially genocide.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, what does the Government then do?  It has hammered every human rights organisation in Ireland, which is astonishing.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis has blown Members&rsquo; protests off the media radar.  The Government has abolished the Combat Poverty Agency and has spancelled the Equality Authority by halving its income and dispersing it around the country.  It has mixed up all kinds of people with different expertise.  All such organisations have been hit because they advocate human rights and decent levels of support for the most vulnerable people.  In the kind of financial crisis we face both globally and domestically, we need such organisations to be strengthened and not be subject to an attempt to neuter them.  All sensible people undoubtedly would conclude that the promotion of human rights and the provision of support to those throughout the world who defend human rights definitely should be considered under the objectives of this Bill.  However, this is not the case and the only inevitable conclusion one can come to is this constitutes a further indicator of a policy by the Government to limit the expression of such groups.</P>
        <P>For many years, I was a member of the council, committee, board or whatever it was, of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and, consequently, I know a certain amount about it.  It was founded in 1976 by Mary Robinson and Kader Asmal and I became involved fairly early on.  Members should consider its achievements.  For example, it has helped to secure the establishment of an independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the legalisation of the right to divorce.  It has furthered children&rsquo;s rights, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and enhanced equality legislation.  Its mission statement, to use that abused phrase, is to advocate for positive changes in the area of human rights and to monitor Government policy.  Is the reason for its exclusion because it will be effective in monitoring Government policy?  This makes me very worried.  Its purpose also is to ensure the Government complies with international standards and to conduct original research, publish reports, run campaigns and so on.</P><Col N="441"/>
        <P>Deputy Joe Costello of the Labour Party noted it was strange that human rights should be excluded, as surely no better charitable cause existed.  He also expressed his belief that this is expected of Ireland by the international community under the European Convention on Human Rights as well as broader international commitments under the United Nations charter.  Senator Buttimer ably indicated the position that obtains in the neighbouring island.  I am astonished by this omission in that light.  I have been a Member for 21 years and routinely have witnessed the Government introducing, <i>en bloc</i>, legislation that was made in the United Kingdom.  We follow it slavishly.  Hence, when it is not automatically done, as in this case, a specific decision has been made to exclude.  It cannot be for legal reasons because if it was found possible in the neighbouring island, it certainly is possible here.  As it has been done in Scotland, England and Wales, why not here?  What is the hold-up?</P>
        <P>This point was made, not for the first time although very ably, by Senator Buttimer today.  It was made just as ably in the Lower House by a member of the Minister of State&rsquo;s own party.  I refer to a man with a conscience who comes from a family that has acted as a conscience within Fianna F&aacute;il, namely, Deputy Chris Andrews.  As the Minister of State also has a conscience, I ask him to reconsider this issue.  Deputy Andrews asked why, if this could be done in Scottish or English legislation, it could not be done in Irish legislation.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Minister of State should not tell me it is not necessary because it is considered to be so.  Among other matters, I have been informed the deeming provision may not be strong enough to ensure the survival into the new legislation of charitable organisations with a human rights element because some of them were established so long ago they may not have included the precise formula, in respect of this Bill, that will meet that requirement.  Were the Minister of State to make the point that they will be included without being acknowledged, that would not be satisfactory either.  First, I do not know this to be the case and, second, the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to acknowledge them gives a bad signal of which it eventually will come to be ashamed.</P>
        <P>Having mentioned Deputy Chris Andrews, I will refer to another element in the Government, namely, the Green Party.  My good colleague and, I am proud to say, constituent, Deputy Mary White, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Green Party shares the concerns of the voluntary sector that by not including these purposes in the legislation, it might diminish the standing it has in the eyes of the State and possibly result in the unintended exclusion of such organisations from the register, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other purposes that are of benefit, and in turn public thinking.  The advancement of human rights, social inclusion and social justice are pursuits worthy of equal recognition to those listed in the relevant section [8].</P>
        <P FLI="0">Moreover, as stated previously, the Government cannot offer the excuse that it cannot accept amendments in the Seanad because the Bill would be obliged to go back before the D&aacute;il and that it does not expect any amendments, because it already has expanded the Bill.  The Government has expanded the Bill under pressure from the Green Party to include the environment.  Is the environment more significant to the Government than human rights?  That is what the Official Report will show unless the Minister of State accepts the tabled amendments.  I have tabled amendments on this issue and I am sure my colleagues will support them unless they tabled theirs first, in which case I will be delighted to support them.</P>

	<P>In that one minute, I will deal with a couple of items.  First, I strongly support the business about Daffodil Day.  I never have collected and loathe having anything to <Col N="442"/>do with money.  I am awful at it and it makes me shiver.  Sometimes they make me take up the collection in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and I have taken to refusing to do it.  I simply will not do it.  However, I did help them with the photo opportunities by clowning around.  I know how terribly important&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was no problem to the Senator.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It was no bother to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was no problem whatever.  I know how terribly important it is.  This is a question of change and of being able to give change when using a sealed box.  The Minister of State will consider this issue.</P>
        <P>Another matter, which also was mentioned by Senator Buttimer, was raised by the Respond housing agency.  It pertains to the withdrawal of previously agreed State funding, thereby leaving an affected organisation with a hole in its funds for which it could be found liable.  This matter must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of sport, which is beneficial to the community.  While some organisations, such as the GAA, receive enormous sums of money, they do a very good job and it is important in respect of the promotion of health.  It is a primary vehicle for active citizenship and their exclusion from this legislation also may exclude them from access to philanthropy or grants administered by the Irish Sports Council and will deprive them of a certain level of legitimacy.  A reply to the effect that a separate regime is provided under tax legislation for sport and so on would be inadequate.  Under section 41 of the Finance Act 2002, tax relief is restrictive in that it is only available on donations made to certain sports bodies and on funding of capital projects that have ministerial approval.  One could find oneself in the ludicrous situation of having money for a sports hall but none for a boxing coach and so on.</P>
        <P>While these are important points, they are not half as important as the inclusion of human rights.  The Minister of State is a decent and humane man whose heart is in the right place.  His party is urging him to do this.  Every single element of the House and all the relevant organisations are asking for it.  I will use this opportunity to ask him to do the decent thing, which is his instinct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, on the work he has initiated since entering office.  The Charities Bill 2007 will reform the charities sector and will provide protection to those engaged in charitable activities and who collect money for charitable purposes.  Its purpose is to bring about a reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability and to protect against abuses of charitable status and fraud.  It will also enhance public trust and confidence in charities and increase transparency in the sector.  Together with the Charities Acts 1961 to 1973, the Bill will provide for a composite regulatory framework for charities through a combination of new legislative provisions and the retention of existing charities legislation, with updating, where appropriate.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision in respect of a number of key issues.  For the first time, a definition of &ldquo;charitable purpose&rdquo; is being included primary legislation.  In addition, a new regulatory authority to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and also to encourage better administration of charities will be established and a register of charities with which all charities operating in the State must register will be set up.  The Bill will minimise also the administrative burden placed on charities where possible.  I welcome this development because <Col N="443"/>those involved with charities often give their services voluntarily and are not paid for their efforts.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a charity appeals tribunal, the dissolution of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland upon the establishment of the new regulatory authority and the transfer at that stage of its functions to the authority.  All jurisdictions previously vested in the Attorney General by statute or common law in respect of charities will be transferred to the new authority.  As a result, clarity will be provided for many charitable organisations and registered charities.</P>
        <P>I am sure that, like me, other Members received representations welcoming the legislation.  However, issues that could also be described as matters of concern have also been raised.  We take on board people&rsquo;s concerns.  In my opinion, the Bill gives the concept of charitable status a new meaning.  For the first time, the phrase &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; will be fully defined in primary legislation as follows: the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship; the advancement of education; the advancement of religion; and any other purpose that is of benefit to the community.  The term &ldquo;any other purpose&rdquo; refers to the advancement of community welfare, including the relief of those in need by reason of youth, age, ill health or disability; the advancement of community development, including rural or urban regeneration; the promotion of civic responsibility or voluntary work in the community; the advancement of conflict resolution or reconciliation; the promotion of religious or racial harmony and harmonious community relations; the protection of the natural environment; the advancement of environmental sustainability; the efficient and effective use of the property of charitable organisations; the prevention or relief of the suffering of animals; the advancement of the arts, culture, heritage and sciences; and the integration of those who are disadvantaged and the promotion of their full participation in society.</P>
        <P>A number of groups and organisations relayed concerns to Members about their activities not being covered under the legislation.  In light of the wide range of matters in respect of which provision is made in the Bill, however, those concerns will be allayed.</P>
        <P>As already stated, the Bill will minimise the administrative burden placed on charitable organisations.  I welcome the initiative taken in this regard.  The work of charitable organisations tends to be voluntary in nature and any reduction in or minimisation of their administrative burden is welcome.</P>
        <P>The esteemed Senator Norris referred to sporting organisations.  I am involved with many such organisations in the area of athletics, Gaelic games, etc., and they are close to my heart.  As a director of the Donegal sports partnership, I am acutely aware of the need to afford protection to sporting organisations.  Sporting bodies, as defined under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are being excluded from being charitable bodies under the Bill.  Their current status will not change and they will remain the subject of a separate tax exemption regime operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  This will allow each sporting organisation to qualify, on merit, for tax exemption.</P>

	<P>I support the legislation, which will bring clarity in respect of the charitable sector.  I commend the Minister of State on his efforts and commitment in respect of this matter.  I agree with the points made about the Bill by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, my party&rsquo;s spokesperson in the Seanad on community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill.  As other Members said, it will introduce a regulatory regime which will serve the interests of the public and charities, and in that regard it is to be welcomed.  </P><Col N="444"/>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, to the House in respect of his introduction of this important legislation.  As acknowledged by other Members, we have a proud tradition of charitable donation in this country.  Many of our charities fly the flag for Ireland, domestically and internationally.  Organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire, Concern and the Niall Mellon Trust have acted as ambassadors, attracting international admiration for the superb work they do in developing countries.  Domestically, the Irish Cancer Society and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are two examples of the breadth of charitable activity in our society.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, we must reflect on the fact that, in the context of the latest round of cutbacks, many of which are essentially targeted at some of our most vulnerable citizens, our charities will be called upon more than ever to fill the gap in services that should be provided by Government.  It is ironic that this Bill should come before us now.  A proper regulatory regime is long overdue for many reasons, many of which have been outlined by my colleagues and, in fairness, the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that there are those who exploit the goodwill of Irish people while posing as agents of charities when in reality they are bogus.  This affects the credibility of genuine charities, in particular those that are not so well known but which do invaluable work in their field of endeavour.  The Bill will go a long way to addressing this problem through the creation of the regulatory authority which will oversee compliance with the legislation.  Central to this is the register of charities which will be maintained by the authority and open to the public to view, which is an important aspect of this legislation.  The unique registration number for each charity, be they Irish or foreign but operating in Ireland, is one of the measures that will improve transparency.  This is supported by the authority&rsquo;s role in regulating fundraising activity by issuing permits and updating the regulations to account for modern collection methods.  The authority will also promote good administration practice within charities and require them to keep proper accounts.</P>
        <P>It is legitimate for the public to ask what is being done with the money collected by charities and if it can be better spent.  Charities are not immune from the need to be efficient and transparent.  The authority will have powers to investigate and sanction, where appropriate, those posing as charities.  The regulation of trustees is an important provision.  The proposed register of disqualified persons, which will be available to the public, is another measure that will foster confidence in the sector.</P>
        <P>I note the authority will also have an advisory role, in particular with smaller charities that may struggle to meet their new obligations under this legislation.  The appeals mechanism provided for in the Bill is an important counter-balance to the authority but we must ensure it is effective as an appeals body and is not simply a body that rubber-stamps the authority&rsquo;s determinations.</P>
        <P>I hope this Bill will be the first step in addressing the issue of charities paying VAT.  Lack of a proper regulatory and registration regime for charities was a major impediment to this being achieved in the past.  It is hoped also that following a suitable period during which the legislation will take effect, the Government will return to this matter.  I welcome in particular the decision not to restrict the advocacy role of charities.  This would have seriously hindered their effectiveness on the ground and as a force of civil society raising public consciousness about the many ills in our country and around the world.</P>
        <P>I want now to raise a particular matter with the Minister of State.  I am effectively reiterating what has been said by some of my colleagues, in particular, Senators Buttimer and Norris, namely, the inexplicable and as yet unexplained omission or deliberate exclusion by the Minister of human rights from the lengthy list, referred to a few moments ago by Senator &Oacute; <Col N="445"/>Domhnaill, as purposes of benefit to the community.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill seemed to think that because that list includes some areas that might avail of human rights organisations, they should be assured by this.  They cannot be assured by that.  The Minister was asked during the debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il to include human rights as a sub-category and decided not to do so.  Anyone who examines this legislation following enactment can only come to the conclusion that a deliberate attempt or positive decision was made by Government to exclude it.  There is no point suggesting human rights fits into this somewhere between subsections (<i>a</i>) and (j) of section 3(8) .  That is nonsensical.  I say that with respect to my colleagues.  Ultimately, it is not the case that one can find a place for human rights organisations, their having been directly and knowingly excluded by the Minister when this matter was dealt with in the D&aacute;il.   I hope the Minister will revisit this issue.  There is no reason he should not do so.</P>
        <P>The explanation that has been given is not satisfactory or convincing.  I say that with respect to the Minister.  The explanation given was that the Bill was seeking neither to narrow nor broaden the purposes that have emerged through case law down through the years.  As Senator Norris pointed out, the Minister has added a particular category in terms of the inclusion of environmental organisations.  It is not true to say that some categories of organisations have not been included by way of direct decision of the Minister.  There is nothing that would prevent the Minister including human rights organisations or at least including human rights as a purpose.  We are speaking not about listing organisations in legislation but about listing categories of activity, which is an important point.  The organisations concerned are not lobbying politicians specifically in regard to their own organisations although they would benefit were such provision to be introduced.  It is the wider principle that is important.  It is a fundamental and important principle, as pointed out by other speakers.</P>
        <P>A noteworthy article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>  relates to a speech made yesterday, in the context of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by President McAleese who quite rightly pointed to the importance of strong laws and accessible mechanisms for the vindication of human rights and how important these elements are in ensuring a human rights culture.  It is extraordinary that the Government should omit or, as I said, decide deliberately to exclude human rights as one of the categories under section 3(2) of the Bill.  I ask that the Minister revisit this issue.  I know he is a reasonable person and that he understands the arguments put to him.  If he is not inclined to respond positively at the end of this debate perhaps he will do so on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I reiterate, with respect to the Minister of State, that the explanation given so far is simply not convincing.  I will not on this occasion go so far as Senator Norris but I will sit back and invite the Minister to give us an explanation that is persuasive and convincing.  In the absence of such an explanation, I too would have to conclude that there is some other reason for excluding this area of activity from the Bill.  What could it be?  Of course, people are entitled to speculate as to what it might be.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks a number of human rights organisations and organisations involved in related activity have been undermined.  Some have been abolished by Government in the course of the past few weeks.  Reference is often made to the human rights industry and to other pejorative type descriptions of organisations that are involved in this area.  I do not for one minute attribute that to this Minister but it is the type of debate and argument that is taking place.  It is not worthy of the Government to take this type of approach.  I hope the decision made in the context of this Bill is not reflective of this type of attitude towards human rights and the promotion of human rights, so ably and eloquently upheld by the President of Ireland in her speech yesterday.</P><Col N="446"/>
        <P>On the objectives and purposes set out in the Bill, the Minister makes the point in his speech that the list of four draws on case law over many years and what are described as the Pemsel categories of charitable purposes, which as we all know go back a number of centuries to the beginning of the 17th century.  I do not know if there was much of a premium in the early 17th century for human rights, but I doubt it.  We have come a long way since.  It is not convincing to suggest, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has &mdash; I am sure with the best will in the world &mdash; that the purpose of human rights is to be found in any of these subsections, the Minister of State having decided to exclude them.</P>
        <P>It has been mentioned that the advancement of environmental sustainability has been included.  One of the other purposes included in section 3(8)(<i>j</i>) is &ldquo;the prevention or relief of suffering of animals&rdquo;.  I entirely agree with its inclusion.  However, if we are prepared to include a purpose that relates to the prevention or relief of suffering of animals, people are entitled to ask why we cannot also include a category that relates to the prevention or relief of suffering of humans.  That question requires to be answered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good to see a charities Bill finally working its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has been a long time in gestation since the first treatment of the Bill was made available a number of years ago.  It was promised over the course of several years.  One can see by its length that there were many issues to be considered, some of which are still open for consideration.  The Second Stage debate, as in the other House, is an important part of the process.</P>
        <P>Since the original publication of the Bill, there have been several significant developments, one of which was the initial reluctance to include advocacy as an issue to be addressed.  This comes from a particular official mindset, not necessarily a party political one, that charities should be seen and not heard.  We have been very fortunate that many of our social services have been provided by charitable organisations in a way that the State has been unwilling to provide them.  Even as we have grown more prosperous as a country, certain parts of our social services would collapse if it were not for the existence and actions of charitable organisations.  The need for legislation of this type is obvious and it is very welcome.  It fills a significant gap and will be the template for the development of further legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are ongoing concerns about particular charitable organisations, the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> and objectives of which are not appropriately covered in the Bill.  This has been mentioned in the context of human rights, in particular.  My understanding of the concerns expressed &mdash; the Minister of State might allude to this &mdash; is that it is partly a question of drafting but mainly a matter of political concern about how to define organisations which exist for the promotion and enhancement of human rights and the extremely grey area between such organisations and openly political groupings.  I am talking about party political groupings, in particular.  How to legislate for this and provide a buffer is the essential issue.  It should be possible to do this and we should be working towards making it possible.  I have a sense that there are many in the Government who would like to see it happen.  However, because there is this grey area as of now there is an unwillingness to go as far as we need to go.  We still have an opportunity in the remaining Stages of the Bill to continue to examine that issue and ask the appropriate questions.  I hope it can be done.  If not, it will leave a significant area to which we will need to return in the very near future to amend appropriately.  Human rights organisations represent an important part of charitable activity and without their existence the body politic would be weaker.  We would not have properly informed debates, decision making and allocation of resources.  We should recognise them in legislation and I would like to think we would do so, although I understand the political and drafting constraints.</P><Col N="447"/>
        <P>The other provisions that may follow the passage of the Charities Bill in both Houses of the Oireachtas relate to finances.  While this is not a money Bill, for many years my party has argued that we should look at the Danish example of VAT exemptions for charities.  Money that they collect from the general public tends to be eaten up by taxes returned to the State for goods and services provided largely on behalf of the State.  There are mechanisms we can and should consider which have been given favourable consideration.  In the course of the budget debate the Minister for Finance indicated he was willing to do this.  Possibly in next year&rsquo;s budget and Finance Bill we will have such a mechanism.</P>
        <P>Attention should be drawn to the concerns raised by the free legal advice centres about the liability that accrues to directors in a situation where State assistance and funding to such organisations is subject to immediate review and reduction.  If the State has been supplying funding to voluntary organisations, they may have made decisions on this basis.  The legal position of directors of charities taking on a liability they did not understand they would have in making their original decision is something we should review.  It may be a matter of company law.  However, the Bill, as comprehensive and welcome as it is, fails to address these questions.  While it is not addressed in the Bill, it is worth considering the vehicle applied in the United Kingdom, the protection of liability for many charitable organisations under the Companies Act or companies limited by guarantee.  The United Kingdom produced a legal structure known as charitable incorporated organisations.  It seems to be a more specific legal entity that is more representative of the work done by charitable bodies.  If we could examine such a structure in the context of a companies Bill, we would further ease the lot of charities.</P>
        <P>As we seek to complete the processes involved in the Charities Bill, many organisations consider they might not be properly represented by its provisions.  We have received representations from sports and religious bodies.  On the whole, other than the question of human rights which may remain unanswered on the final passage of the Bill, we have the right balance.  The religious organisations will be subject to a particular review.  I understand sports bodies are dealt with elsewhere.  As sports can be both amateur in their nature and have a significant professional money-making aspect, they should not be considered in legislation of this type.  It is right to make that distinction.</P>
        <P>We need to use the remaining time in the Seanad to answer the points and concerns raised by most speakers.  A significant unanswered question has been raised by Senators Buttimer, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Norris and Alex White.  I refer to the fact that we, as public representatives representing our political interests, recognise that there are charitable organisations and voluntary groups which represent particular interests in the field of social justice and human rights which need to have their interests reflected in the legislation.  If there are political, administrative and legal constraints, it may be that the issue will remain unresolved after the passage of the Bill.  However, it cannot remain so for long.  I hope it can be dealt with in the remaining Stages of the Bill.  However, there is a near certainty that if the Bill is passed without addressing these concerns, we will return to it sooner rather than later.  For such comprehensive and necessary legislation, it is not right that this one remaining question should be left unanswered, particularly in this climate where there are question marks over commitments to human rights in general within our ever-evolving society.  It is not right that we as a Seanad, and particularly the Government, should leave those questions unanswered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for being present to take this Bill, which, in general, I welcome.</P>
        <P>I will not delay the Minister of State or the House in making my contribution.  I know the Minister of State is an open and fair-minded person.  I know how he deals with bodies and have seen him in action.  I have only one plea to make to him, namely, that sports organisations <Col N="448"/>be permitted to be part of the new charities regime as proposed in the Bill.  That is my one plea to him.  That is the reason I requested time to say a few words on this matter.</P>
        <P>As we know, and as was referred to, sports organisations are currently specifically excluded, as the Bill is drafted.  Bodies established and existing for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports are specifically excluded.  The Minister of State will know, as we all do, how important to the life and health of the nation are all our sports bodies and activities and the wonderful work that is being done.  The Federation of Irish Sports and all the bodies it represents, including the Golfing Union of Ireland, seven members of which are present in the Gallery, strongly made the point that sport has a key role to play in the promotion of health and the prevention of disease in Irish society.  Research by the ESRI and others has found that participants in physical activity are the equivalent of 14 years younger in health terms.  I only wish I was better at sport.  The Minister of State will understand the point I am making.</P>
        <P>Sport is a primary vehicle for active citizenship and volunteerism in Irish society, with an estimated 15% of the adult population of Ireland volunteering for sporting activity in the course of each year.  This has been recognised in the report of the task force on active citizenship.  Sport advances community welfare and development.  That is recognised in the National Development Plan 2007-2013, which acknowledges the importance of sport to the social infrastructure.  Page 222 of that document states: &ldquo;Participation in sport, whether at the level of competitive sport, recreational sport or active leisure activity can yield physical and psychological well-being as well as fostering social development both in terms of the individual and the community.&rdquo;  It goes on to recognise the role of sport in building stronger communities.  We all know that is true in our communities, whether through the input of the GAA or soccer, rugby or golf clubs and so on.</P>
        <P>Obtaining charitable status for sporting organisations is vital.  I am sure the Minister of State has received representations from the various sports.  The designation of such status is vital to sporting organisations because failure to allow it will prevent sporting organisations &mdash; the vast majority of which operate with limited financial resources and are heavily reliant on Government funding for grants, administered by the Irish Sports Council &mdash; from accessing various fundraising streams, including philanthropy, legacy giving, charitable bequests and so on.  Not granting sporting organisations such status will also exclude them from many soft benefits associated with charitable status, including eligibility for grants and corporate social responsibility programmes.  Furthermore, it will deny sporting organisations the legitimacy that will derive from the improved regulatory regime laid out in this Bill in regard to charitable organisations.</P>
        <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said, but such a measure is one that all of us, including the Minister of State, consider vital.  I greatly look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Perhaps on Committee Stage he will be able to facilitate this request by the insertion of an appropriate amendment.  I believe in his own heart and mind he would agree that such a measure would be worthwhile.  It would be good not only for the sporting organisations but for the life and health of all communities throughout the country.  I believe I can trust in what the Minister of State will do.  I hope he will give this matter favourable consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him on bringing forward this Bill.  Debate on the subject of this Bill has been ongoing for the past ten years and this Bill is the culmination of that debate.  It is not before time that it has been introduced.  Approximately 7,000 organisations have charitable status and that number is increasing.  A vast amount of money, in the region of &euro;2 billion, is collected for charities annu<Col N="449"/>ally.  It is imperative that all charitable organisations are properly registered and that the funds collected are given to the charities named in the collections, but that does not always happen.  It has been a practice for some time for some organisations to give lucrative percentages to collectors on behalf of the organisations.  An extreme example of this came to my attention some years ago.  Collectors were giving 70% of the money collected to an organisation.  Those involved used the names of people suffering from an ailment in an area as collecters went to each house explaining that the money collected would assist in funding research into the ailment concerned.  I exposed that practice at health board level and thereby prevented that type of abuse in the system.</P>
        <P>I established the Kosovo Refugee Aid in 1999, which obtained charitable status.  I take this opportunity to commend all those who participated in that charity, which is still registered.  None of the volunteers, the secretary, chairperson and others who worked for that charity, received a euro in expenses.   All the money collected was ploughed back into providing assistance to the people of Kosovo at that time and in assisting people from Kosovo who came to Ireland.  That was the objective underpinning that charity and I know the procedures that were involved.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the request made by Senator Coghlan concerning sports organisations.  I know from the Minister of State&rsquo;s involvement in his constituency that he was one of the leading lights in an organisation there.  I know that if it is possible that this Bill could allow for the registration of sports organisations as charitable organisations, which effectively they are, he will be prepared to consider that request.  This is significant legislation.  Far too often in every town and village throughout this country people make collections for organisations and members of the public do not know what they are about.  These organisations can say they represent the disabled or former polio sufferers and impress on people to contribute to the charity concerned.  Irish people are very generous.  Collectors for such organisations position themselves outside the post office on a Friday when people go there to  collect their pensions and invariably the organisation for which they are collecting is not based in that locality.  The people collecting for organisations based elsewhere and people generally do not ask the collector for the permit number, which they are entitled to do to determine whether the charity is legitimate and the money will be given to the cause it purports to represent.</P>
        <P>There is also an issue concerning church gate collections, which the Minister of State will have to resolve.  It concerns all political parties, which are allowed to collect funds on certain days in the year.  That is done by volunteers collecting for voluntary organisations, which is fair enough.  A reasonable approach must be taken and rules must be brought in to cover those dates.  Where permits are given for church gate collections, organisations should not exploit their membership by trying to extract more money from people.  I refer, for example, to a collection for an organisation representing people with disabilities where a disabled person is present at the collection.  That is not necessarily required but I have come across cases where disabled people were out in poor weather.  I do not know whether they were volunteers or whether they were requested to appear at collection points to extract the maximum amount of money in donations.</P>
        <P>The Bill is comprehensive and well researched.  A large number of submissions were received from organisations throughout the country.  The general consensus is that the Bill has been well received.  Charitable organisations know there is a need to tighten up the regulations and bring about a more rational approach to charities, which is what the Minister has achieved in the Bill.  I read through many sections of the legislation and it appears to be workable and comprehensive.  I expect the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible.</P><Col N="450"/>
        <P>Members of local authorities are excluded from membership of the charities regulatory authority, as are all elected representatives, Members of the Seanad, D&aacute;il and the European Parliament.  All elected representatives who were appointed to the authority prior to their election or selection will have to step down from their positions.  There is a tendency in Bills currently to exclude public representatives.  Others who are excluded from membership of the authority include those who have been bankrupt or who have committed offences.  Section 3(3)(<i>c</i>) and (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) of Schedule 1 refer to a person who &ldquo;is convicted of any indictable offence in relation to a charitable organisation or charitable trust&rdquo;, or who &ldquo;is convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, whether in connection with a company or not&rdquo;, or who &ldquo;is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to a term of imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Public representatives are included in the group of people who are excluded from membership of the authority.  That is a civil servant approach, with all due respect to the officials concerned.  They are taking this approach in every Bill.  We allowed Members of this House to be on the board of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The vice chairman of the board is a Member of this House and he is providing a good service.  There is no reason to exclude any category of person.  Irish citizens with a right to vote should have a right to be a member of the authority.  A councillor should not be a member of the authority by right but he or she should not be excluded on the basis of his or her elected position.  That is undemocratic.  It is a serious reflection on the integrity, capacity and ability of people elected to public office.</P>
        <P>I have no objection to being excluded as a Member of the Oireachtas as we have enough responsibilities as full-time public representatives.  The same is true of Members of the Lower House.  However, I do not think Members of the Oireachtas <i>per se</i> should be excluded.  There is no reason a Senator who has a proven track record in charitable organisations should not serve well and be a conduit for an organisation to the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State was previously in the Whips&rsquo; office and he knows the situation.  At a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party we agreed a motion that each Minister would scrutinise legislation to ensure this provision was not included.  As someone who has served in his area with councillors, the Minister of State is aware of how hard they work for many organisations.  They should not be excluded from membership of the authority.</P>

	<P>I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach would like me to go further in this regard.  I intend to speak on the matter on Committee Stage.  My personal experience of the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, is that he will not exclude the possibility of allowing councillors to be on the authority.  That does not mean they have to be selected as members of the authority or that there has to be a quota of councillors or anybody else on the board.</P><Col N="451"/>
        <P>I commend the fact that there is a requirement to have gender balance on the board.

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I broadly welcome the Bill because the regulation of the charitable sector is long overdue.  The legislation has been some years in preparation and I am delighted to see it.  Like other Members I urge the Minister of State to take on board one point: to extend the definition of charitable purposes to include a charitable purpose that is beneficial to the community, namely, the advancement of human rights, as in the English legislation and the Scottish equivalent.  I do not believe section 40 covers the situation.  I accept the Minister has taken the view that charities that currently are recognised by the Revenue will be deemed to be charities for that purpose.  I agree that will cover some charities that advance human rights.  Clearly that is so, but it is not enough because there may be other charities that apply in future whose primary purpose is the protection or advancement of human rights.  I urge the Minister to consider amending section 3(10)(<i>e</i>).  An amendment to that effect may be tabled on Committee Stage but I urge the Minister to amend the section to include the purpose of the advancement of human rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik.  One of the points I was going to make related to human rights and now that Senator Bacik has done so, it takes the onus off me.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, and the Bill.  We should have had it a long time ago.</P>
        <P>Over the years, when confronted by a big bucket or box, I never knew how many cent from the &euro;1 euro donated would go to the charity.  When I was a member of a charity board I began to ask how much of the contributions given went to the charity.  I found I was no longer on the board the following year, so clearly I was asking the wrong questions.</P>
        <P>I wish to make three points.  I am especially concerned about section 485C of the Taxes Consolidation Act which puts a cap on tax relief given to charities.  I can understand how that came about.  I remember well when it became apparent that some wealthy people were not paying any tax.  A Member of the Opposition said that was outrageous and the Minister resolved to sort out the issue, and he did.  The trouble was that in closing all those other tax-efficient methods, for some reason or other he included philanthropy, in other words, the giving away of one&rsquo;s money.  That should not have been included.  I am sure that was a mistake and it can be easily corrected.  I suggest that to delete the cap on charitable donations would be at a small cost to the Exchequer and would be a considerable aid to the marginalised in society.</P>
        <P>Section 485C of the Taxes Consolidation Act is a crude instrument that fails to differentiate between tax-driven incentives for infrastructure such as car parks and nursing homes, where the taxpayer acquires a beneficial asset, and philanthropic initiatives from which a donor receives no economic gain but rather personal fulfilment.  I believe that measure was a mistake and it should not have been included, but I can understand how it came about.  The clause suggests a poor awareness of how official Ireland could and should make much better use of the power of philanthropy.  I have argued that point previously and I am not sure I am fully <Col N="452"/>understood.  I do not believe it was the intention of the Minister for Finance at that time when he resolved to ensure wealthy people would pay some tax to include those who want to give their money away.</P>
        <P>The other issue that has been mentioned is the scam of bogus pre-signed mass cards.  The Minister of State has heard about that because the bishop has been in touch with us.  I wish to highlight the massive scam of bogus mass cards for sale in shops throughout the country.  The Bill should make it compulsory for shops that sell mass cards to display charity registration numbers and perhaps even contact numbers to halt the sale of bogus mass cards.  I accept the matter has been discussed but I believe in a number of cases it was found that the mass cards on sale were questionable.  One priest had been dead for two years and in another case a priest somewhere else in the world received approximately 12 cent from the sale of a mass card that retailed for &euro;4.  We clearly must do something to solve this problem.  They are fraudulent cards and are very offensive to those who carry out the work of the church.  They upset many people who believed they were doing the right thing and they hamper many generous efforts.</P>
        <P>Additional wording should be inserted in the Bill so individuals will not be discouraged from becoming voluntary directors of a charity.  The Bill holds directors liable for the failings of a charity in certain instances.  This could have a detrimental effect on the charities sector and, in particular, may discourage one from becoming a voluntary director of a charity.  Directors are liable where there is a withdrawal of previously agreed State funding and on the creation of any new legislation or regulations that would create additional costs for the charity when providing State-funded services.  This seems like a very large burden on the voluntary directors of small charities and acts as a disincentive to those who would otherwise love to become a director of a charity.  The following alternative wording has been suggested:</P>
        <P LI="1">Any default in the relationship/agreement between the charity and the State agency or public body whereby the charity would be at a loss would not be counted as such where the charity has little or no option but to comply with standards or practices set out by the particular body.  In such a case, the individual trustees or directors of the charity cannot be held liable.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This would be fairer and would encourage people to become voluntary directors of a charity and not to be dissuaded due to the liability placed on them if the charity got into difficulty.  This issue needs to be examined more closely by the Minister of State and I would welcome his doing so.</P>
        <P>The point on sport has been already made.  The Charities Bill, as currently drafted, specifically excludes &ldquo;bodies established for and existing for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports&rdquo;.  I imagine the Minister of State will claim this is already covered in separate sports measures that are operating effectively.  This is not so because, under the Finance Act 2002, a very restrictive form of tax relief was introduced in respect of sports organisations.  Tax relief is only available for donations made to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects that have ministerial approval.  An absurdity arises whereby tax relief on donations is available in respect of a sports club that secures ministerial approval or designation in respect of the planned construction of a sports hall but, in that sports club and in respect of that same sports hall, tax relief is not available in respect of donations towards the engagement of a sports coach.</P>
        <P>Sport has a key role in the promotion of health and the prevention of disease.  It is a primary vehicle for active citizenship and volunteerism in the community and it advances community welfare and development.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 states, &ldquo;Participation in sport, whether at the level of competitive sport, recreational sport or active leisure activity can <Col N="453"/>yield physical and psychological well-being as well as fostering social development both in terms of the individual and the community.&rdquo;  The national development plan recognises the role of sport in building stronger communities.  I am sure the Minister of State will claim this is covered elsewhere but I do not believe so.  The example I have outlined is but one example of an area in which we could go further.</P>
        <P>The Bill, while it needs to be improved, is very worthy.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his effort in introducing it.  Let us ensure we perfect it and that it addresses all the loopholes such that the community as a whole can benefit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill has been a long time coming.  Various community groups are watching its progress in the Houses and are awaiting the outcome with bated breath.  Six or seven years ago, when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I was fast to advocate it.  We explored this issue and spent some time not only working through what we should be doing but also examining what was occurring in other countries.  One of the committee&rsquo;s visits was to New Zealand, which had in that year introduced its legislation in this regard and established the role of chief executive or commissioner.  The more we read up on the issue, the more we realised how difficult it was and how many people had problems they wanted addressed.  This is the case in respect of human rights and sports bodies in different countries.  When they were excluded, they sought to be included, and when they were included, they sought to be excluded.  It depends on the regime that is introduced.  Sometimes a regime can tie the organisations in knots administratively.</P>
        <P>I am glad that the Minister of State&rsquo;s legislation demonstrates an attempt to minimise, rather than maximise, the tying up of what are essentially volunteers with administration.  Any body that has already qualified for charitable status will be automatically considered for registration.  This is a very important step.</P>
        <P>One section of the Bill states its provisions will not be commenced automatically when it is signed into law.  Having watched the process in other countries, I realise it takes some time to bed down such legislation and to get it up and running.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that a review will be mandatory in five years to determine what is working well.  This is welcome regarding any legislation but this Bill in particular.  Having explored the issue a few years ago, I understand it is never as clear as it seems to be.  Everybody has his or her own view on it.</P>
        <P>I spoke to the Minister of State previously about sports organisations.  They feel that if they are not included, they will lose out in terms of tax incentives or supports.  The Minister of State responded by saying there will not be an advantage or disadvantage and he will probably return to this matter when concluding.</P>
        <P>Fundamentally, the legislation is desperately needed.  As everyone has said, there is no oversight although &euro;2 billion passes through the relevant organisations.  While I do not want to refer to current controversies, I must state no organisation can operate as successfully when not being watched as it can when being watched.  Sometimes, with regard to some of the very big organisations, money is spent on everything except what one believes it is for.  It is important that this message be circulated.  That one will be able to see in a book or on the Internet how much is being spent on administration and on the cause for which money was donated will allow one to contribute knowledgeably to charities that are spending money on what it should be spent on.  This might seem like common sense but unless one sees the expenditure figures in black and white, one makes assumptions that the money one is donating will really make a difference.  This is not necessarily occurring to the desired level and that is why this legislation is very important.</P><Col N="454"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Having said that makes me sound as if I am bashing the charities.  I do not want to come across as doing so because, as I stated, a phenomenal amount of good work is being done.  That some &euro;2 billion is passing through the system means there are many people who value the voluntary work taking place in many sectors and in every community nationally.  In this regard, one should consider the moneys made available to sports organisations that decided they wanted a new boxing club or pitch for soccer, Gaelic games or rugby.  In speaking on this Bill I commend the trojan work done by a small number of volunteers and I encourage people to get involved in volunteering.  If putting matters on a regulatory compliance framework yields more confidence in the system, more volunteers will be attracted to become involved in this important work.</P>
        <P>On the issue of presumption of public benefit for religious charities, many people focused on a small abuse, namely, that of certain Mass cards.  The last sentence of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech in that context stated that the provision should not affect existing religious charities which will be deemed automatically to be registered.  That is important and it is the usual situation.  One does not want the one or two concerns that do things the wrong way to ruin it for everyone else.  It is important that there be regulations and compliance but we must not have a situation where everyone is penalised for the misdeeds of the few.</P>
        <P>I already alluded to the issue of reconsideration within five years.  I am very pleased that under section 14 the authority has been declared to be an independent body that will have strong regulatory powers.  However, the Minister of State rushed on to say that this was not to be understood as a matter merely of the big stick and that it included being supportive of charities, of public confidence and of the interaction between them.  Transparency speaks for itself because the register will supply that.  I am reminded of the fishing industry where the regulatory authority comes into play and it seems to be all big stick and no carrot.  That is a tremendously important role.</P>
        <P>I thought the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was exceptional in that there were so many such caveats.  He stated he was willing to listen, that he could return and check that everything was going well and, if it were not, that he would deal with it.  That should give great confidence to all 7,000 organisations currently operational.  I wish the Minister of State well with the development of this Bill.</P>
        <P>We have put forward clarifications in respect of sporting bodies.  In some countries these have been clamouring to get in and in others they are clamouring to be kept out of such regulation.  My view is that paper filing should be kept to a minimum and this will then be an important stride forward for the volunteers of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is the first time that we have faced each other in this House but we have dealt with one another in many other situations and I wish him well in the continuation of his Ministry.</P>
        <P>Like everyone else, I welcome this legislation.  Much fine work has been done in the background by the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers.  Many of the matters raised by the different groups I deal with have been touched on by Senator Keaveney and others.  I do not wish to rehearse much of what has been said before but I want to state a few things for the record.</P>
        <P>First, on a general basis, the issue of meeting a charity collector on the street must be considered.  The simple view I have held all along is that when a person is collecting at street level, the requirement must be that we know exactly where our money is going.  Many charities employ people to raise funds and in that situation only a small percentage gets to the objective.  In other words, one hands over a euro and only 25 cent reaches the target charity.  I recognise <Col N="455"/>why this happens.  There are administrative costs and all manner of other difficulties, but there is an easy way of dealing with this matter.  Other groups go out collecting and every penny they get goes straight back into the charity with no one getting commission.  I do not object to commission but I object to not knowing about it.</P>
        <P>An easy way to manage the situation would be to have charity buckets or tickets bearing a figure that would range between zero and 100.  That number would refer to the percentage of contribution that will go to the charity.  The simple requirement is that the charity must indicate this percentage.  This would be confirmed and dealt with each year in the auditor&rsquo;s report.  It is not difficult to implement.  If I were to see someone with 90 written on a bucket I would know that my 90 cent is going to go to the charity, with only ten cent going in commission to the person out there on a cold Saturday collecting or selling tickets.  I know people shy away from such an action.  However, that is the way things are going, especially with audited charities.  Most small charities give 100% and do not keep anything for themselves, for example, a local football club selling tickets.  I ask the Minister of State to bear this in mind and deal with it.</P>
        <P>In light of where we are going as a society and as a community, many arguments have been put forward for organisations promoting equality and social justice to be included in the Bill&rsquo;s terms of reference.  I do not know what the Minister of State&rsquo;s views are on that and where he stands after the Bill has gone through the D&aacute;il.  This is a defining characteristic of our society.  I, Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others raise issues of social justice.  These are fine charities, that is, if they are charities.  Not all organisations promoting social justice are charities and it must be made clear when they are.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</P>
        <P>Another issue concerns defaulting directors.  In the section concerning this it is made quite clear that directors cannot be held responsible when Government policy that previously supported the charity subsequently pulls the rug from under it.  The charity then cannot meet commitments it had given on the basis of previous expectations.  If people act irresponsibly or recklessly, that is a different matter and is covered in other legislation.  I have no difficulty with that.  Where people act genuinely, they should not be held responsible in such a situation.</P>
        <P>I wish to discuss the issue of accountancy.  I declare a conflict of interest here in that I am a member of the board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority and I chaired the audit review group on behalf of the Government some years ago.  I have strong views on how the operation of auditing works and these are disinterested views.  I have missives from the consultancy body of accountancy bodies in Ireland.  I regularly would be on the other side of the table from these people and would differ from them in my views, so I am not merely picking up an issue here and running with it.  I am looking at the concept of how auditors should work.  I believe there are dangers here and I intend to put forward amendments to this.</P>
        <P>The issue of a threshold is probably not a core accountancy issue but it is a political one.  The threshold of a charity&rsquo;s income goes up and down.  It might be left a large sum, for instance.  We should be able to reflect this in the legislation.  That is an easy matter.  However, having an auditor who is also a charity trustee is way off and utterly in conflict.  The work of an auditor must be truly independent.  He or she should not be a charity trustee.  A trustee cannot be the recognised auditor.  In certain situations people may be trustees who, in their day jobs, might happen to be auditors.  I am not talking about such situations but about the person who audits the charity&rsquo;s books as required.  That person cannot be also a trustee of the operation.</P>
        <P>The Committee of Public Accounts, of which the Minister of State has had experience, is the oracle in this regard.  When it dealt with offshore bank accounts in 2000, its report determined that auditors should be untouched by the operation they audited.  The committee, which was chaired by the late Deputy Jim Mitchell and included as members Deputies Pat Rabbitte, Ned O&rsquo;Keeffe and others from Fianna F&aacute;il, was vehement on this issue.  It would not accept <Col N="456"/>even Chinese walls of difference but wanted clear blue water between the operation of the auditor and what was happening on the board.  The requirement was for an independent auditor.  Perhaps the Minister of State has issues in respect of this matter or perhaps he takes a different interpretation.  Having spent considerable time examining the issue of holding hearings in public or private, I concur with the view that they should be held in public.  In the interests of fairness, however, the charities regulatory authority should be given the discretion to allow hearings to be held in private at times.  The Irish Auditing and Supervisory Authority, IASA, conducts investigations on this basis under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003.  This approach should be mirrored in the Bill before us.</P>
        <P>The reason IASA has an option to have private hearings is that an auditor who comes under investigation in a public hearing may as well close up shop.  While this is fine if he or she is ultimately found guilty, as the Minister of State will be aware, these cases proceed in a certain manner.  Once allegations are made, it may take months before the matter is investigated and a conclusion reached.  In the meantime, the reputation of the person subject to the allegation can be shredded.  I raise this issue for reasons of fairness.  I do not take a lily-livered or soft view of accountants and auditors who must be held to the highest possible standards.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I attended a meeting of a subgroup of the IASA board to discuss an issue.  While I am not at liberty to discuss the details, the meeting focused on how we should protect the confidentiality of someone who is being investigated.  It was our view that protecting confidentiality is as important as achieving the correct result.  This contrasts with the view of the media that facts should be placed in the public domain and those involved allowed to argue their case.  The possibility that individuals will be treated unfairly is a genuine one but if I am reading the provision wrong, I stand to be corrected.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State and his officials on introducing this long-awaited and welcome legislation, on which there have been many dry runs.  As the Minister of State will have noted, the issues I raise are minor.  However, it is our role, as legislators, to try to tighten up legislation.  I look forward to debating the Bill with the Minister of State who I am sure will correct me if I have leaned too far to one side.  I hope he will be open to suggestions.  If the Seanad makes a few amendments which necessitate re-introducing the Bill in the other House for a half an hour, it would not be a big deal.  Let us make any changes that are required.  I wish the Minister of State well and look forward to supporting the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well with the Bill.  This is important legislation and I look forward to an excellent debate on Committee Stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct that if it becomes necessary to return the Bill with amendments to the D&aacute;il, it will be the better for it.</P>
        <P>The charities sector needs to be placed on a proper footing.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the different types of people who collect money on the streets.  In the case of those who collect for national organisations it is clear that the majority of the money collected does not go to the charities in question.  On the other hand, in 90% of cases where local organisations such as boy scouts or soccer and GAA clubs collect funds, 100% of the money collected goes to the local club.  It would be foolhardy to attempt to remove the right of such clubs and groups to collect funds.  Another example of significant funds being raised for worthy causes is the Daffodil Day collections.  Many sporting organisations depend on the money they raise on flag days and in the majority of such cases all moneys raised go to the relevant organisations.  The proposed provision should be amended on Committee Stage to improve the legislation.</P>
        <P>On the composition of the charities regulatory authority, I am disappointed that it has been decided to preclude members of local authorities from membership of the board.  Many of the <Col N="457"/>1,500 or 1,600 local authority members were elected on the basis of a reputation they had acquired for working and fund-raising on behalf of charitable organisations.  The main burden for most charitable organisations is raising funds.  It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have acquired vast experience in this area and have been elected to a local authority should be precluded from membership of the board.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this provision prior to Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have played a major role over the years in approving collections by charitable organisations and other bodies.  It is regrettable, therefore, that they are also precluded from membership of the board.  I ask the Minister of State to consider appointing a member of the force to the board.  While this may not have been done previously, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has significant expertise in this area and garda&iacute;  who know the various charitable organisations inside out could bring considerable experience to the charities regulatory authority.  I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill, which is overdue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  While I propose to comment on some of the issues raised, I will reflect on several other matters which were raised for the first time during this debate.  Since my appointment about six months ago, the Charities Bill 2007 has been the only legislation with which I have had to deal.  I do not know if many Ministers of State are landed with the task of dealing with a Bill. </P>
        <P>One of the first steps I took on taking office was to consult the political parties and those involved in the charities sector.  It quickly emerged that the purpose of the legislation was to try to organise the charity sector.  More than 7,000 charities are registered with the Revenue Commissioners and while tax procedures are in place, control and transparency are lacking.  This could undermine the work of charitable organisations as they need to enjoy public confidence.  I recognise that not every aspect of the charities sector will be covered but this is a complex and substantial Bill, which includes a mandatory provision that a review will be undertaken within five years.  Given how long ago earlier legislation underpinning charitable work was enacted, it will be important to have a timely review of the Bill and a clear undertaking has been made in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will respond to some, albeit not all, of the issues raised as I expect some of the points will be debated in detail on Committee Stage.  Senator Quinn, who is no longer present, referred to philanthropy and the Finance Act.  While the issues raised by the Senator are not directly relevant to the Bill before us, they impact on the entire charitable sector and, as such, I will raise them separately with the Minister for Finance.  I will examine in detail the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding accounting, auditing and so forth.</P>
        <P>A number of issues were raised by numerous Senators.  Senator Buttimer, being first to contribute, probably touched on most of them, as did many of the other contributors during the course of the day.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday referred to charity trustees and their personal liability.  I am aware that this has been an issue.  I want to clarify that the Charities Bill does not make charity trustees personally liable for losses accruing to their charity.  The actual legal position is that charity trustees are already personally liable for such losses, whether this is generally known, and I believe that is unfair.  A few weeks ago on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, we introduced section 89, a new section to the Bill, which allows charities to take out insurance to indemnify the trustee from any personal liability in respect of any act done, or omitted to be done, by him or her in good faith.  That is a new indemnity provision, which does not exist at the moment, specifically to address the issue that was raised in the newspaper yesterday.  People might not have noticed this as it was introduced on Report Stage rather than <Col N="458"/>earlier.  However, it was done specifically because we felt the situation was unfair.   It is important to note that.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of whether the Bill would make it mandatory for charities to take out indemnification insurance to protect trustees.  This is an enabling provision so it will be a matter for individual charities and the trustees themselves.  It will not be obligatory.</P>
        <P>Numerous Senators raised the issue of human rights.  This is a matter which had been discussed in both Houses long before I took over responsibility for the Charities Bill.  I am conscious that the definition of &ldquo;charitable purposes&rdquo; in section 38 has been of considerable interest to the sector and to Members of both Houses, particularly as regards human rights.  At the outset, when I was making my introduction, I said that it was important to note that in enshrining these charitable purposes into primary legislation for the first time, the Bill is seeking neither to narrow nor broaden the purposes that have emerged through case law over the years.  That is the setting in which we were trying to frame the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Charitable purposes, in section 3 of the Bill, mirrors those changes that have developed in common law over many years and have been used by Revenue in considering eligibility for tax exemptions.  As I said, the Bill is neither seeking to dilute nor expand these charitable purposes.  While the Bill does not use the expression &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; and it is not expressly mentioned, several of the other purposes of benefit to the community are closely linked to the promotion of human rights.  Senator Alex White, for example, made the point that one of the specifics is the prevention of the relief of suffering in animals.  However, I believe he was slightly unfair to do that.  Had he gone back to an earlier subsection, he would have seen that it related to prevention of human suffering.  While the express term &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; may not be there, many  of the issues are, such as the advancement of conflict resolution and reconciliation, the integration of those who are disadvantaged and the promotion of their full participation in society.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister of State believe that this encompasses human rights? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Before finalising on that, another point is that the organisations in this jurisdiction which are engaged in human rights activities and which are currently registered with Revenue will be deemed to automatically come within the remit of this legislation.  As I said, the Revenue Commissioners do not recognise human rights <i>per se</i>.  It is a question of trying to match terms that are consistent with each other.  However, the principles and effects are clearly identifiable and this is something that will probably come up for greater debate on Committee Stage. </P>
        <P>A number of speakers, in particular Senators Buttimer and Keaveney, raised the issue of the authority being a regulator and support for the sector.  The position being adopted in the Bill is that the authority will have both a regulatory and a supportive role, and that is important.  Senator Keaveney referred to the regulator with the big stick, but it is important that the authority is seen to be a supportive agency.  I do not agree that the roles are mutually incompatible.  Indeed, it is quite common for regulators to perform both roles and that is appropriate.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle said there are no new legal structures for charities.  It has always been the position that the matter of legal structures for charities does not constitute the purpose of this legislation, which is to regulate the charity sector for the first time since the foundation of the State.  The Government wishes to ensure the accountability of the charity sector and to protect against the abuse of charitable status and fraud, and that is the commitment on which the Charities Bill will deliver.</P><Col N="459"/>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in particular referred to the whole issue of holding out.  This came about because of door to door collections, notices coming in, the collection of clothing and so forth, which we have all seen.  Section 46 of the Bill makes it an offence for charitable organisations that are not registered to hold themselves out as charities.  On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il I strengthened the provision, with a particular focus on the door to door collection of second-hand clothes and <i>bric-&agrave;-brac </i> which was a cause of genuine concern.  It was raised time and again.  I have received numerous complaints from the public in relation to those collections.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I made it an offence to cause the public to reasonably believe that an organisation is a charity, irrespective of the terminology it uses in leaflets etc.  This amendment strengthened the provision and greatly limited the scope for non-charitable organisations to suggest to the public that they are charitable in nature.  This will, in turn, help the public to distinguish between genuine charitable organisations and non-charitable bodies.  Prior to the amendment, such bodies would have been outside the regulations had they omitted to use the word &ldquo;charity&rdquo; and so forth.  They now only have to give the impression or behave or act in a manner that the public might reasonably expect of a charitable organisation.  That is aimed primarily at dealing with the door to door collection phenomenon.</P>
        <P>The need for transparency was raised by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others in terms of the spend by charities on administrative and running costs.  Increased transparency is a fundamental principle of the Bill.  It must be recognised that there are administrative costs in running a charity, but the transparency issue is very important.  There may be very valid reasons that one charity&rsquo;s administrative costs are higher than another&rsquo;s.  However, with the register and the availability of accounts, people will make more informed decisions because that information will be more publicly available, and that is significant.</P>
        <P>Numerous Senators referred to sporting bodies and talked about the importance of sport.  I recognise that, and I have been involved with a number of sporting organisations for a long time, which I actively support.  This has been mentioned to me and I have given it some thought.  I want to point out a couple of things.  The Revenue Commissioners operate a separate tax regime for sporting bodies from that applicable to charities and the Bill has been drafted to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  The legislation makes a clear separation between the determination of charitable status by the authority and the determination of tax exemption on funds applied for charitable purposes, which is exclusively the function and responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.  The intention is that there will be a seamless system with no duplication.  The charities regulator decides whether a body is a charitable organisation, but it will solely be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to determine whether any funds applied by such an organisation for a charitable purpose should be granted entitlement to tax exemption.</P>
        <P>In the public consultation process relating to this issue, namely, sporting bodies attracting charitable status, it did not emerge as a matter of concern to any great extent.  Regulation of sporting bodies as charities would impose additional regulation and scrutiny on those organisations.  I do not believe that considering the inclusion of sporting bodies as charities on the principal basis that a particular advantage might accrue under the taxation system is a very sound rationale, particularly when the Revenue Commissioners alone have responsibility for granting tax exemptions, regardless of the decisions of the charities regulatory authority.</P>
        <P>That is the key point.  The argument put forward to have sporting bodies included is specifically that a tax benefit would accrue to such organisations, but that simply would not be the case.  It is important to emphasise that the Revenue Commissioners still maintain their independence in that determination.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of supports for the sector and there is acceptance in Towards 2016 that support will be required for charities to meet their obligations in the new <Col N="460"/>regulatory environment.  Towards 2016 provides that modalities of support will be decided following consultation with the community and voluntary sector after the legislation is approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to what we call &ldquo;chugging&rdquo; and the proliferation of charities collecting together to obtain promises of money.  Collections or promises of money represent a very important source of regular income for charities and allows them to plan their activities in a more strategic way.  Until now they have been outside the scope of the permit system and that was unacceptable.  It is an important issue and will be subject to a legal permit regime for the first time.</P>
        <P>I am also developing, with the sector, non-statutory codes of practice for charity fund-raising which should help to improve collection and ensure the public is not impeded with many collections taking place at the same time.  If non-statutory codes of practice do not work, I have a reserve power under section 94 to introduce statutory regulation.  It is worth mentioning that while we are looking for transparency and control and to have confidence in the charity sector, the counterbalance is not to over-burden and over-regulate charitable organisations, make their work more difficult than it needs to be and take away from their primary function.  If the sector is prepared to implement satisfactory non-statutory codes, I am happy with that, but there is a reserve function.</P>
        <P>Provisions regarding the appointment of the authority were raised by Senators Buttimer, Leyden and Burke.  The provisions in the Bill are standard and were inserted on the basis of legal advice.  There is provision for representation from the sector, specifically persons with knowledge and expertise of law on charities, the keeping of accounts, and the funding and management of charities.  Such representation would be the key to the successful operation of the Bill.  The legislation also provides for an extensive consultative process between the authority and the sector through the various consultative panels.  This should allow the concerns of the sector to be taken fully into consideration.</P>
        <P>The issue of pre-signed mass cards was raised prior to this debate and I am aware that it is a matter of concern to the church and Members of both Houses.  I am taking legal advice on whether it is possible to make provision in the Charities Bill to control the practice of selling pre-signed mass cards in retail outlets.  The previous clause I referred to of holding out would also apply in that if someone was selling a mass card on the false pretence that it was for a charitable purpose, it would be an illegal activity.<b>  </b>I gave a commitment to Deputy Michael Ring that I would examine the issue.  Finding a form of wording that can be effective may be difficult but I am examining the issue, and if Senator Buttimer or others have words of wisdom, I ask them to share them because I want to try to address the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Buttimer and Norris raised the issue of sealed box collections.  The first time this issue was brought to my attention was when I entered the D&aacute;il to take Report Stage and I did not have much of an opportunity to deal with it.  I am aware it is an issue but it only became known to me on that day.</P>
        <P>The existing wording is intended to enhance public confidence but not to hamper the day-to-day operations of genuine charities.  As I said at the outset, the Bill is not intended to change how charities operate or change the sector but to recognise what is happening and assist it by introducing a degree of control.  I am aware many charities collect by selling what I call fixed-price emblems, badges or tokens, and I appreciate that.  My officials are engaging with legal advisers on how we might deal with this, but we do not want to undermine confidence and return to open bucket collections.  It is a question of obtaining an appropriate form of wording.  I am anxious to address this matter because it is what happens with charities in the real world.</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P Just="Left">If Senator Buttimer or &Oacute; Murch&uacute; or any other Senators have specific ideas they wish to share with officials and see how robust they are, I would welcome them at as early a stage as possible because it is a practice that is in place and we are not introducing legislation to make existing practices more difficult.  We must bring transparency, control and public confidence to what we are doing but we must not unduly burden the charities operating now or put their current funding streams in jeopardy.  I will try to address it.  I apologise I did not know about it sooner and if anyone in this House has any ideas, I will glad take them.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that there are bound to be some differences on some of the approaches being taken, I have a positive sense from listening to the speakers today that the regulation of the charities sector in Ireland is broadly welcomed in this House.  The Bill has emerged from an inclusive consultative process and consequently has improved as it progressed to publication and through the various Stages.  I expect to table a number of amendments over the coming weeks and I look forward to working with the Members in this context.  I put that on the record because if we table a number of amendments, the Bill will revisit the other House.  Some people were concerned that there may not be any changes.  I expect there may have to be a number of changes and it is better to be frank about it at this stage.</P>
        <P>I came to this portfolio approximately six months ago.  I put on the record of the House my appreciation of the work undertaken by my immediate predecessors in the Department, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern, who brought this long-awaited Bill to publication, and the Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, who brought the Bill to Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Their genuine commitment and recognition of the vital role charities play in our society and the need, therefore, to protect and value charities has been brought to us today.</P>
        <P>In dealing with this Bill in the House, while not every amendment was agreed unanimously, there was widespread support for the general thrust of the legislation, there was a consensus approach and an openness and willingness to share ideas and work in a co-operative manner.  The words shared in this House were encouraging and I am pleased to see that the Bill will continue.  While we will not agree on every issue, I appreciate that Members of this House are prepared to work in co-operation to advance and improve the Bill as far as possible.</P>
        <P>I mentioned Deputies Ring and Wall, and I want to put on the record that in the absence of Deputy Wall in the Lower House on one occasion, he was ably represented by Deputies Higgins and Lynch.  Whether in the formal setting of the House or in informal consultations with me or officials from the Department, there was a willingness to see this legislation concluded because there is an understanding that it is important.  Another aspect to remember is that there is a mandatory five-year review and during that time, we must ensure we examine how it is working.  It is important and I am anxious to have it concluded, not just speedily but in an efficient and effective manner.  I thank all those who contributed today.</P>

    <Title>Stem-Cell Research (Protection of Human Embryos) Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, for attending the House for this debate.  I am delighted to introduce the Stem-Cell Research (Protection of Human Embryos) Bill to the House.  The context for the introduction of the Bill is a recent unilateral decision taken by UCC to permit the granting of licences to carry out embryo-destructive research on stem cells taken from embryos which have been destroyed, but perhaps not in this jurisdiction.  This decision has been taken in the context of a complete lack of legislation in the area of stem cell research in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a carefully considered and progressive response to the wonderful therapeutic successes from adult stem cell research on an almost weekly basis.  It provides for the maximum possible support for such productive and non-controversial stem cell research through the prohibition of unethical, non-productive embryo stem cell research.  The Bill strives for the best of all worlds &mdash; real treatments applied to real life diseases in the here and now, the highest standards in compassionate and ethical practice and responsible and profitable investment in science.  As a consequence of these achievements, it furthers greater social cohesion.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The core of the Bill is motivated by a profound and consistent respect for human rights.  I have no doubt that every one of my colleagues in the House agrees that one of the most important developments humanity has seen over the past 60 years has been the articulation and affirmation of universal human rights.  We use the language of human rights every time we sit in the House.  What is more, we attempt to speak this language intelligibly, consistently and clearly, lest we weaken its impact.  Hence, we recognise the absurdity of justifying any action resulting from the violation of a whole class of human beings and their rights.  We recognise that all human beings deserve basic human rights.  This is precisely the philosophy which lies at the centre of the Bill, the philosophy of human rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have all heard, usually from non-scientists, that science, supposedly, cannot verify that the human embryo is a human being.  Let us be clear.  &ldquo;Human being&rdquo; is a biological term, and the existence of science is predicated upon its ability to exactly define the objects of its investigation.  When we ask questions of science, it is vital we pose questions to the relevant branch of science.  Embryology is the science of the embryo, not genetics, chemistry or nuclear physics.  Embryology and all textbooks on it are unequivocal in stating that the human embryo, who is always either a he or a she, is an individual, unique and self-developing human being, or perhaps human beings in the case of future twins.  Embryos are human beings with potential, not potential human beings.</P>
        <P>Some journalists, accountants and scientists from areas outside embryology may disagree, but such a disagreement is not founded on the relevant science, but rather on ideology and prior moral assumptions.  History testifies to instances when scientific evidence was repeatedly denied so as to accommodate prevailing world views.  The Bill before the House today reminds us of the horrors resulting from denying the humanity of certain classes of human beings for the supposed betterment of other, less vulnerable classes of human beings.  It reminds us again that what we need are human rights for all human beings.</P>
        <P>However, not everyone here will think this is sufficient reason to turn our backs on research which may result in treatments for debilitating diseases.  I recognise that the hope of health is a very powerful hope.  The question, of course, is where we ought to place our hope because few things are as crushing as hope misplaced.  Let us look to the evidence.  Already, ethically solid adult stem cell research has resulted in 73 treatments for diseases such as Crohn&rsquo;s and cancer.  It has also provided promising research in the area of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, but there is no cure yet.</P><Col N="463"/>
        <P Just="Left">In America alone, adult stem cell research has led to well over 1,200 clinical trials.  On the other hand, research on human embryos, which is ethically controversial, far from leading to a single treatment, has not even led to one clinical trial anywhere in the world, despite hundreds of millions of euro being poured into it over the past decade.  The failures of embryo stem cell research are due not only to its inefficacy, but also to the fact that many of the rats treated by it form tumours due to the totally plastic or totipotent nature of the embryo stem cells.  The irony is that the reason some people think embryo research has potential is also the reason it struggles so badly in the laboratory and is potentially dangerous.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not deny for a moment that there are scientists who wish to conduct embryo-destructive research, if only for comparative purposes.  The point underlying this Bill, however, is that the same potential now is coming from a much more optimistic and life-affirming source, that is, various developments in the field of adult stem cell reprogramming and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even if embryo research could one day fulfil some of its promises, some stunning recent breakthroughs in adult stem cell research may well make the former completely redundant in the future.  In 2007, two separate teams of researchers, one American and the other Japanese, managed to reprogram adult stem cells in order that they behave almost identically to embryo stem cells, thus obviating need for the latter and hence avoiding destructive embryo research.  According to Dr. James Thomson, who pioneered this discovery in America, these induced pluripotent stem cells, IPSCs, with which there is no ethical problem, will make the ethics of embryo research, or the question of their ethics, &ldquo;a funny historical footnote&rdquo;.  Dr. Robert Lanza, another expert in the field, hailed the discovery as &ldquo;a new era for stem cells&rdquo;.  Importantly, the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells did not result from embryo research and, contrary to what Professor McConnell claimed earlier today in a briefing session, IPSC research is not inextricably tied to the continuation of embryo research.  There is an even greater reason for thinking that embryo research will one day be of historical interest only.  Last month, a stem cell team from Harvard found a way to directly reprogram one type of adult stem cell into any other type of adult stem cell, again rendering unnecessary embryo stem cell research in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is another dimension to the context of this Bill.  We live in an uncertain economic climate and funding is at a premium.  Resources are limited and every penny one proposes to spend on embryo-destructive research is a penny less for the adult stem cell research we seek, which hopefully will have the same capacity to lead to cures, albeit cures with which all can live as a society.  There is no neutral position in this regard.  There is a choice to be made and Ireland is a small country with limited resources.  This Bill represents an intelligent and compassionate response to these challenges.  Ireland has neither the funding nor the resources available to become a centre of excellence in both adult and embryo stem cell research and we must choose.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, an article appeared in the <i>Cell Proliferation</i> journal, that criticised proponents of embryo research for making false and exaggerated claims about its potential.  Not only is embryo research unethical, the claims being made on its behalf also are unethical because they propagate false hope to earn government funding.  More money is spent on embryo-destructive research than on adult stem cell research in America.  However, it is no secret that the majority of private funding is invested into where results are to be found, namely, adult stem cells.  It appears that sometimes, even the market does not lie.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the case of Professor Colin McGuckin, a leading Irish-born expert on stem cell research, who recently left Newcastle University with his research team to work in Lyons, France.  He objects that little funding is being given to adult stem cell research, while hundreds of millions of pounds are being wasted on unethical embryo-destructive research.  Moreover, <Col N="464"/>his views are shared.  For example, Professor Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind cloning Dolly the sheep, has completely given up cloning in favour of the new, promising and ethically-acceptable adult stem cell research.</P>
        <P>One also must learn from the British experience.  If one legislates for embryo research, it follows that one eventually must legislate for human cloning and human-animal hybrids.  This much is clear, even from a comparison between the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction report of 2005, which turned its back on animal-human hybrids, and the more radicalised recent Irish Council of Bioethics report, which recommends highly controversial animal-human hybrids in certain circumstances.  The reason is that if one is to conduct embryo-destructive research, it will not be enough to use so-called leftover embryos from <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation, IVF, and one will be obliged to look for other, controversial sources.</P>
        <P>A &ldquo;waste not, want not&rdquo; approach to human life in IVF clinics is utterly contrary to any notion of the ethics of human rights.  I stress this Bill does not touch on reproductive areas.  It aims to seek the support of people who may have no problem with IVF, even as currently practised, although practice in this regard continues to evolve.  This Bill is confined to the issue of research on human embryos.  People who have no problem with IVF or the morning-after pill may well support the principles contained in this Bill because they oppose research on human beings at their earliest stage and using them as a means to an end.</P>
        <P>Some Members may have genuine concerns about where this Bill leaves us in respect of the rest of Europe.  Many other countries in Europe prohibit the destruction of human embryos, although in some cases they hit on an unsatisfactory halfway house in which they allow research on cells taken from human embryos.  This Bill proposes a consistent approach.</P>
        <P>It will no doubt be pointed out that this Bill diverges on some points with recent commissioned reports, namely, the aforementioned Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and Irish Council of Bioethics reports.  My response is it diverges for very good reasons.  Not only are these reports out of date scientifically, they ignore the fact that the majority of submissions they received argued for protecting the human embryo from destructive research.  Moreover, they are progressively more radical in their claims as time goes on.  Although they refer to embryo research as the gold standard, this claim has no meaning in the light of recent optimistic and promising developments in adult stem cell research, which hold out an equal hope of having cures with which all can live.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, I wish to stress the importance of social cohesion.  This Bill should be supported by people who respect the human embryo because of what it is, namely, human life with potential, not potential human life.  The Bill should be supported by those who may or may not believe the embryo constitutes a human life but who do not wish to deny cures.  An alternative ethical route up the mountain now is available.  Although embyro-destructive research has yielded nothing thus far, the hope, backed up by eminent scientists, is that in the future, such yields can come from alternative ethical sources.</P>
        <P>Finally, Members must not forget social cohesion.  They do not seek a future in which society is divided between scientists who will gain employment and those who will not because of their ethical objections or between patients who will accept certain treatments and those who will not, because they have ethical objections.  While Ireland is a small country, it can concentrate its limited resources on the noble area of adult stem cell research, as well as on all the associated exciting new areas, which hold out credible promises for cures with which all can live.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="465"/>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and, together with my colleague, Senator Hanafin, am glad to do so.  I commend Senator Mullen on his work on the Bill, as well as my intern, Dualta Redmond, on his tremendous work while researching it.  It is worth reminding Members that in 1988, the High Court ruled the Offences against the Person Act 1861 protects the unborn from the moment of conception.  However, the High Court judgment of 2007 that an embryo before implantation does not enjoy constitutional protection obviously has implications in this area.  This matter has been appealed to the Supreme Court and Members must await the outcome.  However, neither the courts nor individual judges should decide this matter; it should be the Oireachtas.  This is the reason I welcome the Bill today and I am glad to second it.  Members have the mandate to decide policy and should be involved in it.</P>
        <P>It is a highly complex area from a scientific, moral, ethical and human life point of view.  At the outset, I wish to state that curing debilitating conditions, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and many others, is worthy of serious and well-funded research.  However, embryonic stem cell research is an avenue that should not be pursued.  There is a number of valid reasons for this, including a plethora of scientific research confirming the value of adult stem cell research.</P>
        <P>Members learned last week of the amazing results in Spain, where a 30 year old Colombian lady, who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis with complications and who struggled to breathe, presented herself for treatment.  The surgeons carried out the world&rsquo;s first tissue-engineered whole organ transplant in a pioneering technique using a windpipe made with the patient&rsquo;s own stem cells.  That such amazing breakthroughs using stem cells are beginning to garner publicity makes UCC&rsquo;s recent decision all the more disheartening.</P>
        <P>By the narrowest of margins, the governing body of UCC voted to give the green light for the use of embryonic stem cell research for medical purposes.  I understand the measure was approved on the casting vote of the chairman.  It is unacceptable for UCC to decide unilaterally to forge ahead with embryonic stem cell research.  It is worth noting that the chair of the ethics committee of UCC, who was instrumental in making the recommendation to the governing body, is a member of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction.  She was also appointed by the Government to the ethics committee of the Medical Council.  While I will not comment in this regard, it is essential that people of independent opinions be appointed to such bodies.  If people with predispositions are appointed, the outcomes on which Government policy are based are predetermined and inevitable.  There are similar instances elsewhere, for example, in civil partnership.</P>
        <P>Professor William Reville, head of the biochemistry department in UCC, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Most people do not realise that an alternative stem cell approach to curing disease is now available that is just as promising as the HESCR approach but which poses no ethical problems.  I refer to induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC).  And, of course, adult stem cell research, which is likewise free from ethical problems, is also available and is producing very promising results.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">As has been discussed, the reason embryonic stem cells are the focus of so much attention lies in their ability to differentiate into virtually any cell of the body.  This in turn would allow for the possible regeneration of damaged brain tissue, for example.  However, leading Japanese scientist Dr. Yamanaka of Kyoto University has managed to reprogram normal human skin cells to an embryonic-like form.  These are induced pluripotent stem cells and have the same properties as embryonic stem cells.  Along with the Spanish situation, good research along the same lines is being conducted in Toronto University.</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P>Professor Reville has written a number of articles on and is a strong proponent of this issue.  As he is also a member of my home town, I am familiar with him and know him to be a balanced individual.  When he contacted us regarding this matter, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Although it goes deeply against the grain for me to oppose any research, I must oppose HESC research on ethical grounds.  Biology, the science of life, tells us that human life begins at conception, thereby starting a living continuum that ends only in death.  To deliberately kill the embryo is to violate its human rights.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He continued by stating that, when the ovum meets the sperm, the process of fertilisation is complete and a new life comes into being.  A whole new genome is created and determines gender, height &mdash; subject to normal nutrition &mdash; and colour of skin, eyes and hair.  The Irish Council for Bioethics recognises this position, but inexplicably favours embryonic stem cell research.  It also favoured animal-human hybrid cell lines.  With the exception of Britain, this has been banned in every country that has legislated in this area.</P>
        <P>In an article entitled &ldquo;Life Continuum&rdquo; in <i>UCC News</i>, Professor Reville stated, &ldquo;The whole process is a continuum of human essence between the boundaries of conception and death and is programmed to proceed automatically under normal circumstances.&rdquo;  In addition, he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Each stage along this continuum is fully human, having the full human properties appropriate to its stage &mdash; zygote, foetus, baby, adolescent, adult and older person.  All the genetic information in the human adult is already present in the single-celled zygote.  Each point on this human continuum is dependent on the preceding part of the continuum and determines the succeeding part of the continuum.  Interrupt the continuum at any point and nothing happens beyond that point.  These are biological facts.  Accepting these facts, it seems clear that it is arbitrary, and therefore wrong, to pick any point on this continuum and claim it marks the boundary between the preceding &lsquo;not fully human and not deserving of protection&rsquo; section and the succeeding &lsquo;human enough to deserve protection&rsquo; section.  The same full human essence is present everywhere along the continuum.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He could have gone further.  It is not just a life.  We all started as zygotes and developed because we were not destroyed.  On a pro-life basis, we must oppose the destruction of the embryo because destroying it would not only affect that life, but also the progeny it might produce.  We do not have the right to destroy a genetic lineage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The European Science Foundation&rsquo;s briefing on stem cell research discusses the ethical problems associated with the use of embryonic cells over adult stem cells.  It refers to the use of embryonic stem cells as the &ldquo;instrumentalisation of human embryos&rdquo;, in other words, the reduction of life to a commodity.  Destroying an embryo is to end a person&rsquo;s story after the first sentence.  Arguments in favour are utilitarian, namely, the end justifies the means.  This cannot be an acceptable basis for legislation or scientific advancement.  Biology is the science of life.  Let us keep it that way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>As we debate this Bill, it is fair to state that each Member of this House is now better informed on the issue of stem cell research and the use of adult and embryonic stem cells than we were some time ago.  This is so because the debate has been brought to the floor of the House by Senator Mullen, which is welcome.</P>
        <P>Many countries conduct much research in this area.  Until recently, however, and given UCC&rsquo;s decision in particular, there has not been considerable public awareness of what is occurring.  Ironically, when we heard last week of the stem cell research that led to a young Colombian woman receiving a new windpipe, the general population was given a new aware<Col N="467"/>ness of the research&rsquo;s potential and possible impact on lives.  The woman was donated the windpipe of a deceased person.  Cells were removed from it and replaced by her own to grow and implant an entirely new windpipe.  All of a sudden, the woman&rsquo;s bleak prospects were transformed thanks to the use of adult stem cell research.</P>
        <P>Recently, I read an article on the issue in  <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  It outlined how, five years from now, scientists will be able to grow a larynx from a patient&rsquo;s own stem cells and, within 20 years, it may well be possible to do the same in respect of colons, livers and even hearts.  Furthermore, research is being carried out to grow nerve cells to treat brain diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s.  All of this is occurring using adult stem cells, a welcome development.  The British Medical Council is funding the use of embryonic stem cells to treat macular degeneration, an age-related blindness that affects thousands of people.  Would someone offered this treatment use it if he or she believed it would be a cure?  Ethical questions are involved.</P>
        <P>As Senator Mullen stated, much of the research is still at an early stage.  The European Science Foundation stated that it is essential to proceed with research on stem cells derived from embryos, foetal tissues and adults in parallel to learn more about how they can be used in treatment.  Developments are occurring at a rapid rate and I am sure people will want to avail of these treatments and be able to access them in due course.  Currently, Ireland finds itself in a legal vacuum, which was most recently witnessed when the governors of UCC voted narrowly in favour of effectively using imported embryos for stem cell research.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction raised an interesting question, namely, whether science can be allowed to do what science can do.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There are limits and a need for a legal framework.  The closest that many Irish people come to considering the use of excess embryos is IVF treatment.  Infertility is an increasing problem owing to environmental and physical factors.  It is not well understood.  The commission stated, &ldquo;Infertility can be a devastating experience causing enormous emotional pain which impacts on every aspect of a person&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;  It goes on to state that &ldquo;IVF forces society to face the question, whether for the first time in the history of mankind human embryos may be used for purposes other than human reproduction&rdquo;.  This observation illustrates the close link between some aspects of the legislation before the House and IVF treatment, although Senator Mullen did make the point that he excluded IVF from the Bill.</P>
        <P>I recommend that everyone read the comprehensive report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, especially as it takes a nuanced and interesting approach and engages in an in-depth consideration of research carried out across the globe.  The report indicates that many countries have not yet introduced legislation in respect of this area.  Questions arise as to what happens to spare embryos arising from IVF.  Owing to the fact that there is no legislation in place, we do not know a great deal with regard to what occurs in laboratories or what happens to frozen embryos following a certain period.</P>
        <P>I wish to place on record the most recent legal view from the courts in respect of embryos.  Many Members will recall the recent case where the plaintiff and the defendant were married and where the plaintiff had IVF treatment resulting in the creation of frozen embryos.  The couple subsequently separated and the defendant wanted the embryos destroyed while the plaintiff wanted to have them inserted in her uterus with the hope that she would become pregnant.  In this case, M.R. <i>v.</i> T.R., the High Court decided in 2006 that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; does not include embryos <i>in vitro</i> and, therefore, did not relate to the frozen embryos which were at the heart of this dispute.  The case in question is currently before the Supreme Court.  I refer to it as an example of our understanding, and that of the courts, of the terms relating to this matter.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>Fine Gael is of the view that comprehensive legislation is necessary.  There is a need to establish a wide-ranging statutory framework in the area of stem cell research and the use of embryos.  This issue and the debate relating to it are complex and delicate.  There are deeply held views among many people across the political spectrum in respect of it.  Legislation in this area is, therefore, inevitably complex.  Well-intended legislation may have complex and unintended results.  Such legislation might even have an impact on the Constitution.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that we have a legislative framework which demands that research carried out is informed by our society&rsquo;s values while recognising legitimate scientific enquiry in the human interest and also in the need for appropriate restraint.  The issues under discussion are of fundamental importance.  As the commission stated, in a diverse Irish society it is unlikely that any one set of ethical or moral principles could be acceptable to all.</P>
        <P>I do not have time to outline the detail of what the commission recommended.  However, it put forward detailed proposals on this matter.  The Government has failed to act on any of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a vacuum has been created.  I call on the Government to bring forward legislation in respect of this area.  By introducing the Bill, Senator Mullen has continued the tradition of the Seanad playing an important role in initiating and advancing crucial national debates on issues of immense importance.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a number of points regarding my concerns about the Bill.  I accept that the Bill specifically excludes IVF and I fully accept the bona fides of Senator Mullen in this regard.  Nevertheless, I was in contact earlier today with a scientist who disputes this fact.  There are incompatibilities between section 1(<i>a</i>) and section 1(<i>b</i>)(i) in respect of this matter.  I am concerned by the implications of the term &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo;, which is used on two occasions in the Bill.  Does this term mean that an Irish person could not access treatment abroad?</P>
        <P>Section 6 refers to the &ldquo;responsible body&rdquo;.  What constitutes a responsible body and to whom does the term &ldquo;offence&rdquo; apply?  Fine Gael is concerned about some of the provisions that seek to criminalise people who may make donations of embryos.  The position in the Bill in this regard is somewhat unclear.  In Britain, the Warnock report stated that research on embryos could only be allowed up to 14 days.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Mullen on raising this issue and ensuring the Seanad once again leads the way on a major issue and embarks on a vital process wherein legislation must catch up with rapidly developing science.  I have posed questions and made observations and comments.  I hope these will contribute to the debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond, on behalf of the Government, to this Private Members&rsquo; Bill sponsored by Senator Mullen.  Stem cell research represents one of the most important and challenging areas of investigation that scientists and clinicians will undertake in the 21st century.  Much of the work with stem cells raises no ethical issues or concerns.  For example, bone marrow transplants have been available for some time.  The use of stem cells has the potential for a significant impact on human health in the repair of damaged tissues and in tackling some of the most intractable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions.</P>
        <P>The hallmark of stem cells is their ability to develop into many other cell types and this fundamental property needs continued research and investigation if it is to be harnessed to greatest effect.  Adult stem cells can be obtained from many parts of the body, including bone marrow, brain, blood, skin, eye, muscle, liver and hair.  However, they are somewhat restricted in the number of cell types into which they can develop.  On the other hand, embryonic stem <Col N="469"/>cells are able to develop into almost all the different types of cells needed to form the human body.  The removal of these cells from the embryo would, however, result in its destruction.</P>
        <P>Adult stem cell research can be broadly categorised in three fundamental avenues, namely, identifying new populations and sources of stem cells, understanding the fundamental properties of stem cells and developing new modes of therapy using stem cells.  In Ireland, scientists are engaged, to a greater or lesser extent, in each of these areas and are using adult-derived stem cells.</P>
        <P>A major new challenge for stem cell research will be to identify sources, or ways of generating such cells.  Perhaps the most exciting of these is the ability to endow stem cell-like qualities on cells that do not otherwise share the ability to differentiate into new cell types.  While these cells &mdash; induced pluripotent stem cells, IPSCs &mdash; offer a great deal of hope, much research is needed before they will be routinely used in any clinical setting.  IPSCs are made by genetically reprogramming ordinary adult cells and thereby transforming them into stem cells.  They are claimed to be equivalent to embryonic stem cells in every respect tested.  This area of stem cell research is still relatively new and has yet to be employed to any great extent in Ireland.  However, it is hoped that this technology will offer great benefits to the basic research undertaken by scientists and clinicians in the coming years.  Even with the evident promise of IPSCs, there is a need for continued adult stem cell research because it will only be through their being subjected to meticulous scientific study that we will gain a better understanding of how they develop and what controls their differentiation, thereby gaining a meaningful insight into how their potential to transform to new cell types might be best harnessed.</P>
        <P>Only last week the potency of adult stem cell research was communicated worldwide through the case of Claudia Castillo, a 30 year old Colombian mother of two living in Spain.  Ms Castillo received the world&rsquo;s first airway transplant using an organ partly grown from stem cells taken from her bone marrow.  In this ground-breaking operation, surgeons replaced a section of Ms Castillo&rsquo;s windpipe, which had been damaged by tuberculosis, with a donated organ that was stripped of its cells and used as a scaffold for her own stem cells.  Owing to the fact that her immune system recognised her own cells in the replacement organ, she has not faced organ rejection nor has she been obliged to take powerful drugs to suppress her immune system.  This technique gives great hope to many patients whose organs are damaged.</P>
        <P>Embryonic stem cell research is a sensitive subject and it evokes different views from particular sectors of society.  The main source of human embryonic stem cells for research is from embryos produced, but not used, during <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, IVF, treatment.  As noted by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, the surplus embryos not used for immediate transfer may be preserved in a frozen state for further use by the couple that produced them, thereby avoiding the necessity of repeating the risky and uncomfortable procedure of ovarian stimulation.  If frozen embryos still remain after the couple has completed treatment, the available options include donation to another couple, donation for research, the embryos being allowed to perish or continued storage.</P>
        <P>There are many who are opposed to human embryonic stem cell research on ethical grounds and who see an outright ban on this type of research as the appropriate approach but there are also those who pin their hopes on this research activity finding new treatments for some of the most serious and distressing diseases afflicting society at large.  A significant body of researchers argue that embryonic stem cells offer the best possibility of generating the knowledge that will lead to new treatments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Human embryonic stem cell research is considered to hold significant promise in treating diseases for which there is currently no cure, namely, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, motor neuron disease and spinal cord injuries which cause paraplegia and other disabilities.  However, other researchers <Col N="470"/>argue strongly that the sourcing of such stem cells and the resulting destruction of human embryos can never be justified and is unethical.  These researchers point to work on adult stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, which do not give rise to ethical concerns, as the most appropriate approach to follow.  The view is also held that research on human embryonic stem cells and human adult stem cells is complementary and that comparison between the two is an essential element for advancing basic research.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Currently, there is no legislation in Ireland governing intervention in the natural process of creating human life.  Medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council, which provide that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of <i>in vitro</i> human life already formed is professional misconduct.</P>
        <P>The development and use of technologies in this area, such as embryonic stem cell research, raises an array of legal, social and ethical questions that are complex and profound.  It is an area that triggers diverse reactions in the public, some of which include unease and anxiety.  A number of the issues involved in the broad field of assisted human reproduction treatment, science and human embryonic stem cell research go to the core of our concepts of human dignity and personhood.  There was growing public concern at these developments and in view of their complex and potentially controversial nature, the then Minister for Health and Children decided that the establishment of a Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction would be an essential first step before any policy proposals were propounded.  Its terms of reference included to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The Commission largely comprised persons with expert knowledge spanning the medical, scientific, social and legal domains.  This expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned.  The chair also invited a number of additional experts with complementary expertise in specific areas to join work groups.  These groups were established to explore particular aspects of assisted human reproduction and included experts and academics from sociology, philosophy, ecumenism and theology.</P>
        <P>The commission conducted an intensive and analytical examination of relevant issues and its conclusions derive from this wide research.  Its report was prepared after 23 meetings.  The early meetings were devoted to an exchange of information between the commission members.  Each discipline, medical, scientific, legal and social, prepared a report outlining the current position on assisted human reproduction in that discipline.  In its letter of establishment, it was indicated that the commission would be expected to consult widely, to seek submissions from the public and to establish the views of service providers and consumers.</P>
        <P>The commission was also expected to consult philosophical and theological experts and relevant people in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  In delivering on this aspect of its remit, the commission consulted users of services in a survey organised through the National Infertility Support and Information Group; placed an advertisement in the national press inviting members of the public and interested organisations to make submissions, to which it received 1,700 responses; recruited a market research organisation to carry out a survey of a random sample of 1,003 people aged over 15 years; conducted a survey of the services provided by 1,163 general practitioners for infertile couples; conducted a survey  of 114 obstetricians-gynaecologists in maternity hospitals-units; conducted a survey of the then eight clinics providing assisted human reproduction services in Ireland and contacted the chief executive officers of the health boards to ascertain their involvement in the provision of services.</P><Col N="471"/>
        <P>The commission held two conferences, the first being a small conference of invited experts and the second a public conference of more than 250 people.  Its report, published in May 2005, which was the first step in determining a policy response to assisted human reproduction, made 40 recommendations on services in Ireland.  The key recommendation was that a regulatory body to regulate services in Ireland should be established by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The commission stated that the legislation should specify the procedures to be allowed and provide for the establishment of an independent statutory body, accountable to the Minister for Health and Children, that would have regulatory, advisory and executive powers over the permitted services and activities.  This body would license facilities engaged in these services and activities.  In addition, it should be empowered to issue guidelines on the operation of the permitted services, including, as appropriate, the freezing, storage and uses of gametes and embryos and the fertilisation of ova.</P>
        <P>A licensing and inspection model for assisted human reproduction services and activities, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, would seem to provide a robust system of oversight, monitoring and control over the activities that are now scientifically possible within this domain, including the area of human embryonic stem cell research.  Such a statutory licensing procedure, supported by an inspection regime governing centres, would achieve, with others, this main overarching objective of statutory oversight.  Ultimately, it would ensure that no service or activity for which a licence is statutorily required is undertaken in the absence of approval of the designated statutory authority.</P>
        <P>The other main recommendations of the commission, which may be largely grouped under five general headings, are access to services; donor programmes and procedures; surrogacy; procedures relating to human gametes; and possible approaches to issues surrounding the human embryo.  In the area of embryo research the commission recommended, by majority opinion, that embryo research, including embryonic stem cell research, for specific purposes only and under stringently controlled conditions, should be permitted on surplus embryos that are donated specifically for research.  This should be permitted up to 14 days following fertilisation.  The regulatory body should stipulate under what conditions and for what purposes embryo research is permitted.  Those donating embryos for research must receive pre-donation information and counselling and must give informed consent for the use of donated embryos for research.  No inducement, financial or otherwise, should be offered or accepted for the donation of embryos for research.  Once embryos are used for research their subsequent use for reproductive purposes should be prohibited.  The commission recommended that the generation of embryos through IVF specifically for research purposes should be prohibited.  Again, by majority opinion, the commission recommended that regenerative medicine should be permitted under regulation.</P>
        <P>The commission recommended unanimously that human reproductive cloning and the generation and use of inter-species human embryos should be prohibited, but that research on gametes should be permitted provided it is governed by strict conditions set out by the regulatory body and subject to informed consent from donors.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Government referred the commission&rsquo;s report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for consideration.  The committee will report in due course on its views of the recommendations of the commission.  Given the amount of work required, the Minister for Health and Children instructed the Department to begin work on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.  Factors that will be taken into account include the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, when completed, with any judgment of the Supreme Court in the M. R. <i>v.</i>  T. R. &mdash; frozen embryos &mdash; case.  That case is on appeal to the Supreme Court and a hearing is expected in the near future.  On that basis, the Government has not, to date, proposed legislation in this area but the Department of Health and <Col N="472"/>Children has engaged in the complex preliminary work.  The work that the Government is undertaking is intended to result in policy proposals for a legal framework for this area.  This work involves exploring and examining areas such as legal parentage, practices on gametes and <i>in vitro </i>embryos &mdash; including embryonic stem cell research, arrangements for consent, and many other areas that are impacted by this wide and complex area.  It is not an understatement to say that this area involves consideration of a range of ethical, legal, medical, social and scientific questions and issues that are divisive.</P>
        <P>The work under way has a significant international dimension.  The Department of Health and Children, as part of the complex preparatory work, has been examining the regulatory regimes introduced by other countries and how they went about devising their laws.  This work involves a detailed review of legislation and other relevant legal instruments by which assisted human reproduction treatment and research is regulated in other countries.  This is important as it gives an understanding of how legislation works in this area.  The preparation for legislation on assisted human reproduction and human embryonic stem cell research involves setting out the full range of issues and identifying all of the interrelationships between these, including all of those mentioned in the Senator&rsquo;s Bill.  Once completed, this body of work will form a platform from which a legal framework to govern the area will be derived.  The Government looks forward to seeing this work completed expeditiously so that a comprehensive and robust legal framework for regulating the area can be created.</P>
        <P>More recent scientific developments will also need to be taken into account.  As mentioned earlier, induced pluripotent stem cells, IPSCs, have become available and are described as producing very promising results.  This development postdates the report of the commission and is a very significant development, providing, as it does, another route to research on human stem cells without any negative ethical problems attaching to them.</P>
        <P>The Government is embarked on a responsible and considered path to regulation in this area which requires that it receive the views of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Supreme Court decision in the M.R. <i>v</i>. T.R. appeal to inform the regulatory framework to be introduced.</P>
        <P>I look forward to hearing the remainder of the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Bill addresses a complex and evolving area of medicine that can have great benefits for humankind.  However, stem-cell research also raises moral questions, as has been evidenced by the contributors to the debate thus far.  The Bill seeks to address these questions from a particular religious standpoint.  While it is perfectly legitimate for this approach to be taken, those of us who would take a moral view must be responsible about bringing to bear our personal beliefs in society at large.  We must be conscious and respectful of the other side of the argument &mdash; as Senator Mullen is on record as saying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are medical, financial and legal issues which must be considered.  For instance, the Bill takes a clear legal position on the status of the embryo at a time when a Supreme Court ruling is due on this matter.  Some scientists regard embryonic stem-cell research to be a moral obligation because their work can have genuine therapeutic benefits for people suffering from appalling ailments.  The Bill does not oppose adult stem-cell research and Senator Mullen has argued that this work has great potential and his position generally has support from some scientists, as has been evidenced in e-mails I have received in recent days.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, other scientists say restricting the research to adult stem cells could limit the potential of this field of bioengineering.  We have the typical stance of opposing views on what is a very delicate subject.  We must be particularly careful not to overstep our mark.  It is not the role of the Legislature to make decisions on what medical research will and will not work.  On <Col N="473"/>the other hand, it is within our mandate to take moral positions about what happens within our borders.  The choice we make concerning this complex development in medicine is one we must make carefully.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>While we may disagree on the detail, there is one fact we all share, which is we were all embryos at one stage.  With that in mind I am conscious that life did not start in the reproductive process with the embryo, but human life did.  That is what makes the embryo something that of its own right has dignity.  It must have respect or we would cross a Rubicon over which we could never go back.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the time since the 1960s when stem cells were first recognised to today in November 2008, more than 70 diseases have been successfully treated using adult stem cells.  There is not one single successful clinical treatment arising from embryonic stem cells.  The reason is very clear and quite simple.  If we look at the embryo, we see a living embryo which grows and multiplies at a very fast rate.  That in itself precludes it from being used for any treatments.  In the attempts to prevent this growth and multiplication there have been cancerous cells growing which is why with all the money that has been wasted scientists have been consistently unable to achieve success.  For that reason I am happy to be associated with seconding the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to share the last minute of my time, by leave of the House, with Senator Callanan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Normally that would be announced at the outset.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That embryo-destructive research is wrong in principle because it attacks the life of a human being at the earliest stage of his or her development is also backed up by the absolute inability of embryonic stem cells to have any successful clinical application.  It is saddening to think of how much money, like the alchemists of the Dark Ages, has been wasted when so much could have been achieved for the public by placing these funds into adult stem cell research.</P>
        <P>Recently under the heading &ldquo;How they can rebuild you&rdquo;, a report in <i>The Sunday Times</i> described how scientists and doctors in Britain and Spain set about creating the first tissue-engineered trachea or windpipe, using a patient&rsquo;s own stem cells.  These are the &ldquo;worker&rdquo; cells that replenish and rebuild the body&rsquo;s organs.  This new stage of research and treatment builds on well-established techniques used for decades, like stem cell transplants in cancer patients to replace cells in their own bone marrow lost as a result of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  While these are stem cell breakthroughs, they use adult stem cells.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have heard and read about the words &ldquo;hope&rdquo;, &ldquo;potential&rdquo; and &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; about embryonic stem cell research and yet there is nothing.  After all the billions that have been spent unsuccessfully it must be questionable whether it is fair to be offering hope to people when the reality is that all the success has come from adult stem cell research.  The scientists doing the research that is bearing such astonishing fruit and grabbing the headlines in the news are all doing adult stem cell research.  We need to invite in more of these scientists who are doing adult stem cell research.  We need to make Ireland a grant rich environment for them.  If we build the research centres they will come.  Ireland could become as much a byword in adult stem cell research as it is in software development.</P>
      
        <P Just="Left">In Cologne there is a group called XCell, about which I spoke in the last term.  Nothing has changed in the years that have passed since we discussed stem cell research except that more positive results have come from adult stem cell research.  I note XCell is treating people with diabetes mellitus type 1, those who have suffered a stroke, those with spinal cord injuries and those with multiple sclerosis with stem cells taken from adult tissue.  It is also treating people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and people with cerebral palsy.  What right has it to tell people there <Col N="474"/>is hope when, after 48 years, including 27 years of medical attempts, there has been no success in that regard.  All the success is coming from adult stem cell research.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen&rsquo;s Bill would help, not hinder, in making Ireland an attractive destination for such scientists.  There is an opportunity for Ireland &mdash; one we should not ignore in these economically difficult times &mdash; to coax some of the leading scientists in the field of adult stem cell research to come here.  We can attract them here if we seize the moment and send out the message that we are putting resources into adult stem cell research.  I am conscious there is a proposal that the Government invest money, as is the case in the UK, America and many other emerging first world countries, in rebooting the economy.  This would present a wonderful opportunity for us to have ethical research into an attractive area that is bearing results.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the professor of regenerative medicine at Newcastle University, Colin McGuckin, has decided to leave the UK and relocate to the University of Lyons at the start of next year with his team of ten research personnel, all experts in adult stem cell research.  The reason he is leaving Britain is that the university and the UK funding agencies are investing money first in embryonic stem cell research despite, as he said, the clinical benefits offered by adult stem cell research.  Adult stem cell research is already delivering the goods.  Research using stem cells got by disassembling human embryos is not producing new cures or new treatments.</P>
        <P>The situation has not changed from the last term.  First, it is ethically wrong to use an embryo which must be destroyed to get the embryonic stem cells.  Second, there are no results from such research.  Nothing positive has emerged.  All the results are emerging from adult stem cell research.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Hanafin for sharing one minute of his time with me.  I will say all I want to in that time.  I came here specifically to speak on this substantial Bill and I compliment the three Senators who put their names to it.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I hope the outcome of this debate will be of benefit to the Minister of State, Deputy Devins.</P>
        <P>I put on the record that I fully support this Bill without question or equivocation.  I endorse what was said by the three Senators to whom I referred and the other Senators who spoke clearly and fairly on this Bill.  Specifically, coming from this side of the debate, I support in full what was said by Senators Mullen, Walsh and Hanafin.</P>
        <P>I also want to put something else on the record.  Perhaps I should not say this, but I have been the beneficiary of substantial medication during the past few years.  I have been a recipient and a beneficiary of medication, but I would not wish my life to be extended by one second by the deliberate taking of another life.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I wish to set some context for this debate.  Embryonic stem cell research is a relatively new area of research.  It is within the last two decades that scientists have begun seriously to carry out research on embryonic stem cell lines.  Contrary to some of what we have been hearing, the weight of medical and scientific opinion internationally is in favour of allowing this research to continue, albeit subject to strict conditions and regulations.  I believe we are all agreed on the need for regulations.  </P><Col N="475"/>
        <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for setting out clearly the findings of the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction in 2005.  It is also worth noting that in 2008 the Irish Council for Bioethics made similar recommendations about the need for a robust legal framework within which embryonic stem cell research would be permitted.  That is important.  I would welcome regulations.</P>
        <P>The reason for these recommendations and that scientists internationally are agreed on the potential of this research is that embryonic stem cell research offers immense potential &mdash; it is only potential at this early stage &mdash; for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in particular, such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  With an ageing population in Ireland, we face an epidemic of these disorders in the future.  At present, approximately 7,000 people in Ireland have Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  We should not turn our backs on even a prospect of developing treatment for such disorders by ruling out altogether such developments by putting a blanket ban on embryonic stem cell research.  The drugs, on the development of which we have spent enormous resources, do not work, but embryonic stem cell research offers exciting potential.</P>
        <P>Much has been said about adult stem cell research.  I believe we are all agreed on the immensely exciting potential of such research for treating different disorders.  We have already seen the treatment of blood disorders and leukaemia.  That is very exciting, but the weight of medical and scientific opinion states that embryonic stem cell research offers a different and greater potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in particular.</P>
        <P>The effect of this Bill would be to provide for an absolute prohibition on all forms of embryonic stem cell research.  Where persons wished to donate embryos that they would never see develop into human beings, even for research abroad, that would become a criminal offence under this Bill.</P>
        <P>I could not support and would have to oppose such an absolutist Bill and, on reflection, I believe most of us would agree that it is wrong to close a door absolutely.  Instead, we should look at the regulations that have been provided for elsewhere.  As the commission recommended, for example, it is not permitted to generate embryos specifically for research but rather only to use embryos that would not in any case develop into human beings.  Currently in Ireland, as Senator Fitzgerald stated, embryos are being left frozen in liquid nitrogen indefinitely.  Regulations would have to provide for fully informed consent of the parents of the embryos and that only embryos up to 14 days development could be used for research, as is the case in Britain.</P>
        <P>The danger with this Bill is that it holds out no prospect of regulation of that sort.  It simply bans this research.  It includes the rather emotive term &ldquo;destruction&rdquo;.  It has implications for other developments in the future such as early detection of genetic diseases in embryos and so on.  It would also send out a clear message that Ireland is not open to scientific research.  There has been talk of academics leaving other countries to come to Ireland.  I believe we would see academics leaving Ireland to conduct research they see as offering exciting potential to do good in other countries with less restrictive regimes.  It would send out a dangerous message and it is important that the chief science adviser, Science Foundation Ireland, and others would be involved in any development of a regulatory framework.  This absolutist position would not be helpful.</P>
        <P>Many speakers referred to the meaning of human life and asked when does human life begin.  All of us have different views on that and we must be respectful of each other&rsquo;s views, but whatever views we take, none of us can prove scientifically when human life begins, when an embryo becomes a human being.</P>

I want to refer to a letter from a senior neuroscientist in Trinity College who made that comparison directly and who pointed out that all those patients &mdash; patients are not mentioned in this Bill &mdash; deserve as much help as possible from society and it would be far more morally wrong to close a door on developing research that might have potential.  We must act with compassion, care and caution on this issue and not in an absolutist way simply to prohibit outright all forms of embryonic stem cell research.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the clear and balanced position adopted by the Government in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  I was very heartened by it.  I do not support the Bill.  I do not believe a fertilised embryo is a full human being.  I never have believed that and I never will.  It reminds me of the abortion debate in which I do not think the men in this House distinguished themselves by valuing their spouses at the same level as a microscopic cluster of cells.  I do not deride that but that is the equation.  I would not want to be married to a person who had that view.</P>
        <P>The argument has certain characteristics.  There is a template here that I have observed with concern in recent times.  There is the invocation of compassion, the adoption of the language of human rights and the colonisation of language such as &ldquo;embryo-destructive&rdquo;.  A lot of embryos get destroyed.  They get destroyed by nature.  That happens frequently.  What about that?  Is that an accident?  Is God not in control in those circumstances?  The view comes from the theological perspective of the dominant religion in this country.  That needs to be taken into account.  It is not just Christian, it is denominational and it places a particular view on those matters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Then there is the scare tactic that a lot of money will be wasted and there is the possibility of cancer.  It is said that the money is being wasted because the results have been produced by adult stem cell research alone.  That is not true.  That is <i>Reader&rsquo;s Digest </i>science combined with rhetoric.  The recent wonderfully positive experiments in Spain that had success with a woman was as a result of the interdependence of research on adult and embryonic stem cells.  The discovery of the first IPS cells came out of systematically testing 400 genes in embryonic stem cells until they found the four genes that appeared to be necessary and sufficient to induce pluripotency in adult stem cells.</P>
        <P>Senator Callanan said he received medical treatment because he has a condition.  So have I, but I am not going to go on about it.  I would never say to anybody else that he or she should do something.  I have a number of letters, some of them very nasty and others which impugn the ethical position of scientists.  That is wrong and it is destructive.  I also have a letter from the mother of a quadriplegic, a woman who is paralysed for life.  She does not take the same view as Senator Callanan and she is just as entitled to her view as anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and the opportunity to discuss this Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  I congratulate Senator Mullen on bringing it for<Col N="477"/>ward.  There is a need for comprehensive debate on stem cell research, especially the merits of embryonic stem cell research versus adult stem cell research.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of debate, there has also been a lack of regulation in this area, which compares poorly to the United Kingdom where embryonic stem cell research has been legal since 2004.  The research there is regulated extremely carefully under specific legislation and statutory regulation by an Act of the Westminster Parliament and is controlled tightly by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, by comparison, while research on adult stem cells is legal and some of the research has been publicly funded, the legal position regarding embryonic stem cell research is not clear.  We do not have legislation to deal with, for example, embryos left over after IVF treatment.  The Medical Council produced guidelines in 2004 that forbid the &ldquo;deliberate destruction of embryos in addition to the creation of embryos specifically for use in research, therapeutic cloning.&rdquo;  However, those guidelines do not apply to scientists.  The importation of embryonic stem cell lines created in other countries is not illegal in Ireland.  We have a vacuum and, as legislators, we must respond to that.  The start of the process is to have a comprehensive debate and this Private Members&rsquo; Bill will facilitate that.</P>
        <P>Stem cell research is an important area of research because stem cells are immature cells that have the potential to develop into any one of the 216 different cell types that make up the human body.  In effect, they are a repair kit for the body and they are found in humans at all stages of life, from embryonic through to adulthood as well as in umbilical cords and placentas.  Great strides have been made in this area.</P>
        <P>Other speakers referred to the great day for medical science when there was a successful replacement of a damaged windpipe with a donor organ treated with adult stem cells.  That line of scientific research shows immense potential for development in the fight against disease and in preventing the rejection of organ transplants.  There are great hopes for its use, in particular with patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</P>
        <P>The issue that is particularly relevant to us as legislators is the use of public funding, namely, taxpayers&rsquo; money, for stem cell research.  Irish scientists and researchers deserve to be given the maximum financial and other support to play a leading role in this field.  However, ethical issues intrude on any funding policy and they are ones which we as legislators must take seriously.  The protection offered to the life of the unborn in the Constitution makes clear that Irish people have a deep sense of the value of human life and a particular understanding of when human life begins.  Others may have different views but the matter will have to be clearly defined when it comes to embryonic stem cell research.  For some, what they would see as the destruction of embryos would be completely unacceptable ethically.</P>
        <P>We heard a geneticist speaking at a briefing session today for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who said that as far as he was concerned he does not regard an embryo in the first 14 days of its existence as early human life.  It is only after that that he believes the cells develop the properties he would consider as the early stages of human life.  As legislators, we have serious questions to debate and on which to seek greater clarity so the public can be informed also.</P>
        <P>I do not speak on behalf of the Green Party <i>per se</i> because our party has had difficulties in the past with arriving at a party policy position on abortion.  We deal with such issues by permitting them to be a matter of individual conscience.  I could not enunciate a position on behalf of the party on embryonic stem cell research because one would find the same divisions among the party membership as one would find among the public.</P>
        <P>Adult stem cell research provides much potential.  The advantage of it is that it is uncontroversial.  Adult stem cell research does not involve the destruction of embryos.  Adult stem cells <Col N="478"/>can be developed from umbilical cord blood and placenta, which are rich in adult stem cell potential.  Cord blood banking has already been used to treat more than 80 known diseases and it appears to hold great promise for treating additional diseases and disorders.  Cord blood stem cells are used primarily for hematopoietic, or blood forming reconstitution, for diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma.  Because every cell in the human body has the same genetic information and approximately 200 programmes for using the genetic information, it is clear that it should be possible to make a stem cell from any cell in the body.  As other speakers indicated, scientists have already figured out how to do that from skin cells and induced pluri-potent stem, IPS, cells.  The advantage of such stem cells is that they can be made from any human being and thus have the potential to allow a human being to regenerate his or her own tissue.  That is the best possible scenario given that our immune system rejects almost all cells and tissues from other humans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From research carried out it appears that it is possible to reprogramme skin cells to become induced pluripotent stem cells, a state which is virtually identical to that of embryonic stem cells.  There are some disadvantages attached &mdash; as there is a limited quantity of such cells, they can sometimes be difficult to obtain in large numbers and they may be more difficult to reprogramme to form other tissue types.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Senator Mullen has introduced this Bill and stimulated this debate.  I hope we will carry it to a further stage and, in the process, clarify many of the ethical issues that arise for the Irish public.</P>

	<P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I thank Senators Mullen and Bacik for arranging information briefings for Senators.  These very much helped us to understand the scientific aspects of the issue.  Information and education on this complex issue will help Members of every opinion in trying to understand it and make constructive contributions on the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am not a scientist and do not pretend to be an expert in this area but I  have genuine concerns about unregulated research on human embryos.  I am conscious also that this is an emotive and very sensitive issue and that it has the potential to be very divisive.  This issue raises serious ethical and moral questions for us all.</P>
        <P>The decision taken by University College Cork over a month ago to proceed with embryonic stem cell research, albeit under specific conditions and according to specific criteria, has put this issue on the agenda.  I am concerned that colleges and academics are setting the agenda and protocol on this important matter.  I respect the views of others and believe our colleges and research facilities must have academic freedom to progress science for the benefit of the human race, but that should not take place at any cost and without considering the implications of scientific decisions for society.  This is where the Houses of the Oireachtas have a role.</P>
        <P>There is a legal vacuum in Ireland regarding stem cell research.  There is genuine concern that there is nothing to prevent individuals or institutions from carrying out unrestricted research in this area.  There are concerns that such research could lead to human cloning and animal-human hybrid generation, which would be unacceptable in Irish society.  Such cloning is already scientifically possible and thus requires regulation.  We need to understand whether this Bill addresses these issues in a comprehensive manner or whether there is a need for further examination of this entire area and further comprehensive legislation and regulations.</P><Col N="479"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>Stem cell research has very obvious potential and gives hope to those who suffer from serious permanent injuries and degenerative diseases.  However, the research is very much in its infancy and we must be very careful not to raise false hopes among those who are suffering.  That, in itself, would be unethical.  People need to know the truth regarding scientific progress in this area of research and must be fully informed, in an objective and realistic manner, of any medical breakthrough and the realistic timeframe for progress in respect of their individual conditions.</P>
        <P>The serious ethical and moral questions need to be teased out fully.  The answers thereto will fundamentally dictate our responses to this issue and this Bill.  While the fundamental questions remain unanswered in science and in Irish legislation, we must ask why our colleges are engaging in stem cell research without any legislation or guidance.  Many believe that because an embryo genetically programmed with the unique DNA characteristics of a human being has special momentum to develop into a full person, it should therefore be afforded protection.  We must ask whether we need to become involved in embryonic research when there is considerable progress and potential in the area of adult stem cell research, which does not represent any threat to embryos and to life.</P>
        <P>Adult stem cell research does not pose the same ethical or moral dilemmas as embryonic stem cell research.  It is scientifically much more advanced than embryonic stem cell research and it is therefore a much more appropriate area to develop.  Research in this area should be allowed to achieve its full potential.  This approach must continue to be resourced and receive financial support.  I thank Senator Mullen for raising this important issue and I look forward to hearing the contributions of other Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill as a first step in thinking about this important issue.  There are many good provisions therein.  The human embryo has the potential to become a person or persons.  The Bill proposes the banning of the creation of human embryos for research that could lead to cloning or human-animal hybrids and the donation of human embryos for these purposes.  It rules out the deliberate creation of human embryos for the purpose of research.  It states adult stem cells and pluripotent cells are subject to more advanced research in terms of finding cures for some debilitating diseases.  That is debatable.</P>
        <P>The Bill poses some very important ethical questions.  I define ethics as the intention not to do harm but to do good.  The Bill contains a range of sections detailing criminal offences and we need to proceed with care in this area.  Let me highlight in particular the issue of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, IVF.  Approximately 10% of the Irish population is challenged with infertility.  Many of the affected families have been assisted through IVF or human-assisted reproduction to have a baby.  Many have undergone IVF with no success.  In the IVF procedure, the sperm and egg are fertilised outside the womb in a laboratory setting.  Embryos created in this way do not live for more than five days outside the womb, which is important to note.  Currently in Ireland, we replace up to two embryos and, in some cases, three.  Surplus embryos created in the laboratory can be frozen or, if the couple does not desire this, they are allowed to die naturally.  I am concerned that this Bill could be a legislative step that will in some way contribute to the criminalisation of these couples, or women, in the future.  Given the nature of the IVF procedure, the women have lost embryos at the neck of the womb or, as is happening at present, have allowed embryos to die naturally that they did not wish to have frozen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully accept this is not the intention of the Bill, yet it could be the effect.  Therefore, legal clarification is essential.  We do not want to have circumstances in which a court might rule in such a way as to make current practices difficult or illegal and thus subject Irish couples to criminal sanctions.</P>
        <P>Consider the fate of surplus embryos that are allowed to die naturally outside the womb and which are known not to have been created deliberately for the purpose of research.  Would it <Col N="480"/>not be better to have the option of saving them for research instead of losing them forever?  The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction also made this point, as is evident from the speech of the Minister of State.  Saving the embryos allowed to die naturally outside the womb for research could potentially lead to cures for debilitating diseases such as dementia and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  In doing so, it would be a question of saving a life, lengthening a life and improving the quality of life.  It is for this reason that we need to proceed extremely carefully.  I welcome the Bill as an important first step.  We must learn a lot but we need regulation and broader, more comprehensive legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Science is and will continue to be our new frontier.  Its terrain is infinite and its scope is vast.  History has illustrated how it has reflected the best and worst aspects of the human race.  It has the potential to be the most positive, constructive force in our lives, yet, unchecked and unbridled, it has the potential to be the most destructive.</P>
        <P>We cannot here begin to imagine the potential of stem cell research.  It represents one of the most important and challenging areas of investigation that scientists and clinicians will undertake in our time. The use of stem cells has the potential to have a significant impact on human health, not only in the areas of treatment, repair and recovery, but also in the generation of hope for patients and their families.  Stem cell research creates challenges for scientists and clinicians but, undoubtedly, it creates significant challenges for our society and legislators, not least because of the sourcing of stem cells and the ethical issues that arise.</P>
        <P>As with other Members, I do not have the answers this evening.  I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue and thank Senator Mullen for raising it.  It is only through such debate that we will have the opportunity to think this through in all its dimensions with the aim of arriving at a position that best serves the people and future generations.  For such debates to be effective, it is important that we listen to each other and know our starting points and that we are prepared to be informed by and learn from what we hear.  Ultimately we may change our views as a result of such debates and discussions.</P>
        <P>A considerable responsibility is placed upon us and most of us do not have a scientific background.  However, we may have strong personal or religious beliefs, or have a close family member facing into a serious illness or disease.  We all recognise the importance of this area, the necessity to consider the challenges facing it and the role society must play in its governance and regulation.  Regardless of our perspective, we all recognise the dangers of leaving such an area without guidelines and regulation.</P>
        <P>As legislators, we wish to see ethical issues addressed.  We will have different views on how that should be done but as legislators we also want to ensure that Ireland and its scientific community are at the cutting edge of research in fully realising its potential.  As legislators, we want to ensure that our citizens have access to the best possible quality of life and medical treatment.  Although most of us are not scientists, we are faced with the responsibility of legislation and, as legislators, we must do this based on the facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following are some of the facts we should consider.  Stem cells have a special and unique property to develop into many other cell types that aid treatment.  Stem cells can be sourced from embryos but this results in the destruction of the embryo.  Stem cells can be developed from umbilical cord and from bone marrow.  To date, 214,793 papers on stem cells have been published in peer-reviewed journals.  Of those, 132,662 are papers on human stem cells.  Incidentally, 150 of the latter grouping are Irish.  I say to the Minister of State that it is very important that we support our scientific community.</P>
        <P>These papers have shown that stem cells have the potential to treat some of the most horrific diseases mankind has ever faced.  An example mentioned by previous speakers is the trachea <Col N="481"/>that was constructed this year from stem cells.  The cells in question were transplanted from bone marrow.</P>
        <P>Bristol University is about to start clinical trials on 60 heart attack patients, injecting stem cells into damaged heart tissue.  In Britain, scientists will grow human liver cells from stem cells taken from umbilical cord.  In Newcastle University, scientists will create sperm, again from bone marrow stem cells.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw attention, somewhat unusually, to a quotation from President George Bush.</P>
        <P LI="1">While we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research.  Even the most noble ends do not justify any means.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Some scientists argue that stem cells harvested from bone marrow and umbilical cord are not as useful as embryonic stem cells.  However, ten years ago, the same scientists argued that embryonic stem cells were the only show in town.  As a result of the stance taken by President Bush, which gave them no choice, they created the technology to develop stem cells from non-embryonic tissue.</P>
        <P>This is a horse that has enormous potential but, unsaddled and unreined, it is a dangerous beast.  We do not suggest stabling the horse, merely making sure that it does not harm anyone.  To do this we must introduce legislation.  The questions such legislation must address include the fundamental issue of the use of embryonic stem cells.  Such legislation must prohibit human cloning and  must support our scientific community and ensure best possible practice.  Although we are not as ideally equipped as we would like to be, we must play our role, base our work on fact and arrive at legislation through discussion and debate and, above all, a willingness on all our parts to listen and learn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate in the Seanad and I compliment those who spoke and sought to wrestle with this difficult question.  I state clearly at the outset that I would not, and do not, support the Bill introduced by Senator Mullen.  I do not believe it is the way to deal with this complex problem.  A Bill that is, essentially, founded on criminal sanctions or at least includes such sanctions as a crucial component in respect of embryonic stem cell research is not the way to deal with it.  I agree, however, with those who said that this issue must be wrestled with and dealt with by the Legislature.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the comprehensive treatment he gave to the topic.  However, ringing in his ears and in the ears of all of us are the demands and very strong suggestions from a number of bodies for regulation to be introduced and for legislation in this crucial area.  As recently as this year, the Irish Council for Bioethics made such a demand.  Regulation is the way in which we should approach this matter.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senator Mullen has a continuing interest in this topic.  However, it is probably true that this debate, or at least the occasion for it, was triggered by the decision of UCC some weeks ago.  Whatever one might say about the particular call made by the ethics committee in UCC and, ultimately, by the governing body of the university, at least they wrestled with this question and came up with actual decisions.  It may be good for us to be uncertain, as it were, about where we stand.  This may not be something to criticise.  Let us consider somebody coming into this House or standing up in the media or elsewhere, who makes all the arguments for and against, while we are struggling with this.  From an intellectual point of view, I understand and appreciate someone who takes that viewpoint but ultimately decisions must be made.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan referred to President Bush.  I remind the House that President Bush vetoed a Bill passed in the Senate in respect of the promotion and funding of stem cell research.  President-elect Obama proposes to reverse that veto.  These are decisions made in a much more complex and wealthier country which, no matter what way one looks at it, is likely to be at the <Col N="482"/>forefront of these issues more quickly than we ever will be.  Americans have faced up to the fact that they must make decisions.</P>
        <P>Again and again, with regard to complex moral questions and issues, we have allowed decisions to be made elsewhere and have permitted the effects of decisions made in other countries to wash into this country.  We have taken the benefit, or at least potentially stand to take the benefit, of decisions made in respect of research and advances made in other countries.  These include medical advances in respect of which some of us may have difficulties or questions.  We do not say that we will not permit Irish citizens to benefit from those medical advances nor do we say that we will seek to ensure that Irish citizens can gain such benefit.  If we do not legislate in respect of these matters there will continue to be, as is the current position, a free for all.  At present there is no legal impediment on the importation to this country of embryonic stem cell lines or their use here by scientists.  That is extraordinary.  We must all agree it is not good to be without regulation.</P>
        <P>By all means we can have this debate and it is good that we have it.  The Minister of State gave a strong indication that there would be legislation and I know this is one of the issues the Attorney General is considering, as is the Law Reform Commission.  I fervently hope that we will have legislation to regulate these issues, sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris queried what he described as the appropriation of the language of human rights by some advocates of the Bill.  When this debate was signalled last week, Senator Mullen or another colleague expressed the hope that people on either side of the argument would not be demonised.  While I subscribe to that view and share the Senator&rsquo;s hope, it pains me to hear colleagues criticising professional scientists for cynically generating false hope among people who are ill and vulnerable to attract Government funding for their projects and activities.  This is an example of demonising people which does not have a place in this debate.  Whether one wishes to refer to an embryologist or research scientists, in a debate such as this one can pick one&rsquo;s scientist because scientists on different sides of the argument make conflicting claims and arguments.  This reinforces the point that the decision on this issue ultimately will be one for politicians.</P>
        <P>From what I have understood from reading about this issue, if one were to use a crude measure and take a poll &mdash; legislators have many things to do and must try to get a sense of where the balance lies &mdash; one would find that the weight of scientific opinion is in favour of at least not banning embryonic stem cell research.  The trigger reaction of prohibiting this type of research and imposing fines is not the correct approach.</P>
        <P>On the issue of adult stem cell research versus embryonic stem cell research, I fundamentally disagree with the view expressed by Senator Mullen, in making a point in respect of resources, that we must choose between these forms of research because we cannot do both.  This is an unsustainable position.  Why would we have to make a choice or set one form of research off against another?  Both forms of research have been demonstrated to be valuable.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin emphasised that there has not been a single clinical trial in respect of embryonic stem cell research.  In all areas of scientific research there are no guarantees of success.  No one engaging in research in any field will ever state that success is guaranteed as there is always in scientific research an element of contingency and doubt.  If, next month or next year, a breakthrough is achieved arising from embryonic stem cell research, will my colleagues change their minds?</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the contribution he advanced.  I compliment Senator Mullen on introducing the Bill and on his cogent, balanced and compassionate contribution.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>As a result of rapid changes in Irish society, we have had many human and ethical debates on questions which had not arisen previously or may have lain dormant.  At times, we were counselled that discussion of issues of this nature created division and was emotive.  I do not subscribe to that view.  Who would argue, for instance, that the protests on medical cards or by teachers are not emotive or divisive or that any political action is not divisive or emotive?  I believe the reason this point of view was advanced was to stultify debate, which is a pity.</P>
        <P>My contribution to this debate emanates from an ethical disposition.  I will refer to medical issues only in so far as they have been advanced to support the idea of embryonic stem cell research.  A debate of this nature is a matter of &ldquo;To thine own self be true&rdquo;.  One must, therefore, listen to all points of view, try to understand them and ascertain to what extent they are compatible with one&rsquo;s own position.</P>
        <P>This has been an exceptionally good debate.  If anyone other than an Independent Senator had introduced the Bill, I do not believe the debate would have been so positive.  In saying this, I do not mean to be critical of the Government, my party or any other party.  However, I expect Senators will understand from where I am coming in that respect.</P>
        <P>I take an ethical position on this issue and have questioned myself on some of the points Senators made which, as I indicated, we must try to understand.  It was suggested that something that is done internationally should necessarily apply to this country.  The international community has allowed millions of people to die of hunger, even though it has the wherewithal to save them, allowed millions of people to die of AIDS, even though the necessary medication is available and could be provided at a reduced cost, and stood silent on the invasion of Iraq which created a new generation of terrorists and bred greater violence.  Besides the mercenary aspects of the way in which the global economy has developed, war has been a factor in recent economic developments.  For these reasons, the international community should not be held up as an example.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to ask questions in a God-like manner as I will leave that to Him.  However, the point made about embryos dying accidentally does not amount to an argument.  People die accidentally in car crashes but that does not change the position that we respect human life and its sacredness.  As human life is sacrosanct in our community, the argument about the accidental death of embryos does not carry any weight with me.</P>
        <P>Let us focus on the real issues, therefore.  This debate is on one of the most intrinsic issues with which any of us, as legislators, will be confronted.  The reason I avoid using the word &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; is that the tag &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; would follow.  This also stultifies debate and it is important to allow discussion to flow.</P>
        <P>Let us take on board whatever advice is available to us.  On the medical aspect, there is not a Member of the Oireachtas, including me, who does not have a loved one or acquaintance who has not suffered from a serious disease for which stem cell research could prove beneficial.  The person about whom I am speaking has departed this life.  I grappled with my conscience on this issue on many occasions but this is a much more all-embracing issue than the immediate concerns of one individual.  It is a question of human life itself and whether we will accept destroying one form of human life to help another form of human life.  If we accept that proposition, the discussion becomes much more complex and we must take much greater care and have a greater sense of responsibility in the debate.  I do not accept that proposition, however, because I believe when one opens the gates in that regard, it opens to question the concept of human life being sacrosanct and legislators acting as the defenders of human life.  To suggest that it might be only initial experimentation or whatever does not change this in any way.</P>
        <P>I hope that this Bill will progress to the next level.  That is what I would like to see happening.  I certainly would like to see the debate developing.  I can tell Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen that I am very supportive of this Bill because it comes back to the issue of us as individuals.  It should be <Col N="484"/>possible for us to reach a consensus, but that consensus must respect human life in all its form, born and unborn.  For me at any rate that is not questionable or capable of compromise because I believe this issue supersedes political affiliation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I wish to share time with Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole and Quinn. </P>
        <P>First, I join in the general acknowledgement that this is a very significant debate.  I congratulate Senator Mullen, who is indeed carrying on a great tradition in this House.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was very generous when he said that Independents have led the field on issues such as this and Senator Mullen has done everybody in this House a great service by raising the issue.  He has given everybody an opportunity and indeed a challenge.</P>
        <P>This is possibly a Bill that many of us would not have welcomed because it forces us to make decisions, say things and think about matters that are politically awkward and perhaps personally difficult to decide on.  I have listened to virtually the whole debate and it has been extraordinarily useful.  I would like to say one or two things about it.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that there is any denominational element in what is happening here.  Just because, in the past, there have been associations of sorts with the beginning of human life with certain denominational beliefs, it does not mean that this one follows in that particular tradition.  I know many people of all denominations who have totally different views on issues of this type.  I was impressed by what everybody had to say, but having heard all the contributions this evening, I do not know the answer to the crucial question of where human life begins.  Nobody in this House would want to take or to countenance the taking of human life if he or she thought it began at a certain point.  Having listened to the debate &mdash; I was struck by what Senator Corrigan said too &mdash; I am not a scientist and I do not know for one moment, but I realise that scientists on both sides have disagreed very strongly on, when human life begins.  Therefore the crux of this Bill is very difficult to decide upon.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for a moment that any insincere views are held.  I respect equally the views of Senator Mullen, which were very constructive and well articulated, and those of Senators Norris and Bacik who are opposed to the Bill.  There is a necessity to regulate.  I welcome the fact that this Bill has been introduced because it has given rise to a debate which must go further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for allowing me two minutes of his time.  It must be clear that there is no protection for the embryo until implantation starts in the uterus.  That is the present situation.  There is no legislation whatsoever in Ireland, just Medical Council guidelines, to cover the period from fertilisation to implementation.  The only people in this Chamber who cannot do research into embryos in this country are the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and me because we are medical doctors.  There is no protection for women who receive IVF and no protection for their embryos and foetuses.  That is a shame on both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is fine to wear our souls on our sleeves tonight on this issue and I feel strongly about it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and other Members of this House served with me on the Joint Committee on Health and Children from July 2005 to December 2006, where we talked <i>ad nauseam</i> about the lack of legislation for IVF and the constitutional issues on which we are, in some respects, touching tonight.  We have yet to see legislation on this issue for the protection of women.  We should move this legislation on and get it through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible. </P>
        <P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald and I feel very strongly about this issue and we wall raise it with the Leader again, particularly as it relates to IVF and the protection of women.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister of State and in particular the Bill put forward by Senator Mullen because I believe it needs to be discussed.  I will read, very briefly, from a letter I received by e-mail today from a neighbour:</P>
        <P LI="1">My son is quadriplegic, following a rugby accident in March 2004, when he was 19 years of age.  He has shown remarkable strength of character since then, keeping his body in as good condition as is physically possible while getting on with his studies.  He is doing all of this because of his huge hope and faith in world researchers to find a cure for spinal cord injuries like his, along with cures for many other degenerative diseases...</P>
        <P FLI="0">She goes on to say other things as well.  That reminds us how important this issue is just for one family, one mother.  We have a responsibility here and we cannot allow this topic to go unregulated, therefore I welcome the opportunity for the debate.  I found the debate very interesting because there are very few of us here who had predetermined notions and accepted views that we were sure of.  Some researchers argue that conducting research into embryonic stem cells will eventually lead to a method to grow the cells into a replacement for dead and diseased tissues.  That projected outcome is the same, whether it is for embryonic or adult stem cells.  We have a responsibility to debate this matter and I found the debate very interesting.  I believe this should continue because the onus is on us as legislators to ensure we regulate for the good of our citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  His contribution was very important.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Mullen, on bringing forward this legislation.  For the record, I have done everything possible to have this matter raised on the floor of the House.  In line with what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, I believe it is crucially important that we engage with these issues.  I do not purport to be an expert.  I have read the Bill a number of times and, like Senator Alex White, I do not support it.  That is my view, but it does not mean I am right.  Neither does it mean I believe my view is any better or more strongly held than anybody else&rsquo;s.  Certainly, it is an ethical question. </P>
        <P>Looking at the balances, ethically, I do not know where human life begins.  My view is that it begins much earlier than fertilisation in many cases.  One can bring it back to the dot, somewhere along the way, and all I have heard convinces me that I want research to continue into both adult and embryonic stem cells.  I firmly believe we owe it to people who are suffering from debilitating degenerative diseases and I cannot find it in my heart to stop that from happening.  Equally, people on the other side of the argument have made their case.  I have listened very carefully to all the debate and I respect all the strongly held views.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving us the opportunity of putting this together.  We need to learn everything we can about this issue.  We need also to continue the research.  I congratulate Senator Mullen on bringing forward the Bill.  I believe it is the beginning of a very important debate.  The Seanad, as it has done on many issues over the years, such as HIV-AIDS and various other matters, has once again been the first to grapple with these issues.  This is an important debate, which will be developed as time goes on.</P>

I listened to the debate with interest and support the views expressed on the need for regulation.  From listening to the contributions, particularly of the Minister, I would like to put on record my support for his comments that the hallmark of stem cells is their ability to develop into many other cell types and that this fundamental property needs continued research and investigation if it is to be harnessed to great effect.  I wholeheartedly support that view on the basis of the principle of the Bill, which is to regulate this type of research and investigation. </P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>I also support Senator Liam Twomey in the area of IVF, to which he referred.  There are many other sensitive, delicate areas of which, as Senator Twomey stated, professional, qualified Members such as himself and<b> </b>the Minister of State,<b> </b>Deputy Devins, would have a greater understanding, areas in that sphere which need a certain amount of regulation and where there is no regulation at present.</P>
        <P>I support what has been said on this Bill proposed by Senator Mullen and co-sponsored by Senators Hanafin and Walsh.</P>

I am very grateful to them because this is an issue of profound importance.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be nice to have time to address issues and clarifications and give reassurances to Senators Fitzgerald, Norris and Bacik.  This issue is moving very fast.  It was once thought that only embryonic destroyed cells could be used to treat Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  There seem to be developments that offer hope and promise in the area of age-related macular degeneration, which may be possible using adult stem cells.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is not the evening to examine every jot of the debate and to correct it.  I do not come from a theological perspective, I come from a view, informed by science, that human life is present in its individuality and momentum from the earliest stage.  As we are discussing human life with potential, we must move with great care.  I am greatly reassured by the fact that no one tonight suggested that if we prohibit embryo destructive research we would delay by one day the cures we all hope for.  I, too, hope for those cures and am greatly reassured by the fast-moving, positive developments that will, I hope, allow us to have those cures using ethical means.  Ireland should be at the forefront of that and it would be a service to the world community if we opted exclusively for ethical research.</P>
        <P>I was taken by the statement of a doctor who is an expert in this area and who said we should not demean the humanity we seek to heal.  It was a wonderful injunction, issued modestly, and it invited us all to do the research and develop cures we can all live with.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for responding to this matter.  I ask the Minister to state how he plans to share out the extra mackerel quota offered for 2009.  The mackerel quota has been increased by 33.3%, which is good news, for 2009.  There is a fear in the west, in particular in Galway but also among fishermen in Kerry and Cork who are part of the polyvalent fleet, that the increase will be allocated in its entirety to the 23 boats based in Killybegs.  That is likely to result in the fish being landed abroad, which is what happened in 2008.  I am looking for a share of this increase for the smaller boats in coastal communities.  This issue affects boats in Galway, ten to 12 boats in Rossaveal and the processing plant Iasc Mhara Teo.</P><Col N="487"/>
        <P>I will provide some background to this.  As the Minister of State knows, the mackerel quota for 2008 was 49,000 metric tonnes.  Some 7,000 metric tonnes of the quota was allocated to the polyvalent fleet of approximately 30 boats and 42,000 metric tonnes was allocated to the RSW pelagic, super-trawler fleet of 23 boats, which are larger and which are based in Killybegs.  The mackerel quota is expected to increase by 33.3%, or approximately 16,000 metric tonnes.  A group comprised of representatives of the polyvalent fleet and the four pelagic processors in the south Galway, Cork and Kerry regions came to me and many other politicians to ask that they receive at least 50% of the additional quota.  That appears to be a fair and genuine request.</P>
        <P>I make this claim because the polyvalent fleet is committed to landing at least 90% of the allocation in the Republic of Ireland and this has been their track record since 2002.  The additional quota would give a financial boost, which is very important in these economically constrained times, of approximately &euro;10 million to coastal communities in the west and south of Ireland, and would secure jobs on trawlers and in fish processing factories which are now in serious difficulty.  If the additional quota is allocated exclusively to the Killybegs-based pelagic fleet, most of it is likely to be landed abroad, with fewer benefits to employment in Ireland or the Irish economy.  All the RSW pelagic mackerel quota for autumn 2008 was landed abroad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The polyvalent mackerel quota should be managed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food-appointed Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee to ensure the processing season is extended to maximise value-added employment.  This quota is a national asset and it is important, in the interest of balance and fairness, to note that in this proposal no fish will be taken from the RSW pelagic mackerel allocation.  An allocation of 7,000 metric tonnes was made to the polyvalent fleet in 2002 and that precedent shows this allocation is possible.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, in the interest of fairness and given that this is a national asset, that the extra mackerel quota be allocated fairly nationally.  I look forward to hearing how he proposes to allocate the mackerel quota this year.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;r freisin.  The 2009 management arrangements for mackerel in the north-east Atlantic were agreed recently during fisheries consultations between the Faroe Islands, Norway and the European Union.  These negotiations, which Ireland attended, were conducted over two days at the end of October at the headquarters of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in London.  A significant outcome of these consultations was the agreement to substantially increase the total allowable catch of mackerel in the north-east Atlantic during 2009.  The overall total allowable catch agreed for this fishery is approximately 33% higher than it was in 2008.</P>
        <P>For Ireland, this should mean a net 2009 mackerel quota in a best case scenario of 62,000 tonnes, an increase from 45,500 tonnes in 2008.  That figure, which must be confirmed at the December Fisheries Council, may be subject to some changes as a result of complex transfer arrangements.  There is also a strong lobby proposing that mackerel be used to pay Norway for fishing opportunities under the EU-Norway Agreement.  I have expressed my total opposition to any such proposal at the Fisheries Council, most recently last week.  However, the likelihood of a mackerel quota increase of considerable tonnage for Irish fishermen in 2009 is a very welcome outcome.</P>
        <P>This increase is generally recognised in Europe and in Norway as resulting in large part from improved control and enforcement, with fishermen adhering more strictly to the quotas in this fishery in recent years.  The mackerel fishery is of major importance to the Irish pelagic fishing fleet, and this is a welcome reward for Irish fishermen for the sustainable fishing practices evident in this fishery in recent years.</P><Col N="488"/>
        <P>In value terms, the overall Irish quota for mackerel is likely to be worth approximately &euro;75 million to the fishing fleet in 2009, an increase of some &euro;20 million over 2008.  Critically, the increased quota should also enable increased processing activity and employment in Irish fish factories.  This will add significantly to the value generated for Ireland from the quota increase.</P>
        <P>I have already received a range of diverse views from industry representatives and operators regarding how the additional mackerel quota should be allocated.  The divergence in the views received so far is between the members of the Irish fishing fleet&rsquo;s polyvalent fleet segment and those in the refrigerated sea water, RSW, pelagic fleet and from the factories serviced by these fleets.  Under the existing agreed arrangements for managing Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota, the total annual mackerel catch for polyvalent vessels is capped at 7,000 tonnes, of which 1,500 tonnes were set aside to cover catches by vessels less than 65 feet in length.  The balance of the mackerel quota is divided between the 23 RSW vessels of the pelagic sector, according to set formulae.</P>
        <P>Members of the polyvalent sector, which includes those vessels in Ros a Mh&iacute;l referred to by Senator Healy Eames, have argued that while the capacity of the RSW sector has remained fixed for many years, the number of participating polyvalent vessels has increased significantly since 2001 when the existing arrangements were adopted.  As a result, the 7,000 tonnes set aside for the polyvalent sector is shared by an increased number of vessels, which they argue undermines the viability of all the vessels in this sector.  They have requested that the existing mackerel management arrangements be amended to provide the polyvalent sector with a share of the 2009 mackerel quota increase.</P>
        <P>The polyvalent sector also argued that the number of pelagic processing factories on the south and south-west coast has decreased from 12 to four.  The remaining factories depend on a regular supply of fish, including mackerel, to remain viable.  In return for an increase in its mackerel quota allocation, the polyvalent fleet has offered a commitment to land a fixed minimum quantity of mackerel within the State to support the viability of the factories on the south and south-west coast.</P>
        <P>For their part, members of the pelagic sector have argued that under the 2001 agreement, the 7,000 tonnes set aside for the polyvalent sector is a fixed allocation.  At the time of the agreement, the Irish mackerel quota was 72,000 tonnes.  The Irish quota fell during subsequent years, reaching 49,643 tonnes in 2008.  However, despite these quota reductions, the 7,000 tonnes reserved for the polyvalent sector remained unchanged.  In addition, the likely Irish quota of 62,000 tonnes for 2009 would still be considerably below the quota of 72,000 tonnes that was in place in 2001 when the 7,000 tonnes allocation to the polyvalent sector was agreed.</P>
        <P>Pelagic representatives have also said that, unlike the polyvalent sector, the RSW fleet is dependent on mackerel for its financial viability.  This situation has become more acute as the RSW sector has suffered severe cuts in quotas for blue whiting and north-west herring in the years since 2001.  The reductions in mackerel quota in recent years have put an enormous strain on this sector&rsquo;s finances.</P>
        <P>The pelagic sector has said the large processing industry in Donegal is very dependent on landings from the RSW vessels and it processes almost all the mackerel landed into Ireland.  Representatives of the RSW fleet said there has been an increase in recent years in the portion of the mackerel catch that their vessels land into the State, some 50% in 2008 and perhaps as much as 60% in 2009.  They feel that any increase in the fixed quota allocation to polyvalent sector would lead to further job losses in Donegal and the loss of Irish jobs at sea, as some of the RSW vessels would no longer be financially viable.</P>
        <P>In the context of these differing perspectives, I held a meeting today with all interested parties on the catching and processing sides to discuss the issues.  I have read, considered and <Col N="489"/>listened to the full diversity of views on this issue and note that there is no agreed fishing industry position on the matter.  Differing interest groups have widely differing and strongly held views on the issue and I will have to take these into account in determining the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this issue.  Yesterday, I chaired a conference on the issue of female genital mutilation, FGM, at which Ireland, in conjunction with 15 other European countries, launched a national plan.  It is significant this was launched on a European-wide basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national plan has three specific goals, namely, to prevent the practice of FGM in Ireland, to provide high quality appropriate health care and support for women and girls who have undergone FGM, and to end the practice of FGM.  Female genital mutilation is a harmful and deeply cruel practice and is an appalling human rights abuse.  It is extreme violence against women and girls and involves the cutting off of the genitals.</P>
        <P>The rationale for the continuance of FGM varies across regions, countries and cultures.  However, in every society in which it is practised, FGM is an expression of gender inequality.  In such societies, women consistently have less access to power, resources and education and are more vulnerable to sexual and physical violence because of the socially constructed roles assigned to them.  Control over women, their bodies and their sexuality is a key mechanism of sustaining gender inequality.</P>
        <P>Framed in this way, FGM can be understood to be motivated by the perpetuation of social systems organised around the subordinate position of women.  Ironically, and to my mind tragically, women are often central to the continuation of FGM, because the tragedy of their position is that marriage is one of the few social ways of advancement in such societies.  If they fail to allow the practice of female genital cutting continue, they isolate themselves from their communities.  Therefore, FGM is something mothers and grandmothers frequently require of their daughters, no matter how reluctant.  They see it as the only way of achieving status within the community.  The worrying factor is that FGM has always been a hidden issue and has not been debated in these societies.  Mothers and grandmothers frequently see it as the only lifeline for their daughters.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Understanding the reasons many women may support FGM is essential to develop sensitive and effective intervention strategies.  Research undertaken by AkiDwA this year has estimated that at least 2,500 women who have undergone FGM in their country of origin now live in Ireland.  Women and girls who have undergone FGM are accessing maternity hospitals and GP clinics and attending sexual health services.  Girls and young women from families for whom FGM is an expected rite of passage live in Ireland.  Irish Aid and Irish development NGOs contribute financially and programmatically to the abandonment of FGM in developing countries.  However, it is not just an issue for the developing world.</P>
        <P>FGM is a complex issue and has implications for health, justice, education, immigration, equality and the development aid sections of our Government.  To date, Ireland has no co-ordinated strategy or interagency working group set up to address FGM.  Consequently, differ<Col N="490"/>ent Government agencies, health care professionals, communities, organisations and individuals work in isolation from one another and only provide <i>ad hoc</i> services.</P>
        <P>This came out in our conference yesterday.  One young woman, only 20 years of age, spoke of her own experience.  She had been living in Dublin and got used to a certain general practitioner.  Generally, our general practitioners are not trained to deal with this sensitive and traumatic issue and as a result she found herself unable to deal with the general practitioner in Dundalk where she now lives.  She still comes to Dublin to visit her former general practitioner because the one in Dundalk could not handle the issue.  This demonstrates the need to train people in the medical profession here to deal with FGM.</P>
        <P>I mentioned earlier how it is not simply a matter for the developing world as it also affects us here in Ireland.  At the aforementioned conference yesterday, one could witness just how horrific this practice is.  It is a form of torture that is used to keep women subordinated and I simply cannot tolerate its continuance as a practice.  Moreover, it is completely gender based.</P>
        <P>However, one cannot consider this issue merely theoretically.  At present, there is a case before the courts concerning a woman who, having lost one daughter to this barbaric practice, fears returning to her home community where her family insists she should allow her daughters to undergo this practice.  She absolutely refuses to allow this to happen and, given what I witnessed at that conference yesterday, I understand completely the reason she would not wish to return to subject her daughters to such brutal torture, which would last a lifetime.  This is the reason I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene perhaps in the case of Pamela Izevbekhai and, using humanitarian grounds, not to insist she be deported from Ireland, as I can imagine no parent would ever consider bringing back his or her child.  I can imagine that no parent would give in to being deported when the health of his or child would be put at such risk, especially in the aforementioned case, given she already has lost one child to this practice.</P>

	<P>I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of my senior colleague, Deputy Harney, who is unable to attend the Seanad this evening.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for the opportunity to speak on this important matter.</P>
        <P>I also believe that female genital mutilation is a barbaric act, which constitutes an assault causing serious harm to the girls and women on whom it is performed.  Female genital mutilation is a deeply rooted traditional practice which continues in countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.  The age at which it is performed varies from area to area.  It may be performed on infants, female children and adolescents or, occasionally, on mature women.  It is not only extremely painful but results in serious mutilation and may cause infection and even death.  It exposes young girls and women to high health risks and seriously affects the quality of the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is working at present with Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and other relevant agencies in the preparation of a national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The strategy will set out the general vision and objectives and actions to tackle these issues.  I also understand that female genital mutilation will be among the gender-based violence issues the strategy will address.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, recently received a draft copy of the document, Ireland&rsquo;s National Plan to address Female Genital Mutilation, which was launched yesterday, and she has noted its contents.  The plan was produced by a national steering committee which included a number of non-governmental organisations as well as the Health Service Executive, and was funded by the European Commission.</P><Col N="491"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley may wish to note that legal advice which the Minister obtained in 2004 strongly indicated that female genital mutilation is an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The advice states, <i>inter alia</i>, that it is likely that performing an act of female genital mutilation would comprise an intentional act which causes serious harm and would thus be an offence under section 4 of that Act.  If the act of female genital mutilation was not found to have resulted in serious harm, it still would be open to the Garda to prosecute for the similar, though less serious, offence of assaulting a person causing harm provided for by section 3 of the 1997 Act.  In September 2006 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, in its concluding observations on Ireland&rsquo;s second periodic report, urged Ireland to continue its efforts to end the practice of female genital mutilation through, <i>inter alia</i>, prohibiting it by law. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is examining the possibility of introducing specific legislation to ban female genital mutilation in the context of the UNCRC&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children wrote to the then health boards in 2001 and again in 2004 and to the HSE in 2007 drawing their attention to the issue of female genital mutilation and requesting that personnel working with immigrant populations take opportunities to educate them about the dangers and unacceptability of female genital mutilation.  The Department also wrote to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2004 about the issue.  It asked that staff under the aegis of that Department, whose work brings them into contact with persons from regions where female genital mutilation is practised should be made aware of the issue and should educate and inform such communities about the illegality and unacceptability of female genital mutilation.  The Department of Health and Children will, together with the HSE, examine the actions which the national action plan recommends regarding guidance for health care professionals and data collection.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley and pass on the thanks of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for raising this important issue.  Female genital mutilation is a barbaric practice and the Government will take any further steps which may be necessary to promote awareness of its illegality and unacceptability in our society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment, namely, the provision of a secondary school for the area of Stepaside-Leopardstown.  This area has grown in the past ten years from having a couple of hundred homes to one that now has in excess of 8,000 homes.  It has four primary schools immediately within its environs and a further four immediately adjacent to it.  It does not have any secondary school.  Stepaside-Leopardstown is located within the Glencullen electoral area which itself lacks any public secondary school and this is a matter of great urgency.</P>
        <P>A site for a secondary school, located in the village of Stepaside, was identified in 2000.  I understand the Department has been examining this site with a view to commencing the secondary school.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could give an indication of the timeframe.  A phase is being entered now in which the children of the area are getting ready to leave primary school.  Unless they have a secondary school to attend, there is a real likelihood they will commence a pattern of attending secondary schools outside the area and that pattern will persist for their sisters and brothers who will follow them.  This would be in the interests neither of the community nor in building the kind of stable environment we have spent the past ten years developing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Department&rsquo;s capital programme for 2008 and to outline the current position on the provision of a secondary school for the Leopardstown-Stepaside area.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, <Col N="492"/>would like me to clarify that modernising facilities in approximately 3,200 primary and 730 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nevertheless, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure appropriate facilities are in place to support the delivery of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme from slightly more than &euro;90 million in 1997 to almost &euro;600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>As Senator Corrigan may be aware, a developing areas unit was set up in the Department of Education and Science to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas.  The main emphasis in 2008 was on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Officials from the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science have met D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council officials a number of times regarding the education infrastructure requirements across the county, particularly in the context of ongoing developments at Kilternan and Stepaside.  It has been determined that if all the current planned developments in those areas reach completion, an additional 2,600 primary school places and up to approximately 2,000 post-primary places will be required in the general area.</P>
        <P>In the course of examining the need for additional provision at post-primary level in the context of developments at Kilternan, Stepaside and Cherrywood, the Department has identified surplus capacity of approximately 1,100 places in the existing post-primary schools across the south Dublin area.  However, as it has been determined that there will be a future requirement of up to approximately 2,000 post-primary places, the Department has requested the local authority to reserve two sites for schools in the relevant local area plans.  The Department will continue to monitor the demand for post-primary school places in the area to ensure that any extra demand is met in a timely manner.  The acquisition of suitable sites for school developments will be kept under review in this context.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Corrigan for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive response.  While I am pleased that the Department&rsquo;s identification of future need is in keeping with ours, will he ask the Minister for a timeframe for the provision of school places?  Despite the surplus capacity identified in south Dublin, will he also convey to the Minister that, for the first time ever, young people have not been able to find school places this year?  Each case must be followed up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s ongoing interest in this matter.  Given her hands on approach, it is important that the Minister discuss with her the question of whether the surplus capacity is as large as indicated in my response.  I will convey her points to the Minister during our meeting tomorrow morning and I hope he will contact her as quickly as possible.</P>
