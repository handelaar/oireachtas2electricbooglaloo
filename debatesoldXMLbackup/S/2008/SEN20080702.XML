        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the Government&rsquo;s waste management policy; its policy on incineration; the role, if any, he sees for incineration in waste management in Ireland and both the number and capacity of incinerators that he considers is required.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to clarify the steps he can take to reduce charges in the new M50 tolling scheme given the worsening economic circumstances and the need to provide relief with the rising cost of living.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Keaveney, O&rsquo;Reilly, McFadden, Doherty and Fitzgerald as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Keaveney, O&rsquo;Reilly and McFadden and they will be taken on the conclusion of business.

	<P>We have agreed that the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2008 will be taken without debate.  I wish to raise the matter, however, especially given the news this morning that an incinerator is going ahead in County Meath.  In my constituency in Rathcoole, an application for an incinerator by a private developer has gone straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in line with the changes to legislation under the essential infrastructure rules.  What is the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party policy on incineration, and how many incinerators does the Government believe are necessary in this country?  We must ask serious questions about waste management policy given that exempted development and essential infrastructure are being used in this way to fast track planning applications for private developers.  I would like a response from the Leader on the matter.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to yesterday&rsquo;s discussion about the expenditure of &euro;200,000 on an office for the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Concern was expressed on all sides of the House about the amount of money involved.  I hope that when it comes to dealing with the economic situation, that the most vulnerable will not be targeted and that the issue of waste will be dealt with seriously by the Government and reformed.  I previously brought to the attention of the House statistics on waste in recent years.  Much concern was expressed yesterday about the expenditure of &euro;200,000, which is unacceptable, and gives us a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the waste of public money.  The cost of the decentralisation programme is &euro;1.27 billion.  What will happen in that regard in the weeks ahead?  The overruns on the East Link and West Link toll bridges ran to &euro;407 million.  The computer system PPARS cost &euro;186 million.  I hope the other side of the House is as concerned about these enormous amounts of waste as it is about the amount we discussed yesterday.  In any review of the economy the question of managing waste in Government-financed projects should be prioritised as opposed to attacking front-line services.  We want to see a new approach to the management of public money in the months ahead.</P>
<Col N="621"/>
        <P>At a conference last Friday the Director of Public Prosecutions highlighted his concern over legislation on children.  The headline from <i>The Irish Times</i> to a report written by Carol Coulter was &ldquo;DPP warns of major difficulty in taking underage sex cases.&rdquo;  He is extremely concerned that cases are not being taken now that should be taken.  Clearly children are not being protected.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  I am concerned that the Government is not clear about its direction regarding an amendment on children&rsquo;s rights or legislation.  If the DPP is warning of major difficulty in taking these cases, it effectively means that children are not being protected and there is a gap in the law which is of great concern to us.  There have been quite a number of high-profile cases in recent months where children were not protected.</P>
        <P>This issue is of great seriousness.  We need the Leader to tell us the line the Government is taking.  Will it proceed with an amendment or has it got cold feet following the experience with the referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  Will it introduce legislation that might deal with the issue to a degree?  One way or another, we need immediate action on the issue.  The DPP is extremely concerned about the lack of protection for children in these cases.  He has said it is &ldquo;immensely more difficult&rdquo; to take cases now than it was before.  This is a very serious legislative issue that may need emergency legislation before the end of this D&aacute;il term.  If there is to be emergency legislation next week, it should be in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point raised about children&rsquo;s legislation is crucial.  We need to give it broader consideration.  I received a communication from the National Youth Council stating that the recently issued regulations regarding alcohol and young people were put together without consultation with any youth organisations, which is appalling.  In addition the matter should be addressed through legislation and not by way of guidelines.  It is a matter to which I would like to return.</P>
        <P>Without wishing to query the good intentions of Senator Butler on the points he made yesterday, I feel he should look back at what has happened in the past 20 or 30 years.  I listened to members of the Government in 1987 telling us how bad the country was, that it was going to the wall and that there was not a shilling in it.  It took a couple of hundred million pounds worth of tribunals over the following 20 years to find that the country was overwhelmed and rotten with money at the time, most of it going offshore and most of it being accumulated without tax having been paid on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is questions to the Leader on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to discuss the matter.  I am not putting this in any assertive way to Senator Butler and I do not query his good intentions.  However, people need to understand why we need the facts before us this time.  I agree we need to share the pain.  We should have a view that anybody who speaks in this House should propose a solution that covers everybody.  Income and wage restraint are fine.  However, we need to remember that is called profit for some people, wages and income for others, and all sorts of fees for others again.  We should look to the people who got us into this mess, the bankers and the builders.  There should be an extra tax on bankers who are still making &euro;1.7 billion profit this year.  We should consider a means to protect people at the lower end on the minimum wage to ensure those outside the tax net are not brought inside it.  Everybody would be prepared to consider the introduction of taxation for people earning more than &euro;100,000 a year &mdash; or whatever figure.  I am sure the <Col N="622"/>trade union movement will not be found wanting in supporting that kind of progressive programme.</P>
        <P>In any discussion we have on the matter there should be an objective.  Why would people have a pay pause?  Why would we share the pain?  What are we trying to achieve?  What we are trying to achieve can be articulated, quantified or measured by benchmarks through interest rates, economic growth or inflation.  People would then know when we reach that point we have achieved the target and then the pain can be relieved.  People need to be clear about the state we are in at present, what we need to do to achieve our target in a way that will be shared by everybody and how we will know when we are out of it.  We have none of that information at the moment.  We should not buy into listening to bankers&rsquo; economists telling us how bad things are.  They are the people who told us how good things were not that long ago and guided us into this mess in the first place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the basis on which we should have the debate on the economy, which I understand the Leader proposes to hold next Wednesday.  That debate needs to be based on the facts.  We can see clearly the facts.  While we may differ in our opinions, we must have some level of shared understanding of the facts.  I am less than hopeful in that regard when I hear some of the statements made in this House and elsewhere as to what the facts really are.  What the Taoiseach said yesterday shows that he is persisting in the sham and untruth that our economic difficulties at present are wholly based on the international situation.  He again said in the D&aacute;il yesterday that tax revenues were down because of the international situation.  Tax revenues are not down because of the international situation.  Tax revenue is down and will continue to be down because of the collapse in the holy grail of the construction industry into which so much trust was placed by his colleagues and him in recent years.  That is not an opinion; it is a fact.  I raised this matter in the House last week and some colleagues opposite described it as an idiotic idea.  It is not an idiotic idea because it is factual to point to the reality that our economic difficulties are almost wholly domestically generated.</P>
        <P>We had a difficulty during the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign, when certain Ministers and others said they had not read the treaty.  I ask Ministers and Members of this House to read the documentation available to them before the debate next week.  I ask them to read the ESRI medium-term review, which makes clear that these difficulties are domestically generated.  They are not based on what is happening internationally.  If colleagues read the information first, we can then have the facts-led debate that Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly requested.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the matter Senator Fitzgerald raised regarding the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, of which I am also a member.  Whereas I understand where she is coming from regarding the DPP&rsquo;s statement, I respectfully disagree with anybody who would advocate emergency legislation in this very difficult and sensitive area.  We have had emergency legislation in this area and in related areas in the past, which has left us with difficulties.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>We need carefully considered debate on the matter in that committee and if necessary in this House &mdash; I have no difficulty with a debate in this House.  It is not clear to me that the only way to resolve this matter is through another constitutional amendment.  There is a real doubt as to whether that would be a sensible way to proceed.  My party is considering the possibility of the matter being addressed through legislation.  I presume the <Col N="623"/>Government is also considering the various options.  I know Senator Fitzgerald would always support a calm and reasoned debate.  This is classically not an area for emergency legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the approach advocated by Senator Alex White on whether the children&rsquo;s rights issue should be dealt with by legislation or through a constitutional approach.  The Oireachtas has established this committee which is due to report and all options are being considered.  Nevertheless the views of the DPP form an important part of that process.</P>
        <P>No. 1 is a motion on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Regulations 2008, which have been discussed in depth at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It largely relates to new procedures that allow small measures such as solar panels and wind turbines to be erected on domestic dwellings without going through the full planning process, which most people will welcome as a speeding-up mechanism in ensuring more renewable technologies are used.</P>
        <P>Regarding the query on the Government position on waste management, the Minister has indicated that a review of international best practice will be completed by this month.  That will be made public and will inform the debate.  The programme for Government indicates that incineration is not a preferred waste option but mechanical and biological treatment are.  The situation regarding the incinerator in Meath has gone through all existing processes but is being promoted by a company that says it wants an economic advantage over landfill for its operations.  However the programme for Government is clear that such an economic advantage will not be offered, so that raised questions.</P>
        <P>I had severe qualms about the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill when it was introduced in both Houses of the Oireachtas during the last Government but I have had experience of one of the first uses of it regarding an application by the Port of Cork company to relocate elsewhere in Cork Harbour.  Having seen that turned down and public concerns addressed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s refusal, I am more at ease with the use of that legislation and how it is being applied.  Nevertheless, we must monitor the situation and any attempt to foist unnecessary incineration due to the capacity that such operations would require to run will be strongly opposed by Government policy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, in building up as a major event today&rsquo;s presentation of the Department of Finance Exchequer figures, are playing for time on the economy.  It is not a unique event.  The Department of Finance produces Exchequer figures every month and they have shown, since the beginning of the year, a deterioration in tax receipts.  Talk of corrective action and mini budgets and the proposed press conference today is just masking the inactivity that has taken place.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Fitzgerald mentioned the economy.  The Taoiseach refuses to diagnose and admit what has gone wrong.  The economy was based on a property bubble.  In 2005 the IMF warned that this bubble was unsustainable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has agreed to a debate on that next week.  Senator Regan must ask a question of the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the Leader.  On foot of that property bubble, taxes on construction and housing related economic activities rose from 6% in 2001 to 20% in 2006.  That was unsustainable.  The Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance in 2006, said property prices were anchored on sound fundamentals in the Irish economy.  If we do not analyse and diagnose, and if the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance are not prepared to face the facts and properly diagnose the problems in the economy, they will not be able to steer this economy out of the recession that is staring us straight in the face.  I ask the Leader to address that question.</P>

	<P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of the protection of children.  I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to an item I read during the week disclosing that a leading British bank, which I do not believe operates in Ireland, is in the habit of sending debit cards to children as young as 11 years without the consent of the parents.  I do not know if it is possible to do this in Ireland and I do not know if it happens here but we must be very careful of it.  When we talk about protection of children we are not talking just about their protection in the normal manner but in other ways too.  The possibility of these children being able to buy alcohol, cigarettes, pornography, etc. is causing quite a concern in the UK and I would like to ensure we have some stipulation against this.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the banks.  Their representatives are coming into a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service, of which I am a member, and I intend to raise this.  It is a reminder that legislation on children is required not in just one restricted area but in a varied range of areas.</P>

	<P>I want to raise a few matters that arose yesterday morning.  I agree with most of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  Yesterday morning I did not do a very good job of getting across the point that we must protect those who need protection in this economy when there is a downturn.  It is the responsibility of unions, employers and all who have power at the table.  That was the point I made yesterday morning.  The responsibility is there.  I will not dwell on that.  Senator Coghlan, for whom I have great regard, raised some questions on the construction industry yesterday morning.  This is an important part of our country&rsquo;s industry.  The local authority budget for 2008 is very substantial.  I got a few figures before I came up and I want to read them to the House.</P>

	<P>The point has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Members complain in the House about the construction industry and the drop in housing business.  There is a bright side to this in that the customer will benefit.  There has been a drop in average housing prices from &euro;320,000 in 2007 to &euro;255,000.  That has to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is no use if people cannot get credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will reply to those points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a few points which are relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Not to the Order of Business.  I want questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is the Order of Business but it is important that we get these points made on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can do that in the debate next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2008 we have an average house price of &euro;255,000.  That is a very affordable price for young couples going into the market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Not if they cannot get credit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a bad thing.  It is good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.  We want questions, not statements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the sort of pricing that should have been around to begin with.  Some builders and developers have been too greedy in extracting money from young couples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He should have said that in the tent in Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>It shows what they can afford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Government housing policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I would finish, if I was allowed to.  I would say to the leader on the other side of the House that you have a job to control your own people, which you cannot do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must speak through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak through the Chair.  He has made his point.  A number of other speakers are waiting.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="627"/>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I have my point made but the point I am making&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have that on the debate next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I will wind up with the important point that there is a light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fairly weak light.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>We will debate the economy on Wednesday and I hope it will be a constructive debate and not one in which Members shout each other down.  We are letting down the tenor of debate in this House by shouting across the Chamber at each other.  It is not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Senator Butler&rsquo;s bona fides with regard to his concerns about the contractions taking place in the construction industry.  As the Senator said, something is wrong in this area and the managers are being strait-jacketed by the Department with regard to this, that and the other programme.  I have seen major programmes cancelled and I know something is wrong.  That is all I will say on that matter.  The Leader can respond if he wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Today, the good people of Valentia and Malin are before the Joint Committee on Transport and I have no doubt they will get a good hearing.  We must remind ourselves that these people have a sterling record of first class service to this State.  In these straitened times of sharp economic downturn, we need to conserve resources and not waste what is available.  If further specialised equipment needs to be installed, I suggest we have suitable premises for that at both Valentia and Malin.  I look forward to today&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That can be discussed at the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Finally, a very important subject with regard to the protection and rights of children has been touched on in the House.  The law is lacking.  It is a most serious issue when it is taken up by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, the most senior law officer in the State.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to a report in<i> The Irish Times</i> which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Prosecutors find themselves equipped with a far more limited range of legislative tools, James Hamilton said, at the conference at University College Cork.  He called for the codification of the law on sexual offences, to make it accessible and comprehensible.  It was essential the law was clear and easily understood, and not just by lawyers, he said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very important point.  I look forward to the Leader responding on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the concerns expressed about the comments of the DPP.  I share his concerns with regard to the current difficulty in prosecuting cases.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Child Protection in the last D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We recommended that absolute protection would be reintroduced by way of a referendum.  I hope the current committee, under the able chairmanship of Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, will come forward with that.</P>
<Col N="628"/>
        <P>I concur to a very large degree with everything Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about the economy and what needs to be done.  There needs to be restraint everywhere and everybody needs to play his or her part, as I have said, with regard to the public service and having a pay pause for a period of 18 months.  It is absolutely essential we do this.</P>
        <P>With regard to comments on the construction industry, anybody who knows anything about economics and house building will know that maintaining 80,000 to 90,000 units per year is unsustainable and that a more natural figure would be 40,000 to 50,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity the Government did not know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the huge increase in the past few years, we have approximately a 70,000 unit overhang which will probably take a couple of years to wind its way through the system.  When that is gone, we will be back to more normal production of units.  However, we should not become negative, be it for political reasons or due to those in the media who have been predicting doom and gloom for the past five years and now seem pleased the economy is getting to the stage where growth rates are beginning to wind down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Who blew the surplus?  This is nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh, without interruption.  I will ask Members to leave the House if they will not obey the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I want to make some reasoned comments on some of the derogatory references made in this House, in particular yesterday, with regard to a motion which I and others had at our parliamentary meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to refrain from getting involved in a direct clash.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a very good debate, everybody was very happy and the wording and content of that motion was very fair and balanced, and accepted by the meeting and by the Taoiseach and the Minister.  I would encourage other parties to look at the heads of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What happens at party level is immaterial to me or to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is material to the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that we would again debate the issue in the autumn.  We had an excellent debate in the House three months ago on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator support the Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I was amazed that members of the media paid no attention to that debate in this House.  Yet, everybody was looking for me on Friday and since in order to comment.  If more attention was paid by the media in general, with the exclusion of Mr. Jimmy Walsh and <i>The Irish Times</i>, they would have these stories well in advance.</P>
        <P>In response to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which I thought had a terrible heading, the republican ethos that is engendered in this House and particularly in my party would ensure marginalised people in society need have no fears that their issues will be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What a relief.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="629"/>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator support the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is made.  I want to move on to other speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On this issue, it is essential it is done in a way that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want questions to the Leader.  We are moving away from that.  I know the Senator wants to make a point but he has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish by making the point that in doing this, there is no need to, and  it must not happen that we need to, redefine marriage from its intrinsically heterosexual nature, which is for the propagation of society and the welfare of children, into one which is purely for an adult sexual relationship.  That is essential and important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are totally unacceptable comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the announcement last night from Fianna F&aacute;il that it will slap down that motion from Senator Walsh.  It shows they are not all dinosaurs and we must recognise that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Well done and well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I want questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to the situation in Abkhazia in the Caucasus.  Many will have read about the involvement of the Russians inside Abkhazia and the developing situation regarding the border with Georgia.  I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs how important it is that the European Union makes some noise about this situation.  The Minister should meet the Russian ambassador to discuss Russia&rsquo;s intentions regarding Abkhazia.</P>
        <P>An announcement was made this morning that Indaver Ireland is about to begin construction of an incinerator outside Duleek.  The site is two miles away from where I live and I am very concerned about the impact of the incinerator on the people of County Meath.  I am also very concerned to see that the Green Party has washed its hands of this issue.  Members of that party have argued that the issue has been through the courts and that there is nothing they can do, but they are wrong.  They can roll out the brown bin strategy.  Fingal County Council has managed to reduce waste significantly by introducing a pilot brown bin programme in the Fingal area.  I would like to see that rolled out nationwide.  That is something that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can do.  Let us see him do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach who is a most indulgent and patient man.  I ask the Leader if there is any possibility, given the difficult situation in the fishing industry, of having a brief debate on the issue before we conclude this session next week.  In particular, I am concerned about the fact that most, if not all, crewmen are self-employed and they seem to have been ignored by the Cawley report.  The fact that they are self-employed means they are facing a bleak future.  It probably suited some of the trawler owners that the crewmen were self-employed but sin sc&eacute;al eile.</P>
        <P>I chaired the Oireachtas committee on the Constitution which examined the issues of children&rsquo;s rights.  It is an extremely sensitive issue.  I support the concept of a referendum on the rights of children but if we do not get it right, we could create a legal quagmire and a minefield of problems.  I would urge caution, with all due respect to the leader of the Opposition.  I know she means well but we must be cautious.  I urge Members to wait for the concluding report <Col N="630"/>from the current committee and following that, I suggest that a cross-departmental committee should examine closely the wording of any amendment to the Constitution.  If such an amendment is not worded correctly &mdash; forget about Lisbon &mdash; we could have a major headache in this country in the future.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the cost of refurbishing the former Taoiseach&rsquo;s offices was mentioned.  In that context, I wish to share an anecdote with the House.  I met a man who is building a house on an island off west Cork, the name of which I will not mention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Inishvickillane, perhaps?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an inhabited island off west Cork.  The man in question is getting his house built for &euro;127,500.  In that context, are we getting value for money?  I believe the point speaks for itself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a point to the House.  On the Order of Business, Members may request clarification of the Leader&rsquo;s proposals for today&rsquo;s business or seek alterations or amendments to the times allocated.  A Member may also ask about forthcoming legislation or request that the Leader provide time for a debate on a particular matter or topic.  Members do not need to give a very detailed reason for requesting such a debate as that information can form part of the debate when it takes place.  Contributions should be brief and to the point to enable the Chair, within a reasonable time, to facilitate any Senator wishing to ask questions on the Order of Business.  We should not return to issues we discussed yesterday.</P>
        <P>I will circulate this information to Members, in case they are not up to speed on procedures.  People have been drifting totally off the point.  We may be nearing the end of the session and I might be a little more lenient with people than usual but there are approximately seven minutes remaining with ten or more Senators wishing to make a point.  I do not have a hope of being able to accommodate them all.  Unfortunately, some Senators who may have important points to make will not be able to do so.  To be fair to the Leader, I often wonder how he manages to pick out the actual point raised by Senators, given the length of some contributions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues in calling for a debate on the economy.  I understand that debate will take place shortly, which I welcome.  As a neutral, non-party observer, I note an amazing sea-change in the political atmosphere of this House in just one week.  Last week, Senator Alex White made some very trenchant points about the economy.  He was howled down and political charges were shot at him from the Government side of the House.  This week he made precisely the same points, equally trenchantly, and he was listened to in silence.  That tells us something about the seriousness of the situation which we all have finally grasped.</P>
        <P>I ask that we examine the situation regarding the forthcoming visit of President Sarkozy.  I understand he has indicated he is interested in meeting groups who had conscientiously voted and campaigned against the Lisbon treaty.  On that point, reports in various newspapers indicated that 75% of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; were really concerned about increasing militarisation and our neutrality, the reduction in the number of European Commissioners and the protection of our tax regime, while approximately 50% of people were confused about abortion.  The newspapers headlined abortion as the main issue.  Why?  I hope this House can be instrumental in ensuring the real concerns of people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side are made clear to President Sarkozy.</P>
        <P>I note the preliminary Order Paper references a debate on health once again.  While the issue is very important, I wonder at the lack of imagination which means that we have such a debate almost every Wednesday.  Then I noticed what seemed to be a quotation in classical <Col N="631"/>Greek.  I wondered if it was from Homer, Aristotle or Plato.  Then I looked more closely and could not understand it.  I thought my Greek had failed me.  I read, &ldquo;cals on te&rdquo; but then I realised that it should read &ldquo;calls on the Government to&rdquo;.  Is this the European dimension overtaking us here in Leinster House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is hardly relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all Greek to us too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, announced that the Health Service Executive is rolling out its planned disability developments.  The additional &euro;50 million provided for the service plan will be spent on new places for children with autism who are leaving school, on preschool places and on extra therapies.  Would be possible to bring the Minister of State before the House next week to outline how we can ensure the spirit of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is implemented and to confirm that his role is to deal with health and disability issues in schools, as well as in the pre and post-school settings?</P>
        <P>Currently, if one needs special needs assistance or help in school, the Department of Education and Science will tell one that many of the therapies are the responsibility of the HSE but if one talks to the HSE, one will often be told that it is the responsibility of the schools.  There is a difficulty in determining whether the issues are to be dealt with under health or education.  It is about time the two Departments worked together and the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is well placed and has the resources to progress that.</P>
        <P>I believe the Intoxicating Liquor Bill will be before the House next week.  If that had not been the case, I had intended to call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to end our session in the same way in which it began, with a discussion on the important issue of alcohol abuse and misuse in our society.  Such a discussion could include issues such as that raised by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, namely, voluntary codes of practice, as well as the positive work that is going on in organisations such as the GAA in the promotion of healthy lifestyles.  If the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is before the House next week, such issues can be dealt with in the course of the debate on that legislation.  However, if the Bill is not due before the House, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to conclude the session in the same manner in which we began it, that is, prioritising the issue of our cultural abuse and misuse of alcohol.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions last weekend and the report published yesterday by the Ombudsman for Children which claimed that the State is falling short in its duty to protect vulnerable children and highlighted a 43% increase in demand for that office&rsquo;s services, will the Leader arrange an urgent debate on children, before the summer recess if possible?</P>
        <P>I join Senator Hannigan and others in calling for a debate on civil unions.  The legislation due before us is very important.  The debate must be devoid of emotion.  I respect the views of everyone but there are people in this country who are being marginalised and who are vulnerable.  We must treat all our citizens equally.  We urgently need a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was addressed by the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the Local Authorities Members&rsquo; Association and the Association of County and <Col N="632"/>City Councils in respect of the Green Paper on local government reform.  I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s policy of having briefing sessions around the country.  </P>
        <P>The Leader has indicated that he is prepared to take a debate on this matter, which I assume will happen after the recess.  I welcome that because time is needed.  I watched a programme recently that dealt with teenage gangs in another country.  They were not using baseball bats or hurley sticks; they had guns.  While I am not saying that this is the case in this country yet, we are getting there.</P>
        <P>In tandem with that report, I ask that the management of estates be put centre stage.  People have been forced to leave their houses on the advice of the local authority and the Garda.  The culprits were not asked to leave but the decent people who could not live their lives in peace were asked to leave for their own safety.  It is a damning situation that must be addressed.  In the context of this debate, I ask the Leader to put the management and the performance and behaviour of tenants top of the agenda.  If people misbehave and make life difficult for others, there is only one way they will go, which is out without a return ticket.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much discussion about the economy and how it is going into recession.  When we face difficult times, we need to invest in our infrastructure.  I have called for numerous debates and numerous Senators have called for a debate on what is happening in respect of the national development plan, particularly the areas which have not seen the benefit of the Celtic tiger over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on broadband.  A survey on communications by the European Commission showed that, again, Ireland lags well behind with the highest costs and lowest speeds.  We are the only country in Europe where more people used narrowband or dial-up than broadband.  This is a serious issue if we wish to be a knowledge-based economy and want to get out of the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a debate on it.  Members of the Labour Party previously raised the topic during Private Members&rsquo; business but we need a debate, in particular because an international advisory committee has been set up to deal with next generation networks.  Countries like Japan are not even looking at next generation, they are looking at next-next generation.  We need to catch up fast.  </P>
        <P>There is a way for us to help regional development.  I spoke to the experts who were here last week.  In respect of areas like Donegal, we could, with only a couple of hundred thousand euro, test pilot next generation networks.  Can one imagine what that could do for places that have 18% unemployment?  In light of the growing demands for a debate on the economy, I ask that we deal with the issue of broadband and next generation and that the Minister come to the House to give us an update about what is happening and what can be done in the short term.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources come to the House.  Oil has now reached $142 per dollar.  We are now hearing from the markets that speculators are not causing most of the problems, that there is shortage in light of the demands coming from China and India, that we are into a number of supercycles of demand for commodities from those nations and that there is a production capacity problem, which is not necessarily a shortage, which could continue for a few years.  In light of all this and Ireland&rsquo;s unique situation in Europe, with unique possibilities, we should request EU funding to provide clean energy offshore from wind and tidal energy <Col N="633"/>with major support from the EU in light of its correct claim that it has a competence in the energy field.  </P>
        <P>I also note that an abusive term was used again in the House.  Yesterday, the term &ldquo;rump&rdquo; was used by somebody referring to members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  One finds that some of these people who call themselves liberals are very intolerant.  The term &ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo; was used this morning.  This is not the Jurassic or the Triassic age.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Buttimer, Coghlan, Butler, O&rsquo;Donovan, Norris and Doherty all raised pressing issues which have been raised on the Order of Business over the past number of weeks.  I viewed the programme on RTE last night which was a credit to the station.  It was a profile of Ian Paisley for which I congratulate Tommy Gorman, Ed Mulhall and others associated with it.  It showed the tremendous achievement that took place in our country in our time.  I was very proud to see our former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the current Taoiseach and everyone from all political persuasions who played their part over the years to bring us to where we are today in respect of what we have all known for years as the national question.  I include leaders of all parties, both North and South, in our congratulations.  </P>
        <P>In respect of the planning and development issue highlighted by Senator Fitzgerald and many other Senators, we all share her concerns in respect of the protection of the environment and our people.  In respect of anything we can do in this House to help and assist the Government and Minister formulate policy, time will not be a problem.  I agree fully with many of the concerns that have always been raised here in respect of planning issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy Leader of the House, Senator Boyle, raised a point about the motion to be taken without debate.  It is to enable solar panels and energy-saving systems to be placed on houses.  I know that all colleagues of all political persuasions fully support this which is why we are asking the House to proceed with the motion, which was approved by the relevant committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all know that a debate on the economy is taking place here next Wednesday.  In respect of the challenges faced by the Government &mdash; I include Senator Regan&rsquo;s question in this &mdash; the procedure is very clear and has been established by all Taoisigh down through the years during my membership of the Oireachtas.  The Department officials give a six month report in their own style without spin and give the facts to the Irish people, politicians and the Government.  The Government and the Minister for Finance then assess that and the Minister, on the first subsequent sitting day of Cabinet, which in this instance is next Tuesday, makes his proposals in respect of the information he has received from the Department officials.  The Cabinet then approves it or sends it back again.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Cabinet will approve the Minister&rsquo;s proposals next Tuesday.  At the first available opportunity, we will discuss them here on Wednesday.  The Minister for Finance will be here and in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday.  Colleagues in the D&aacute;il and Seanad can then express their opinions or concerns and make their proposals to the Minister and Ministers of State who will be taking the debate and who will address the serious challenge facing the country over the coming six months.  At that point, we must again assess the situation as a Government and <Col N="634"/>take the necessary corrective measures in the budget, as has happened in the past.  Those are the facts.</P>
        <P>In respect of Senators&rsquo; concerns regarding the statement by the DPP, we were all used to hearing about him and his powers but none of us ever knew him or the type of person he was until he took part in a very famous and informative interview on RTE radio.  As a citizen of Ireland, Member of the Oireachtas and Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I was proud when I heard the DPP talk to the interviewer that evening on RTE radio.  The more the DPP can be interviewed and make known his views to Ireland, the more we can have total confidence in the judicial system.  The challenges the DPP faces daily are among the most difficult in the land.  If there is anything we can do to assist the DPP, I want to hear the views of colleagues on all sides on the suggestions made this morning by people who are very professional and know what they are talking about, especially those in the legal profession.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Keaveney referred to the alcohol legislation, which will be in the House next week, when colleagues will have the opportunity to express views and justifiable concerns, as they have done over recent months.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden expressed his concern at the fight of the people of Roscommon for that very good facility, Roscommon County Hospital.  The motion during Private Members&rsquo; time is proposed by the Fine Gael and Labour parties and concerns a serious issue.  Senators will make known their views on health, particularly on the cancer strategy, with the Minister present.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn referred to the issue of bank cards and the alcohol problems of children.  He also referred to the issues concerning banks, to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>Senators Butler and Coghlan highlighted the difficulties in the construction industry.  Building more than 600,000 houses in ten years is a marvellous achievement.  As Senator Walsh said, there is an overflow at the moment and it will take two years to catch up.  An auctioneer said to me yesterday that it is too late to sell and to soon to buy.  That seems to be the attitude of most people.  I will be delighted to see young couples purchase when the banks start lending money again.  No matter what price one could purchase at, the banks do not seem to lend money.</P>
        <P>The banks are appearing before the joint committee today and the Chairman of the committee is the very experienced Deputy Michael Ahern, who was the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and who knows minutely everything that has taken place anywhere in the world over the past ten years.  I hope we will do with the banks issue as the then Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business did with the insurance industry, working hand in hand with banks as a conduit of Government and the Oireachtas.  The banks need to continue to make the immense contribution they have made over the past 15 years.  We want them to do so.</P>
        <P>Senators Coghlan and O&rsquo;Donovan referred to the people of Valentia and Malin Head who are appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport today.  Many Senators will be present to make their views known.  I have no difficultly allocating time for further debate if it is requested.  I will pass the views of Senator Hannigan on the Russian ambassador to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the fishing industry.  This will take place next week.  The Senator referred to self-employed people in the fishing industry and it is an area of serious concern.  The Minister will be in the House next week to hear the debate.</P>
        <P>I will pass the views of Senator Norris on the French President to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Taxation, the loss of the Commissioner and neutrality were the three issues to which <Col N="635"/>he referred and which were of serious concern to the &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters in the electorate.  It would be a great idea if public representatives met the French President to tell him at first hand why they were so strong in their views of the electorate voting &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It would be of immense help to the process of getting a successful conclusion to this major issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney welcomed the &euro;50 million the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children allocated yesterday.  I join her in that and I am willing to help and assist in any way I can.  I will pass on the views of Senator Buttimer concerning civil unions.  Senator Glynn called for a debate on the Green Paper on local government reform.  I have no difficulty allowing this to take place early in the next session.  Funding for local government is dear to the hearts of Members and we want to play our part in having the issue debated and making our views known.  Unfortunate people in some housing estates are having a serious challenge.  It is a challenge to society, the behaviour of a small number of residents which has the maximum effect in these housing estates.  I have no difficulty in providing time to have this matter debated.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty called for a debate on the national development plan, especially the roll-out of broadband.  Everyone joins the Senator in his request for that.  Some 100,000 homes were connected in the past three months but we are coming from a low base.  I will do everything I can to set time aside in the first week or two after the summer recess, if not before the recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called on me to allocate time to debate energy costs and energy from oil.  With oil so expensive, energy costs are more expensive which creates higher food costs.  In an effort to facilitate the Senator&rsquo;s request, I propose that Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members&rsquo; time will have a motion to debate and discuss alternative energy uses that do not include oil.  I look forward to the views of experienced Senators and their proposals to the Minister.  I refer particularly to wind energy and tidal wave energy, which seems an ideal opportunity for Ireland, with its geographical location.  Perhaps we have an advantage for this proposal.  I have no difficulty with this and I will discuss it with Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and spokespersons and our colleagues in Government, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats.  We will discuss how we can table this motion in the House to assist in what is a serious challenge.  I welcome assistance from all parties in dealing with Private Members&rsquo; business next week.</P>

    <Title>Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P Just="Left">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The purpose of this Bill is to enable the transposition into Irish law of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  While Ireland is not, and will never be, a <Col N="636"/>nuclear weapons State, it is appropriate that we complete processes such as this to ensure consistency with well developed public policy.</P>
        <P>The nuclear test ban treaty was opened for signature in 1999 but has yet to come into force.  This is because 44 specifically named countries, those with nuclear capability, must ratify it to enable entry into force.  However, to date 41 of these specified states have signed it and 35 have ratified it.  Those who have not ratified the treaty include China, the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Pakistan and the United States of America.</P>
        <P>The treaty requires a state party to the treaty to prohibit natural and legal persons anywhere on its territory or in any other place under its jurisdiction from carrying out, or participating in the carrying out of, a nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.  Since the first, and thankfully so far the only, use of nuclear weapons in 1945, the world has sought ways of preventing the proliferation of such weapons.  For many years, Ireland&rsquo;s non-nuclear status has enabled it to be very much to the fore on the international stage in promoting nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.  Ireland has continually called on all states to refrain from testing nuclear weapons and to embrace nuclear disarmament.</P>
        <P>The historical context to this treaty was the growing concerns among states about the consequences of a large number of countries holding nuclear weapons and the increased likelihood of their use if this happened.  These concerns led to the landmark Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, which was proposed by one of our own, the late Mr. Frank Aiken, in 1958.  Another significant treaty, banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water, was concluded in 1963.</P>
        <P>Given the historical background and our own non-nuclear policy, Ireland is fully committed to the policy of promoting nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  We believe that nuclear weapons states must speedily take steps towards achieving total nuclear disarmament, as they are obliged to do under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</P>
        <P>It is our view that the current treaty structure, the non-proliferation treaty and the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water, has had considerable success in limiting the number of nuclear weapons states.  However, this structure left a clear gap by permitting the nuclear weapons states to continue testing new weapons underground.  The solution to this problem was found in the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which prohibits all nuclear weapons tests anywhere.</P>
        <P>The nuclear test ban treaty was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 September 1996 and opened for signature on 24 September 1996.  Ireland signed on the first day.  To date it has been signed by 178 countries and ratified by 144.  Ireland and all our EU partners have also ratified the treaty.</P>
        <P>The treaty bans all nuclear test explosions, wherever they may be conducted.  To verify compliance with the prohibition, the treaty provides for the establishment of an international monitoring system.  This system comprises 337 stations around the globe which will conduct continuous seismological, hydro-acoustic and radio-nuclide monitoring.  This network of stations will permit the detection of any nuclear explosion.</P>
        <P>The treaty provides for the establishment of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation. known as &ldquo;the treaty organisation&rdquo;, to be based in Vienna at the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The purpose of the treaty organisation is to achieve the objectives of the treaty, to ensure implementation of its provisions, including those for international verification of compliance with it, and to provide a forum for consultation and co-operation among state parties.</P>
<Col N="637"/>
        <P>The treaty organisation will be responsible for the running of the international monitoring system and will have the power to inspect any sites on which it is suspected that nuclear testing has taken place.  It will also have the technical expertise to make reliable judgments on suspicions.</P>
        <P>As in other international organisations and bodies, the treaty organisation&rsquo;s budget will be provided by contributions from state parties, based on the United Nations scale of assessment.  Pending the entry into force of the treaty, a preparatory commission for the treaty organisation has been set up and it has begun to establish both the monitoring system and the organisation&rsquo;s administrative structure.</P>
        <P>As I indicated earlier in this speech, the treaty will only enter into force when 44 specifically named countries have ratified it.  As was also stated, the 44 countries in question are those which the International Atomic Energy Agency deems to have a nuclear capability, whether civilian or military.  Ireland, naturally, is not among them.  I stated to the House that so far, 41 of the specified 44 states have signed the treaty.  Furthermore, only 35 of the 44 states have actually ratified it.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, I have to state it is a matter of regret that so far, the United States of America has yet to ratify the treaty.  Ireland and its EU partners have expressed their deep regret that this is the case.  The treaty cannot enter into force without the ratification of the USA. It would be an empty treaty without American adherence.  However, the announcement that the US will abide by the moratorium on nuclear testing, in place since 1992, is welcome.  On a more negative note, the House will be aware that India and Pakistan conducted tests of nuclear weapons in 1998 and North Korea did likewise in 2006.</P>
        <P>Clearly there was concern that the situation described above would arise and accordingly provision was made that if the treaty had not entered into force within three years of opening for signature, namely, by 24 September 1999, a conference of states which had ratified it would be convened to consider ways of ensuring its rapid entry into force.  A number of such conferences have taken place, the most recent being in September 2007 when the state parties agreed to spare no effort and use all available avenues to encourage signature and ratification of the treaty.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset of my speech, the Nuclear Test Ban Bill will give legislative effect in Ireland to the nuclear test ban treaty.  It transposes the treaty into national law.  However remote it may be that Ireland will be exposed to such actions, the Bill will make it an offence for any person to carry out, or cause the carrying out of a nuclear explosion in the State.  It will similarly be an offence for an Irish citizen to carry out, or cause to be carried out, such an explosion outside of Ireland.  The Bill also designates the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland as the national authority for the implementation of the treaty.  The institute will act as the national focal point for liaison with the treaty organisation and other contracting parties to the treaty and will facilitate any on-site inspection visits by the treaty organisation&rsquo;s technical secretariat.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and  Local Government to appoint authorised officers who would have the power to, <i>inter alia</i>, enter a place where he or she has reasons to believe an offence under the Act has been committed and to remove any relevant documentation.  These officers would also have the power to accompany the international inspection team on any site inspections.  In the unlikely event that a major offence is committed under the Act, it would be an indictable offence and would be liable to penalties including imprisonment for life.</P>
        <P>Other offences that may be committed under the Act relate to wrongful disclosure of information obtained under the Act, or the making of false or misleading statements to official <Col N="638"/>authorities.  Depending on the seriousness of the offence in these areas, there is provision for a fine of up to &euro;50,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both.</P>
        <P>Given Ireland&rsquo;s rejection of nuclear as a source of energy, and the fact that nuclear medicine and industrial uses represent the main applications of nuclear materials in Ireland, it is reasonable to state that it is extremely unlikely that this Bill, when enacted, will ever come into play in Ireland.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the regulator for all uses of radioactive materials in Ireland, and all such users must operate under a licence from the Institute.</P>
        <P>The costs to Ireland associated with implementing the treaty are relatively low.  None of the treaty organisation&rsquo;s monitoring stations will be in Ireland and, given the absence of a nuclear industry here, it is not expected that Ireland will receive any inspections.</P>
        <P>The main cost to Ireland is approximately &euro;350,000 per annum which is our share of the establishment and running costs of the treaty organisation.  The amount is decided in accordance with the UN scale of assessment used for determining states&rsquo; contributions to UN bodies.</P>
        <P>Let me emphasise that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is a central international instrument in preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons.  The implementation of a ban on testing nuclear devices and establishment of an effective mechanism to monitor the ban, would add to the security of all.</P>
        <P>The transposition of this treaty into Irish law is entirely appropriate.  It is consistent with our current and historic position on nuclear weapons and non-proliferation.  While Ireland&rsquo;s transposition will not trigger the entry into force of the treaty, it will ensure that Ireland is in a position to discharge its obligations under the treaty when and if it does enter into force.</P>
        <P>This is straightforward and strictly non-contentious legislation dealing with a subject for which there is cross-party support in Ireland.  Enactment of the Bill will be in line with Ireland&rsquo;s strong stance on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Hopefully, our transposition of the treaty will serve as encouragement for other states to sign up to and ratify it and accelerate its entry into force.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome this comprehensive Bill, which covers all aspects of the banning of nuclear testing in Ireland.  I compliment the officials involved in drafting the legislation, the purpose of which is to give effect to and transpose into Irish law our obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The treaty was opened for signature in 1999 but, regrettably, it has not come fully into force.</P>
        <P>This debate is an important opportunity to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s support for the full implementation of the treaty.  It will enter into force only when 44 specifically named countries have ratified it.  The countries in question are those the International Atomic Energy Agency deems to have a nuclear capability, whether civilian or military.  Ratification by the key 44 countries will not, however, close off their nuclear capabilities.  It is a mechanism to deter nuclear proliferation.  Ireland, naturally, is not among these countries and our history in regard to nuclear arms must be acknowledged on the international stage.  Ireland has always played, and will continue to play, an important part in promoting the policy of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and the passage of the legislation is another important step in that direction.  Ten years after its opening for signature, the treaty is still, however, in a vulnerable position.   The Minister of State referred to a number of key states, including India, Pakistan and the United States, which must sign and ratify it to enable the treaty to take full legal effect.  The longer the treaty <Col N="639"/>is not ratified by these states, the greater the chance that one of them will resume nuclear testing and that must be a concern for all.</P>
        <P>By prohibiting any nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, the treaty will help to constrain the improvement of nuclear weapons, curb proliferation and advance the disarmament of nuclear weapons.  It has been signed by 176 states and 135 states have ratified it.   The Bill will give effect to the treaty under Irish law, completing our ratification.  The Minister of State referred to the 337 monitoring stations around the globe that will detect nuclear testing and explosions.  It is important they are properly resourced and take account of testing anywhere on the planet.  The legislation requires a state that has signed up to the treaty to prohibit persons anywhere on its territory or in any other place under its jurisdiction from carrying out or participating in the carrying out of a nuclear weapons test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.</P>
        <P>It is important to consider the purpose of the treaty, the challenges to its entry into force and the consequences for national and international security if nuclear testing were to resume.  A nuclear test ban contributes to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology, as well as supporting disarmament.  It also prevents further damage to the environment from the intense heat and radiation of successive nuclear blasts.  History details the horrific harm caused through the inappropriate use of atomic or nuclear energy.  The atomic bombings in August 1945 illustrate the magnitude of harm caused by such explosions.  For example, of Hiroshima&rsquo;s population of 340,000 people, 130,000 were dead by November 1945 and, by 1950, an additional 70,000 had perished, mainly from radiation-related illnesses.  In Nagasaki, 70,000 people were killed outright or died within the first four months and another 70,000 had died by 1950.  Such horrific explosions have significant consequences.  All countries have strived to find a way to deter further use of such horrific bombs.  Any civilised state must learn from this mass destruction of life and  we must continue to remind ourselves of the destructive potential of nuclear weapons to civilisation itself.  Ireland has been a leader in this regard and we must continue to strive to find ways to prevent further use of such weapons.</P>
        <P>A major concern that will continue to exist, despite the adoption of the Bill, is that it will take just one unstable situation in a country with nuclear capabilities to cause a cascade effect and trigger the use of nuclear weaponry, bringing devastation to our planet.  North Korea was a signatory to the treaty but inspectors from the IAEA discovered discrepancies in its position.  Pressure was put on it to comply but, instead, it withdrew from the treaty, which must be a concern.  There is no impediment to leaving the treaty but it also has been argued that a ban on leaving it would impinge on national sovereignty and make it difficult to encourage countries to sign up to it.</P>
        <P>Article 6 of the treaty obliges the states holding nuclear weapons to pursue in good faith measures related to nuclear disarmament and to ending the nuclear arms race.  Since the end of the Cold War, significant progress has been made towards this goal.  For instance, 2,000 warheads from an entire class of weapons have been eliminated under the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty.  The ending of the Cold War has not, however, had the desired effect on reducing the total number of weapons that the political situation would warrant.  A new generation of nuclear weapons is being designed in the US and the United Kingdom and this programme will run to 2020.</P>
        <P>In particular, the 1995 treaty mentioned the five key states with a key role to play in the test ban treaty and contained several commitments in the sphere of disarmament such as making the comprehensive test ban treaty a reality and negotiating a verified ban on the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons use.  Failure to meet these commitments is one of the main reasons the 2005 review conference on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of <Col N="640"/>Nuclear Weapons, NPT, ended without any declaration on this issue, which is also a cause for international concern.</P>
        <P>Since 1996, more than 158 nations, including the US, have signed the nuclear test ban treaty, yet the world has witnessed nuclear and missile tests in India, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea.  Global enactment of the nuclear test ban treaty banning all nuclear test explosions can provide a last line of defence against new advances in weapons development.  Nations can build unsophisticated nuclear weapons without testing but they would be much less likely to do so knowing they could not test.  Without a ban on testing, other weapons states will at some point begin testing again.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The threat of international terrorism must be examined.  Former Soviet republics and others have plutonium and uranium deposits and it is important that Ireland has the resources through the treaty to both monitor and properly resource the agencies to which authority has been given to oversee the implementation of the treaty.  Agencies such as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland have the expertise and it is important the Minister of State ensures its staff has the resources to properly carry out their functions under the treaty.  The Garda also has a role to play, even though this issue is not on its agenda on a daily basis.  International terrorist threats occur and, from time to time, reference is made to an attack, for example, on Sellafield and the serious impact that would have on Ireland.  It is important that we play our part, having signed up to the treaty.  We welcome the Bill, which will enhance and reinforce Ireland&rsquo;s position on total nuclear disarmament while banning the testing of nuclear weapons.  Ireland can, and will, play a role in this regard going forward.  I support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Nuclear Test Ban Bill.  It sets out in detail Ireland&rsquo;s position with regard to nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons.  One need only recall what happened in Chernobyl, among other examples.  Many families in this country have hosted children who come from areas near and even quite far from where that nuclear explosion took place.  I was pleased to host some of those children.  I commend Adie Roche and others like her who have made a career out of helping those people.</P>
        <P>I welcome the common approach to this Bill of all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That unified approach clearly indicates the importance they attach to the legislation.  I am particularly pleased that Ireland has ratified the treaty, as have all EU member states.  That brings into focus the importance of being a member of a group such as the EU.  It infers that in most cases there is unanimity of approach.  In my view, nuclear weapons and the utilisation of nuclear energy generally constitute a death wish.  There are many examples to demonstrate that is the case.  I am pleased Ireland has done its bit by ensuring that the administrative area of the Irish Republic and its shores are free from nuclear testing.</P>
        <P>I agree it is disappointing that a number of countries have yet to ratify the treaty.  The USA, for which I have a great deal of admiration, should take the lead or be a pathfinder in this regard.  One or two of the countries that have not ratified the treaty are causing some concern to the international population.  Everybody knows who they are.  There is provision for 337 monitoring stations.  It is one thing to ratify treaties and to introduce legislation but it is another to monitor and enforce the terms of such agreements, which is most important.  I shudder to think of what could happen if people such as Robert Mugabe, Saddam Hussein or the like had nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>When we consider the reason for bringing forward this Bill, it clearly brings into focus the fact that we are dealing with the preservation of life itself and society.  Given Ireland&rsquo;s anti-<Col N="641"/>nuclear policy and the proactive role taken by this country over the years with regard to nuclear disarmament, it is essential that Ireland has in place, sooner rather than later, the necessary legislation to enforce the treaty&rsquo;s provisions.  This is notwithstanding the fact that entry into force of the treaty is still not likely for some time.  The Minister clearly outlined why that is the case.  The Nuclear Test Ban Bill will give legislative effect in Ireland to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The Bill precisely transposes the treaty into national law, however remote might be the possibility that Ireland would be exposed to such actions.  The rather odd looking provisions arise directly from the treaty and constitute a treaty obligation.  It is therefore a requirement that we transpose the obligations specifically into law.  In the unlikely event that a major offence is committed under the Bill, it would be an indictable offence and the perpetrator would be liable to penalties that include imprisonment for life.</P>
        <P>The Minister has covered all I wish to say about the Bill, and I will not parrot what he said.  I welcome the Bill and thank all parties in both Houses for their unified approach to it.  That is indicative of the Bill&rsquo;s importance.  Their attitude to the Bill shows a great maturity on their part.  I warmly commend the legislation and ask all Members to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The historical background to the Bill has been adequately and appropriately outlined by the two previous speakers.  It is fair to note that since the time of the late Frank Aitken Ireland has played a distinguished and historic role in the banning of nuclear weaponry.  It is something in which we can take considerable pride.  Unfortunately, however, matters have not advanced as much as we would like.  I do not mean my contribution to be just an attack on the United States but given that of the countries that have failed to sign and ratify the treaty it is the country to which Ireland is closest, it is important that we, as friends of the US in general, although in my case not friends of the current regime there, should make known our views.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to put a question to the Minister of State.  I note that there are more than 300 seismic stations to monitor the treaty but Ireland is not included among them.  That is a large number and the stations must be scattered across the globe.  Is there a particular reason for Ireland not being included?  It would be an important role for Ireland.  I would welcome our co-operation in this technical manner and I believe we have the expertise to do it.</P>
        <P>It is easy for Ireland to sign this treaty, so let us not over-estimate the courage of what we are doing.  We are unlikely to start manufacturing nuclear weapons.  It is also highly unlikely that there would be a terrorist threat in this country, although it is always possible.  However, one must be conscious of the proliferation of nuclear technology.  When one considers the countries involved in this issue and the history of the past ten or 20 years, one can identify two sources of worry.  The first is the result of the breakdown of the former Soviet Union.  A great deal of nasty material that disappeared and is unaccounted for might have found its way into the hands of people who are not what one would describe as responsible.  Adequate accounting and monitoring of this material is necessary but that has not yet been done.</P>
        <P>The other issue is that the worst offender is Pakistan.  We do not appear to appreciate that the man who headed that country&rsquo;s nuclear programme opened a type of one-stop-shop in Pakistan whereby he distributed these materials to the most appalling sources, apparently including North Korea.  I welcome the fact that there has been some amelioration in the situation in North Korea and I hope that will continue.  However, it is the last country to announce officially that it conducted a test.  That was in 2006.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the United States has given an undertaking to observe the moratorium.  However, the US is the only country that has employed nuclear weapons in active military engagement.  That gives it a particular moral responsibility and I do not believe it has lived up to that responsibility.  The US has constantly attempted to undermine the International <Col N="642"/>Atomic Energy Agency and its reports.  It sees the nuclear issue as an arm of foreign policy; there is little to do with principle involved.  That a nation refusing to ratify the treaty attempts to use moral arguments against Iran is extraordinary.  I have no great time for Iran and President Ahmadinejad, while occasionally capable of acute analysis, is an unpredictable maverick who must be watched.  However, we must be careful about what is transpiring and I ask the Minister of State to raise this matter at the highest possible levels.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the dying days of the Bush regime.  For example, this morning&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> contains a report regarding a former CIA operative involved in disclosures concerning a number of legal cases he is taking.  His claims are supported by those of others and the track records of the United States and Britain in managing such information.  He maintains that there was a deliberate suppression of findings of the Central Intelligence Agency on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme.  Political interference in and management of information about the precise nature of the perceived nuclear threat in Iran is cause for concern.</P>
        <P>Coupled with this is the fact that the landmark intelligence report presented to the US Houses indicated that Iran had halted work on nuclear weapons design in 2003.  At the time, this man and others were being instructed to falsify reports so that they could be used politically by the Administration.  According to his lawyer:</P>
        <P LI="1">[the] informant provided secret evidence that Tehran had halted its research into designing and building a nuclear weapon.  Yet, when the operative sought to file reports on the findings, his attempts were &ldquo;thwarted by CIA employees&rdquo;, according to court papers.  Later he was told to &ldquo;remove himself from any further handling&rdquo; of the informant, the documents say.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a cause of concern, given that reports published this week and last tell of military exercises involving the Israeli air force and the air forces of member states of the European Union in what Israeli daily newspapers described as a test run for a raid on the Iranian nuclear facility.  As I am not in a position to say whether this is true, will the Minister of State find out?  Such a raid would be extraordinarily dangerous in light of the human, military and political catastrophe in the Middle East that it would unleash.  In terms of environmental damage, one cannot calculate the impact of the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere as a result of this type of cowboy bombing raid.  We must take this issue seriously, particularly when coupled with other situations.</P>
        <P>My nature is to be a friend of the United States and its constitution, something I cannot say of President Bush, and not to be particularly friendly to the regime in Tehran.  However, one must view these matters dispassionately.  Like me, the Minister of State may have noticed the recent development of a slush fund of $400 million granted by Congress to President Bush and his Administration for use in covert operations in Iran for which he is not answerable to Congress.  The committee charged by both American Houses with monitoring and seeking accountability in this respect is supine and has not lived up to its constitutional function.  Since the award of the money, there has been a rash of abductions, kidnappings, bombings and assassinations and the funding of dissident groups within Iran.  Coupled with the fact that President Bush has not ruled out a strike, anyone interested in a nuclear test ban must be concerned by these developments.</P>
        <P>We would all wish for a world free of nuclear weapons.  The more they proliferate, the more dangerous they are and the greater the mathematical possibility of an accident occurring or their falling into the hands of an irresponsible leader.  Regrettably, there are many such leaders on the planet.  When I was a child, I trusted adults because I believed that when one grew up, one gained sense.  This is plainly not always true in political terms and we cannot rely on a <Col N="643"/>number of countries&rsquo; political leadership, particularly those on the list presented by the Minister to State to the House.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take my comments on board and to make representations regarding the situation in Iran.  According to the IAEA and reports of the American intelligence services, it appears that the programme has been halted while remaining within legal boundaries.  The United States has not ratified the treaty, but it seems to be preparing contingency plans for launching an assault against a supposed nuclear facility.  I wish to signal a warning and to ask the Minister of State to make some inquiries as to whether we, as a small country, a friend of the United States and world peace and the historic source of much of the valuable work done on banning nuclear weapons, can exert some degree of pressure on the US so that it will not embark on this dangerous mission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That this legislation is non-contentious in Irish politics has been alluded to in the debate.  A responsible Opposition would not make a call for nuclear tests to occur in Ireland.  In this respect, many Senators will be repetitive in welcoming the legislation.</P>
        <P>Historically, the gestation period between United Nations agreements being reached and legislation being passed has been long.  For example, the test ban treaty in question was adopted by the General Assembly in 1996, but we are only now implementing it in our Statute Book.  It is more than &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; legislation.  Our foreign policy record is a proud one in that the original nuclear non-proliferation treaty was primarily led by our then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken.  We should never lose sight of Ireland&rsquo;s proud role in the debate.</P>
        <P>While no political party or future governmental composition will take Ireland down a nuclear armaments road, the Bill and the test ban treaty in question adopt further measures.  We live in an increasingly unsafe world where people who do not have national affiliations have access to a technology and the ability to act on it.  For this and other reasons a test ban treaty and governing legislation is required.</P>
        <P>Senators referred to the number of countries with access to nuclear armaments, some of which have yet to admit to such.  Israel, which views itself as a regional policeman, particularly in respect of Iran&rsquo;s ambitions, has never formally acknowledged that it is a nuclear power.  However, we are certain that it is given that Mr. Mordechai Vanunu was imprisoned in Israel for revealing many of its nuclear technology secrets.  It is unfortunate that an ostensibly democratic country experiencing regional strife has adopted this degree of subterfuge and abused its citizens by failing to acknowledge its use of nuclear technology.</P>
        <P>Nuclear energy has been a cloak for the nuclear armaments industry.  We should treat with cautioin the nuclear energy industry&rsquo;s promotion of itself as the solution to global warming.  Since the end of the Second World War, nuclear energy was never promoted as a cheaper form of energy; it was always there to refine and provide the raw material for nuclear armaments.  It is no accident that those countries that have large-scale nuclear energy plants are the ones that have nuclear weapons.  It is the reason there are justifiable concerns that the claim by countries such as Iran and North Korea they are producing a programme of nuclear energy technology is simply a cloak for nuclear armament ambitions.  That is why a test ban of this type is especially important.  It is especially true of Iran which can make no argument for promoting nuclear energy as a means of counteracting global warming or in meeting its own energy needs because it is a large-scale producer and exporter of oil.</P>
        <P>The ambivalence and, it is fair to say, hypocrisy of the United States in regard to ratifying this treaty has been already noted but it should be re-stated.  I was born in the United States, my parents having emigrated from this country.  Many Americans are at odds with their government in this policy area.  We debated this issue during the recent Cluster Munitions Bill.  There <Col N="644"/>is a trend to develop armaments, which spew from the general nuclear industry.  The existence and use of the depleted uranium as a weapon of war is one of the more immoral aspects of modern warfare not covered by a Bill of this type but a definite by-product of the nuclear industry.  We should use every opportunity such as the initiative of the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, which has been followed through by the current Minister, Deputy Martin, with the adoption of the cluster bomb treaty, to make similar arguments on the international stage about the use and morality of weapons of this type.</P>
        <P>The biggest fear is the existence of nuclear weapons in countries that have less than stable governments and democracies &mdash; Pakistan is a natural case in point &mdash; or the development, sale and use of technology as an economic tool to, what are defined as, rogue elements.  The CIA in a recent intelligence report to the US Congress said that it is not a question if but now a matter of when a dirty nuclear bomb will explode somewhere on the planet on the basis of rogue elements not associated with any particular affiliation.  That is the dangerous world we live in today.  It is important to have in place a treaty of this type.  It is also important that we contribute to ensuring that it is policed effectively. As a country we have a proud history in this area and have made no attempt to engage in a nuclear armaments role.  The most significant effect we make is to highlight the physical constraints that exist in terms of this technology.</P>
        <P>The other argument made about nuclear energy and its possible saviour role in terms of global warming tends to forget that nuclear technology depends on a raw material that is finite.  The use of uranium and plutonium cannot sustain the running of nuclear energy plants or the production and continued production of nuclear warheads.  On those grounds, there will come a day when this becomes an obsolete technology.  However, that does not address the problem that these armaments are incredibly dangerous.</P>
        <P>There has only been one use of nuclear armaments in the history of mankind with the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Those were atomic bombs which have been replaced by hydrogen bombs.  The effect of the use of current armaments would be much more devastating than atomic bombs.  It is possible to blow up the world by many factors of times that would accomplish that, which shows how ridiculous the arms race and the nuclear armaments element of that has become.</P>
        <P>I wish to address our relations with the United States and the use of weapons.  I was born in the United States and, despite largely disagreeing with its foreign policy, I still identify with it as a friendly nation.  The United States has a policy in terms of its naval vessels, even when visiting on a cordial basis, of refusing to state whether they are carrying nuclear weapons or weapons of the type such as depleted uranium.  It is a matter of courtesy in international relationships and in keeping with the spirit of legislation such as this, that we should require that all invitations for such future visits are contingent on none of those vessels and none of the people connected with them having been associated with nuclear weapons.  Otherwise, we are introducing a degree of hypocrisy and turning a blind eye to policing and to what we seek to insert in this legislation.  If we can get across the message in a friendly, cordial and diplomatic way that these are the standards we want to ensure are met, I would like to think that perhaps not the current US Administration but future Administrations would begin to understand that they way America sees the world is very different from the way countries such as Ireland see it in terms of the use of force and nuclear armaments in particular.</P>
        <P>On those grounds, I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the contributions made by Members in support of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I agree with Senator Boyle that this is not a contentious Bill.  There is agreement for its enactment across the House.</P>
<Col N="645"/>
        <P>I am glad that the Bill has finally being put on the Order Paper.  It gives us a chance to fulfil our obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was signed almost ten years ago.  The Bill is a statement of Ireland&rsquo;s firm stance on the issue of nuclear weapons and their use anywhere in the world. Under the treaty every state will have to ensure that not only does it not carry out any nuclear test, but nowhere in its jurisdiction will tests be allowed.  Every state which ratifies this treaty will also undertake not to participate in any way with the nuclear testing industry.</P>
        <P>This is the 10th treaty controlling the use of weapons of mass destruction since 1963 and, in many ways, it is one of the most promising.  Treaties such as this are a dire necessity following the race in the latter part of the 20th century to develop increasingly more efficient and deadly weapons which ultimately could have destroyed the human race.</P>
        <P>The arms race embarked upon by the USSR, as it was then, and by the United States led to a simple choice between mutually assured destruction, MAD as it was known then, or the elimination of the weapons and banning of nuclear tests.  Therefore, we welcome the introduction of this legislation.</P>
        <P>As of April 2006, 176 countries had signed the treaty but only 132 had ratified it.  Therefore, 44 countries have yet to ratify it.  We have reached a point where even the USA along with Iran have signed the treaty, although they have not yet ratified it.  India, Pakistan and Israel have not even signed it and North Korea withdrew from process.  There is an impasse concerning some of these countries.  Many countries do not want to be pressed by America, which up until now is probably the most experienced tester of nuclear weapons and the only country that has used them to kill people on two occasions in the last century.</P>
        <P>It is possible that if America was to ratify the treaty and make a national law similar to what we are proposing here, that could help to encourage some of the other countries such as Israel, India, Pakistan and perhaps even Iran to do the same.  Senator Boyle referred to Mr. Mordechai Vanunu and the work he did in Israel to expose its nuclear programme.  It was worrying to read recent reports of potential nuclear strikes between Israel and Iran.  That is a matter of great concern.  Intermittently every few years we continue to hear about the potential for war between India and Pakistan.  We are all very aware of the nuclear danger in these regions.  If ratification of the treaty was expanded to include these countries, it would make the world a safer place.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also provides for the setting up of a monitoring commission to be based in Vienna, which will manage monitoring of any tests that may take place.  We are not a member of the nuclear club, therefore we have got nothing to gain or lose on this island from signing the treaty.  However, being a close neighbour of a nuclear power, it assures the world that we will not assist our neighbour in testing such weapons in any way.  Since the first tests were carried out in 1945, more than 2,000 tests have taken place worldwide.  The United States has been responsible for more than half of them.  Among the other tests recorded, the USSR has completed 715 while China has completed 45.  India and Pakistan have been head to head when it comes to showing their teeth, each of whom has tested six times each.  Nuclear testing has also commenced in North Korea in recent years.</P>
        <P>This treaty is a fine example of what we can achieve by working together to avoid nuclear conflict.  Multilateral engagement is always preferable to confrontation, especially when something as deadly as nuclear weapons are involved.  We are setting an excellent symbolic example to the world by taking the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty so seriously.  We can only hope certain other countries take notice of this and follow our lead.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators who contributed to what was a constructive debate.  It is interesting to note that 2008 marks the 12th anniversary of the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  As I mentioned earlier, the treaty will enter into force when the 44 countries named have ratified it.  It is important, given our long-standing position on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, that Ireland has the necessary legislation in place to transpose the treaty.</P>
        <P>The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty will make an important contribution towards preventing the proliferation of materials, technologies and knowledge that can be used for nuclear weapons &mdash; one of the most important challenges facing the world today.  The treaty, through its verification system, will also bring scientific and civil benefits, including, for example, tsunami warning systems and possibly other disaster alert systems, through civil and scientific applications of waveform radio nuclide technologies and the use of the data.  We have many natural disasters but possibly more information now about when they will take place.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Coffey especially for his remarks.  He referred to the great work done by the officials in the Department, to whom I pay tribute.  It is an excellent Bill which required much work.  He mentioned the number of stations around the world for monitoring purposes, the threat of international terrorism and the need for the ban on testing.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn mentioned the Chernobyl disaster.  We are all aware of the dreadful outcome of that explosion.  Throughout Ireland, many towns and small villages still help the people of Chernobyl, especially the children who visit Ireland and stay with Irish families.  He said all EU states have ratified the treaty.  This is a good example of where the countries in Europe are working together.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked why there is no station in Ireland.  The 337 stations are managed and monitored by the treaty organisation and are located in what are deemed to be the best locations in 89 countries.  These stations detect any nuclear explosions.  In Ireland, national stations are located across the island and are constantly monitored by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Any increase in radiation will be noticed and assessed.  There are protocols within the EU and the IAEA to notify a significant change in radiation or any other action that needs to be taken.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris also raised the issue of Iran.  I will ensure my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is made aware of the Senator&rsquo;s contribution on the matter as well as on the military manoeuvres in the Middle East, in particular.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle mentioned the nuclear industry, which I found interesting.  He has much knowledge of that issue.  He welcomed the cluster bomb treaty on which the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Government did much work.  It was finally dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, at an excellent conference in Croke Park recently.  He made the point, and I agree, that countries which have unstable governments are involved in the testing of nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the monitoring commission in Vienna and the issue of US ratification.  It is fair to say the US has announced a moratorium, even if it has not signed or ratified the nuclear test ban treaty.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their positive comments and constructive input into the debate.  I look forward to the Bill being finalised in the Seanad and enacted into law as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>OECD Report on Integrated Public Service Reform: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be in the House today to discuss the OECD review of the public service, Towards an Integrated Public Service.  The public service has served this country exceptionally well.  Those involved deserve a great deal of credit for the peace process, Ireland&rsquo;s successful engagement with the European Union &mdash; even if temporarily disrupted &mdash; and the fantastic economic and social progress of the past 20 years, the miracle being that it was sustained for so long.  The present sharp slowdown in the economy is not a recession, at any rate so far.  Central Statistics Office figures published yesterday showed a 0.8% increase for the first quarter of 2008 in gross national product, which has always been regarded as a truer measure of performance than gross domestic product.  A recession requires two successive falls and there has not even been one fall in GNP.</P>
        <P>There are commentators who would, in a slightly vindictive spirit, attack the public service as the first item in an economic reform programme.  It is salutary to be reminded in the report that general Government employment at 14.6% of the total labour force in 2005 is comparatively low by OECD standards.  One needs to bear that in mind when one hears commentators or groups talk about the immense burden the public service puts on the rest of the economy.  Naturally, we must avail of efficiencies and cost savings where possible.</P>
        <P>The OECD review marks an important step in the ongoing modernisation of the public service.  I say &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;, because modernisation is a continuing process in the public service which dates back at least to the strategic management initiative launched in 1994.  That set the agenda for change in the public service.  The objectives were to ensure on an ongoing basis that the public service would make a greater contribution to national development, be a provider of excellent services to the public, and make effective use of resources.</P>
        <P>The report, Delivering Better Government, published in 1996, gave clear direction to the programme for change and modernisation.  It expanded on the framework set out in the strategic management initiative and outlined an extensive modernisation process for the public service built around key organisational themes, including greater openness and accountability, a mission of quality customer service and the efficient and fair operation of simplified regulations.  During that time our public services have been expanded, improved and reformed.  There have been significant improvements in the areas of financial management, human resources management, regulatory reform, e-Government initiatives, and customer service delivery.  There has been a significant step change not only in the way the public service deals with its customers but also in the manner in which it organises its internal business.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the modernisation agenda has been, and continues to be, driven by various partnership agreements across the public service.  The current partnership agreement, Towards 2016, builds on the progress made under previous agreements and ensures continued co-operation with change and modernisation initiatives as well as improvements in productivity right across the public service.  The agreement provides an important framework for meeting the economic and social challenges ahead and builds on the achievements of previous agreements.  The Government is committed to developing the modernisation agenda through the partnership process, which I always staunchly defended when a Member of this House.</P>
<Col N="648"/>
        <P>No organisation, public or private, can afford to stand still.  While significant progress has been made, many more changes are both awaited and needed.  At a time when the Government had been investing unprecedented levels of resources in public services, problems remained with delivery on the ground and maximising the return on investments.  After a decade of improvement there was a need to take a fresh look at the public service.  That is precisely why the Government asked the OECD to undertake a review.  The review was not an external audit by the OECD of the public service.  Instead, the Government invited the OECD to conduct a comprehensive review of the public service as a whole.  That innovative approach was new not just for Ireland but also for the OECD, which is now moving to replicate the approach in other countries.  That puts Ireland at the leading edge of developments in public service modernisation and creates a model that will be copied elsewhere.</P>
        <P>What the Government wanted the OECD to do was to examine how its priorities and decisions are translated into services and outcomes for citizens and how these processes can be improved.  While much change has already taken place in the way we organise our business, there is a need to ensure delivery on the ground.  The OECD review was intended to highlight what is and is not working and help the Government make better informed choices about where to allocate resources.</P>
        <P>The OECD was given two tasks: first, to benchmark the public service in Ireland against comparable countries and to identify appropriate measures to compare the productivity and effectiveness of the Irish system, or discrete elements of it, against comparable international best practice; and second, to make recommendations on future directions for public service reform which would support the Government&rsquo;s drive for delivery of optimum services to the citizen, within existing resources, and contribute to sustainable national competitive advantage.  Put simply, the Government wanted to know how the decisions it is making at Cabinet are translating into services for the citizen and how the process can be improved.  Where things are not working properly, we need to know.</P>
        <P>The review took place over a period of 16 months and surely must count as one of the most comprehensive reviews of the public service ever undertaken.  It was conducted by the OECD&rsquo;s public governance and territorial development directorate through a multidisciplinary team of OECD staff members and national experts from a number of OECD countries.  The review was overseen by a high level steering group, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, and assisted by a project liaison group which was established to support the OECD&rsquo;s fieldwork.</P>
        <P>As part of the fact-finding phase of the review, the OECD met a large number of key stakeholders and conducted more than 100 interviews with Ministers, Members of the Oireachtas, officials, representatives of the social partners and other stakeholders from relevant interest groups, the private sector and academia.  In addition, there was a major public consultation process involving a media campaign, an invitation to the public, the social partners and other interested parties to make submissions, and a dialogue between the OECD and a representative consultative panel.  More than 930 submissions were received from private individuals and organisations.</P>
        <P>The review acknowledges the central role played by the public service in contributing to an economic success story that many OECD countries would like to emulate.  It states we are on a sound trajectory of modernisation, but we could further improve the yield from reforms by renewing focus on their pace and sequencing in order to make them more mutually reinforcing.</P>
        <P>The review concludes that there is a need for a more integrated public service.  It recommends that there needs to be improved governance and performance dialogue in order to address the <Col N="649"/>current disconnects between the central Civil Service and the broader public service.  Rather than creating new structures, however, it recommends a networked approach to working across existing structures to allow greater connectivity between different sectors.  It emphasises the need to move towards a performance focus, with more information being gathered on outputs, outcomes and what has been achieved.  It acknowledges that in a tighter fiscal environment there is a need for prioritising spending within budget frameworks.</P>
        <P>In an integrated public service it points to the need for increased flexibility for workers.  A senior public service should be created to provide a single, integrated public service leadership cadre, a recommendation about which people may have hesitations and which would need to be very carefully considered.  It also suggests there needs to be a strong leadership role for the centre.</P>
        <P>An overarching theme of the review is the compelling need to adopt a more citizen-centred approach.  There needs to be an increased focus on service delivery over internal reforms and a shift in emphasis from organisational inputs to outcomes for the citizen.  As the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions, the modernisation process needs to deliver results that are clear, useful and verifiable to the user.  We need to put the public at the centre of our public services.</P>
        <P>I welcome the emphasis on a more integrated public service, often described as joined-up Government.  Any objective assessment will conclude that the different elements of the public service &mdash; the Civil Service, local authorities, health and education services and State agencies &mdash; all need to work together better to deliver services to the citizen.  Of course, moves towards a more integrated public service will need to take place on a carefully sequenced basis to ensure that reforms are well founded and incorporate the benefits of initiatives already commenced.</P>
        <P>We also need to reinforce a performance culture by linking performance information with decision-making processes.  Recent developments in annual output statements, and value for money and policy reviews provide a sound basis for progress in this area, but we need to do more.  All public service organisations need to deliver higher productivity in their areas to ensure reform of the public service and quality delivery to citizens.  I support the OECD&rsquo;s call for improved governance arrangements for the public service.  There is a need to take a hard look at the approach to agencies, why and how they are set up, and the proper reporting relationships between agencies and their parent Departments.  This area is central to the next phase of public service modernisation.</P>
        <P>Underpinning all of this there needs to be a greater use of e-Government for the delivery of services.  To this end, the Taoiseach has already announced that responsibility for e-Government will be consolidated in the Department of Finance.  This is in keeping with recommendations from both the OECD and from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on e-Government.</P>
        <P>Much has been made in some quarters about the OECD&rsquo;s comments on decentralisation.  However, decentralisation is not new to the Irish public service.  Previous decentralisation programmes have built up considerable learning within the system, which is being applied to the current programme.  The Government is highly mindful of the impacts that decentralisation could have on the delivery of services to the public, if it is not implemented with due care and attention.  Challenges, such as the turnover of staff, can and are being managed in a way which minimises risk.</P>
        <P>The Government and the decentralisation implementation group have been always aware of the business issues surrounding the relocation programme.  The implementation group recommended to Government back in 2004 that a phased approach be adopted to implementation.  This has had the benefit of allowing sufficient time to put in place the property, business and <Col N="650"/>staffing aspects of the programme, including the intake of staff over a phased period to enable skills transfer and training to take place.  In addition, organisations participating in the programme were asked to prepare detailed implementation plans, including risk mitigation plans.  The implementation group has met individual Secretaries General on a number of occasions and is satisfied with the level of planning in each of the Departments.  That said, the Government will take account of the views and concerns outlined in the OECD&rsquo;s report, and will ensure these are taken into account in implementing the decentralisation programme, and in developing and implementing an action plan for public service reform.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recently announced the establishment of a task force to develop an action plan for the public service.  The task force, which has already met on three occasions, is preparing a comprehensive framework for renewal of the public service which takes account of the analysis and conclusions of the OECD report, as well as the lessons to be drawn from the strategic management initiative, the organisational review programme and the efficiency review process.  It is developing an action plan to guide the implementation of the recommendations set out in the OECD report.  In particular it is examining how best to secure a more integrated public service and the contribution a senior public service could make to a more integrated and cohesive public service.</P>
        <P>There are a number of key stakeholders concerned with the shape of this implementation phase, including, in particular, the public service trade unions.  In carrying out its work the task force will consider how the principle of partnership with public servants and their representatives should be reflected in the course of implementation.  Of course engagement with other stakeholders will also form part of the implementation strategy.  The task force is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and includes four external members as well as the heads of four key sectoral Departments.  It will complete its work by the end of the summer and that work will inform the next phase of the modernisation process.  I look forward to its report.</P>
        <P>Overall the OECD review has many good items to report.  Broadly speaking, we are on the right track.  However, it outlines certain things we could do better.  As that is precisely what we asked the OECD to do, we should be prepared to consider its recommendations.  In  the past decade or so, Ireland has experienced unparalleled levels of economic success and prosperity.  Our economic environment has been transformed through the implementation of appropriate Government policies underpinned by stakeholder participation through the social partnership process.  Our public services have made a major positive contribution to this transformation.  The OECD review has already added greatly to the debate on the continued modernisation of the public service and I am sure it will be cited for years if not decades to come.  As we head into more difficult times the task now facing the public service is to ensure that it remains well placed to continue to contribute to our national development.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have an excellent Civil Service and public service.  We may at times criticise senior management in the public service, for example in the HSE, as well as other aspects of the public service and Civil Service.  However, the greatest problem has been the particularly bad political leadership in the past decade.  It is regrettable that there have been so many lost opportunities as pointed out by many comments in the OECD report.  Benchmarking was supposed to have been a means towards helping to reform the public service and improve how things are done in recent years.  It was an opportunity that was basically wasted at huge cost to the taxpayers now and into the future.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State described decentralisation as a learning process.  Decentralisation as announced in 2003 by the then Minister, Mr. McCreevy, was an absolute disaster and was <Col N="651"/>thought out on the back of a stamp.  It made no sense to the proper running of the Civil Service and public service.  The same people who made a mess of decentralisation, of benchmarking and of reform of the public service are still in control of the process today.  As then Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach was central to the process.  I do not believe the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues have it in them to introduce the necessary reforms requested here.  I believe the senior civil servants are very supportive of these reforms, but they are not getting the political support.</P>
        <P>Some interesting comments have been made on the matter.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said that having 800 agencies was too &ldquo;many by half.&rdquo;  It was the same former Taoiseach along with the present Taoiseach and other Ministers, including Deputies Martin and Cullen, who set up these quangos.  The same people were responsible for many of the problems the OECD review pointed out.  The report contains a very interesting comment which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Agencies vary significantly in size and budget and it is unclear how much public funding they use for their own functioning, for further distribution or for investment.  Neither is it known exactly how many staff they employ.</P>
        <P>The report stated these agencies do not know how many people work for them and for what purpose they are using their budgets.  I thought it was an urban myth when somebody pointed out to me that one of these Government agencies had a budget of &euro;250,000, of which only &euro;40,000 was to be distributed.  It cost &euro;210,000 to run the agency to distribute &euro;40,000.  It remains an urban myth because, as we can clearly see from this report, nobody is quite sure what all these agencies are doing and what is their purpose.  That is a complete failure of the Government over the last ten years to walk the walk about reforming public service along with the senior public and Civil Service personnel, who wanted these reforms carried out.  However, the Government was too busy meddling with matters for purely political reasons.  The decentralisation plan epitomises that sort of interference, making announcements the Government knew would never go anywhere.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach said, &ldquo;It is clear to me, with the fact that resources will not be increasing at the same rate as up to now, that we will have to look at everything&rdquo;.  He is saying, now that we do not have the money we have to stop wasting it.  That is the sort of performance we have had from this Government over the last ten years.  The Minister has done a major discredit to many of the civil and public servants.  Many Government Members try to blame the HSE in the same way and suggest the mess we are in is the responsibility of senior civil servants there rather than the Government.  The Government should publish a report on the sort of reforms it has carried out over the past decade and the sort of change it is talking about.  People can then make a comparison with what great reforms have happened in the last decade.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was much political interference in the establishment of the HSE.  Some units that were established have had four or five different directors over the last four years.  There is such a serious lack of continuity and clear focus on what the Government wants that even new organisations it is establishing are falling apart in a couple of years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is interesting to hear in the news today about what is happening in F&Aacute;S.  Clearly there was an absence of governance in a huge State organisation that was spending &euro;1 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  A recent report showed that IDA Ireland has a huge number of sites that are of no great benefit to anybody.  One has to question what has been happening to taxpayers&rsquo; money over the last number of years and much of that responsibility lies with how the Government and its Ministers do their jobs.  Some of the public sector unions have some responsibility here <Col N="652"/>about which there should be more discussion.  We have been waiting to see reforms in the health service for many years, yet nothing can happen.  Nothing significant has happened.</P>
        <P>It was announced that the Minister was happy to reduce the working hours of nurses from 40 hours per week to 38 if it is budget neutral.  Up to one third of the nurses working in the health services can make the work practice changes to make that happen.  Why cannot we have that sort of initiative?  Why did Government Ministers not work with the public sector unions to make those sort of strategic changes over the last decade?  It is because the Government members are too lazy to do it.  They were too happy spending taxpayers&rsquo; money because they thought this boom would never end.  This Government has been responsible for the failure of reforms.</P>
        <P>I have no great confidence that many of the proposals in this report will be implemented.  Numerous reports have been published from every aspect of the civil and public service but when one requires real backbone from Government politicians one does not get decisive action.  E-Government is an example of that.  E-Government has failed dramatically in this country because no great emphasis was put on it over the last ten years.  It should not be given to the Department of Finance.  It should have its own separate Minister.  We should get rid of half a dozen junior Ministers and have a Minister responsible for e-Government across the services because we need it right.  It should be done immediately.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we get only eight minutes to respond to the Minister.  I will get the usual criticism that I am great to criticise but cannot suggest any solutions.  With only eight minutes to talk it is very difficult to provide a clear debate.  However it is clear, from reading this report and watching what has happened in this country over the last decade, that much of the performance failure and lack of governance has come from the political establishment and that has led to problems in the public and civil service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to make some points on the OECD report on public service reform.  I will begin with the normal rebuttal of Senator Twomey, which is customary between us.  He might have more time to talk about the solutions if he were to begin with them rather than the perpetual moan.  His colleagues in Wexford will not complain about the land bank IDA Ireland held there given this week&rsquo;s announcement of Coca-Cola establishing a facility there.  The decentralisation of Zurich Insurance, formerly Eagle Star, to Wexford is also facilitated with the help of a land bank that was held either by Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.</P>
        <P>I would like us to focus more consistently on tangible solutions and suggestions we might undertake to pass on to our colleagues around the Cabinet table so they can integrate them into their views and plans for the reform of the public service.  Over the years Fianna F&aacute;il in Government has been consistently willing to reform the public service and, contrary to Senator Twomey&rsquo;s view, has always tried to undertake and add in a way that helps to modernise the public service.  As the Taoiseach and his predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, have undertaken to do, there is a need for continued modernisation.  As a result we requested the OECD to prepare the report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The findings of the report are interesting.  The Irish public service is on a sound path to modernisation, as the Minister said, and has &ldquo;played a central role in ensuring that the right economic, regulatory, educational and social conditions are in place to facilitate growth and development&rdquo;.  We are in a changed set of circumstances and I look forward to a debate on the economy next week when we can get into the detail of that.  The banks are being questioned on it by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and perhaps we can debate the report from that committee in due course.</P>
<Col N="653"/>
        <P>General Government employment is relatively low in Ireland among OECD countries.  That might surprise many people.  It is also among the cheapest in terms of the overall cost, given our population.  Only Korea and Mexico are cheaper.  This figure has decreased over the past ten years.  Compared to other OECD countries, Ireland has been able to deliver public services with a relatively small public sector, given the size of the economy and labour force.  That is significant.  While the Irish public service has created structures and systems to ensure co-operation and co-ordination, it, according to the report, &ldquo;remains segmented overall, leading to sub-optimal coherence in policy development, implementation and service delivery&rdquo;.  These are the kind of issues we must take on board.</P>
        <P>According to the OECD report, &ldquo;the major challenge for the public service is to improve service quality through timely, user-focused and integrated public services&rdquo;.  The Minister mentioned many of the key recommendations of the report, but I will focus on some.  One is the focus on citizens and societal goals, which is close to my heart.  According to the report, &ldquo;the Irish public service needs to become more outward focused . . . so that it is best placed to more effectively contribute . . . to the identification and attainment of overall societal goals&rdquo; alongside citizens, business and other actors.  It goes on to state that, &ldquo;In a changing, more complex . . . dynamic and educated society, greater focus needs to be placed by the Irish public service on citizens and their expectations, and on targeting delivery of services from their perspective&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>If the public service is to maximise its contribution to meeting citizens&rsquo; expectations and to achieving broader societal objectives, it needs to think as a more integrated system.  According to the report, &ldquo;achieving an integrated public service will require targeted actions in a number of areas&rdquo;.  The first of these is better communication.  According to the report, &ldquo;Improved dialogue is needed to address fragmentation and disconnects between Departments, their offices and agencies, and other public service actors&rdquo;.  The Minister mentioned this.  We need a better interdepartmental approach, a cross-departmental approach, so communication can improve efficiencies and ensure we are taking the right decisions at the right times, consistent with broader Government policies and policies of other Departments.  I recently attended a meeting involving the Higher Education Authority where a particular situation could not be investigated because it fell under the remit of National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.  The problem of making a connection in this area created a serious difficulty in getting an answer to the question.  One of the major reforms we must undertake is to connect the many boxes that exist within the various Departments throughout our political system as well as to improve dialogue.  A more cross-departmental approach will achieve this.  We need managing for performance rather than performance reporting.  Realistic expectations of performance need to be developed within organisations and additional managerial discretion is also required.  Increased flexibility is needed to achieve these goals.</P>
        <P>On leadership, in terms of achieving our goals, supporting and driving a renewed reform agenda and moving towards a more integrated public service will require significant leadership from senior management who have a detailed understanding of the broad range of issues and challenges unique to the public service.  If new ways of working are to be successfully implemented, a strong central leadership role is required.</P>
        <P>In terms of the concept of a senior public service, the development on a phased basis of a single, integrated public service leadership with a membership drawn from elements of the broader public service is an interesting concept and perhaps would allow Ireland to strengthen a system-wide perspective at the leadership level and reinforce and develop skill sets among the senior cohort of the public service as well as deepen coherence within the system.</P>
        <P>Membership of the senior public service should not be limited to the Civil Service so as to have a broader perspective on the public service as a whole.  I do not propose that this should <Col N="654"/>be a whole new set that would require a ridiculous increase in the level of resources.  We should do it from existing budgets through a reorganisation plan.  Obviously, this will have to be negotiated with the various unions but it is a good concept and one that could be achieved.  I am not suggesting we would create another echelon of new staff which would seriously contribute to additional expense.  We want to get away from that.</P>
        <P>With regard to managing agencies, a performance dialogue between Departments and agencies is needed, as alluded to by Senator Twomey.  This would entail a process of setting different types of targets and evaluations and making links between inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes.</P>
        <P>In terms of the general Government response, the Taoiseach set up the task force on the public service, half the membership of which came from the private sector and half from the Secretaries General of various Departments, under the chairmanship of Dermot McCarthy, Secretary General to the Government, whose reputation and experience speaks for itself.  The terms of reference given to the task force for consideration were for a comprehensive framework for renewal of the public service and it will report towards the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>There is broad cross-departmental and cross-party support for reform of the public service.  We can all be justifiably proud of the work our public service and Civil Service have done in the past decades.  However, it is time for reform and improvements in efficiency.  This will require leadership across the board, not just from the political establishment but also from within the Civil Service and public service.  I very much hope that, through negotiation, we can achieve the optimum results which would take this country forward in a way the existing Civil Service has done so successfully in the decades of the past.</P>
        <P>I look forward with interest to the report of the task force which is expected before the end of the summer.  I hope we can all get behind the action plan it comes up with, put our shoulders to the wheel and move forward in the interest of a more streamlined, efficient public service which will be best placed to continue in the way it has over many decades.  While it was a great system which served us well, we need a newer, more effective system based on the OECD report and the action plan which we expect from the task force in due course.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and the Leader for facilitating a debate on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my fellow county man, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and I welcome the chance to comment on the report on public service reform.  We could talk for ever on this issue which has been raised many times in the House.  For the record, the public service has contributed significantly to the development of our country and its economy.  I am not one of those who, now the economy is on the slip, are interested in buzz words and the frenzied attack which claims we need public service reform left, right and centre.  Of course we need reform but we need to consider it in a rational way.</P>
        <P>I intend to raise five or six of the areas we need to address.  As one who came to the Seanad having worked for almost nine years in the public service, I might have some insider knowledge from which the Minister of State could benefit.  Changes in the public service have been too inward looking and not external enough.  Reviews to date have tended to be about &mdash; here are the buzz words &mdash; internal processes, improving service delivery, organisational development, individual performance management, risk and governance procedures and trying to increase transparency, even if the latter is more about theory than practice because transparency is not increasing.</P>
        <P>This is not enough, however.  We need to consider the public service in a broader way. We need to consider managing goals better as well as improving project targets and how plans are implemented.  We also need to consider how we can achieve better performance across agencies <Col N="655"/>and Departments, which is a core issue I want to address as it is a fundamental problem.  There are too many silos in the public service, which is one of the biggest issues relating to lack of efficiency.</P>
        <P>We need a networked approach to working in the public service.  When we consider this issue on a macro level, there are three areas in the public service: the Civil Service, the commercial semi-States and the non-commercial semi-States.  These are three very different types of organisation, a point that needs to be understood because it is where much of the problem we face lies.  We have allowed these three silos to develop independently and, to progress, we need to bring them closer together while keeping their positive components and ditching the rest.  To use a phrase, we need to use the Kilmeaden cheese approach &mdash; take the best and get rid of the rest.</P>
        <P>We need to improve governance and performance and we need a Civil Service working more closely with the public service.  Dare I say it, there needs to be change on the Civil Service side in particular with regard to the manner and tone with which it deals with the public service.  The relationship needs to be one of partnership but there is currently a sense of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo;.  I know this is the reality as I have been in that position and, although some will say it is not the case, it is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The public service, semi-States in particular, should not be seen to be below the Civil Service or be afraid to report to it.  That day and age is gone and the system needs to be more partnership led.  We need a structure that allows for the Civil Service and Departments to have goals and outputs that are measured in such a way that they are in some way bound into supporting the semi-State organisations.  The reporting should go both ways and not simply in one direction.  Anything going in one direction tends to increase a silo and create circumstances that will not work to mutual benefit.</P>
        <P>A classic example in this regard is the rural transport scheme.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs approached the Department of Health and Children to get the Health Service Executive to consider dealing with local area transport managers to bring people for medical appointments in clinics.  When the two Departments came together, one saw a way of dumping some of its costs on the other, so nothing happened.  That is just one example but we need a better way of dealing with cross-sectional agencies and projects because there is a lack of joined-up thinking across these.</P>
        <P>Another example is that many agencies simply cannot work properly unless they get support across agencies and Departments.  I worked for F&aacute;ilte Ireland for nine years.  It is totally dependent on five or six Departments, not just the Department of Finance but also the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Transport and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  If it cannot get the buy-in from these Departments, it cannot execute its projects.  In many cases, it simply does not get the buy-in.</P>
        <P>We need to break down internally focused goals where the larger picture is not being seen.  The Committee of Public Accounts investigates spending but we need to ensure the focus is not just on overspending and budgets but also on the reasons for the lack of joined-up thinking and missed opportunities.  In many cases, these are not highlighted enough because people do not have the vision to see them.  We need to develop networks so people work together on projects rather than within silos in their own Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>On recruitment, as a Labour Party representative I know we need increased flexibility in this area.  I do not have an issue with this as long as workers&rsquo; rights are protected.  More to the point, we need to ensure career paths are drawn and people are not allowed to slip into a silo, which happens too often.  There is a sense within certain Departments in the Civil Service, and it is probably a bigger issue in certain semi-States, that a staff member must serve his or her time.  When I was made a permanent employee in F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I was the youngest male <Col N="656"/>permanent employee.  Eight years later, I was still the youngest male permanent employee.  That simply is not good enough.  Such situations are what drives good people out of the public service and into the private sector and one cannot blame people for that.</P>
        <P>If the problems are to be dealt with, we must employ specialists.  This is a significant issue, given the costs that arise because we do not have specialists employed in the public service and must hire consultants in many areas.  We see from the disastrous decentralisation programme that in order to create fluidity between the public service and the Civil Service, we must examine the issue of transferability, particularly with regard to pension entitlements.  Staff in a number of semi-State organisations have not applied to decentralise because they cannot transfer their pension entitlements.  This issue has not yet been addressed.</P>
        <P>While performance management is a very good initiative, in reality it is a failure because it has not been applied from the top down.  I urge the Minister of State to ascertain whether performance management procedures, which have been put in place for workers, are also in place for the chief executives and senior managers of the various semi-State organisations.  He will find that they are not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">E-Government has not been treated in the correct manner.  Measures to date amount to tokenism.  I know what I am talking about because I was e-Government person of the year in 2006.  If one shows a little initiative, one will get support.  However, in many cases we do not have people in the various organisations who have been promoted to a level which would ensure projects are completed.  The e-Government process has been tokenism to a large degree.</P>
        <P>The issue of leadership is critical in this debate.  The best way to promote and change the public service and to achieve greater efficiencies is to show strong leadership.  The Taoiseach had an opportunity on coming into office to show such leadership but unfortunately &mdash; although fortunately for the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh &mdash; he did not take it.  He maintained the offices of 35 Ministers and Ministers of State.  He could have shown leadership on the matter but refused to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The undertaking and publishing of an OECD report into public service reform is a very useful starting point for an important and necessary debate on the quality of Irish public service and the way forward.  The report indicates that Irish public servants are persons of ability and commitment who, in the main, operate effectively.  However, there are systemic faults within the public service that must be corrected.  Such faults can be corrected only with an appropriate amount of political will and through what has been a highly effective social partnership system.  </P>
        <P>In addressing the issue of reform, we must deal with fundamental questions, one of which is whether the public service in Ireland is of an appropriate size.  We do not have good templates surrounding us, given that the public sector in Northern Ireland accounts for 40% of the workforce, which is possibly an unreal comparison.  An effective economy must have a proper balance between the private and public sectors, in the areas in which they are separate as well as the areas in which they interact.  It is clear that we remain in a process of evolution in that regard.</P>
        <P>Historically, the public sector represented a large proportion of our workforce, mainly because important infrastructural developments were not advanced by any bodies other than the State.  There was an unwillingness, either through a lack of initiative or a reluctance to provide capital investment to bring about that initiative, in the private sector to do so.  The early development of this State was largely brought about through an active public sector and a very inert private sector.  That the Irish economy began to shed its agrarian past only in the <Col N="657"/>1960s meant we had a lot of catching up to do in terms of the lack of enterprise and entrepreneurialism in the Irish psyche.</P>
        <P>That said, we still need an appropriate balance in terms of the numbers.  I would accept that the number of people involved in the Irish public sector is probably too large but it is also the case that there are significant shortages in certain areas.  We lack people of specialisms throughout the public service to provide the most effective performance.  We must examine the areas where there is an over abundance of staff and consider retraining and redeploying them to fill in the gaps in the public service.</P>
        <P>Political debate continues as to where we locate public servants and how we allow them to operate to ensure the public service operates to its maximum potential.  I accept this is a legitimate debate but I do not intend to go into the issues in depth now.  I will say, however, that the extent to which we do not hinder the public service by making unnecessary changes to location over short time periods and allow staff to focus on the job of work at hand, the more effective the public sector will be.  Those criticisms are expressed clearly in the OECD report.</P>
        <P>It would be to our benefit as a society and an economy if we managed to increase the level of interchangeability between the public and private sectors.  The fact that many people spend all of their careers within the public sector and sometimes even within a narrow sector of the public service means we cannot use the full potential of such individuals, nor does it allow those individuals to be fully rounded in their ability to offer public service.  There should be more people in the public service taking work experience breaks in the private sector, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Given the criticism that some in the private sector make of the public service being an inherently bad thing, we might benefit from people from the private sector acting within the public service, thus getting a better sense of a model that is more about service to the public and less about profit making.  That interchangeability does not exist in our system at present.</P>
        <P>The OECD has indicated some fundamental reforms that must take place.  In the current climate, in terms of the public resources available and how they will be allocated, a political debate might emerge regarding whether these are the best circumstances in which to implement many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations but I would argue that it probably is the best time.  However, it must be done with great sensitivity and in the sense of partnership that has characterised all of the social partnership deals to date.  It also must be recognised that the aim of reform is to bring about a better service and it should not be just a number cutting or budget pruning exercise.</P>
        <P>We are talking here about people who provide vital services in our society.  Such people cannot and must not be discarded in any way.  The reform process is about finding the best use for their talents and abilities in order to meet the needs of the public service.  Perhaps marrying public service reform with some of the commitment that already exists to delivering public services throughout our society that are not even properly economically recognised &mdash; for example, some of the ideas of the task force on active citizenship &mdash;  would yield a public service that would suit this country in the 21st century.</P>

	<P>In preparing for today&rsquo;s debate, I came across a very appropriate quote from one of the pioneers of our public service, Mr. T.K. Whitaker, who stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The day-to-day decisions of government, no less than those of individuals, tend too often to respond to the pressures, the needs, the provocations and the opportunities of the moment. Good management demands the longer view.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In this debate and the report from the OECD, what we are clearly seeing is the longer view, in terms of the challenges that face our economy and society and the need for our public <Col N="658"/>services to respond to those challenges.  In examining how the public service responds, we must recognise and emphasise the wonderful contribution our public services have made in dealing with so many pressing needs and challenges faced by the country, from our engagement with the European Union, to Northern Ireland, to the status and recent success of our economy.  However, the report does not believe there is a need to review the structures of our public service, rather it believes there is a need to review the culture of our public service.  I am not sure how in recognising the significant challenges we are facing, we can get to a point where we can review our culture in the delivery of those public services without first looking at the way they are delivered and the structures in which they delivered.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate for us to pause and reflect on the kind of challenges faced by the public service and our economy and society.  There are three that are most appropriate for the discussion in which we are engaged.  The first is what is happening with our economy.  Over the past ten years, we have seen our economy grow on average by about 7.5% per year.  The OECD report acknowledges that for the next 20 to 30 years, we are likely to see economic growth of around 3.5%.</P>
        <P>The second point is what will happen to the countries against which we have needed to be competitive and perform in the past.  Many of those peer countries will change.  The centre of economic gravity will move east.  The countries that will decide what the benchmark is in terms of competitiveness and how societies are performing are more than likely to be the Indias, Chinas and Russias of the world.  This will pose huge challenges in respect of how a small open economy like ours performs.</P>
        <P>The final point relates to the role of technology and globalisation given that so many of those influences are coming together to create a rights-based culture in respect of how people interact with public services and to create profoundly different expectations on the part of people in terms of the information to which they believe they are entitled about how their public services perform and the standard which they expect those public services to attain and deliver for them.</P>
        <P>I am critical in that I do not get a sense that this report recognises the breadth of those challenges and the fact that in our future, we will need superb public services more than in the past.  The statistics on the economy that appeared earlier in the week showed that many of the public sector parts of our economy were leading the overall economy in terms of output and economic development.  We will need that performance more than we ever have in the past.  At the same time, our ability to pay for it and our economy&rsquo;s ability to sustain it will perhaps be challenged more than at any point in the past.  There is a real pincer movement, to use an unfortunate phrase.</P>
        <P>I am concerned because I do not get a sense of urgency or vision from this report about what we as politicians will do and what the public services will do to respond to this profound challenge.  The report talks about an integrated public service that acts increasingly through networks rather than top-down structures, greater staff training and mobility, the quality of performance indicators and information, and the need to for them to be improved.  I had a real sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> in that we have said these things before.  My question is whether those recommendations are strong enough and radical enough to respond to the kind of challenges we as a small open economy will face in a globalised world and economic environment that is changing very quickly.</P>
        <P>There is an omission in this report in that it does not place sufficient focus on the need for the individual using these services to have choice about the services they use and information about the quality of performance they receive.  It says additional consideration should be given <Col N="659"/>to the development of both quantitative and qualitative performance indicators that are comprehensible to the citizens and that reflect societal goals.  That is the only reference I could find to the need to empower individuals in the services they are performing.  This report is good and merits discussion but my point is whether it goes far enough in helping us rise to the kind of challenges we face because we have risen to those in the past and our public service has been instrumental in allowing us to do so.</P>

	<P>I again welcome the Minister of State to the House and am pleased to welcome the OECD report on integrated public service reform.  It gives us an opportunity to remind ourselves of the role the public service has played in Ireland&rsquo;s development.  We have one of the finest public services anywhere.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It was only in the 1960s when Dr. T. K. Whitaker and Se&aacute;n Lemass began a process of developing the economy of this country.  Prior to that, we had a public service that provided services for the nation that the private sector was not in a position to provide.  I am thinking of services such as the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company and Bord na M&oacute;na, which supplied our energy needs, especially during war years.  I am conscious that the Land Commission was necessary to redistribute land during the founding years of the State.  This took place across so many facets of Irish life that we now take for granted, many of which have subsequently been privatised.  These include Telecom &Eacute;ireann, which is now Eircom, and other State-provided boards such as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which was an example to so many others throughout the world.  Other examples include the IDA and Forf&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>We have a public service that brought the nation along with an integrated plan for development.  It is a very well-educated and highly regarded service which is somewhat on the French model where it is rightly seen as a great public service.  We should also remember the great work done by the Institute of Public Administration in providing education.  As a graduate of that institution, I can say how very well-organised, committed and focused it is.  I welcome the OECD review.  Not surprisingly, this review shows that we have one of the most cost-effective public services.  Of the OECD nations, we have the third lowest cost for our public service which again must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>We are in the midst of changing with decentralisation.  This decentralisation is to be welcomed because it is bringing into the provinces many of the services of the State which can, through better communications facilities, be just as easily undertaken in rural areas.  As a student of this particular aspect of public service, I am conscious there is a timescale involved, primarily because one wants to allow people in the public service time to stream.  I am conscious of the French model where over ten years it was decided that if a department was going to Lyon, which may not have suited everybody in the department, they were given sufficient time over a ten-year period to stream into that area or department that was going to where they wished to go.  Of course, decentralisation was handled very well.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the OECD review was to benchmark the public service in Ireland against comparable countries and make recommendations regarding future directions for public service reform.  There was a particular emphasis on how the various parts of the public service relate to each other, including the Civil Service and particular sectors such as local government, health, education and justice.</P>
      
        <P>The review was undertaken by the OECD&rsquo;s public governance and territorial development directorate.  In addition to the core OECD team, national experts from other OECD countries have been involved as peer reviewers.  The OECD, which is based in Paris, was established in 1961, with Ireland as one of its 20 founding members.  It is an international organisation with 30 full members which promotes dialogue and the exchange of good practices in public and <Col N="660"/>corporate governance issues, including issues relating to the economy, policy making, human resource management, ethics and information technology.  Much of the OECD work is based on peer review and dialogue.  It has extensive databases and access to key policy makers throughout its network of committees and working parties.</P>
        <P>The OECD is a reputable organisation.  We are proud founding members of it.  The findings of the 375 page report are that general Government employment is relatively low compared to other OECD countries.  Ireland has the third lowest public expenditure as a percentage of GDP.  We have low cost and low employment, yet we have excellent results and service.</P>
        <P>We need to enable co-operation and co-ordination to ensure there is no disconnect between the Civil Service and the broader public service.  The OECD recommends that the public service think more as an integrated system.  We can only welcome this, which is not a criticism but a recommendation.  I would happily take on board this recommendation.  There are many aspects of e-Government that have yet to be rolled out.  The public service will continue to play its leading and proud role.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I was fortunate to be in Dublin Castle at the launch of the OECD report on the integration of the public service.  Having experience over 40 years in both the public and private sector, I am in a position to comment on it.  There are as many clever people in the public sector as there are in the private sector but the management standards in many places in the public sector are not adequate to deliver the service.</P>
        <P>The core of this report is that we need a more integrated public service and that the public services should be citizen oriented.  The principal of a school and the Secretary General of a Department must act as if they were the chief executive of a private company.  Speaking of my experience working 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 16 years, unless a company has nous, and looks after its customers, it will not survive.  A public company survives because it has first-class management systems.  Many improvements have been made in the 20 years since I left the public sector.</P>
        <P>Management is the most difficult science in the world.  If a person is taken on, the job should be explained and performance evaluated.  The boss must spell out if the person is doing the job right or not.  If this did not happen in a private company it would disappear.  Many of our problems in delivering public services are due to the lack of good management.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm stated recently that the day must come when Irish people have the courage to demand better public services in the health sector.  They forget they pay for the public service.  It is taxpayers&rsquo; money that pays for the service.  They must become more self-confident and demand a better service.  They should demand that the treatments for our citizens are as good as those for citizens of other countries.  If we find that cardiac arrests here are higher than in Nordic countries or another OECD country, we must demand that our standards of cardiac treatment be improved to reach that standard.  Our patients in the public health service should not be patient with long waiting lists.  Even with private consultants, to whom one pays big money, one might have to wait one hour in a waiting room before seeing the consultant.  The citizen must be empowered to demand an excellent service from the public service, for which the citizen pays.</P>
        <P>There are at least 360,000 people working in the public sector in Ireland.  It is responsible for one in three euros spent in the Irish economy.  It sets the policy environment for economic and social development and provides a wide range of essential services.  We must take note of <Col N="661"/>the OECD report.  The number one change is that we must get metrics to evaluate the service provided by the different Departments.</P>
        <P>To be a good manager, one must be a leader.  People in key positions in the public sector are afraid to be bold leaders.  In contrast, one must be a bold leader in the private sector or one is gone.  There must be a mechanism to allow people with leadership skills in the public sector to come forward and take risks without fear of losing promotion opportunities if they make mistakes.  If one is a bold leader, everything one does will not be right.  If we do not make this change in the public sector and this generation does not get this right, the taxpayer will get very bad value for money.</P>
        <P>Those in the public sector are not less clever than those in the private sector.  There should be free movement from the private sector to the public sector and <i>vice versa</i>, giving a cross-fertilisation of skills and innovation.  For any good business or policy to survive, it must innovate.  We must have innovation in the public sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment.  I requested yesterday that he come to the House but I did not expect to see him so quickly.  I will not, however, raise the matter I raised yesterday.</P>
        <P>The OECD report is vital to the current position of the economic cycle.  As Senator White stated, the public service is enormous and responsible for a huge budget, and we must get it right.  A good public service is critical to our economic survival.  It is timely to undertake such an assessment.  The report is, by and large, positive reading.  This is to be expected because the public service was set up to perform a particular duty and it did so exceedingly well, particularly in the 1950s when various public bodies were established.  The mark of a good public service is its ability to adapt and, by and large, it has adapted well.</P>
        <P>The public service has expanded by 30% in five years.  This has caused a certain amount of alarm.  When we had the money we needed the capacity which came with it.  At present, we need to examine reform and how we can get the best out of the public service.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers alluded to a synergy between the public and private sectors, which is a good way to innovate reform.  Senator Mary White referred to it.  We need an ability within our public service for public servants to move from the public to the private sector.  It would be to our mutual benefit that this is the case.  The public service would benefit from many practices in the private sector.  If we had a better synergy between the two sectors it would improve the performance of our public sector.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak in detail about motivating performance in those involved in the public sector.  The report states that Ireland is at a stage of performance reporting rather than managing performance.  It states, &ldquo;There is a need to develop a performance culture that is based on achieving outputs and outcomes rather than compliance with processes&rdquo;.  This is the essence of what our focus should be.  We need a dynamic public service where risk, achievement and innovation are rewarded.  I fear this is part of the problem we inherited in an overbureaucratic public service and it is where we need to focus our efforts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From speaking to public servants I know that a sense of drowning in a deep bureaucracy is demotivating and will never deliver the results we need.  Reform of the public service is one of largest challenges we face, particularly in terms of the pay talks and agreements, and it is vital that we get it.  We need to be able to reward innovation on the part of public servants.  To attract people from the private sector to the public sector we must ensure that payscales are appropriate.  We may not have performed very well in this area in the past.</P>
        <P>The other side of the equation is that those in the public service have great security and enjoy great benefits.  This is why people in the private sector look at public sector workers with <Col N="662"/>a certain level of resentment.  This is where tension can exist.  If people were able to work in both sectors, these misunderstandings might go.</P>
        <P>Reform of the public sector is its single greatest protection.  We do not need greater bureaucracy.  We need a public service which is motivated, paid appropriately and has an enthusiasm for innovation, which is celebrated and rewarded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Malley for taking the Chair.  I had not intended to speak on this motion but I heard her contribution and that of the previous speaker and now wish to state a few words on public service reform.  I must concede to the Minister of State that I am not an expert on the report.  However, we have had discourse on public service reform and pay during recent months and we all have a passing knowledge on it.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the outstanding service and performance of the Irish public service since the foundation of the State.  Many problems have yet to be addressed and we face many challenges.  However, looking at the history of the Republic of Ireland during the past number of decades, we have made great progress.  Much of this is due to the fine public servants working for Departments, State agencies, local authorities and many other projects throughout the country.</P>
        <P>We will always have a need for change, reform, fresh thinking and new approaches and we should focus on this.  If there is any difficulty with regard to our public service, and we must acknowledge that we are all public servants, perhaps it is that it does not have the flexibility it needs to face the challenges ahead.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the decentralisation programme?  We can see the difficulties in trying to put in place a scheme which is desirable and worthwhile and which will be good for the country economically and socially.  Our difficulty in progressing such schemes illustrates blockages and a lack of flexibility and, perhaps, work practices which are outdated and need to be challenged and changed.</P>
        <P>The other immediate issue facing the Government and the body politic is public service pay.  This is part of the reform package as are the questions of productivity, bonuses and performance related incentives.  We need fresh thinking in this area.  The public sector unions have been clear and strong in defence of their staff during recent weeks, pointing out that there can be no pay restraint or reductions.  We must acknowledge that in the new economic climate we face, all sectors will have an obligation to respond, starting in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must recognise that while the public sector and public servants have legitimate requirements and demands and will make a case for further wage increases, on the other side of the equation are certain advantages to working in the public service from the point of view of security of employment and pensions which must be considered in the overall balance.  If, over the course of the next twelve or 18 months or two years, restraint is required and, let us be honest, the Government must put in place some degree of control of public expenditure.  We must be realistic from a political point of view and the public sector and public service unions must also be realistic.</P>
        <P>This is a challenge which I acknowledge will be difficult for the Government to face but it must be faced.  We must work as much as possible with the hundreds of thousands of people in the public sector, acknowledge the great strides and progress made but also respond to the fact that we are in a new Ireland and Europe in a modern world where new challenges are emerging.  We will not solve all of the old questions with the same answers as we may have done five or ten years ago.  This is why flexibility and a more modern approach to our public sector is required.  I hope the Minister of State and his Government colleagues will be able to respond to this report and put in place some of the practices recommended.</P>
<Col N="663"/>
        <P>Often, we discuss shortcomings in the health service.  However, more than 100,000 people work in this sector.  We must ask ourselves whether we receive value for money and whether we could do things better.  This also applies to many Departments.  The public service budget as well as the Government&rsquo;s budget all comes back to the taxpayer who pays the bill at the end of the day and, therefore, we must always demand value for money.</P>
        <P>Those are a few brief, inadequate comments and I apologise for my lack of preparation.  This issue will require much debate, attention and reflection over the next few months and years.  New challenges lie ahead and we need to work with the public sector to address them.  We will also need the public sector to work with us and to be realistic in facing these challenges.  It should acknowledge things cannot be as they always were and we will have to do things differently in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  Thinking back on my own time as a Member, I miss the pronounced views on these subjects one often hears from the Independent benches.</P>
        <P>The only politicised contribution was made by Senator Twomey.  We have had excellent political leadership over the past decade, especially on the economy.  The past 20 years have been miraculous and, inevitably, a positive cycle will not continue forever but it has put us on an entirely new plane.  Benchmarking was vastly superior to the special pay claims systems that existed previously.  From time to time, agencies are created and then rationalised.  Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s father rationalised agencies 20 years ago.  Many large towns live in hope and their chances are better if they have IDA sites.  Inevitably, they will not all be filled and that is not necessarily a criticism.  They should not be provided for excessively but they are necessary.</P>
        <P>It was stated there were no reforms of the health service.  What was the establishment of the Health Service Executive?  One might have mixed views on the outcome and Senator MacSharry made an important remark about management for performance rather than performance reporting.  I would be concerned if the aim of the public service was merely to satisfy certain bureaucratic criteria rather than service improvements on the ground.</P>
        <P>I am interested in Senator Kelly&rsquo;s experience in F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Many Members of the Houses, including myself, have spent time in the public service.  I refer to the comment that semi-State bodies are below the Civil Service.  When I was dealing with energy issues, I was never under the impression that the ESB was below the Department of Energy and I doubt Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s father was either.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle that the social partnership system has been highly effective and I also agree about the need for more mobility and interoperability.  Senator Donohoe correctly stated the OECD report presented the longer view and, like many good OECD reports over the past 40 years, it will be referred to for a long time to come.  I also concur with him that many of our benchmarks will be outside the country.</P>
        <P>I join in Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s tribute to the public service and I agree with his reference to France and giving people time to stream.  I also endorse his praise of the OECD.  I attended an OECD ministerial meeting a few weeks ago but, as a public servant in the 1970s, I attended such meetings and the organisation is an enormous resource for western democratic governments.  While it does not take decisions, it provides peer reviews and discusses issues and common approaches.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments about the calibre of people in the public as well as the private sector.  She stated people should be encouraged to take risks and make mistakes and I concur up to a point.  However, Irish Shipping was sunk by two executives who took speculative risks and put the company in an impossible position.</P>
<Col N="664"/>
        <P>Senator Bradford rightly praised the social partnership system and we all hope the current talks will come to fruition.  It is important that, in the current challenging climate, that be the case.  In an address to IBEC on 25 June the Taoiseach stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">A new deal on pay and related issues would provide much needed stability and reassurance at this time.  It would convey a strong sense of confidence domestically and internationally by showing that we are prepared to work together to safeguard the economy and our competitiveness as well as the interests of workers and the more vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I also agree with his criticism, which has been made by many heads of government across Europe, that it is all very well for organisations to call for pay restraint and moderation but, as he stated, &ldquo;It is clear that the headline rate of pay increases for top level executives in the private sector has not been aligned with this general message and this is a source of concern.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>At its heart, public service modernisation is about delivering excellent public services and improving the service provided to citizens at all levels in the most efficient and cost effective way.  It requires good structures and business processes and it also requires that the quality of service delivery to the citizen is central to the work of public servants at all levels.  We have come a long way in delivering on this agenda and this is recognised by the OECD but we also recognise there is much more to do.  Public service is predominantly a people business run by people for people and I want to be clear about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to our public services.  We want a public service fit for purpose of which the public and our public servants can be proud.</P>
        <P>According to the OECD, the public service and, in particular, the Civil Service are doing more with less relative to the size of the overall economy and workforce and this has been a factor in Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness.  I once served in the Department of Foreign Affairs and relatively small embassies do for this country what larger embassies do for bigger countries.  The OECD recommends not only improved governance but also performance dialogue for increased sharing of information and expertise and shared agreement on performance targets to hold each party accountable for the realisation of such targets.  That must be a real and not an artificial process, otherwise pursuit of targets becomes an end in itself.  One can think of other countries where it has been alleged figures have been massaged to meet targets and we do not want to get into that.</P>
        <P>The OECD recognises that instead of focusing on outputs and processes, more information must be gathered on outcomes and what has actually been achieved, as this can better assist in measuring how the public service is meeting overarching targets and objectives.  The terms of reference for the task force refer to an appropriate framework for reviewing the establishment, operation and governance of State agencies.  As already indicated, this area will be important to the next phase of public service modernisation.</P>
        <P>With regard to decentralisation, which is of interest to many Members of both Houses, almost 2,200 posts have been relocated to date.  Decentralising organisations have now established a presence in 34 locations around the country and over 11,000 civil and public servants have applied on the central applications form to decentralise.  I receive representations and correspondence from individuals on this almost every day.  I dare say many other public representatives receive similar communications.</P>
        <P>It is clear that public service reform has increased importance, particularly in the current economic climate.  We will be looking to the public service, in conjunction with political and Government responsibility and the co-operation of all other sectors of society, to help us to <Col N="665"/>steer through the current difficult phase in the hope that we can hold onto and consolidate many of the gains that have been made and retreat as little as possible.</P>
        <P>This is a valuable report that will be carefully studied, as is the case with all such reports.  It is not a bible so not every recommendation is necessarily perfectly adapted to our culture and circumstances, but it is certainly a resource from which ideas and inspiration can be drawn so we can improve our performance.  I will finish as I started by expressing my high regard for the public service and the contribution it makes, and will continue to make, to Irish society.</P>
        <P>With regard to a point made by Senator O&rsquo;Malley, I have looked at the figures for the public sector.  The figures for the Civil Service are different.  The growth in the public sector in the past five years has been 7%.  It is not a large expansion of the public service.  Certain sectors have grown but others have contracted in compensation for that.  We have a reasonably lean public service but we must get maximum value for money from it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for contributing to this useful debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The value of a report such as this is that it provides hard figures which one can discuss and from which one can make evaluations.  In his contribution Senator Hanafin said that the figures indicate we have a fairly lean public service, while Senator O&rsquo;Malley inferred something quite different in her contribution when she referred to the perceived over-manning and bureaucratic structure in the public service.  Evaluating the size of our public sector against that of other countries only becomes valid when one considers the type of country we have.  The population of our country is predominantly young and growing, which is very different from the situation in France or Germany.  One could expect, therefore, that our public service would be smaller at this stage in our demographic development than the public sectors of those countries.  However, that is not the case.</P>
        <P>The core issue I tried to raise in my contribution is the fact that the need for a well funded and excellently delivering public service will be greater in the next ten or 15 years than in the past but our ability to pay for that public service will be under more pressure than it has been in the past.  As a Minister of State in the Department of Finance and somebody who is aware of the discussions taking place, what is the Deputy Mansergh&rsquo;s thinking on how we will rise to that challenge?  What will be the contribution of the Government, in light of this report and the discussions taking place, to squaring that circle?  The discussions about the funding of the HSE will be of an entirely different nature if, in a few years, we have economic growth that is probably less than half of what we have enjoyed over the last decade.</P>

	<P>The Senator has a legitimate point when he refers to the demographic structure of this country compared to that of other countries.  However, we have a significantly smaller public service than some of those countries.  I do not believe the size of the public service is disproportionate or out of kilter, even taking account of our stage of development.  I disagree with the Senator on that point.</P>
        <P>Most bodies who make projections for ten or 15 years, or even beyond that, see that period as a time of opportunity to eliminate or largely eliminate some of our historical deficits.  In other words, the demographic and social provision pressures will not really begin to impact seriously until the 2020s and beyond.  There is a window of opportunity, therefore, over the next ten to 15 years.  That would be part of Government thinking; for example, there is heavy <Col N="666"/>emphasis on getting our infrastructure up to speed because we might have resources to do that now that might not necessarily be available to the same extent in the future.</P>
        <P>It is probably always a danger to take any given point in time, whether things are going well, badly or indifferently, and extrapolate that into the future.  We simply do not know how matters will develop.  Let us take the example of the current economic situation.  I was in the public service in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It was thought then that the recession at that time, while quite deep, would be of relatively short duration.  That was not the case.  It was quite a long siege that lasted several years.  We can hope, as turned out to be the situation in 2002 and 2003 or in the early 1990s, that any downturn &mdash; and by downturn I do not mean recession but simply greatly diminished growth &mdash; will be of relatively short duration.  However, we cannot know whether it will be, for which reason the Government must act prudently.  Were one to have an absolute assurance that growth would resume at 4% or 5% next year, one&rsquo;s response today might be different than is actually the case, as the volatile international climate and specific domestic factors must also be taken into account.</P>
        <P>What public services can be provided is materially connected to the state of the economy and the revenue supplied.  There is no doubt that the buoyancy since 1993 or 1994 has enabled us to make significant improvements in public services, but they cannot be divorced from the level of resources available.  I agree with Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s basic point in that challenging times lie ahead for everyone in the public service, which includes the Government and other political parties in its broadest sense.  For this reason, the report is timely and we must pay close attention to anything capable of improving public service delivery and efficiency.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, noting:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />the announcement of a National Cancer Strategy;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />the proposal to develop eight centres of excellence at various locations around the country;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />proceed immediately with the provision of Centres of Excellence, based on an adequate and ring-fenced budget;</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />continue to work closely with the authorities in Northern Ireland on the development of cancer services.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House.  She is a great attender here for debates on motions on health matters.  I am delighted she is here to take this important motion.</P>
        <P>I thank the Labour Party for joining Fine Gael in tabling this motion.  It is a very important motion dealing with the provision of cancer services, particularly in the west and north west.  The motion will afford the Minister and the Government an opportunity to reverse the decisions that she has taken, or at least to put them on hold, until the centre in Galway, in our case, is fully operational.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This motion is the same as that which was debated in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago.  I am delighted that something positive has emerged from tabling it.  The Government amendment to the motion is different from that to the motion on this matter in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome some aspects of the Government amendment, particularly where it is stated that &ldquo;seasonal arrangements for summer months at University College Hospital Galway do not impact on key specialties, including cancer specialties&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to explain that aspect because the word is out that cancer services and operational services will close in University College Hospital Galway during the summer months, particularly for the month of August.  I am delighted this provision is included in the amendment and welcome the intent of it, but I would still like the Minister to explain it.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to clarify a number of issues regarding statements she made concerning cancer services in the west and north west in the context of the number of hospital procedures carried out.  What figures did she use to support her statement that women had a better chance of survival if the treatments were carried out on the east coast versus the west coast?  She made that statement some weeks ago.  Can she explain the differences between the figures she gave for breast cancer procedures carried out at Mayo General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital and those given by the surgeons and those hospitals?   I would like the Minister to explain the discrepancy in those sets of figures.</P>
        <P>The Minister is doing a disservice to Mr. Barry in the case of Castlebar and Mr. O&rsquo;Hanrahan in the case of Sligo because they know the number of procedures they carried out.  She has cast aspersions on them by saying they have not carried out the number of procedures that they have carried out and by saying that there is a better chance of survival if treatments are carried out on the east coast rather than on the west coast and in the south.  Those two issues in question are dear to the hearts of those surgeons and I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify them.</P>
        <P>The Minister also said that the people were voting with their feet and were leaving Castlebar, other parts of Mayo, Sligo and the north west and going elsewhere to have their procedures carried out.  I do not find this is the case on the ground.  Thousands of people marched on this issue in Sligo and 7,000 people marched in Castlebar.  The women who had procedures carried out in the centres in Castlebar and in Mayo led the campaign.  Those seven brave women know what has happened in their cases.  They have the highest respect for Mr. Barry and his multidisciplinary team in the case of Castlebar and Mr. O&rsquo;Hanrahan and his multidisciplinary <Col N="668"/>team in the case of Sligo.  I do know of any cases, particularly in Castlebar and elsewhere in Mayo, where  people are not going to the centres in Castlebar or Galway.  The Minister said people were voting with their feet already and going elsewhere to obtain breast cancer services or have procedures carried out, but I do not find that to be the case.</P>
        <P>I do not know from where the Minister got the figures to support her claim that people have a better chance of survival if treatments are carried out on the east coast than if they are carried out on the west coast.  The centres in Castlebar and Sligo are only in operation since 2000.  The first five-year survival rates are coming on stream.  The survival rates in the centres in Castlebar and Sligo are more than 88%, which compares favourably with any centre in the world.  That is why I hope the Minister will use this opportunity to apologise to those surgeons and to clarify the position.  That would be  welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also the matter of funding.  I acknowledge that the Government amendment refers to arrangements during the summer months.  There is chaos in Galway.  There are procedures that need to be carried out other than breast cancer services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For parathyroidectomy there is a waiting list of almost 40 patients for Galway.  That hospital can carry out only three operations per week.  In effect, there is a waiting period of more than six months in Galway for this procedure.  This is a life threatening disease for which procedures have to be carried out urgently for the patients involved but due to pressure on theatres these procedures are not being carried out.  We now have a situation where people from Mayo, Sligo, south Donegal, Leitrim and north Roscommon will descend on University College Hospital Galway after September when Mr. Barry and his team move to Galway.  This is unprecedented.  Can one imagine Mr. Barry and his multi-disciplinary team leaving Castlebar and travelling one and a half hours to and from Galway one day per week when he could look after patients in Castlebar because he will meet only patients from Mayo in Galway?  It is a Mayo clinic within University College Hospital Galway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not sure whether there will be a Sligo, Roscommon, or south Donegal clinic in University College Hospital Galway.  Two beds are available for the Mayo clinic within the Galway hospital which has ten beds.  These beds are operating at full capacity.  That a top class surgeon and his team will travel one and a half hours each way, one day per week, to Galway from Castlebar to meet patients from Mayo when he and his team could meet them in Castlebar every week is ridiculous.  Some 30 to 50 people will travel from Mayo to Galway when they could be seen in Castlebar.  That makes no sense.</P>
        <P>I wish to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to an article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 28 May 2008 on the Beacon centre which reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">A new breast cancer surgery service will open in six weeks&rsquo; time at Dublin&rsquo;s Beacon Hospital. . .</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The breast surgery service will augment a &ldquo;comprehensive cancer care services&rdquo; which has been operating at Beacon for the last year  . . .</P>
        <P LI="1">Delivery of an outreach service is envisaged under the Government&rsquo;s cancer plan.  University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre (UPMC), which manages Beacon, runs a cancer facility in Pittsburgh, which is outpatient-oriented and operates in conjunction with 43 satellite centres.  Service Level Agreements for cancer were reached for UPMC&rsquo;s joint venture Whitfield Clinic in Waterford in February last year and for the Beacon Hospital in January 2008.  The beds in Beacon&rsquo;s oncology day unit can be turned around more than once daily. . .</P>
<Col N="669"/>
        <P LI="1">In Western Pennsylvania, 90 per cent of patients get cancer care close to their homes, through a network of 23 centres.  Ninety five per cent of our patients can get care at locations less than 20 minutes from where they live.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is all we are asking for in Castlebar and Sligo.  We are seeking an outreach and a satellite of University College Hospital Galway.  We understand that and we are fully in agreement with the centre of excellence in Galway.</P>
        <P>The Minister has an opportunity to at least delay the removal of services from Castlebar until Galway proves itself.  She has said in the past that these centres will provide a better service to patients than at present.  The people of Mayo, Sligo and the north west will not get a better service in Galway at present than they get in Castlebar or Sligo.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to examine this issue closely and delay the removal of services to Galway.  I hope she will avail of the opportunity to clarify the issues I have raised in regard to the number of procedures and the shadow she has cast over the work of some of the finest surgeons in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion in the name of my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I take this opportunity to look at Galway and how it can serve the whole region of the north west.  In that regard I will point out pluses and minuses in regard to the centre of excellence.  We need an assurance that the minuses will be addressed, otherwise an adequate service cannot be delivered to the people of Galway or to the  people of Sligo and Mayo.  I accept it is great to have centres of excellence in health because in the area of breast cancer outcomes matter.  To achieve the best outcomes, high volume and throughput count.  I do not say this because the Minister has said it.  It is a fact.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Galway has some excellent fundamentals in place.  I will give a balanced contribution having done my research locally around the pluses and minuses.  We can be proud of Galway in that, according to the national cancer control programme, more than 60% of women presenting with breast cancer do not need a mastectomy; a lobectomy will suffice.  Also, more than 50% of women presenting with a mastectomy undergo immediate breast reconstruction at the same time, which is the highest rate in the country.  All plaudits go to Galway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are aspects of Galway that appear to be ready to cope with the transition of breast cancer care from Sligo and Mayo but there are a number of aspects that are not adequate, even for Galway&rsquo;s hinterland.  In regard to outpatient care, I am delighted with the new symptomatic outpatient unit, which opened on 16 June and which is working well.  I understand there is adequate physical space there to cope with increased population.  However, it is lacking in terms of staffing arising from increased patient case loads predicted from Sligo and Mayo.  Extra patient caseloads from these areas will require the following staff to provide essential care: two to three outpatient nurses, one breast cancer care nurse, one radiographer, one receptionist-clerical officer and one backroom secretarial person.  I did not make up those figures, they come from the unit.  This staffing level will be needed to run the clinics.  In addition, three consultants are needed if we are to cope adequately with the transition.  In light of the staffing embargo and the ongoing cutbacks will the Minister outline her commitment to these specific staffing resources?</P>
        <P>There is a need for dedicated beds because there is still a problem with access to beds.  The care is good, the outcomes are great but the access is not good.  There are no dedicated or protected beds specifically for breast cancer care in University College Hospital Galway.  A centre of excellence for Galway and its hinterland, not to mention the expanded area of Mayo and Sligo, needs its own protected dedicated space, not a bed here and there.</P>
<Col N="670"/>
        <P>Two new operating theatres are due to open in October 2008.  We need a commitment that staffing will be provided for those theatres.  These are the questions coming from the practitioners in the field in Galway.</P>
        <P>I support my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, on the notion of network solutions and outreach centres.  Last autumn, when speaking to the main surgeon in Galway, he envisaged Galway as a centre of excellence but with network satellite centres in Sligo, Castlebar and Letterkenny to create a network solution to best serve patients&rsquo; needs locally where that was possible.  Like my colleague, I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response on that issue.  It is critical that no centre should be closed until the new resources are provided.  I seek an assurance that adequate capacity and staffing are in place before local facilities are removed, not only for the women of Galway but for those in the entire north west.  That is only fair.  Otherwise it will make a joke of the philosophy of centres of excellence.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the capacity of the laboratory in University College Hospital, Galway, to cope with cervical smear testing volumes.  I am most disappointed with what has happened there.  The Minister is aware that there has not been investment in the laboratories in UCHG to help it achieve accreditation.  I accept, however, that it is on a list for that purpose.  Last autumn, due to inadequate levels of staffing to meet the volumes of cervical smear tests in UCHG, smear samples from around the country were refused.  I saw the letter myself from a professor.  The laboratory needed only two extra staff to cope with the increased volume of smear tests.  Instead, the Minister chose to outsource that work to private laboratories that had only 80% to 85% reliability compared with 95% in Galway.  The laboratory&rsquo;s only failing was that the Minister did not invest to upgrade it.  If the Minister is committed to Galway as a centre of excellence for breast cancer care, she should tie in other aspects of women&rsquo;s health in order that it can be a centre of excellence for cervical smear testing also.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to the important area of broader transport infrastructure to support UCHG as a centre of excellence.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that traffic-wise, Galway is a bottleneck.  The <i>Galway Independent </i>is a local newspaper that profiles an important person in Galway every week.  People are asked what are the best and worst things about Galway and each week it is reported that the worst thing is the traffic.  I received a significant number of representations about the need for a right-turning arrow to allow people to turn into UCHG.  On several occasions I have waited in my car for up to three changes of traffic light to gain access to the hospital.  One can imagine what that is like for sick patients in their cars and the inconvenience caused to families visiting patients, sometimes from a long distance away.  I question whether there is joined up thinking between the Departments of Health and Children and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make Galway a true centre of excellence capable of serving the entire area.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply as it is important to people in Galway and to women across the north-west region.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I, too, welcome the Minister, Deputy Harney, and thank her for making herself so accessible to us in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The national cancer programme was rolled out last September.  It was announced that there would be eight centres of excellence; four in Dublin and one each in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  It is not new to say that the people of the north west, especially Sligo where I live, were most disappointed that Sligo General Hospital was not on the list.  Together with my Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas colleagues I immediately set about working to try to change that.  We met with the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Professor Keane.  We hoped something good would come from the process.  We were seeking a satellite unit for Sligo General Hospital.  During last February and March, Mr. Kevin Barry, on behalf of Mayo General Hospital, announced that the hospital wanted to be part of the programme that is to be rolled out in Galway.  That announcement dealt a severe blow to our political efforts.  The last hope of Oireachtas Members in Sligo was to approach the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who was leaving office, and ask him to speak to Professor Keane on our behalf.  He reported back to us in April that no exception would be made for Sligo General Hospital or anywhere else.</P>
        <P>During the course of our representations it became clear to my colleagues and me that the national cancer control programme was the way forward.  The programme was put in place by doctors.  Seventeen out of 24 members of the body charged with putting together the programme were medical personnel with expertise in the cancer area.  The programme was endorsed by the Government, the Irish Cancer Society, Action Breast Cancer, the Irish Patients&rsquo; Associ<Col N="672"/>ation, the Marie Keating Foundation, Patient Focus and Reach to Recovery.  The Government has endorsed the programme; it did not draw it up.  The report was written by medical personnel with the aim of ensuring the best outcomes for patients suffering with cancer.  The Minister went to British Columbia in Canada and met Professor Keane.  I alluded to the matter previously.  Over dinner, she jokingly asked whether he would be interested in coming to Ireland.  I think the Minister was bouncing a ball.  To her surprise he said he would come and head up the cancer strategy programme.</P>

        <P>Sligo will lose its assessment and surgical units but it will maintain its chemotherapy service.  The plan that has been rolled out for Sligo is that we will have a Sligo clinic in Galway or if a Sligo patient opts not to go to Galway, he or she can choose to go to any of the four centres in Dublin.  Sligo patients will have dedicated beds, a dedicated theatre and dedicated clinic times in Galway.</P>

	<P>If medical personnel in Sligo sign up to the strategy, as medical experts in Mayo have done, they would travel to Galway one day a week and look after Sligo patients who will return to Sligo for the rest of their treatment.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that only one out of every 15 women who are screened for breast cancer will be diagnosed with breast cancer.  That means 14 out of 15 women will have to make only one visit to a breast care clinic.  Professor Keane indicated that the fact we are transferring surgery to a cancer service is no criticism of surgeons in regional hospitals but the evidence is striking that the best way to provide a service is to concentrate resources.</P>
<Col N="673"/>
        <P>If a woman has a mastectomy she should be offered reconstruction surgery.  Sadly, in Sligo General Hospital there is no facility to offer reconstruction surgery because we do not have plastic surgeons.  I can speak only for my area but I think the same is true of Castlebar.  When the breast surgery unit is moved from Sligo to Galway, I urge the Minister to ensure the move is as smooth as possible bearing in mind patients&rsquo; interests and safety and making sure they are to the fore.  We all have a part to play in rolling out the cancer programme.  Not only politicians but also doctors must come on board.  They cannot let personal interests stand in the way of best practice and patient care.  Politicians and doctors have a role to ensure patients in this country have the same chance as patients in the rest of the developed world.  It was interesting to hear Professor Keane talk about the rise in lung cancer incidence that is expected in coming years, especially in young women.  He feels that breast cancer is now under control and breast cancer services will be rolled out in the eight units.  The cancer control programme will then try to bring prostate cancer under control.  Rare cancers will be treated in two of the units here in Dublin.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to ensure everything will be ready in Galway when the time comes to move services.  I know there will be two ring-fenced beds.  Women, particularly those presenting with breast cancer, have the best chance of survival and achieve the best possible outcomes if treated in a dedicated unit.  Paediatric cancers are dealt with under one roof.  Women need to be treated by dedicated breast cancer surgeons who are dealing with all sorts of surgeries and know what to look out for.  Mr. Tim O&rsquo;Hanrahan is an excellent surgeon and we are very proud to have him in Sligo.  However, if something happened to him in the morning &mdash; God forbid &mdash; there would be no one to replace him because he is a general surgeon with an interest in breast surgery.  When he goes on holidays I am sure no one is there to take over the vital work he does.  Therefore it is important for us to move our unit.  I commend the Minister&rsquo;s work and that of the national cancer control programme, which I fully support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House.  In my 21 years in Leinster House I have never learnt anything in political debates on the health area.  Anything I learn about the health service I learn through talking to people working in the service or through listening to experts on the radio.  I find it very difficult ever to find that middle line and I tend not to involve myself in such debates.  I believe this is the first one to which I have contributed in approximately two years.  I wish to place on the record of the House that I feel the Minister is doing a job above and beyond what might be expected of her.  That may be an unusual comment to make in these Houses in these times.  However, that is my view on the matter.  She has taken on an almost impossible task and I feel a huge sense of sympathy in how to get it done.</P>
        <P>One of the biggest problems people like me have in trying to take a middle line on the matter is that we have nothing by which to measure it.  At the beginning of a year I would like to have a very clear understanding of the objectives for the year, the key performance indicators and how we would assess them at the end of the year.  That would allow me to say this was the objective we set out to achieve and this is how far we got in areas such as waiting lists, the number of operations performed, diagnoses or whatever.  That is the information I need.  I have found it very difficult over the past two years with the various things that happened in the hospitals, including misreading of X-rays etc.  Given that we are talking about the running of a business with a management structure, I should be able to ask for the risk register for that particular institution, wherever it may be.  I would be able to inform the Minister within one hour where responsibility lay or if someone was responsible.  That is a major issue for me.  I would like the risk registers of hospitals to be available.  There is no reason for them not to be public documents and readily accessible.  Over the course of the year the assessment of those documents should also be available.</P>

        <P>The radio interview with Nuala O&rsquo;Faolain, who, sadly, has died since, impacted on us all.  In the middle of that interview she talked about the way she was treated in a New York hospital.  I am sure we all listened to it in different ways.  I listened to it on the basis of all we have heard about the Irish health service.  We are supposed to be aspiring towards the system that is available in the United States.  Even though she had adequate health cover, she was allowed to lie on a hospital trolley or some such without any counselling.  Someone stuck his head in the door and told her she had terminal cancer.  That is as bad a story as I have ever heard of the Irish health service.</P>
        <P>The terms of the Fine Gael motion are not unreasonable and I look forward to hearing how the Minister responds to it.  Intuitively like everyone in the House, I find it difficult to live with the fact that there is no centre of excellence in the northern half of the country.  The Fine Gael motion accepts much of what already exists and seeks something which should not be beyond practical response.  On the issues of travel and quality and how they relate to each other, there is no contest.  It would be an abrogation of the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility were she to agree to establish a centre of excellence in a place where the scale, experience or amount of work being done did not reach the threshold to ensure quality.  While I completely agree with the point, I do not know the figures.  However, I certainly agree with that basis of making a decision.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of what I am talking about.  I spoke to a woman who was about to have minor heart surgery &mdash; some people would say there is no such thing as minor heart surgery.  As she had full health insurance cover she went to a specialist in a hospital in Dublin.  It was an unusual operation that involved inserting some sort of electrical impulse.  Senator Quinn and I would be attracted to this.  The specialist told her that the hospital had a 92% success rate, which is greater than nine out of ten.  He advised her that a hospital in Bordeaux &mdash; the best hospital in Europe for the procedure &mdash; had a 99% success rate.  Knowing her own situation and having received advice from the surgeon, she went home and made a decision with a full armoury of facts.  In the event she decided to have the operation in Ireland, which, thankfully, was successful.  That is the kind of benchmarking or quantitative detail that is not normally associated with the health service.  As an Independent Senator I need more of those kinds of data to make an honest assessment.</P>
        <P>Is the same level of scale needed in the four areas of diagnoses, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to make every centre of excellence effective?  Could the surgery be in Galway and the treatment in Castlebar, for example?  If we are moving, is it required to move everything?</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael motion refers to &ldquo;the proposed closures at University College Hospital Galway, where the Centre of Excellence is to be located, for the month of August this year due to severe budgetary constraints&rdquo;, which is utterly unacceptable.  I cannot find any justification for establishing a centre of excellence and closing it down in August.  The Minister has spoken previously about the comfort of people who need to travel long distances.  There is no point in dealing with it in a way that politicians then complain about how much it cost us to send people in taxis in the previous year.  I have no difficulty sending people in taxis during a year if they are sick and need that kind of cover, we can justify the expense and it is done on a properly tendered basis.  I saw the Minister writing when I first mentioned benchmarks and I will finish by saying it again.  What people like me need are the benchmarks to assess progress so at the end of a year we can say whether we have made progress towards the key performance indicators and quantify it.  That would be very helpful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Recently Professor Tom Keane, who has been appointed to implement the national cancer strategy, met the Green Party parliamentary party as part of his ongoing consultation around the country.  I found him a very impressive individual.  He has come, with <Col N="675"/>his experience and background, from British Columbia.  The benefit of that experience is meant to be directly applicable here.  British Columbia is a region of Canada that has a population similar to the island of Ireland and it implemented a similar type of regional cancer strategy.  Interestingly, it chose to have eight centres, although British Columbia is geographically many times size the island of Ireland.  The geographical distances between those centres are far larger than that between any of the proposed centres here.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane made a few interesting points, the first being about the nature of reforming and changing a health service.  Additional resources were made available in the cancer care services of British Columbia by altering the types of expenditure.  The number of beds was reduced and rather than putting that saving back into the general fund, it was reallocated into diagnostic services, community care and after care services.  We have not used this approach enough in reforming our own health services.  Having someone like that in the Irish health service gave me great confidence that we might be heading along a direction we have not had an opportunity to go in the past.</P>
        <P>Another point Professor Keane made, and this has not been communicated strongly enough, is that while we refer to the eight centres as &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo;, he thinks that is not the most appropriate term.  He is talking more about centres of specialist care in cancer treatment.  Using the word &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; creates an expectation that wherever the centre is located has something super-duper, so to speak, and way in excess of anything available.  In making that point he stressed that what does not seem to be getting across is that these centres will have the entire range of services that need to be available for cancer care, including all the diagnostic aids, continuing care, after care and surgery, which is the most important element of what will happen in the centres.  That does not mean parts of those elements will not exist in the rest of the country.  The surgery will take place solely in the eight designated centres but elements of the diagnostic, continuing and after care will continue to take place in the various parts of the country where they now happen.  While much of the debate focuses on the eight centres, it continues to be a national strategy because all elements of cancer care will be provided somewhere, somehow in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>The implementation of this strategy is at the heart of the motion.  Part of my family background is in the north west.  My father was an islander from Donegal.  He passed away of cancer eight years ago.  He received all his treatment in Cork and was fortunate to do so.  He had three incidents of cancer over a 20-year period and the incident that led to his passing away occurred while he was holidaying on the island.  The manner of his passing indicated to me the degree to which there tends to be a regional imbalance in health care services.  It is more difficult in a remote area such as an island.  When my father passed away the island&rsquo;s ambulance was not in operation.  He was carried from one part of the island to another on the back of a trailer with hay and was taken off the island by the lifeboat.  He was then transported 30 miles from Burtonport to Letterkenny General Hospital.  Fortunately for him he was in a coma during all this but it somewhat lessened the dignity of his passing away and represented to me an illustration of the need to have high quality health services wherever we are on this island.  This was eight years ago and things have improved; we have a better ambulance service.  However finely tuned the health service is in dealing with areas of low population and remoteness, it will be difficult to provide a high level of service.</P>
        <P>This is at the heart of the national cancer strategy.  We have to ensure that wherever people live they get the treatment they need how and when they need it and that the questions of geography and dignity are properly addressed.  A fair attempt is being made to do that.  There is a lacuna in the north west.  Not only is it a remote part of the country, the population of the area is smaller than in other regions.  Those factors have to be assessed in deciding which locations are best.  I would like to think the cancer strategy is being structured with a Letter<Col N="676"/>kenny node and that the possibility of increased links between the health services in the Republic and the North of Ireland would offer opportunities, especially with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.  This makes perfect sense in the context of a holistic approach to health care on the island.  If there is a medium-term strategy that could put this in place, it will address the gap that remains because of the remoteness and the population size in that part of the country.  Thought is being given to that.  It is difficult to marry our health system with the National Health Service in Northern Ireland but we are talking about cross-Border bodies and wherever such synergies can be achieved, we should work towards doing so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a personal reservation on the application of the eight centres from the current, more diverse approach to cancer care service distribution.  In the south west, Cork has been identified as the regional centre and moves are taking place to move cancer care services from Tralee to Cork.  There is a logic in that.  Cork has been designated and Tralee is part of the south west region.  I find it difficult to understand the logic of the fact that the Cork regional centre is to be located in one campus in Cork University Hospital, CUH.  This means some services currently being provided to a very high standard in the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, which already seems to have a liaison with the construction of the BreastCheck facility which is located next to it, will be moved across the city to CUH.  If someone can explain to me why that has to take place and in the given time span, it would make more sense to the people of Cork.  I understand Cork is the regional centre but I am not necessarily convinced that means location in one building.  This is just a localised example of how the cancer strategy is being implemented.  I accept this will cause difficulties when the regional centres are being moved from A to B.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the opportunity of supporting the Government amendment and of asking some of the questions.  We all wish to see the best cancer treatment system in the country and it is our collective intention in this House to work towards that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  She is the Minister whom I have had the opportunity to meet most often in this House.  That is a measure of the level of need to have her here regarding the health services and her commitment to coming here and giving at least an ear to what has to be said.  It is very difficult to remove the emotive aspect of cancer services from the equation.  I am aware that many people have suffered the loss or the diagnosis of close family members, which is difficult to deal with.  The statistics on the prevalence of the different types of cancer are horrific.  While I will not go into detail, it appears the very prevalence of cancer makes it seem as if it is not so horrific for the person hearing that diagnosis.  This can cause another aspect of emotional loss and grieving that is probably not factored into the relationship with the diagnosis of cancer and its treatment, the therapies and the location where the best care can be given.</P>
        <P>I take the point on when a child becomes ill.  I worked mostly with very young children and babies and I know that when a child becomes ill, one would cross the world to get best service.  I must acknowledge this, which is not to take from any case being made.</P>
        <P>The strategy for cancer control in Ireland proposes to put in place a system which will see a reduction in the incidence, morbidity and mortality of cancer in comparison with the other European countries by 2015.  It is a very good target to have set.  We will see the establishment of eight centres of excellence which will deal with the diagnosis and treatment of the more common forms of cancer, with each centre serving an average of 500,000 of the population.  There will also be a comprehensive provision for the treatment of rarer cancers in specific locations.  I am fully supportive of this strategy in the context of developing and advancing <Col N="677"/>expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  It would be unfair of me not to acknowledge this, having worked in the health service for so long.</P>
        <P>While the provision of centres of excellence based on population works very well in the southern half of Ireland, this should not be the sole consideration in deciding the location of such a centre.  In the northern half of the country, due to the lower population density, clients are sometimes hugely disadvantaged by the distance they have to travel to avail of treatment.  A special case surely must be made in this area to make treatment more accessible to service users and to reduce the discomfort and disruption to very ill patients in need of regular treatment.</P>
        <P>I take issue with the manner in which the eight centres of excellence were chosen.  It seems that in the four HSE areas these centres will be located on the site of the existing regional hospital, which is not a particularly sensible approach.  Most of these hospitals are in coastal locations and less accessible than would have been the case had they been located some distance inland.  During the protracted situation in regard to the divided services in Clonmel and Cashel and the regional services in Waterford, on one occasion I was caught out when the bridge was up and I had to get to the hospital quickly because there was an emergency to be dealt with.  I had to hope that the bridge would be back in place soon, which was a discomfort to me as a professional.  I can only imagine the situation of the woman in premature labour, but we got there in time and everything was fine, thank God.</P>
        <P>For service users to have to negotiate towns and cities that are already choked with traffic is another dimension when one needs to get to a hospital desperately, or when there is a concern about keeping an appointment and whether one will lose one&rsquo;s place in the queue.  There is much to be said for having a new facility on a greenfield site.  There is no reason a hospital has to be located in a town or city and it may be easier to access one on a greenfield site, both in routine and emergency situations, once the area is well serviced by roads.  I accept this is not a small detail.</P>
        <P>In the past, cancer care and treatment was provided at a local level by skilful and dedicated consultants.  While Professor Tom Keane had issues with the provision of cancer care in smaller hospitals, I commend the consultants who managed to do so very successfully for many years.  Thousands of people throughout Ireland were very well treated and can thank their local medical personnel for the fact they survived and got great treatment and care in smaller hospitals.</P>
        <P>There is a valid point in regard to the consequences of a lack of experience in diagnosing cancer due to a low turnover of patients.  We have seen the impact of such a systems failure on the women of the midlands caught up in the recent situation.  One must not underestimate the stress and trauma caused to these women who had to undergo revision of their test results and to their families.  I hope that with the provision of care through centres of excellence we will never see such a situation arise again.  Awareness is a major factor in this regard.  Quality audits should be in place and they should be put in place sporadically so all staff are subject to unannounced audit and should have no fear of that.  I would have no fear of it.</P>
        <P>In my own constituency, we have already seen the transfer of an excellent breast cancer care service from South Tipperary General Hospital to Waterford.  It is essential that adequate groundwork has taken place to ensure the hospital has both the infrastructure and staffing levels in place to service the additional area of expertise.  While the Health Service Executive denies it has a continuing embargo on staff recruitment, I am concerned that the directive in place indicating that staff may be hired within financial constraints does and will have implications for the setting up and maintenance of any new service.</P>
<Col N="678"/>
        <P>Underpinning the centres of excellence, we clearly need to extend the screening process for treatable cancers, including widening the range and age groups for these tests.  For example, in the case of breast cancer, it is expected that the 2,000 cancers treated annually will be reduced once BreastCheck, the national breast cancer screening programme, is fully rolled out.  However, as BreastCheck encompasses only women in the 50 to 65 year old age group, it will have no impact on the 67% of cancers which were diagnosed in the over 65s.  The Minister agreed this was to be extended to the age of 69 at a previous meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and I hope this might be addressed in her response to this debate.  The age group serviced by BreastCheck needs to be widened to include these women to ensure early diagnosis and treatment and, ultimately, a better prognosis.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with extending the range of available tests, I acknowledge the importance of the front-line role of the general practitioner in the early diagnosis of cancer through the identification of symptoms during physical examinations and the provision of routine screening for cancers such as prostate cancer and cervical cancer in the surgery setting.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed to note that despite the reservations voiced by me, among others, about the possible granting of the cervical screening contract, the Minister has signed the contract with Quest Diagnostics.  This was ill advised considering the misgivings raised about the company&rsquo;s practices.  On a more significant note, this decision will have long-term implications for cytologists and pathologists in Ireland who will have reduced access to the reading and screening of cervical smears.  They will be completely deskilled in reading these.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to contribute.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for taking the time to come to listen to the debate.</P>
        <P>I will be opposing the motion.  To clarify that, since September last I have probably been the most consistent speaker on this issue.  I have had two motions on the Adjournment on the issue which have been specific to Sligo and that region.  I am a supporter of the Government strategy in general in the context of developing specialist centres throughout our nation and I acknowledge Professor Keane&rsquo;s expertise in that regard.  I obviously differ, as the Minister well knows, on a variety of points, to some of which I will refer during my contribution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A strategy for cancer control in Ireland states: &ldquo;Ireland will have a network of equitably accessible state-of-the-art cancer treatment facilities and we will become an internationally recognised location for education and research into all aspects of cancer.&rdquo;  I am holding a map of Ireland which apparently shows a network of equitably accessible facilities.  It speaks for itself.  North of a line from Dublin to Galway, there will be no centre of excellence.  That is simply unacceptable to the people of the north-west region.  There is no situation in which we can call no representation in the northern half of the country equitably accessible.  It is unacceptable to me that any aspiration would exist to have the National Health Service supply the health service to the north west of this country.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons the debate over the past year has taken a number of different turns.  I do not accept there is no case based on facts.  This is not some local politician interested in having a rant on behalf of some glorified local nursing home in the north west.  I consider myself a citizen of the north west and I believe the north west is entitled to representation in the provision of equitably accessible services.  This is based on fact, not on aspiration or any political situation because this is an issue of human importance.  There is a human aspect to this which must be considered.</P>
<Col N="679"/>
        <P>I fully support the concept of specialist centres because they will lead to better outcomes in due course.  However, if we are to purport to design a programme which acknowledges this is the case, then we must examine the statistics, even if those statistics come from the HSE, laundered through public relations companies or otherwise.  Based on the national cancer registry from 1994 to 2001, cancer sufferers in the north west region had a 25% lower chance of survival.  However, that is an incorrect statement.  When one examines the figures more closely, one sees that the figure is 123% less 100%, which is actually 23%.  In the western health board region, which includes Galway where the proposed centre of excellence will be located, the figure is 26%.  The north western region was no worse than the west.  However, an interesting fact to which I have never heard anyone in the HSE refer is that, according to the same document, when the fully adjusted model is taken into account, survival rates in the north west are only 7% lower than those in the eastern region.  At the same time, in the western region, including Galway, the figure is 26%.</P>
        <P>Those figures are completely out of date, as we all well know.  They predate the development of Sligo Regional Hospital, based in Sligo, which is a gateway centre under the national spatial strategy and the largest urban centre in that part of the country, north of the line from Dublin to Galway.  They also predate the appointment of a medical oncologist, an excellent surgeon, Dr. Tim O&rsquo;Hanrahan and a multidisciplinary team in 2001, as advocated under the report of 2000 by Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins.  Nobody from the HSE is prepared to engage with the professionals on the ground until they are, in their words, prepared to &ldquo;submit&rdquo; and at that point, Professor Keane has told the authorities in the regional hospital representing the north west&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The outcomes which have been achieved in the regional hospital in Sligo over the period since the introduction of medical oncology, triple assessment and multidisciplinary teams &mdash; including pathologists, radio-oncologists, oncologists and radiotherapists, who meet each Tuesday &mdash; when benchmarked against what the best in the world has to offer, namely, the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results, SEER, database in the United States, of which I know the Minister is aware, are at least as good as in the United States.  In fact, when age is taken into consideration, the outcomes are better.</P>

There are justifiable grounds, not for an unravelling of the cancer control strategy, but for an adjustment to it, to take cognisance of the brilliance that has been achieved by people since 2000 in the north west area and the geographical situation which exists.  Such an adjustment must be true to the people who live in the north west region who, like every other citizen, yearn for what is promoted by the cancer control strategy, namely, accessible equality of service.</P>

        <P>I fully support centres of excellence and I particularly support my colleagues, Senators Burke and Healy Eames in calling for the retention of existing high quality services at Mayo General Hospital and Sligo General Hospital, as satellite units.  I urge the Minister to ensure the centre of excellence at Galway is able to cope with the increased volume of patients.  In that context, I question the notion of closing the University College Hospital in Galway for a month.  How in God&rsquo;s name can one close a centre of excellence for a month?  I ask the Minister to clarify the situation in that regard.</P>
        <P>There have been many fatal cutbacks in the health service.  Wards have been closed, operations have been cancelled and there have been enormous increases in the number of patients on trolleys.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned Ms Nuala O&rsquo;Faolain but there are many people like Ms O&rsquo;Faolain.  We should never forget the story that was documented on RTE, although I cannot mention the lady&rsquo;s name, about the length of time she had to wait to undergo a colonoscopy &mdash; seven months.  We should also not forget the people to whom Senator Prendergast referred who were misdiagnosed in Portlaoise.  I hope we never see this in our health service again.  It is worth noting that the situation in Portlaoise arose less than a year ago.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that I support centres of excellence.  The Minister was present during my first debate in the House.  I was accused of being parochial and colloquial when I protested at the closure of services in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar but I make no apology for the concern I had for my constituents and the people of the midlands generally.  At the same time, I agree with the need for centres of excellence.  Unfortunately, however, people are not being cared for in the way they should be.  People from the midlands region must travel to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin and some who are attending Portiuncula Hospital are now being told they must attend the University College Hospital in Galway, the site of the proposed centre of excellence.</P>
        <P>I repeat that centres of excellence are the way forward because there must be a sufficient volume of cases to guarantee better outcomes.  There must be accessibility and staff.  How can one deliver the service that is needed if there is an embargo on staff?</P>
        <P>I spoke in the first debate about people travelling from the midlands to Dublin, having to get the train at ungodly hours and having to get off it to be sick.  This situation has not changed.  There are people in Ireland who have no cars and no means of transport.  During the initial debate, I asked the Minister to put a dedicated medical transport system in place.  There should be joined-up thinking between the HSE, the Department of Health and Children, which we should not forget, and the Department of Transport and a central fund should be ring-fenced for comfortable transport for victims of cancer.</P>
<Col N="682"/>
        <P>It has been rumoured, and the Acting Chairman will have an input into this, that there will be a transfer of services from Roscommon County Hospital and that people will be helicoptered to a centre of excellence.  I am not sure whether this centre will be Galway.  Can the Minister clarify that because rumours are rife?</P>
        <P>The Minister told me that Athlone is very well-serviced bearing in mind that we have no hospital.  However, 40% of the people of Athlone, the population of which is about 25,000, attend Portiuncula Hospital.  There is no longer a mammography service at Portiuncula Hospital which means that 40% of the patients from the Athlone area who have cancer or a query or need even a routine mammogram must go to Galway to which they are being transferred from Portiuncula Hospital.  This is a significant number of people.</P>
        <P>I commend the oncology service at Portiuncula Hospital and hope that it will not be removed.  There is an excellent chemotherapy treatment at the hospital in conjunction with an advanced nurse practitioner.  I applaud the staff who provide a 24-hour treatment facility.  It is way beyond the call of duty.  Due to the staff embargo, staff at this hospital are under serious strain and provide great relief to cancer services in the midlands and Galway area.</P>
        <P>In respect of cytology, my colleague, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, referred to the fact that laboratories are unable to cope with the volumes.  To me, a centre of excellence is a place where one can get a diagnosis, prognosis, surgery and palliative care under the one roof.  Is that correct?  In respect of cytology and people who want to get the results of smear tests, this, to me, is diagnosis and should be provided under the one roof.  As a centre of excellence, the laboratory should be able to deal with smear tests.  Smear tests are no longer being reported or dealt with in Portiuncula Hospital but are being sent to Antrim at huge cost.  I believe that funding must be provided in University College Hospital Galway as the centre for excellence for smear tests and the reporting of such tests.</P>
        <P>I fully support the motion, particularly the position taken by my Mayo and Galway colleagues because I am concerned about the volume, access and egress to University College Hospital Galway where there is no car parking.  This very basic issue needs to be addressed to deal with cancer services and a centre of excellence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to express some views in the debate here today.  We must accept that the Minister has endeavoured to provide the best possible care to people throughout the country.  Nothing is being done from sinister motives or to attack or downgrade any hospital.  I come from an area that, along with the people of Donegal, has probably the greatest gripe regarding the fact that there is no local service available.  </P>
        <P>The first thing to which any of us looks when a member of our families or our friends become sick is where the best possible diagnostic care and treatment can take place.  This is why it is accepted across the House that centres of excellence are probably the best possible way of moving forward with regard to cancer treatment.</P>
        <P>I do not know how many people here heard the professor whom we are not supposed to name speak on the radio yesterday morning.  He made it very clear that as far as he was concerned, the expenditure here was on a par with anywhere else in the world with regard to cancer care.  That was something we were all probably glad to hear.  Nobody can say that we are underspending or that the health service here is underspending when it comes to cancer care, despite all the attacks on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

	<P>Great.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>During My 30-year experience, I have seen people like the Senator come and go and I know how to deal with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very disparaging remark.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  She was the one who drew the fire so she should take it when she draws it.</P>
        <P>People in this country are entitled to the best diagnostic service and treatment.  If this can be delivered through centres of excellence, we must accept it.  However, there is a role for hospitals like those in Sligo, Castlebar and Letterkenny when it comes to the further treatment and monitoring of patients after diagnosis and initial treatment, which should be pursued.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why some people say that it is now impossible for somebody to get to and from Dublin.  I agree with Senator McFadden that there are people who do not have cars but services are being provided by the HSE in all areas.  In the area I represent, the HSE will bend over backwards to ensure that somebody gets the service to get them to and from Dublin.  I do not know what the story is in respect of the area covered by the former Western Health Board.  I can only speak for the one with which I mainly dealt, namely, the former North Western Health Board area which still provides an excellent service to patients going to and from hospitals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What annoys me is the fact that certain people shout for local hospitals but when it comes to treatment, they go to either the Blackrock Clinic or some of the other private hospitals in the country.  This is something about which none of us wants to be hypocritical.  I, like many people, pay VHI but if people do this, they will use it to the full.  It is imperative that those who do not have the benefit of VHI cover get the same level of care as those who pay for private health insurance.  If this is by means of the provision of centres of excellence, then that is the way we should go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What also annoys me is the fact that some of the people who are most vocal in some of these protests have first-class VHI cover and, in many cases, will not use the local hospital.  We all know that.  Some believe that those who do not have health insurance should have a lesser service than those who can afford to pay for it.  This is not the way the HSE or others operate.  Let nobody try to tell me that we should have a three-tier system because that is what some people would like to see.  I want to see the best diagnostics and surgical treatment provided to patients.  If the local hospitals are in a position to do the monitoring work as people&rsquo;s treatment progresses, then that is the role they must play.  That will not please many people but if we are to have perfection, one must have continuous work in the field in which one works and this is what the centres of excellence will do.  I pay tribute to the surgeons in regional hospitals who do excellent work.  It is unfair to expect them to perform across every discipline, from cancer to other surgical work.  That is why there should be specialist surgery.</P>
        <P>There are a certain number of hospitals that will carry out cardiac surgery.  Everyone is happy with that because they know that going to see the senior cardiac surgeons means they will get a service that is second to none.  Oncology should be the same.  While people may feel aggrieved, they must consider who must be looked after most, the patient.  If a family member was ill in the morning, we would be prepared to go to the end of the world to ensure the best possible treatment.  That is why we have a role to play as politicians to ensure people get the best service.  It might not be the most convenient service but we want the best possible service.</P>
<Col N="684"/>
        <P>On radio yesterday, the famous professor made it quite clear that there were sufficient funds in the health service of this country.  In some cases he felt there was waste on some treatments and the amount of professional time used by surgeons to monitor people who could be monitored as well by the local general practitioner or cancer nurses.  These are the people who are being dragged back to clinics on a regular basis after full treatment and cure.  They are taking up consultants&rsquo; time.  I felt both for and against this because if someone has been seriously ill he or she would like to continue to see whatever doctor dealt with the illness.</P>
        <P>Many of the motions before this House are not aimed at the patient but at making political capital.  This is not in the best interest of patients or the communities we serve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue is about the patient and ensuring that patients get the best possible service and that they have access to the service on a regular, clear-cut basis, with immediate effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senator Hannigan.  I welcome the Minister, who is very good in the way she attends the House.  She cannot always be pleasant because there is usually a good dose of criticism.</P>
        <P>I have always agreed with the idea of centres of excellence.  There is a problem politically because people are subjected to intense pressure in their local areas to keep the local hospital despite best practice.  Centres of excellence are important.</P>
        <P>The question of transport must be examined but in a country this size the best treatment is the most important factor even though there are great inconveniences with regard to transport.</P>
        <P>Educating the public and self-diagnosis is important.  Professor Keane made the point that cancers which affect the throat and so on are particularly nasty.  Sometimes they can be detected during oral hygiene and visits to the dentist.  Unfortunately, many of the people who develop this kind of cancer do not go pay frequent visits to the dentist.  There is a question of diagnosing and identifying so that it is not given inappropriate treatment.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of certification.  There have been a series of problematic areas, including the midlands, where there was difficulty with proper diagnosis, understanding of medical scans and treatment.  In the Canadian system, there is a certification process every year.  The senior consultant or a higher authority issues a certificate for all doctors underneath him or her.  This states that the doctor is fit to practice, has had no accidents or problematic areas and can continue for another year.  That is excellent and we should do that, which would lead to greater patient safety.</P>
        <P>If one wants to find out what works, one should examine the way people practice.  I am interested in evidence that is a partly anecdotal but partly verifiable, namely, that doctors send their families to centres of excellence.  Then, for political reasons, they will bellyache about the closing of the local cottage hospital.  That is as immoral and wrong as politicians mixing it.</P>
        <P>My final point relates to Roscommon.  I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the Lisbon treaty referendum and campaigned for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  I was clear about the reasons for this, namely, bullying, opportunism, lack of democracy and the infractions in neutrality.  I remember the people of Roscommon but that is not a reason to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is the lowest form of politics to base one&rsquo;s campaign on some other issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Fine Gael in an effort to ensure these centres of excellence are maintained and not affected by potential savings that the Government may be considering.  We need to see the guarantee of centres of excellence around the country.</P>
        <P>I want to defend a current centre of excellence that people are worried will be closed by the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  The D&oacute;chas breast cancer unit in Drogheda has made a massive impact on the lives of the women it has served and the families that have been affected by its service.  Louth maybe the smallest county in Ireland but it has clocked up one of the largest number of cancer diagnoses of all counties.</P>
        <P>If the Minister needs to make a phone call I am quite happy to wait.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am listening, I am sorry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>D&oacute;chas was opened in 2004 as a dedicated centre for breast cancer care and it very quickly became popular in the area.  It serves patients from across the north east, from Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  It provides an efficient service for treatment and after-care with dedicated staff who get to know the patients personally.  If the centre closes it will dramatically affect the lives of a great many people across the north east.</P>
        <P>D&oacute;chas has seen a constant increase in the numbers of patients it treats over the past few years.  In 2002, it was treating 72 patients but by 2006 this had increased to 136.  Initially D&oacute;chas was told that 100 new patients per year was a requirement to remain open.  This increased to 150 patients per year in order to remain open.  The number of patients in treatment by D&oacute;chas in 2007 dropped to 115.  It appears that the reduction was partly because GPs were referring patients directly to hospitals in Dublin to depress the number of users of D&oacute;chas.</P>
        <P>In the months of January to March this year, D&oacute;chas treated over 130 women.  Inevitably more patients will be referred during the summer and in the run up to Christmas.  This centre does not need to be cut.  It is essential for a growing number of breast cancer patients in the north east.  In one place, patients can avail of a mammogram, an ultrasound and a biopsy.</P>
        <P>The journey for many cancer patients to and from Dublin can be an arduous one.  Many may have to travel from Monaghan or Slane to Dublin, where they are totally removed from their family, making it difficult for visitors.  It is an arduous journey if one is ill.</P>
        <P>I spoke to one ex-patient of D&oacute;chas who described the comfort of knowing her husband and family were in close proximity and could visit on a regular basis.  That may not be the case if this centre of excellence closes down.  Every person I have spoken to regarding their experience in D&oacute;chas has been positive.  They have nothing but praise for the treatment and staff attention they receive.  People describe it as an incredible service.  The quality of aftercare could not be better.  It is a centre of excellence for breast cancer services in the north-east.  It treats a growing number of women with every week that passes.  It provides a convenient and quality service for many people in the north east.  The closure of the service would be a betrayal of these people who are asking for nothing other than the best treatment for their illness.  We must retain existing centres of excellence such as D&oacute;chas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for providing me with an opportunity to speak about the cancer control plan.  I will try to answer as many of the issues raised by Senators as I can.</P>
        <P>The cancer control plan is about one thing and one thing only and that is patient survival.  Ireland comes 18th out of 23 European countries in terms of survival from cancer.  The only area of cancer where we are top of the class is children&rsquo;s cancer.  Why are we at the top with regard to children&rsquo;s cancer?  Why do we compare favourably with Europe and the US with regard to children&rsquo;s cancer?  It is because children&rsquo;s cancer services are centralised in Crumlin <Col N="686"/>where diagnosis and initial surgery takes place.  Much of the follow-up chemotherapy takes place in 15 other hospitals.  I strongly believe if the trade-off is between survival and travel, few patients and their families would not travel in order to survive or would put the local area before better survival rates.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Places in the world which have the best survival rates include British Colombia, which has the same population as Ireland and which has four centres in the southern part of the province.  Senator Boyle earlier stated it has eight.  I visited them because we were so impressed with their results.  It is a publicly funded system.  People travel thousands of miles to obtain the best treatment in Canada and so it is that it has one of the best outcomes in the world.</P>
        <P>We are discussing eight designated centres, not eight centres of excellence.  Every health service should be a centre of excellence whether it is a general practitioner&rsquo;s surgery or a local hospital performing minor and elective work.  We are discussing having eight designated centres where all of the surgical and diagnostic specialists will work together in multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
        <P>Medicine used to be organised on the basis that we had general surgeons.  We have moved well away from this.  Most surgery has begun to specialise.  We want to aspire in Ireland to what they have in British Colombia, Europe, the United States and Australia which are the countries which perform best.  They have breast surgeons, brain surgeons for cancer and lung surgeons.  They do not have general surgeons who might do a bit of breast surgery.</P>
        <P>This is not about the skills of any individual.  No service can be organised on the basis of any individual&rsquo;s skill or personal commitment.  We cannot have a service organised around one or two people.  As somebody stated, if this person is sick or on leave we do not have a service at all.  Given the population of Ireland we cannot justify more than eight centres.  Some people have stated this is four too many and we should have only four centres.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four in Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>However, 23 people were put together, 17 of whom were doctors and six were non-medics.  These 23 people recommended to the Government that we should have eight centres and stated where those centres should be.  If we take the two hospitals mentioned, namely in Sligo and Mayo, a person with brain, lung or pancreatic cancer in Sligo or Mayo already travels.  A total of 52% of all the lung cancers in the country are dealt with in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>In 2007, 7,014 surgical procedures were carried out in Sligo.  We are discussing moving 79 of these, which happen to be breast cancer.  In Mayo, 4,816 surgical procedures took place and we are discussing moving 58 of these.  We are being accused of running down the hospitals.  In 2006 in County Sligo, 477 people were diagnosed with cancer.  Of these, 106 were not treated in Sligo.  They were treated in other places, presumably because the specialist activity did not happen there.  People had various cancers which required surgery.</P>
        <P>Patients are already travelling from Sligo and Mayo for cancer treatment &mdash; many of them to places in Dublin &mdash; heart bypasses and many other procedures.  The reason people must travel is because we cannot provide multi-disciplinary specialists and by this I mean more than one individual in a specialist area.  One cannot have a designated cancer centre with one surgeon in a particular specialty.  It is not adequate to provide the level of cover, expertise and service warranted to justify it being a cancer centre.</P>
        <P>We already have many people working in these centres but they are working in a fragmented way.  Until recently, breast cancer was performed in more than 30 hospitals in Ireland.  In some cases, only one or two procedures were carried out each year.  I do not know many women who would want to be operated on by a doctor who only did one or two surgeries a year.  I do <Col N="687"/>not believe any woman could be convinced, notwithstanding the data which I will deal with in a moment, that this would deliver a good outcome.</P>
        <P>Approximately one third of breast cancers lead to mastectomies.  Many women having a mastectomy want to have reconstructive surgery.  This is particularly the case with regard to young women but not exclusively young women.  They can have this in centres with a plastic surgeon.  They cannot have it in Mayo or Sligo.  A woman in Mayo or Sligo who has a mastectomy and wants to have reconstruction must have a second bout of surgery.  This is not good international practice and not recommended.  One should only have surgery when it is essential to do so.</P>
        <P>No matter what small group of data we take, it cannot put to one side the data from throughout the world.  More than 250 medical publications support the view with regard to breast and other cancers that volume equals quality.  Unless one deals with 150 new cases a year and a surgeon performs at least one new case a week, one will not get a good outcome.  Recently, I was asked a parliamentary question about this data.  I referred to a website which contains it.  I recommend people to check it out.  It continues for pages and pages and includes data from the world&rsquo;s best surgeons and scientists in the best organised cancer services in the world.</P>
        <P>I would not be worthy of the job of Minister for Health and Children if I were to set this aside, take a chance and state to the women of Mayo or Sligo that they will be second best and that we will take a chance it just might be all right when we know all of the evidence states that by having a designated centre with multi-disciplinary teams their chances are so much better.  What are the chances?  If one is treated in a centre with a low volume where four women survive, five will survive in a specialist centre.  We are telling one woman who might die that if we treat her in a specialist centre she might be the one to survive.  I do not believe any health system should take this type of chance.</P>
        <P>When the strategy was recommended, seven patient organisations recommended, notwithstanding the inconvenience to some people which we acknowledge, that we should implement it.  These organisations included the Irish Cancer Society, Europa Donna, Arc, the Marie Keating Foundation and the Irish Patients Association.  It also included local cancer organisations.  These organisations did not recommend that we proceed as quickly as we could for any reason other than that they knew it would deliver the best results and outcomes for women.</P>
        <P>Last autumn, Senator Fitzgerald stated that we have the guidelines and demanded that they be implemented.  She asked that the eight centres be put in place and for me to show leadership.  This is what she encouraged me to do.  When one shows leadership and gets on with it one is accused of ignoring certain matters.  In Ireland, approximately 22,000 new cancers diagnoses are made every year and approximately 7,750 people die from cancer.  We have approximately 2,500 cases of breast cancer.  To provide the service that deliver the outcomes achieved in places such as British Columbia, we need to reorganise, eradicate fragmentation and make sure screening, diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, counselling and so on are integrated.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that initial diagnosis and surgery will take place in the designated centre and the follow-up treatment will be carried out in the hospitals in Sligo, Mayo, Mullingar and the other locations mentioned in accordance with protocols that will be devised at the specialist centre.  That is best practice and it delivers good results.  Out of every 100 women who travel to Galway from Mayo or Sligo, 95 will not need to return but if the five who may be diagnosed with cancer and need surgery are not given the best chance at the start, the process cannot be undone.  One can never recover down the line with chemotherapy if the diagnosis and initial surgery is not correct.  That is what all the experts tell us and there is a compelling argument for us to take on board the best expertise available to the Government and the health service and put that into effect.</P>
<Col N="688"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I was asked about resources for Galway University Hospital, which has 2,500 staff.  From time to time, 100 beds are occupied by patients awaiting medical or radiation oncology treatment.  That is not best practice because most of the treatment should be provided on a day case basis.  That is why Professor Keane is reorganising the service.  The issue is reorganising the manner in which the service is provided to make sure it is focused on delivering the best result for patients and not on more beds or staff.  The 100 beds occupied in GUH are not necessary and fewer hospital beds are required for such patients.  St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin has 300 beds for radiation oncology while the hospital in British Columbia, which caters for the same population, has approximately 60 inpatient beds.</P>
        <P>We are spending a great deal of money but, unfortunately, it has not been put in the right direction.  Recently, the Government advertised for 120 new consultants for the health care system, more than 20 of whom will be cancer specialists in the eight centres of excellence.  Additional specialist breast surgeons will not be appointed to centres that are not designated because it does not make sense to do so.  When doctors work in a critical mass environment dealing with cancer, significant positives flow from that.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to performance indicators and survival rate is the one that matters in the context of cancer services.  In the first instance, we must organise around volumes of 150, for example, for breast cancer while there will probably be only one centre for both prostate and brain cancer, one or two centres for oesophageal cancer and perhaps only one centre for lung cancer because the volume of patients to achieve good results only warrants these numbers.  That will mean patients travelling but if it improves the chances of these patients having a positive outcome by 20% or 25%, many of them will do that.</P>
        <P>I fully accept the need for modern transport that meets the needs of patients and that is why the Irish Cancer Society is involved in a new transport initiative.  Only yesterday I met Mr. John McCormack, chief executive of the society, which will provide in conjunction with cancer centres, similar to its counterparts in many other countries, resources for the provision of transport where a bus service would not make sense and where individuals want to make their own arrangements through a family member, neighbour or another form of private transport.  The ICS is also developing a volunteer effort, which works well in Canada and other European countries.  I have witnessed this working well elsewhere and people might like to contribute to this effort.</P>
        <P>Recently, at the request of Senator Feeney, I made an allocation to Sligo hospital to provide a new bus for patients who must travel to Galway for radiation oncology treatment because she brought to my attention the substandard nature of the current bus.  More dedicated transport initiatives are needed to meet the highest transport standard.</P>
        <P>Two additional beds will be provided for breast cancer patients from counties Mayo and Sligo in GUH.  I am often criticised because there is 90% to 100% occupancy in hospitals, which people say is dangerous.  It is normal practice for hospitals such as GUH to reduce activity during August for maintenance and refurbishment work and other reasons.  That does not affect cancer or other specialist services or the accident and emergency department.  That is normal practice around the world.  Many elective hospitals that do not deal with emergencies, cancer or other specialties in Europe close during August.  I assure Senators it will have no affect on the availability of capacity.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane did this job in British Columbia and we are lucky to have his medical expertise and people&rsquo;s skills in putting this plan into effect in Ireland.  He is ahead of the target <Col N="689"/>set, which was to make a 90% transition from the current system to the new arrangements over two years.  By the end of this year, all breast surgery will move to the designated centres.  He is moving on to prostate and lung cancer services and he expects to complete their transition during 2009.  By any standard, that is a major outcome in a short period and it is a performance indicator.</P>
        <P>Many Members feel strongly about the issue but I appeal to them not to confuse the local with the best outcome.  If I were to take a chance and leave the service as it is, I would not be able to live with myself when I know the evidence worldwide is so compelling.  The countries that have done this achieve the best results and Ireland has the capacity to achieve similar results.  Every cancer patient, regardless of where he or she is from, should be given the same chance of survival as the patients from Dublin, Galway or Cork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senators Twomey and Doherty.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  Contrary to what she just stated, health services should be delivered locally, where possible.  This is critically important, as people want to remain in their locality because they respond best in that environment.  That should be our guiding principle and we should only opt for an alternative when the evidence is compelling.  The burden of proof should be to establish a patient should not be cared for locally rather than the reverse.  The Minister has made a compelling case for centres of excellence and empirical evidence suggests they should be provided but it is not right that, north of a line between Dublin and Galway, a centre of excellence will not be provided.  That is active discrimination against a significant proportion of our population and it is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced and I do not have sufficient evidence that there is budgetary provision for the centres of excellence and the necessary ancillary facilities.  How will next week&rsquo;s announcements impinge on resources?  We were told in 2007 there would be no cutbacks but there has been a plethora of cutbacks since then.  How do we know the resources will be available to provide the centres of excellence?  If we are not convinced of that now, why proceed with dismantling existing facilities before the centres of excellence are in place?</P>
        <P>Take the example of primary care.  There are not enough general practitioners to implement primary care.  The concept of primary care is great but there are no resources.  There is also the example of Monaghan hospital, which is now effectively closed.  There were 3,000 admissions per year to that hospital while Cavan hospital has 5,000 admissions per year.  The total is 8,000 and that number will now be loaded onto Cavan hospital, but there is no evidence that it has adequate resources to cope with it.  In fact, one of the wards in Cavan hospital has no staff resources.  While the philosophy and the grand statements are fine, there is no evidence of resources to support them.  That has been the case with primary care and in a range of services and hospitals throughout the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish with a compelling point, and if the Minister can dispute it I will be happy for her do so.  I understand that before attending the centre of excellence in Galway, the patients will be seen by the same personnel of oncologist, radiologist, pathologist and surgeon in Letterkenny and Mayo as will see them in Galway.  What is the logic of that?  In what way will it enhance the welfare of those patients to be seen by the same personnel in Galway?  The logic of that escapes me.  Where possible, we should keep services local.</P>
<Col N="690"/>
        <P Just="Left">Finally, although it is not germane to this debate, it is an abomination that the Minister is proceeding with the co-location plan.  It is wrong to put a two tier health system in place and to give public hospital grounds for private hospitals to create a system for the rich, famous and powerful.  The location of private hospitals on the same grounds as public hospitals will mean the public hospitals will ultimately become the slums of hospital care because money dictates these things.  That is wrong.  It is also wrong to have a grand plan for cancer services without a statement of specific resources to match it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry I do not have enough time to go through the issues.  However, I reject the Minister&rsquo;s efforts and those of Professor Drumm and other Ministers and colleagues.  They are trying to induce a guilt trip in public representatives and local communities when they suggest we are irresponsible in seeking the retention of services at Sligo and Mayo.  In the motion we are calling for safe facilities and services and satellite units linked to the Galway centre.</P>
        <P>However, this is nothing new from the Minister and this Government.  They have consistently argued for centralisation of hospital care and have implemented it in a number of cases.  This is far removed from reality.  When there is centralisation, people die or they accept inferior treatment because they and their families have to travel shorter distances.  The Minister talks about Professor Keane as if he is a person who knows everything but Professor Keane is only implementing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay, but the Minister referred to him many times.</P>

	<P>He is mentioned in the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>He is implementing a Government strategy.  That strategy calls for eight centres of excellence.  Nobody is arguing for radio-oncology and everything that goes with it in all these centres but eight centres is too few.</P>
        <P>I attended a public meeting on this which was packed with cancer patients and people who have gone through the system.  They are demanding that these centres are kept open.  I urge Members on the Government side of the House to support the patients in the north west and the people who are asking us to do the right thing tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I also know doctors who work in British Columbia.  Some of them came back to work in Ireland.  They tell me that the regional hospitals in Ireland are not a patch on the smaller hospitals in Canada.  That is the reality.  There is neither the number of consultants nor the equipment in the hospitals in this country to do what the Minister has described.  No matter what high notions the Minister might have about saving people&rsquo;s lives, she has not put the resources into it.  Until she does, she will not save those lives.</P>
        <P>It would be far more appropriate for the Minister to put the funding into the eight centres now and, when we return to this in 12 or 24 months, the Minister can show us the comparisons between the resources those eight centres have and what she wants to take away now.  We see what has happened in the north east where the Minister&rsquo;s Cabinet colleague has confirmed that there is no money for a new hospital there.  If the same thing happens in this case, there will be no money for cancer services to treat patients.  In the meantime, however, the Minister <Col N="691"/>will have closed down the services that are already available to patients in hospitals throughout the country on the basis of something she calls reform.  The Minister should first build up the services in the eight centres and when we debate this again in 12 or 24 months we will make the comparisons the Minister mentions.  At present, however, it is a phoney war.  The Minister is not putting the resources into this and she will not save people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has a very difficult job and has had to make very difficult decisions.  This issue was unclear for many people until they met the man who cannot be named, Mr. Keane, and listened to him.  It is one thing for a politician to say something, it is another for a clinician to say it.  Almost ten years ago I was asked by Europa Donna to go to London for a meeting with clinicians.  The clinicians made it clear that they realised politicians would want their local service to remain as close to home as possible.  In three major cancer hospitals in London, however, the clinicians pleaded with us not to fight a parochial battle for a local hospital but to fight for the multidisciplinary team that will deliver best results for patients.  Patients must come first.  This has been a difficult issue for the Minister and for many public representatives throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The patient&rsquo;s survival is the core issue.  My father died from cancer.  The debate appears to have centred on breast cancer but there are many other types of cancer.  When somebody contracts that disease, one would be willing to take them to the moon if they could be cured.  I want patients in Ireland to have the best potential for survival.  Mr. Keane has convinced me that we can do it.  I commend the Department on seeking his replacement at present so this process can continue.  There is nothing worse than a good start and not finishing something, and people are concerned about that as much as anything else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that a surgeon is ready to take up his post in Letterkenny at the beginning of August.  The idea that there are no facilities north of a line from Galway to Dublin was true a decade ago but if we are true republicans and believe in a 32 county Ireland, we must develop the links with Derry and Belfast.  We must ensure we have equality of access to the services there because they are known to be as good as services in the rest of the world.</P>
        <P>There is so much one can say on this issue.  I urge the Minister to continue to fund the service.  The amendment to the motion states that the system is funded and is designed to have the patient at its core.  Like everybody in this Chamber, I want fewer people to die from cancer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending the debate tonight but I regret the inflexibility of her response to a reasonable, balanced and well considered motion.  I hope the Minister has listened carefully to the excellent points that were made.  Clearly, Members did not have enough time to put forward the points they wished to make.  I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s concern for patient safety but Members on this side of the House have spent the past year highlighting the risks to patients under the current Government&rsquo;s policies and the actions undertaken in the reform of the HSE.  One need only mention Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley, Susie Long, the women in Portlaoise, Cork and Limerick,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The cutbacks are compromising patient safety.  The care of elderly people is being compromised by the lack of home care packages.  Care for young people with disabilities is being compromised because they are being sent to nursing homes where they become infected with MRSA.  Patient safety is being compromised in all sorts of ways.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A number of Senators have highlighted how this is a debate on the issues of access and equity.  The motion refers to the &ldquo;absence of a Centre of Excellence north of a line from Dublin to Galway&rdquo;.  There is a geographical inequality.  We ask the Minister to listen and respond to our comments.  Professor Keane was invited to Ireland to implement a strategy, but Deputy Harney is the Minister and she has the ability to change the strategy.  She can respond to the requests set out in the motion to have a centre of excellence in the north west and to develop the satellite unit model because there is international evidence that they work.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Minister stated that the consultant surgeon and his team will travel to Galway where there is one bed for patients from County Mayo and one bed for patients from County Sligo.  How could this constitute a service?  The Minister is closing centres in which patients have confidence.  The patients treated therein and their families must feel undermined by some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments when she quotes international research.  While that research is all very well, one must consider the figures.  When Senator MacSharry quoted the figures in respect of counties Mayo and Sligo, the Minister did not respond in detail to the points made concerning survival rates.</P>

	<P>I speak on behalf of St. Phelim&rsquo;s national school, Leiter, Bailieborough, County Cavan, the roll number for which has been provided with the motion.</P>
        <P>St. Phelim&rsquo;s national school got a welcome new classroom and resource room under the devolved scheme in 2007, for which it was grant-aided, and additional funding in July 2007.  In March 2008 the architects sent a letter to the board of management of the school which outlined <Col N="695"/>further unseen emergency works needed to bring the building up to building regulation and health and safety standards, particularly, in relation to septic tank, waste water treatment and percolation area.  The letter identified a number of items, three of which I will outline, but there are also serious health and safety issues.</P>
        <P>There is a need to provide a new waste water treatment system and percolation area.  The current septic tank is not large enough to cope with the capacity of the existing school and the new extension.  It is quickly filling up and overflowing onto site and playground area in wet weather.  For health and safety reasons, a new large waste water treatment system must be installed.  There is currently no percolation area for the septic tank.  When the tank overflows it pollutes surrounding ground water.  A new percolation system also needs to be installed along with the new waste water treatment system.  It is a shocking situation that needs immediate rectification.</P>
        <P>There is a need to provide non-slip floor covering in existing toilets and to replace the existing urinal.  The gravity of that matter does not need elaboration in terms of health and safety.</P>
        <P>Another item on the list from the architect, who comes from a reputable firm of architects, seeks the replacement of sanitary ware.  The existing sanitary urinals in the toilet are leaking and the sinks in classrooms, where new hot water taps need to be installed, will need to be replaced with new sanitary ware.</P>
        <P>A number of other areas need to be dealt with.  There is a need for double glazed external windows in all areas of the school, the existing flat roof is leaking and causing a problem, internal ceiling soffits on the flat roof need to be insulated, new electric hot water heaters need to be mounted properly, and fire compliance electrical works are needed.  From a reputable firm of architects I present a critical list of the unavoidable extra improvements needed.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the provision of the new classroom and resource room.  The critical list of improvements needed arises from a huge population bulge in that area, as a consequence of a migration from Dublin and a new developing population in that area.  These are health and safety issues.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State in these areas.  However, I do not think the Minister of State, his officials or any of us have discretion on this issue.  There is a compelling need for these improvements.  I do not raise the matter lightly.  I have been approached by the management of the school, concerned parents and the contractor on the job who said the school is not sustainable in its present form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House.  I thank my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, for sharing time and commend him on raising this matter on the Adjournment.  </P>
        <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the need to provide additional funding towards essential improvement works at St. Phelim&rsquo;s national school in Bailieborough.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, made strong representations in support of the permanent accommodation scheme 2007 application submitted to the Department of Education and Science by the board of management.  Thankfully, that application was successful and the building project is under way at the school, funded under that scheme.  I am aware my colleague has made representations to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in regard to obtaining additional funding to carry out improvement works, so eloquently outlined by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  Those works should be undertaken at the same time as the substantial building project that is currently under way.</P>
<Col N="696"/>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the provision of additional funding based on the essential works that need to be carried out, as outlined by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly who has my support in this regard.  I urge the Minister of State, through his good offices, to progress the application as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising the matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the Department&rsquo;s position regarding the allocation of funding to St. Phelim&rsquo;s national school, Bailieborough, County Cavan.  The management authorities of the school applied and were approved for funding under the 2007 permanent accommodation scheme to provide additional accommodation at the school.  A grant of &euro;180,000 was originally sanctioned to enable the school to extend the existing school building.  A further &euro;26,617 was approved on appeal by the school.</P>
        <P>The Department moved towards a model of devolved funding, responsibility and authority, as appropriate for smaller building projects-refurbishments, directly to school management authorities in 2003 with the introduction on a pilot basis of the devolved small schools and permanent accommodation schemes.  Due to the positive feedback from schools, the schemes were extended to include additional schools in subsequent years.  The permanent accommodation scheme allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project.  The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.  A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools granted discretion and funding must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensure value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participation in the scheme or to drop out if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits is a matter for each school authority.</P>
        <P>The authorities of St. Phelim&rsquo;s national school accepted the grant offer and returned a form of undertaking agreeing to comply with the requirements of the scheme.  The school authorities submitted an appeal for significant additional funding, which was considered by the Department.  However, in line with the original intention of the scheme, it was considered that the school should be encouraged to complete the project within the funding envelope provided.  In the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to entertain such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to schools.  It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.  The board of management should take the necessary steps to ensure the scope of the works undertaken matches the funding allowed.</P>
        <P>I regret that the response is not more favourable on this occasion, but I am sure Senators will agree it is important that we ensure that grant aid is managed prudently.  As the Senators may be aware, a total of &euro;586 million will be spent under the Department&rsquo;s school building programme this year alone.  It is important to ensure that costs are kept under control in the construction of school buildings and that those responsible ensure value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.  In that way, we can ensure completion of the maximum number of projects <Col N="697"/>from within the funds available for the school building programme under the current national development plan.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senators for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very disappointed with the response.  In the school in question the building work is not discretionary, it is a matter of health and safety.  That is not a good signal to send to children or their parents.  I have been approached by the entire community.  My colleague in the area, councillor Sean McKiernan, informed me that parents are very angry and find the situation unsustainable.  If we do not provide adequate health and safety for children in schools what signal are we sending?  We cannot leave it up to them to protect themselves.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to reconsider.  I will not go on at length in deference to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and my colleague, Senator McFadden, who wishes to raise another matter but I reserve the right to continue my campaign.  I appeal to the Minister of State to re-examine the matter.  I take his point about the management of money but we cannot allow children to be at risk next September.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the presence of one of my favourite Ministers, Deputy Haughey.  He is becoming well versed on this important issue.  I refer to the need for the Minister for Health and Children to decide a way forward for the introduction of arts therapies into special schools, given the proven benefits in Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, Buncrana, of the one year of music therapy for special needs students, now threatened with withdrawal.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, has heard me refer to this issue more often than most Ministers, yet it does not make it any less valid to raise tonight the need for music therapy in the school in question.  Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Buncrana is a school of 651 students with one principal, 25 mainstream class teachers, three learning support teachers, two resource teachers, eight teachers in eight special classes and three temporary language support teachers.  The school has four special classes for children with autism; two moderate classes, one severe and profound class and one class for special learning difficulties.  The school evidently knows something about special needs.</P>
        <P>I managed to secure approximately &euro;60,000 last year, a small percentage of which was for administration, but most of which was to fund the appointment of a music therapist in the school.  The results were monitored and the school recorded a significant success.  Some of those involved gave evidence recently to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science.  They indicated that 60 out of the 690 children got access to the music therapist.  One of the parents outlined the case of her ten year old daughter who has autism, who had not been able to blow or suck but who had made progress following music therapy.  She got to the stage where she could blow out the candles on her birthday cake and suck juice with a straw from a glass, which she had not been able to do previously.</P>
        <P>Music therapy is sometimes misunderstood as someone playing a guitar while everybody sings and enjoys themselves.  That is not the case; it is a clinical intervention to assist people <Col N="698"/>especially with vocal skills but other skills also.  The principal, Sinead McLaughlin, asked for an extension of the funding which had come from a children-at-risk fund but it was not possible to do that.  The children are at risk in one respect but that is not the case from another perspective.  The principal was told that funding for a music therapist had to come from the Health Service Executive but the HSE did not accept that point because the therapy involved a school.  In order to implement the spirit of the EPSEN Act, we need a mechanism whereby the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children can come together to decide what is working.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State used the term &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; in his previous reply.  For a maximum of &euro;50,000 we could continue to have 60 special needs students advance and be supported in their development.  Music therapy has proven to be effective both here and in many other countries.  I accept that professional recognition is required and we are dealing with that.  The question arises of how one controls the demand for music therapy.  First, by definition, there are only a certain number of special schools in the country and, second, there is a finite number of qualified music therapists.  I would not allow someone to play a guitar to a class of students with special needs and call it music therapy.  Either we provide the real thing or nothing at all.</P>
        <P>The reason I have tabled the motion again is that I believe in what I say and it is backed up by clinical proof.  I cannot arrange a meeting between someone in the Department of Education and Science who is responsible for special education and someone in the HSE.  I urge the Minister of State to undertake to arrange a meeting between the relevant person in the Department with responsibility for special education, the relevant person in the HSE, the principal of the school and me.  I do not wish to solve the problem for just one person because I know that sets precedents, and I want to solve the problem for everybody.  The situation in question could be resolved for the want of a small amount of money.  I am sure we invest far more in areas where we might not be able to see the outcome.</P>
        <P>In this case, however, a clinical trial has been carried out and evidence exists to stand over it.  Anybody who heard what was said before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science would recognise that this case has merit.  There is a very serious issue in that those responsible for special education can claim this is a health issue and those responsible for health can claim it is an education issue.  We had a long meeting on Monday with the National Council for Special Education to discuss SNA provision.  The same issue came up.  SNAs are not there to solve all the problems.  There are issues within the health area and health professionals need to be brought in.  Even the National Council for Special Education accepts that the two sides are not talking to each other in a meaningful way, which is the crux of the problem.  If people saw what was happening action would be taken to address the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this important issue raised by the Senator.  I wish to emphasise the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to providing a high-quality service to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have made in disability services in recent years.  Between 1997 and 2006, additional revenue and capital funding of &euro;851 million has been invested in health-funded support services for people with disabilities of which &euro;549 million was provided for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
        <P>To fund the requirements for service development for HSE funded services, the Government has set aside specific funds for service delivery for people with disabilities by way of the multi-<Col N="699"/>annual investment programme.  An additional sum of &euro;75 million for revenue purposes was provided for disability services in each of the past two years under the programme, with a further &euro;50 million being made available in 2008.  The Minister has been assured by the HSE that while the commencement of some services had been delayed this year due to a financial review, it is now in a position to roll out the planned disability developments as outlined in its 2008 service plan.</P>
        <P>The priority in 2008 is on continuing to enhance the assessment and support services for children with disabilities.  This will also help to build the additional capacity in multidisciplinary and other support services, required under the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  As a further significant development in support of the national disability strategy, the Office for Disability and Mental Health was established by the Government in January of this year.  The office brings together responsibility for different policy areas and a range of services which impact on the lives of people with a disability and mental health difficulties.  The main focus of the office is to improve co-ordination and communication across Departments and Government agencies in the delivery of disability and mental health services.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, music, drama, art and dance therapy are collectively known as the creative arts therapies with music therapy being the most popular and more widely used, but drama, art and dance therapy continue to be developed in health care settings.  Music therapy may be offered, on an individual or group basis, to people of all ages who have physical, learning, social or emotional difficulties.  Therapists work most commonly with individuals with special needs, with the elderly and with stroke victims.</P>
        <P>In the specific case raised by the Senator, the Department of Health and Children understands from the Health Service Executive that a music therapist was funded through the Department of Education and Science for one year under an arts grant programme.  I am advised that as this funding was granted on a once-off basis, the school is now seeking alternative funding from the Health Service Executive and other sources, including national lottery funding.</P>
        <P>While the benefits of music therapy in Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, Buncrana are recognised by many, the significant demands on resources for disability services, together with the need for the HSE to live within its overall budget for the year, means that it is unlikely that music therapy would be prioritised in this instance.  The HSE did, however, submit a business case to the Department of Health and Children in April 2008 for the statutory recognition of the creative arts therapies, including music therapy.  The matter is under consideration at present and the Department of Health and Children intends to explore this issue further with the HSE.  I will take the Senator&rsquo;s request for a meeting back to the relevant section in my Department, the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I always appreciate the time he has taken when he comes to Athlone and the midlands in his role with responsibility for adult education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The three schools about which I seek information regarding building projects are Coosan national school, Athlone Community College and Ballymahon Community College.  Coosan national school is a 14-teacher national school on the outskirts of Athlone.  Enrolment has expanded rapidly in recent years.  As the Minister of State will be aware, Athlone is a gateway town the population of which is expected to double in coming years.  The school has 248 pupils, which puts great demands on the physical structure of the school.  The school has eight prefabs, some of which were closed for periods of time during the year due to vermin infestation which is appalling and unacceptable.</P>
        <P>In January 2007, the Department approved a new school building with 14 classrooms and four auxiliary rooms.  Although the design team was appointed, funding has yet to be sanctioned.  While I am sure the Minister of State hears this throughout the country, this is very important for the pupils and teachers of the school.  I ask him to clarify the position on the school.</P>
        <P>Athlone Community College has 1,000 post-primary pupils.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment several times previously.  It was with delight that I received a phone call today informing me that the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has agreed to meet with the Oireachtas Members who represent Longford-Westmeath.  I look forward to hearing what he has to say.  While it might be pre-empting that meeting, I ask the Minister of State to ask him for clarification as to when we might have a commencement date for the building of the new school.  As the Minister of State is aware, Athlone Community College has had very high academic and sporting achievements and has an holistic and caring manner.  It caters for all pupils and especially for those with special needs.</P>
        <P>There are great health and safety risks for pupils and teachers in Athlone Community College.  There are serious issues with the roof and space is of serious concern.  Windows cannot be opened and there are other problems.  Land has been purchased by Westmeath VEC from Athlone Town Council.  Considerable preliminary work has been done and a design has been put in place following consultation with parents and teachers.  I ask the Minister of State to expedite the building.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding Ballymahon Community College, I understand members of Longford VEC will meet the Minister on 9 July.  I also look forward to that meeting.  A grant of &euro;1.3 million was allocated last year.  In December 2007, the Department of Education and Science contacted the architect to stop all plans.  Where is grant of &euro;1.3 million?  Has it been ring-fenced for the refurbishment of this school?  There are 200 pupils receiving an excellent schooling.  It has an ABA special unit, which is housed in a prefab.  The old building is in a desperate state and I ask the Minister to give me clarification on this.  These are three very worthy projects and obviously warrant urgent attention because they already have been approved by the Department of Education and Science.  What is different this year compared to last year?  I cannot <Col N="701"/>accept it is all about money.  The money is there.  If not, is it gone somewhere else?  In the interests of health and safety I ask that these three building projects be expedited urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position on the building projects for Coosan national school, Athlone Community College and Ballymahon Community College.  Modernising facilities in approximately 3,200 primary and 730 post primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme from just more than &euro;90 million in 1997 to almost &euro;600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.  As the Senator may be aware, a developing area unit was set up recently in the Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The developing areas unit of the Department has identified Athlone as an area of rapid development.  A decision has been already taken to replace and expand the existing Athlone Community College.  The new building, when complete, will cater for 1,000 pupils.  The proposal for Coosan national school is to construct a new 16-classroom generic repeat design facility on the existing school site.  Both projects have advanced to the point where the next step is the appointment of a design team.  The status of all schools in Athlone, including Athlone Community College and Coosan national school, is being assessed as part of an overall delivery plan, which is currently being formulated within the developing areas unit.  The policy and modernisation unit of the Department has appointed the design team to the Ballymahon Community College project and a stage 2, that is an initial sketch scheme, has been approved by the Department subject to certain technical requirements being adhered to.</P>
        <P>While I am not in a position to give a timetable for the progression of Coosan national school, Athlone Community College or Ballymahon Community College, I reiterate that the need for new school buildings for the schools in question is acknowledged by the Department.  As with all large capital projects currently on hand within the developing areas unit and policy and modernisation unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on Coosan national school, Athlone Community College and Ballymahon Community College.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Was there a need to establish a developing area unit when all these projects had been already approved, funding allocated and design teams approved?  I accept that the Minister says Athlone is a developing area and I have outlined the same, that <Col N="702"/>we are part of the spatial strategy.  I reiterate my question: where has the money that was already allocated gone?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Education and Science announced projects under the school building and modernisation programme earlier this year and most of them are focused on rapidly developing areas.  When the new Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe took over he took time to brief himself.  I expect further announcements to be made during the year as the financial situation is reviewed in the Department and as the Minister familiarises himself with all programmes and projects that have applied for funding.  The funding has been made available to the Department and that is being further considered by the new Minister.</P>
