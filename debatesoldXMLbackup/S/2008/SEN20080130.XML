    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re time limit for the Order of Business, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re custodial sentences, referral to committee, to be taken without debate; No. 3, statements on the 70th anniversary of the Constitution; and No. 4, Private Members&rsquo; business, an all-party motion recognising the epidemic in our society of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use, especially cocaine and related substances, and acknowledging the need for a co-ordinated cross-departmental approach to this problem, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to concluded at 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a discussion last session about the time limits on the Order of Business.  My understanding was that we would return to this matter in the appropriate committee.  I will be opposing the Order of Business today on the basis that we should have further discussion about extending the time allowed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In the six weeks since we last met, we have seen worrying signs of an economic slowdown.  Just this morning we heard of over 300 jobs which are to be lost in Arklow.  Economic times are clearly getting tougher, but what is more worrying is that we have seen unprecedented wealth squandered.  We have seen a lack of reform in the health service. <Col N="491"/> Everybody should listen to recent recordings of &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; in the last few weeks, which dealt with young women and men suffering from cystic fibrosis, or they should read the interviews given by Orla Tinsley on cystic fibrosis in this country.  There has been a complete lack of services and the health service has been a sham for them and their families.  It is extraordinary that in this time of boom, we have one of the highest incidences of cystic fibrosis in the world and yet we have tolerated such shoddy treatment over the past ten years, despite the eloquent calls of the young sufferers from this disease.  What impact did the boom have on these people and on the services they were looking to receive from the State?</P>
        <P>A 12 year old was featured on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; this week who has a curvature of the spine.  She was reliant on a private businessman donor coming forward and offering &euro;100,000 in order for her to have an operation in England.  Where is the National Treatment Purchase Fund for such a young woman and where is the HSE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is making the decisions and why has she been left waiting a year and a half?  What is the explanation, who is accountable and who is responsible?  I could go on.</P>
        <P>Yesterday a memorandum regarding cutbacks was issued.  Given that we are moving into trickier economic times, what is going to happen now in the health service?  There are to be cutbacks.  Tallaght hospital has indicated its intention to impose cuts.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan, is reducing non-emergency orthopaedic surgery by 25%.  Last night I heard of an elderly woman who is in pain and will have to wait 18 months for a hip operation.  Non-emergency surgery is being cut in County Louth and within the Cavan-Monaghan General Hospital group an emergency treatment room, which opened very recently at the cost of &euro;1 million, is being shut down.  The list goes on.</P>
        <P>What is happening in the health service, especially at a time of an economic downturn, when this is the quality of treatment that people are being subjected to?  There is a lack of confidence in the Taoiseach and people do not believe he is telling the truth.  How can people have confidence in the health service and in the ability of the Government to deliver, given the litany of cases I have outlined, and which seem to need airing on national radio to get any attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the point made by Senator Fitzgerald as regards No. 1 being taken without debate and the time limit on the Order of Business.  This was discussed in the House before and referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It has not been disposed of by the CPP, and it is inappropriate to force a <Col N="492"/>division on it today.  I regret that the Leader insists on doing that.  It is unnecessary and should be dealt with by the CPP. </P>
        <P>There is now something of a quandary.  If the Order of Business goes through, No. 1 will have been taken without debate which will lead to much unhappiness on the Opposition benches.  I have reviewed the Order of Business over the years since the foundation of the State and lengthy debates have taken place at intervals.  When he was leader of the Opposition, former Senator Jim Dooge spoke for approximately 45 minutes on an issue on the Order of Business, and it was not ruled out of order.</P>
        <P>We have imposed limits on contributions since then and nobody disagrees with that concept.  However, the amount of time given to issues is of concern to many people and in view of this I ask the Leader to reconsider, to see whether the matter may be addressed this week.  If there is no agreement at that point, then it is fair enough to bring the proposal back into the House.  The current proposal constitutes a bad start to the session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of the child with autism whose parents are faced with an extraordinary legal bill has seized public attention this week.  I do not necessarily agree with what the parents are trying to do.  I have told the House before I believe applied behavioural analysis, ABA, is a perfectly good system, but that the Department of Education and Science should have more eclectic arrangements in place.  However, that is not the issue.  The point is that the parents in question were acting constitutionally as prime educators of their child.  They were driven to do something, as there was an imperative on them to do the best for their child.  They had no option but to take the matter to its limit.  They have done all of us a service by so doing.  I am not arguing with the outcome in the courts.  The courts came to a decision, right or wrong.  However, it is wrong, unfair and undemocratic that these people are now being made bankrupt by fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities and imperatives. </P>
        <P>The House passed the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act in 2004.  I appealed at that stage for a commencement date to be included.  The Minister refused and I was told that parts of the Act would be commenced over time.  The Act allowed for the involvement of parents at the assessment stage of a child with educational needs.  It provided for an appeal as part of the assessment.  It then involved teachers, psychologists, other professionals and parents in the determination of the resources required and, again, the parents have an appeal process built into that.</P>
        <P>In terms of the application of resources, it involved a series of professionals and allowed the <Col N="493"/>parents to make appeals.  There were to be three systems of appeal, which were accepted and promoted by the Government as an extraordinary commitment on the basis that there would never be a shortage of resources for children with special educational needs.  The State&rsquo;s refusal to commence the appropriate sections of the Education for People with Special Educational Needs Act, EPSEN, has driven these parents to go the route of the law as far as the Supreme Court to try to get what is best for their child.  There would have been no need for them to have done so had we put in place what was passed by the Oireachtas.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to implement the appropriate sections, or 90%, of the EPSEN Act, means these parents are now in this quandary.  We owe them something and I ask the Leader to bring it to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not see the necessity for the proposal in respect of the Order of Business having to be agreed in the manner suggested by the Leader.  I agree with those speakers who stated this matter was not resolved in the previous session.  I would not have thought there would have been a major problem with the matter being left to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to be discussed further.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In case I am giving the impression that I believe there ought to be a change, previously I expressed the view that 40 minutes is a reasonable duration.  I want to be straight about what my view is.  I do not see why other Members, on both sides of the House who need those extra minutes on the Order of Business should not have them.  The CPP might like to see us having a further debate about it to get the duration right.  I do not see the problem with sending it back to that committee.  I disagree with the Leader that the matter must be resolved in such a quick manner at the beginning of the session.  I support it being returned to the CPP.</P>
        <P>On a related matter, a debate has taken place during the past 24 hours on the amount of legislation being presented by the Government to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It raises a real credibility issue for both Houses.  It is remarkable how little legislation has been proposed by the Government since the Houses first sat last autumn.  The Government Chief Whip made the point that it is early days for the new Government and this is what happens.  Perhaps there is something to this.  Legislation proposed by the Opposition, however, such as a Bill on climate change or witness protection, gets short shrift from Ministers coming to the House who politely tell us where to put our proposals.  We know legislation can be produced quickly and put through the Houses as we saw prior to Christmas when the Government believed it needed to have legislation passed to deal with what it saw as a crisis.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and explain his proposal to issue a directive in <Col N="494"/>respect of the retention of all e-mail and Internet activity by citizens of the State for a period of three years?  This should be done prior to the issuing of such a directive so at least we can have some debate before such a far-reaching measure is implemented.</P>
        <P>We know a basis exists for orders being made to preserve this type of information, as we have seen in high-profile criminal cases where the Garda needed such information preserved.  We all support that.  However, this is a blanket provision for the retention of records of all e-mails and exchanges over the Internet of every citizen of the State.  Surely this should be the subject of legislation and debated in both Houses.  It may be justifiable although I doubt such a blanket provision can be justified.  Regardless of whether it is justifiable, it is amenable to a debate in this House during which people can express their views.  It is not suitable for the Government to put it through by way of ministerial order without public debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House as soon as possible to respond to the announcement in my constituency today, which has caused great concern, to the effect that Allergan will close its operations in Arklow and relocate to low-cost Costa Rica.  This is a matter of grave concern for the 350 employees working for the firm who have been left in a position of great uncertainty.  Most of them, like the rest of us, have mortgages, young families, car loans and so forth and all of them are facing into an uncertain future.  I ask that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come before the House to outline the strategy his Department will adopt in response to a worrying trend whereby companies are increasingly relocating their operations not on the basis of poor performance or problems with profit margins but because of the attractiveness of low-cost locations in other parts of the world.</P>
        <P>The House should also seek a commitment that the Minister will pursue the matter of finding a replacement industry for Arklow, a designated growth centre under the strategic planning guidelines and a town with a young and growing population.  In recent years, the IDA has been asked to be more proactive in securing industry for Arklow but has not yet managed to deliver.  I ask that the Minister come before the House to address the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Education and Science come before the House to address the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in judgment, which is a matter of concern.  I would like to hear her response to the decision by the High Court not to allow the costs incurred by the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family to be covered.  This was a public interest case involving a couple who were seeking to secure appropriate education for their young son with autism.  The form of education in ques<Col N="495"/>tion, ABA, is available in other areas and the programme for Government includes a commitment to make permanent the 12 ABA schools currently operating on an interim basis.  It appears that if one lives in County Wicklow, as the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in parents do, one&rsquo;s child is not able to access this specialised, important methodology for working with children with autism at an early stage.  If, however, they lived over the county border in Dublin, they would be able to access this form of education.  This is extremely unfair.</P>
        <P>The &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in parents argued an important case in the High Court.  It was an unusually long hearing which lasted for 69 days.  Under the High Court ruling issued yesterday they will have to bear their legal costs.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister come before the House to outline her views on the case.  I hope the appeal to the Supreme Court will result in a different judgment for the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Fine Gael Party spokesperson on education, I am astounded by the High Court decision that the parents of a seven year old autistic child, the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins, are not entitled to legal costs of seven figures.  The couple were doing no more than defending their legal entitlement to an appropriate education for their son.  The key word in this context is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  They wanted applied behavioural analysis &mdash; ABA &mdash; tuition.  Much quantitative evidence is available from families whose children have received this education to show that it works.  I have also observed this method working in a school in Galway, &Aacute;balta. </P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very concerned by the decision of the High Court in this case.  First, the parents were failed by the State which did not provide appropriate education and early intervention for their son for years.  Now the courts are putting the fear of God into 150 families who may also wish to defend their legal entitlement to appropriate education.  The Minister favours an eclectic approach to education for autistic children.  I have not seen supporting research for this approach.  The issue will be raised at the Joint Committee on Education and Science which is discussing this area.  Cost should not be a factor in the provision of education for children with autism.  Appropriate education is what matters because it will, in the long run, lead to the formation of independent young adults.  Evidence in support of ABA is available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand RTE intends to cease its medium wave transmission service on RTE Radio 1 as and from March.  I have received correspondence from Britain and I am told that if this service is withdrawn it will impact severely on the Irish community in Britain, especially on the older members of the community.  These people had to leave Ireland <Col N="496"/>before the Celtic tiger was born and at the same time they made a huge contribution to Ireland by sending back money at a time when it was badly needed.  They still make a contribution to tourism because they come back to Ireland regularly.  They have been taken for granted often and have been ignored as well.  One thing they have always appreciated has been that they can keep in touch with the homeland through radio.  I know from going to Britain that programmes such as &ldquo;C&eacute;il&iacute; House&rdquo;, &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte Isteach&rdquo; and GAA activities are all the lifeline they have back to Ireland.  Would it not be sad when the Celtic tiger is alive and well that we would take this service from them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not well. How can the Senator say that?  In fact it is quite ill.</P>

	<P>He will not.  It would be very sad, at this time when the Celtic tiger is alive and well, if this particular service were to be withdrawn from the Irish community in Britain.  I ask RTE to revisit this decision.  Whatever the cost, it is the one thing we owe the Irish community in Britain.  I hope that from this House we can take a stand for them because I have heard people here bemoaning the difficulties the older Irish generation must contend with.  Often they do not have pensions or social back-up.  It is vital that we leave with them what they appreciate, that is, RTE Radio 1.  I hope RTE will reconsider that decision.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite my disagreement over the state of health of the Celtic tiger I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about the RTE Radio 1 medium wave service, especially because it will represent a further downgrading of the broadcasting of religious services on Sundays and that is very regrettable.</P>
        <P>I wish to turn to the business of the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in<b> </b>family.  I have had the pleasure of meeting <Col N="497"/>Mrs. &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in.  She is a person who is motivated very strongly by the welfare of her son.  It is instructive that legislators on all sides of this House have said today it is a matter of public interest because, to my surprise, the judge in his judgment said it was not of sufficient public importance for the court, in exercising its discretion on costs, to justify making an order in favour of the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;ins.  He went on to make the point that under examination Mrs. &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in had said this was not a class action.  Of course she did.  I have been in that situation as well.  I took what was effectively a class action but, on advice from lawyers, I had to say it was not because it would have been ruled out if I had said it was.  That is an unfair advantage to take of evidence which the woman was probably compelled by the nature of the case to give.</P>
        <P>It seems extraordinary to me to neglect the fact that this was plainly a highly significant constitutional point that was determined by the High Court, that is, that the Minister for Education and Science and not the parent or parents had the right to decide what is in the best interests of the child.  This is a significant alteration by the courts to what I understand of Article 42 of the Constitution which reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes and so on and so forth but, more importantly, Article 42.3.1&deg; reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a highly significant constitutional point which has been glossed by this court in a way that is negative for the interests of the parents.  For that reason, it seems this family should be reimbursed.  The Government has made its point.  It wanted to give a family a bloody nose and I understand a significant number of subsequent cases have now been dropped.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It would be shameful to pursue this family into bankruptcy.  The fact that Members on all sides have made this point should give the Government pause to consider.</P>
        <P>This is part of an increasing trend towards autocratic and non-accountable Government, as evidenced by the new immigration Bill, which should be called the ease of deportation Bill because, although it contains some useful <Col N="498"/>measures, it does not live up to the promise clearly given in the programme for Government that there would be access to the courts for all and a system of independent arbitration.  I look forward to a debate on this matter.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Leader also request information on the status of the national marine conservation and educational centre?  I have on record from 2005 the ecstatic welcome given by the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, the then leader of the Green Party, because &euro;2 million in funding was to be made available for this remarkable project, which would be valuable in terms of tourism as well as wildlife conservation.  Yet, I understand, one element has not signed up to the contract so the funding is in danger of being lost.  People like Brendan Price are once again putting their homes on the line to make up this deficiency.  The issue needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, I note that despite everything that has been said, the civil partnership Bill comes under the heading &ldquo;Bills in respect of which heads have yet to be approved by Government&rdquo;.  We have been fobbed off again.  We were told the heads of the Bill had been prepared but nothing has been done.  Why do we not, for example, take the Bill on this issue that was drafted by Senator Bacik and I and let the Government amend it?  It is clear it will do damn all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s request with regard to RTE and the continuation of medium wave services.  Approximately 10% of listeners have medium wave and it is used quite extensively, particularly overseas as well as here at home.  I cannot understand what justification RTE would give for the discontinuation of the service.  Perhaps we could request the Leader to have the matter discussed in the Chamber and bring the responsible Minister to the House.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a discussion on the proposal published on the website of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. James Hamilton, and which I greatly welcome, seeking submissions with regard to policy on the giving of reasons for non-prosecution in many cases?</P>
        <P>I also take this opportunity to ask the DPP why he has re-entered the prosecution on Michael Fahy, the councillor from County Galway who was acquitted in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 28 November.  He suffered eight months in Castlerea Prison and was given a considerable fine but he has recommenced his work as a member of Galway County Council.  Now, the DPP has decided to re-enter a case against him.  This is not prosecution, it is persecution of a man doing his duty &mdash; he brought his mother home for Christmas from a welfare home.  The DPP has decided it was a mistrial, irrespective of the decision by Mr. Justice Finnegan, Mr. Justice <Col N="499"/>Feeney and Ms Justice Irvine that the case was to be thrown out.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances, I ask the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Hamilton, why he has re-entered this case when there are so many cases to be heard before our courts.  It is a waste of public funds and the matter should be left aside.  This man has suffered enough.  I ask the DPP to reconsider his decision.</P>

	<P>We agreed a number of months ago that there would be a debate in the Seanad on the Lisbon Treaty.  When will we have that debate?  It is also agreed that there will be a referendum.  When will we have it?  The Taoiseach and the Government are playing games with the date for the referendum, which is damaging to the prospects of a full and open public debate on the treaty.  I fully appreciate that the Taoiseach has an appointment in Washington following in the tradition of Liam Cosgrave, who addressed the joint Houses of Congress on 17 March 1976.  </P>

	<P>Liam Cosgrave was the first Taoiseach to address both Houses of Congress, followed by Garret FitzGerald on 15 March 1984 and John Bruton on 11 December 1996.  I appreciate this is an important event and I do not wish to take from that.  The Taoiseach also has other appointments, not least with the Mahon tribunal, and these are a distraction but this referendum is important to Ireland and to Europe.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach could announce a date for the referendum without waiting for the adoption of the referendum Bill or the making of the referendum order.  I urge him to do so.  By fixing a date he could allow the debate to begin.  If the referendum is held before the summer it will be like the first Nice treaty referendum, when there will not be enough time for proper information to be provided to the public in the form of facts on the treaty.  The procrastination on fixing a date now appears to be leading to a situation where the referendum may be delayed until the autumn.  That would be most unfortunate because it would allow much of the misinformation currently being circulated to gain currency.  I fully endorse the call in <i>The Irish Times</i> today for the speedy establishment of the referendum commission.  In the interim, however, I ask the Leader to address the issue of legislation and the fixing of a referendum date.</P>

        <P>Before Christmas, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, said that various agencies should co-operate to reduce the number of early school leavers.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister of State to attend the House for a timely debate on early school leaving and the development of vocational skills to support current economic developments.  The debate could also include access funding to ensure that disadvantaged students can attend third level education.  The National Special Education Council could also be involved in the discussions as to how we maintain people with special needs in our system as well as encouraging people back into education who might currently be avoiding school attendance.  I ask the Leader to consider those points in the context of a forthcoming debate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join other speakers in requesting the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House for a debate on the cystic fibrosis issue, including the Pollock report on CF services.  The Minister should also release the report that was promised in December on Dublin maternity services and the implications for such services where delivery rates are approximately 1,000 per annum.  I wish to ask the Minister if existing services, such as colposcopy services, will be cut when cervical screening starts.  Breast screening services in the local hospital in south Tipperary have been transferred to Waterford with the indication that next year colon and prostate services will be transferred to Waterford.  I have a serious concern that the erosion of local health services will be to the detriment of the population of the area in which I live.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to deal with these issues?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a number of matters.  First, I would like to issue an SOS call.  I have asked the Leader on three or four occasions about the long awaited Cork-Swansea ferry service and I am seriously con<Col N="501"/>cerned that the route may not materialise this year.  We were without a ferry last year and the service is of critical importance to the local economy in Cork and Kerry and the tourism industry, in particular, and to people living in remote parts of west Cork and Kerry.  Will the Leader redouble his efforts to make progress on this before we are on the rocks totally?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Second, I refer to the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in decision in the High Court.  I accept it is an extremely sad, difficult decision and the case ran in the High Court for a long time.  However, the court has decided on this delicate issue.  Mr. Justice Peart is an excellent judge and having read his <i>obiter dictum</i>, I am under the impression that had a class action been taken on behalf of the approximately 150 children in this autism category, it might have been considered to be have been of sufficient public interest to award costs against the State and the HSE, which would have meant a huge saving for the family.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for taking a class action in this country.  It would have been ruled out immediately if the family had taken a class action.</P>

	<P>That is my reading of the judgment if the decision on costs is appealed to the Supreme Court.  I fully empathise with the family who have my full compassion.</P>
        <P>Third, I refer to an issue close to my heart.  I wish the negotiators and the mediator in the Cork GAA dispute every success.  It would be a travesty of justice for the county that has won most All-Ireland medals that it will be unable to field at team this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I support those who are concerned about the motion to maintain the limit on the Order of Business at 40 minutes.  This matter should be left to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, for a number of reasons.  This is the one <Col N="502"/>occasion in the day when the House is almost full.  In addition, we have not exactly been overburdened with legislation for our consideration.</P>

	<P>In the spirit of debate, the Order of Business presents an opportunity to Senators to raise issues of concern to the public.  I appeal to Senator Cassidy to withdraw the motion in order that it can be deliberated on in the proper way, as suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising the issue of RTE&rsquo;s decision on medium wave transmissions.  I am concerned that RTE does not think sufficiently of its remit as a public service broadcaster.  When it comes to the salaries of its leading lights, one would not think it is a public service broadcaster.  It is all too easy to forget our emigrants and those who tune in to morning mass on a Sunday or whatever else but who do not have long wave or medium wave on their radios.  Before Christmas I raised the shameful lack of radio and television services for elderly people, particularly those in nursing homes.  It is another example of RTE not fulfilling its remit as a public service broadcaster.</P>
        <P>I thank the Labour Party &mdash; something I seldom do &mdash; for its courageous stance in opposing the sex industry and calling for curbs on lap dancing clubs.  At the very least we should give the power to local communities to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to such clubs.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has stated he cannot make a specific commitment on the issue because he does not want to pre-empt a forthcoming Government policy document.  However, if it was a matter pertaining to the environment, he would rightly express his personal views as a Green Party Minister.  Social responsibility demands of us that we give the power to communities to refuse lap dancing clubs because, at the end of the day, the free market stops when we start to exploit other people.  That applies as much to the denial of the integrity of women&rsquo;s bodies as to the sale of organs for medical purposes.  I ask the Government to take a courageous stand by initiating a debate in this House at the earliest opportunity in order that we can all be heard on the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Leader arrange the debate on the marine rescue co-ordination centres in Malin Head and Valencia to which he committed on the Order of Business of 15 December.  He expressed his hope that an all-party agreement could be reached to strenuously oppose the proposal and he wanted to ensure the Minister would attend the House before the Christmas recess.  While that unfortunately did not happen, I hope the debate will be arranged as soon as possible.</P><Col N="503"/>
        <P>I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Noel Ahern, come to the House to discuss the very interesting and positive OPW energy awareness campaign which he launched last Monday.  This campaign will affect the 250 State buildings administered by the OPW.  He announced that as part of the campaign 20 existing oil-fired heating systems will be converted to biomass.  At the same time, however, new buildings are being constructed, including one in Buncrana, County Donegal, to house the decentralisation offices and the local Garda station.  The OPW has advised the best solution for that building is an oil-fired heating system.  I would like the Minister of State to tell the House whether he is serious about this campaign or if it is merely another press release and broken promise.</P>

	<P>I pay tribute to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>  on yesterday&rsquo;s wonderful supplement on drugs.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the health promotion unit of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science because the newspaper&rsquo;s supplement is filling a void created by the absence of Government action.</P>
        <P>I join other Senators in noting the withdrawal by RTE of its medium wave radio service.  I ask that the relevant Minister attend the House in order that we can debate the role of the national broadcaster.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of emigrants abroad but people within the country will not have access to RTE once the medium wave service is lost.  I am particularly conscious that many people listen to religious programmes and sports coverage on medium wave.  A dual commitment, therefore, is being reneged upon by RTE.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Donovan on the urgent need for a debate on the provision of a Cork-Swansea ferry service.  The tourism industry of the south west needs a ferry service but action on this has been lacking.  It would be a shame if another summer passed without such a service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of Education and Science to come to the House to discuss the issue of third level access.  In this regard I refer to mature students and those who recently have lost their jobs because of the turnaround in the fortunes of the Celtic tiger, which unfortunately is quite sick at present, especially in respect of the construction and manufacturing sectors.  It is sad to note that although hundreds of places remain unfilled in a number of third level institutions, people who have been made redundant through no fault of their own are unable to take them up.  A more innovative application process and system should be put in place to facili<Col N="504"/>tate such individual, particularly given the present downturn in the economy.  The phenomenon of idle places is nationwide and is not limited to a single region but is particularly prevalent outside Dublin.</P>
        <P>The suggestion that those who have been made redundant from the construction or manufacturing sectors require &ldquo;upskilling&rdquo; is incorrect as such people already possess skills.  While it is unfortunate that their skills are no longer required, such people need reskilling.  In many cases they must enter a third level institution to do so, therefore, it is regrettable they are not facilitated in respect of the places available.</P>
        <P>An indication that the economy is changing comes from the annual opportunities exhibition taking place in the RDS, at which 16 countries, including most eastern European countries, are advertising to attract back construction industry workers.  They probably will attract some Irish workers at the same time.  This is a sign of the times and four regions in Poland are attempting to do so.  The people in Ireland who are being discommoded and are losing their jobs should be facilitated in respect of third level education.</P>
        <P>When the Minister for Education and Science appears before the House to discuss this issue she could also give Members her opinion in respect of the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in judgment.  In addition, in the absence of the summer works programme she should specify how she proposes to facilitate the maintenance work carried out on schools nationwide during the summer.  Boards of management are under enough pressure to raise funds for their schools without the removal of this grant scheme.</P>

        <P>I ask the Leader whether he can update Members regarding the mid-western development plan, which was put together last May and about which Members have heard nothing.  I am unsure whether it ever will take place, particularly in the wake of the advent of the open skies policy and the possibility that Air France will withdraw its significant cargo service from Shannon Airport.  The Government has committed to a plan for the mid-west but has not yet implemented anything.</P>
        <P>I have asked for a debate on tourism for a long time, a subject close to the Leader&rsquo;s heart.  Before Christmas, the Leader gave a commitment that such a debate would be held in early February.  Has a date been set?  The figures published earlier in January indicate the industry is suffering from what is termed the &ldquo;hole in the doughnut&rdquo;, with the midlands and mid-west losing out.</P>

	<P>One of the main topics discussed so far on the Order of Business has been the state of the economy and the impact the downturn is having on manufacturing jobs nationwide, especially in County Wicklow today.  I join my colleagues in asking for a debate on our economic future.  One likely response to the debate will stress the need for the Government to continue to invest in research, development and innovation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A study published some weeks ago by University College Cork stated that, in spite of the &euro;600 million spent under the previous national development plan and the &euro;1.1 billion to be spent under the current national development plan on research and development through the higher education institutions, no evidence exists of a link between expenditure and actual commercial <Col N="506"/>innovation.  Although we will spend considerable time ascertaining how we can develop a more skilled and innovative economy, the study states our approach is not working.  According to those who work in the business, the &euro;1.1 billion is not being spent in the correct way.  Our debate should focus on the manner in which we stimulate economic innovation and ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent correctly to deliver in this regard.</P>

        <P>I am deeply concerned that such a significant State property as Killarney House remains closed and is deteriorating rapidly.  It is in the heart of Killarney beside our foremost national park and was listed for refurbishment in 2006 in the national park&rsquo;s management plan for the period 2005 to 2009.  There was an opportunity to obtain funding under the national development plan through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and in that regard Killarney interests, spearheaded by the national park liaison committee, submitted a detailed proposal to the relevant authorities.  The proposal required the approval of the sponsoring Department but, sadly, someone in the national parks and wildlife service took it upon himself or herself to withdraw approval.  I am sure it was withdrawn without the Minister&rsquo;s knowledge or approval.  In a visit to Kerry last week, the Minister indicated he is looking elsewhere for funding, exploring all avenues and remains focused on the project.</P>
        <P>What has happened is both sad and maddening and very much against the national interest.  It is akin to national sabotage and it is not how things should happen in our democracy.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister to investigate this matter.  I wish the Minister well in this regard.  Something dastardly has happened and we must get back on track.</P>

        <P>I speak with a vested interest in expressing my surprise at yesterday&rsquo;s call by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, for supermarkets to raise their prices to allow for an increase in the unjustly low payments received by farmers for their produce.  This is the type of issue that should be debated in the context of a wider discussion on Europe.  While EU set-aside provisions mean that farmers within the Union are paid not to grow anything, 1 billion people worldwide go to bed hungry every night.  The debate on the Lisbon treaty, which must incorporate a consideration of the future of agriculture in Europe, should take place urgently to ensure it receives the attention it deserves.  All aspects must be discussed before we can make a decision on it.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s call for a debate on the future of agriculture in Europe.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and other speakers in their request that the Leader reconsider the proposal to limit the Order of Business.  Members on both sides of the House regularly and justifiably complain about the lack of coverage by various media outlets of the proceedings of this House.  Any proposal to limit artificially what is generally the most interesting aspect of our daily business will not assist us in securing increased media interest in our work.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s comments on this week&rsquo;s schedule, which includes only three items of business.  It is unacceptable that the Government proposes to limit the Order of Business when there is so little work on the schedule.  With all due respect to my eminent colleague, Senator Regan, whose contribution to the discussion on the 70th anniversary of the Constitution will undoubtedly be outstanding, there are more important issues to discuss.  There is more than enough time in the schedule to accommodate some of the issues raised by speakers today.</P>
        <P>I share the concerns expressed by Senator Ross and other speakers in regard to the High Court judgment in the &Oacute; Cuanach&aacute;in case.  A debate on this issue should be accommodated later today or tomorrow.</P>
        <P>I support the calls by Senators de B&uacute;rca and Donohoe for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House for a discussion on the increased number of redundancies in the six-week period since the last sitting of the House.  There have been several high-profile closures as well as numerous job losses in smaller businesses.  The Jacob&rsquo;s factory in south Dublin is a landmark industry but production there will cease with significant job losses.  Allergan announced job losses at its plant in Arklow today.  In my area, we have had announcements of the closure of smaller businesses in Freshford, Callan and Kilkenny.  It is appropriate that a debate on this issue should take place this week.</P><Col N="508"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Kelly&rsquo;s comments on the schools summer works scheme.  As a former member of a school board of management, I am outraged at the Minister&rsquo;s decision to terminate this scheme.  There is great pressure on parent councils and boards of management throughout the State to raise funds for the upkeep of schools.  The summer works scheme provided essential services for many schools.  There must be a full debate on how the Government proposes to replace the scheme and on the rationale for its termination.</P>

	<P>I begin by noting the sad passing of a great friend and colleague, the late, great Joe Dolan.  Joe was a lifelong family friend.  Like many people in Westmeath and throughout the midlands, our Christmas finished at 3.15 p.m. on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day.  Joe was a person who uplifted people in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and into the 21st century.  He was the greatest Irish entertainer of his time.  He showed that the world of entertainment was one in which many of us could make our living and generate significant employment.  Up to 10,000 jobs were created in an industry that evolved from the success of showbands.</P>
        <P>Without doubt, Joe Dolan was the greatest Irish artist of his time.  His record &ldquo;Make Me an Island&rdquo; went to No. 1 simultaneously in 14 countries.  No Irish artist had achieved as much since the late John McCormack, another great Westmeath entertainer.  The 15,000-strong attendance at Joe&rsquo;s removal and funeral was testimony to the esteem in which he was held by those who loved the entertainment he provided.  Some queued for up to six hours to pay their respects.  To his sisters, Imelda and Dympna, his brothers, Paddy, Ben and Vincent, and his nephews and nieces, I point to the words of Fr. Brian D&rsquo;Arcy, a close family friend, at his funeral.  He said: &ldquo;Death can leave a heartache no-one can heal, but love leaves a memory no-one can steal.&rdquo;  I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me the opportunity on the Order of Business to say these words.</P>

The health service now has an annual budget of &euro;15 billion and the Minister for Health and Children has come to the House on several occasions to offer an up-to-date progress report.  I will organise a debate on the latest developments in the health service at the earliest opportunity.  It was uplifting to hear the Minister say on television in recent days that the talks between the Health Service Executive and the unions representing health service professionals were nearing completion.  We all look forward to better health services and with the funding being made available by the Government we expect a major improvement this year and next year.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business has been 40 minutes for a considerable time.  One Senator cited the example of Senator Jim Dooge with whom I served, along with Senators John Ellis and Shane Ross who are the longest serving Members of the Oireachtas.  Senator Jim Dooge was an eminent Leader of the House in his time.  The two longest speeches made in either House were made by the legendary Senator Bernard McGlinchey who spoke in this House for eight hours and 20 minutes and, on another occasion, for seven hours and 15 minutes.  If Senators wish to be long-winded, I have no difficulty with that.  However, I recall that one of those who called for longer speaking times today begged me to conclude the proceedings of the House at 4.20 one morning.  I would like consistency in the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fact.  The Senator was not a Member of the House at the time, so I understand why she does not know what is going on.</P>
        <P>Ministers must be available to listen to statements and the concerns of Senators.  Between today and tomorrow, three Ministers will be present in the House.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is available to come to the House at 3.50 p.m. today while the Minister for Education and Science will attend at 5.30 p.m.  Tomorrow morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am briefing Members on what is happening in the House.  The father of the House proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to debate an urgent matter and I have to take his request seriously.  However, one cannot arrange a Minister to be present at five or ten minutes&rsquo; notice.  My telephone number is known to all Senators and if they telephone me three or four days in advance, I will do everything possible to arrange a debate.  </P>

	<P>With respect, the Minister will be in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is not interrupted when speaking, as the Cathaoirleach will tell the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senators Joe O&rsquo;Toole, D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, Fidelma Healy Eames, David Norris, Shane Ross and many other Senators expressed their great concern about yesterday&rsquo;s High Court ruling.  Given the separation of powers and the fact this case may be appealed to the Supreme Court, we should stand back.  I will be advised by colleagues from all sides in regard to the request made to me.  I will also discuss the request in respect of the family concerned with any colleague after the Order of Business.  The deliberations of the Seanad have always had to take into account the separation of powers.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White expressed serious concerns about legislation coming before the House.  The Government informs the Leader of impending legislation but if there is no legislation I try to arrange for Ministers to come to the House for debates requested by Senators.  As I stated, the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin will be in the House today and tomorrow, which is an acknowledgement of the importance of debates in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I consider the 70th anniversary of the Constitution a milestone in the success of our country and an acknowledgement of the vision of &Eacute;amon de Valera, the founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il, and of the serious part he played in compiling it.  I will lead the debate on this immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White called for a debate on e-mail, the Internet and on the retention of information for three years.  I have no problem arranging for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, John Paul Phelan, Shane Ross and many other Senators expressed their shock at the announcement of the loss of 350 jobs in Arklow from next year.  As Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca correctly pointed out, we are losing jobs because of low-cost economies.  I visited many countries as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business during the last D&aacute;il.  These Third World countries are the greatest opponents the IDA and Enterprise Ireland face because of the educational improvements in them.  I will arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to update us on what can be done in this regard.  Last week I attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="511"/>ment at which the successful Enterprise Ireland report was debated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, David Norris, Terry Leyden, Cecilia Keaveney, R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, Jerry Buttimer and many other Senators expressed concern about RTE discontinuing its medium wave service, particularly in regard to Irish emigrants in the UK and all the great programmes which are so uplifting such as &ldquo;Ceili House&rdquo;, &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte Isteach&rdquo;, the GAA games on a Sunday, other sporting events broadcast only on medium wave, Mass on a Sunday morning and the services of other denominations.  I will endeavour to arrange an urgent debate on this issue next week.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris raised the funding of the national marine conservation and education centre and referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  I will come back to the Senator this evening on the updated position.  I will also endeavour to come back to him on the Civil Partnership Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Hamilton, and expressed his views on the situation regarding our colleague, Councillor Fahey from Galway.  As the Senator is aware, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent and it would be unfair of me to give an opinion on this but I will discuss it with him after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators Eugene Regan and Fergal Quinn called for a debate on the Lisbon Treaty and the referendum.  I will arrange for it to take place and will discuss a timeframe with the leaders after our meeting tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan expressed his appreciation of the importance of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Washington later this year.  The Taoiseach is one of only five world leaders to address the UK Parliament and the United States Congress.  It is a historic occasion and it is only right that perhaps the Cathaoirleach and I, as Leader, should represent this House in Washington.</P>

        <P>Senator Phil Prendergast called for a debate on health issues and Dublin maternity services and I will arrange for the Minister to come to the House.  Senators Denis O&rsquo;Donovan and Jerry Buttimer called for an urgent update on the Cork-Swansea ferry service.  Perhaps we will ask the Minister to come to the House to outline the up-to-date position in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan is concerned about Cork GAA and the Cathaoirleach let him make his views known.  We wish Kieran Mulvey well in his discussions about the rebel county&rsquo;s participation in the all-Ireland series.  On all-Ireland <Col N="512"/>final day that county brings a strong ethos of the Gaelic Athletic Association to Parnell Square and all the areas around Croke Park.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen called for an urgent debate on lap dancing and the planning permission granted for it.  To the older fogies who do not know what happens because they are in bed so early in the evenings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Sometimes I am delighted to be as old as I am, because these unfortunate happenings never occurred when we were being entertained years ago.  The lap dancing club issue should be discussed in the House.  It is related to planning issues for local authorities.  We wish to see how we can strengthen this to have these events discontinued.  The Senator&rsquo;s call on me requires strong words.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Doherty spoke about a debate which is taking place this evening during Private Members&rsquo; Business.  We all support the call for the marine rescue co-ordination centres in Malin Head and Valentia to be left where they are and for their facilities to be improved.  The Senator also called for the Minister for State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Noel Ahern, to come to the House to discuss the requirements of the OPW.  Living with the spirit of the programme for Government with colleagues in the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, we can address all the issues so that the State service can play its part in the same way the private sector is expected to do.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on the health service.  I have no difficulty with this taking place.  Senator Kelly called for a debate on F&Aacute;S and mature students.  Up to 60% of all those at work today will have to be retrained by 2020 and F&Aacute;S has been given the task of carrying out this work.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator and have no difficulty with a debate on the issue in the House.</P>
        <P>I also support Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s call for an update on the mid-western development plan and Shannon Airport services.  I promised that we would have a debate on tourism and I hope that will take place in the next two to three weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to explain his Department&rsquo;s expenditure on innovation and research and those areas that will create jobs in future.  I certainly have no difficulty in having the Minister come to the House for this.</P><Col N="513"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan made a very strong statement about Killarney House.  If he wishes to table a motion for Private Members&rsquo; business, he may do so.  He may also wish to put it forward as a matter for the Adjournment.  Otherwise we will try how we can facilitate the Senator&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden spoke about young people being denied access to dental care.  I can make inquiries of the Minister for Health and Children about this issue and I will come back to the Senator in the next few days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Constitution, which was 70 years old on 29 December last, is one of the oldest written constitutions in Europe.  &ldquo;Few things have shaped and controlled Irish political and legal culture as decisively as the Constitution of Ireland.&rdquo;  So writes the eminent Professor Gerard Hogan in the foreword to a remarkable, new documentary study on the Constitution by Dermot Keogh and Andrew McCarthy.</P>
        <P>Few could have foreseen, with the coming into force of the Constitution, that this document would survive largely intact into the very different Ireland of today.  Our Constitution has stood the test of time.  While there have been amendments relating to matters such as the unborn child, divorce, voting rights, the European Union, citizenship and Northern Ireland, the very fact of these amendments demonstrates one of the most powerful features of the Constitution, namely, the people&rsquo;s right to charter the destiny of the nation.</P>
        <P>Much of the case for a new constitution to replace the Free State Constitution was the need to make perfectly clear that the source of authority in Ireland is the people.  Hence the preamble states: &ldquo;We, the people of &Eacute;ire ... do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo;  Article 6 states: &ldquo;All powers of government ... derive, under God, from the people&rdquo;.  With Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, there was a desire to give the State all the characteristics of a republic and remove references to the British monarchy.  The enduring effect of these provisions, however, has been to entrench the rights of the citizen as against the State and, as I indicated, the right of the people to charter its destiny.</P>
        <P>In the European Union puzzlement is sometimes expressed about the reason Ireland holds referendums with relative frequency.  With the forthcoming referendum on the Lisbon treaty, we will hear much more in this respect.  However, the referendum on the treaty underscores the <Col N="517"/>dynamic and democratic nature of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>A conference held in Trinity College last year to mark the 70th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution demonstrated the influential nature of the Constitution, which affects many aspects of daily life, from religion to education and the criminal justice system.  In future years, the Constitution will be pivotal in enabling Irish law and policy to accommodate difference in society and help realise human dignity.</P>
        <P>It is a sign of the sophistication of the legal order that when the European Convention on Human Rights was embedded in our law through an Act of the Oireachtas in 2003 the change did not cause upheaval.  Our judges and lawyers were already well versed in human rights principles.  By contrast, the incorporation of the convention constituted a sea change in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann has not only been an influential document in Ireland; its influence is much wider.  Much of the Pakistan Constitution and some of the Indian Constitution were modelled on the Irish Constitution, which is also well known to the constitutional architects in South Africa.  In recent years, it has been a much studied document in the newer eastern European democracies.</P>
        <P>The stability and relative success of the Constitution is a testament to those who drafted and interpreted it.  Its creator, &Eacute;amon de Valera, was lucky in terms of the quality of his civil servants and his judges and had the foresight to choose a talented drafting team led by the remarkable Mr. John Hearne, the then legal adviser at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  As well as being a skilled draftsman, Hearne had an unrivalled knowledge of comparative constitutional law and international law.  He and his drafting team transcended the limitations of their times and helped to infuse the document with balance and basic humanity.</P>
        <P>Criticisms were made at the time that, in the area of personal rights, the new Constitution did not extend fundamentally the rights contained in the 1922 Constitution.  Article 40 listed some new rights, however, and included an open-ended reference to the rights of mankind.  This article, in the way it has been interpreted by judges, has probably proved to be the most radical part of the Constitution and the volume of constitutional litigation concerning it is a sign of its strength.</P>
        <P>One area of the Constitution which has been neglected is Article 45 on the directive principles of social policy.  These broad principles are intended for the guidance of the Legislature and are not enforceable in the courts.  One can understand the reason there was a fear during the early years of the State about making social and economic rights fully enforceable.  Nevertheless, the people believed sufficiently in these principles to make them part of the Constitution.  Today, in a time of greater prosperity we would do well to remind ourselves of these principles.  It surely <Col N="518"/>must be correct, for example, that limitations be placed on the free market in the interest of the common good and that the State should protect the vulnerable.</P>
        <P>As with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Constitution can co-exist very well with international instruments, including European instruments.  This is a matter for the future, however.  For now, it is important to recount &Eacute;amon de Valera&rsquo;s achievement in 1937.  Apart from the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, he was the only other Taoiseach to win three general election victories in a row.  His achievements in 1937 were to find a drafting team to transcend the limitations of their day and courageously hold a referendum on the Constitution.  The end product was a living document which contributed much to the stability of the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The House is discussing the basic law of the country, the Constitution of 1937, which defines our representative democracy as one grounded in popular sovereignty, subject to the rule of law.  It is sometimes easy to forget that among the former colonies, Ireland, in 1922, became the first to win independence and chose deliberately to make its legislation subject to the control of a Judiciary sworn to uphold rights enunciated in and derived from a publicly ratified Constitution.  This is the essence of the liberal democracy through which, at a time of great threat to democracy from modern European dictatorships, Ireland, in both the 1922 and 1937 Constitutions, translated into the British model of government the great democratic principles of the French and American revolutions.  Thus were created the foundations for the stable parliamentary and European democracy we enjoy today.</P>
        <P>The American Constitution, the Constitution of the Soviet Union and the Irish Constitution of 1937 are all notable documents.  They only have meaning, however, by virtue of adherence to the principles enunciated in them and their interpretation by the courts.  We know the manner in which the Soviet Constitution was implemented and interpreted and the authoritarian and brutal state that was the USSR.  Just as the interpretation of the US Constitution by its Supreme Court is what gives character and meaning to US democracy, the same can be said of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the key values from which our Constitution has derived support from the people, and secured rights for citizens, is the principle of equality before the law.  This was embedded in the 1937 Constitution.  It resulted in the abolition of a number of common law rules which restricted marital equality.  It prevents discrimination by the State on grounds of sex, race, language, religious or political opinions.  For example, in the O&rsquo;Donovan case which addressed the uneven spread of D&aacute;il seats across the country, in the McKenna judgment on the spending of public <Col N="519"/>funds in referenda, and the Coughlan judgment on availability of broadcasting time in referenda, this principle of equality has had a tremendous influence on Irish democratic life.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note that many of our fellow European member states, such as the French Republic and Italy, grant to their public representatives immunity from prosecution.  It is entirely to the benefit of the Irish people and to the integrity of public life that under the Irish Constitution we as public representatives are bound by the rule of law.  From the highest office holder to the ordinary member of the public, we are equal before the law or so the Constitution provides.  This is something the present Taoiseach and Cabinet should bear in mind.</P>
        <P>Se&aacute;n Lemass said in the D&aacute;il in 1928 that Fianna F&aacute;il was a slightly constitutional party.  Mr. Lemass was correct in 1928 and, by all appearances, he is correct in 2008.  This can be seen most clearly in the manner in which the Taoiseach and his Ministers have sought to undermine and frustrate the work of the current Mahon tribunal, a body established by the Oireachtas to inquire into corruption in Irish politics.  That tribunal, as every tribunal which is established by the Oireachtas, is essential to restoring confidence in the political process and every TD and Senator has an interest in ensuring it does just that.  De Valera would be watching the debate this evening in the Lower House when that matter is discussed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of personal rights set out in Article 40.3 of the Constitution it is not the personal rights enunciated in the Constitution which are the most notable but rather the unspecified personal rights developed by the courts with, at times, the most tenuous of links to the actual wording in the Constitution.  As Professor John Kelly, a former Fine Gael Member of this House, pointed out in <i>A Short History of Western Legal Theory, </i>it was only in the Irish constitutional jurisprudence built up on the idea since the mid-1960s that there existed latent, unenumerated personal rights, which Article 40.3 of the Constitution protects in merely general terms, but which may be specifically identified and enforced by the courts as occasion arises.  These rights, according to the judgment which initiated the trend, are such as are implied by &ldquo;the Christian and the democratic nature of the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We know that many of the unspecified personal rights &mdash; the right to bodily integrity, the right to earn a livelihood, the right to marital privacy, the right to individual privacy, the right to litigate or have access to the courts &mdash; have been identified as unspecified and unenumerated in the Constitution.  The court did not, however, interpret the right to privacy so as to invalidate in the Norris<i> v.</i> Attorney General case, penalising homosexual conduct between consenting adults in private.  That is a matter which was resolved in the European Court of Human Rights.</P><Col N="520"/>
        <P>As James Casey stated in <i>Constitutional Law</i> it was not the 1937 Constitution which broke with British constitutional theory but rather the 1922 Constitution of the Free State.  While the treaty formed part of the constitutional text, neither the preamble nor the articles of that constitution recognised or acknowledged any British authority, holding that the power to enact the constitution derived from the people.</P>
        <P>Our current system of proportional representation was based on Article 26 of the 1922 Constitution which, on two occasions, was sought to be overturned in referenda.  Judicial independence and the principle of judicial review invalidating legislation was provided for in the 1922 Constitution.  That constitution limited the powers of the Oireachtas in several respects, one of which was in the area of extraordinary courts which was reintroduced in the 1937 Constitution.  Trial by jury was guaranteed and so on.  Therefore, there was quite a degree of continuity between the 1937 Constitution and the 1922 Constitution, the latter being amended by legislation at the time.</P>
        <P>The one important innovation in the 1937 Constitution which is commendable is Article 26 which gives the President a role in adjudicating on the constitutionality of legislation.  While decisions are made by the council in that regard, they are made in abstract.  Nevertheless that power helps to create a certain legal certainty in the interpretation of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The review of the 1937 Constitution and the protection of personal rights &mdash; the real innovations &mdash; were slow to develop.  There was a tendency in the courts of the 1940s and 1950s to uphold the legislation and the legislator rather than the Constitution as it protected individual rights.  That was a process which developed in the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent publication, to which the Leader has referred, <i>The Making of the Irish Constitution 1937</i> by Dermot Keogh and Andrew McCarthy, has highlighted the quality of the drafters, in particular, John Hearne, the legal adviser at the Department of Foreign Affairs, in drafting the 1937 Constitution.  Articles 2 and 3, the claim on Northern Ireland, the ban on divorce, the special position of the Catholic Church &mdash; Article 44, and the so-called place of women in the home provisions characterise that Constitution.  In many ways those characteristics define the Constitution and define the Ireland of the time.  The activism of the Irish Judiciary from the 1960s was clearly influenced by the human rights principles enunciated in the UN Declaration on Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and by the judicial activism of the American Supreme Court, particularly during the courts of the Chief Justice Earl Warren and Warren Burger.</P>
        <P>Chief Justice Cearbhall &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh and Mr. Justice Brian Walsh are among those who grasped the nettle of a changing society and firmly established the role of the Supreme Court as protector of the individual under the Consti<Col N="521"/>tution, as opposed to the more traditional role as upholder of the legislation and the legislator.  It also reflected a changing Ireland from an authoritarian and in many ways closed society to a more liberal and open one.  In this connection one has to mention the constitutional crusade of Garret FitzGerald in the 1980s which had an undeniable liberalising effect, not only in terms of the constitutional amendments which were subsequently made but in terms of the opening up into both public and legal discourse on the Constitution of the potential to be progressive and not to be bound by the conservative public and judicial thinking of the 1940s and 1950s.  The most important innovation of the Constitution was that it was rigid and that it required a referendum for changes to be made to it.</P>
        <P>As Gerard Hogan pointed out recently, of the 23 amendments to the Constitution, five involved the European treaties, three were on abortion, two on voting rights, two on citizenship and one on the Belfast Agreement.  He stated that the only significant changes have been to delete those controversial provisions of the Constitution which reflect traditional Catholic and nationalistic views &mdash; the claim on Northern Ireland, Articles 2 and 3, etc.</P>
        <P>The 1937 Constitution, as amended, most particularly following judicial review by the courts, our entry into the European Union and the constitutional crusade of Garret FitzGerald, now provides a basic law which is more in keeping with a modern and pluralist society in the European mainstream.  We are all the better for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Seanad &Eacute;ireann on having a debate on the anniversary of the Constitution.  It came into operation on 29 December 1937 and while this debate did not take place in the calendar year of 2007, it has taken place within a few weeks of the anniversary of the Constitution&rsquo;s commencement.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Cassidy in paying tribute to Professor Keogh on his magnificent work describing the origins of the Constitution and the work of the drafters who produced the final text and who assisted the then President of the Executive Council, Mr. de Valera, in its preparation.  I also pay tribute to Professor Gerard Hogan, who in a masterly analysis of the Constitution and its origins made the point that Mr. de Valera was of course one of the outstanding liberals of his generation.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan finds it very difficult to avoid being contentious in this House but I note that when the Constitution was introduced in 1937 it was the only written constitution in Europe which made express reference to the existence of the Jewish congregations.  In the course of making a criticism about the former provision recognising different religious faiths, Article 44, Senator Regan should have noticed the express reference <Col N="522"/>to the existence of the Jewish congregations in Ireland.  A former Chief Rabbi made the point that at the time it was a far greater assurance to the Jewish congregations of Ireland to be mentioned in the Constitution than to be given the kind of abstract guarantees of freedom they were conferred with in constitutions such as the Soviet constitution of 1936.  This is an example of the essential liberalism of Mr. de Valera in the original text of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I take issue with the rather hackneyed presentation by Senator Regan about the contrast between some modern crusading era inaugurated by Dr. FitzGerald and the original text.  Dr. Fitzgerald has many achievements to his credit, including the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1986, but a permanent imprint on the text of the Constitution is not among them because that particular crusade, like some crusades before it, ended in the sands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>All the amendments are based on that crusade.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know what that crusade was about.  It was followed by a pro-life amendment.  We really do not want to go there.</P>
        <P>The Constitution was put in place in 1937.  As Senator Regan fairly notes, it has been amended many times since but it embodies certain features which have assured it has endured.  I agree with the proposition that the Constitution re-bottled some wine and built on the work of the Free State Constitution and the earlier Home Rule Bills going back to the first Home Rule Bill introduced by Mr. Gladstone in 1886.  However, there is one fundamental feature which distinguishes the 1937 Constitution from all previous proposals for the Government of at least this part of Ireland, namely, for the first time it confirmed in an unequivocal way the national sovereignty of the Irish people in this part of Ireland.  The 1922 Constitution was annexed to a United Kingdom Act of Parliament whereas the 1937 Constitution was not considered or enacted in that assembly.</P>
        <P>When Senator Regan referred to Mr. Lemass and his famous comment of 1927 that Fianna F&aacute;il was a slightly constitutional party although it was open to the definition of being a republican party, he was of course referring to the conditions under which his party believed it had to operate under the 1922 arrangement.  It was decided in 1937 to go back to the people and have a clear unequivocal root of title for the Constitution, and this was achieved.  One of Senator Regan&rsquo;s most illustrious predecessors on the Fine Gael benches in this House, Senator Alexis Fitzgerald, made that point in a very fine obituary of Mr. de Valera published in 1976, when he noted that one of Mr. de Valera&rsquo;s greatest achievements was to lead that unconstitutional band into the constitutional light of day.</P><Col N="523"/>
        <P>That was his achievement in 1937.  The question is whether this transcended a party achievement and became an achievement for the nation and the State.  When the plebiscite took place in 1937, there was a majority for the Constitution but it was far from a decisive one.  To be accepted by a people a constitution must have widespread acceptance and it is not sufficient that it should have simply the acceptance of one party or another in a mechanical voting exercise.  The question on which we must reflect seven decades on is whether that text &mdash; that text as amended, as Senator Regan points out &mdash; has managed to provide an enduring basis for the Irish polity.  I suggest it has.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first feature of the Constitution that achieved this was the question of national sovereignty and the fact this was clearly and unequivocally vested in the people for the first time.  It is true that the 1937 Constitution contained some rhetorical flourishes, not all of which would be in accordance with popular thinking today.  That said, it is important that a people is entitled to make such rhetorical flourishes, which was a right denied to the Irish people for many centuries.</P>
        <P>The Constitution of 1937 secured popular acceptance in the decades that followed, the degree of which is illustrated by the fact it was not necessary to amend the Constitution, after the initial transitional amending period, until 1972.  For more than three decades there was no popular demand to amend the Constitution and the only proposal to amend it in that era, which was brought forward by my own political interest, was the proposal to abolish the system of proportional representation.  This was something which the people in their wisdom or lack of wisdom decided to reject, a decision which certainly gave the people more authority and certainly made the politicians work harder.  As to whether it produced a better system of government, future generations of political scientists will have to decide.</P>
        <P>A further feature of the Constitution is that it settled the national question where this part of Ireland is concerned.  It is interesting that when in 1992 the Downing Street Declaration, which is the basis of the modern peaceful arrangement in both parts of Ireland, was formulated, it was felt necessary in the first instance to affirm the right of self-determination of all of Ireland, albeit that it must be exercised in two parts.  This reflected the thinking in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Articles 2 and 3 were modified by vote of the people but thank God we had them to negotiate with when the Good Friday Agreement came to be negotiated, and that they had not been abandoned in some kind of crusade.  They proved very valuable in the discussions that took place on the Agreement.  The Irish people were able to reformulate their aspirations in the context of a comprehensive settlement of the <Col N="524"/>Northern question, which has now been brought about.</P>
        <P>I do not want to dwell too long on those issues.  I wish to draw attention to a second feature of the Constitution, the question of popular sovereignty, with which I believe all of us agree but about which I wish to raise certain questions.  The Constitution of course confirms our sovereignty as a nation but it also vests that sovereignty in the people, who are entitled to exercise the franchise in the State.  De Valera himself said when he presented the draft to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1937, &ldquo;If there is one thing more than another that is clear and shining through this whole Constitution, it is the fact that the people are the masters.&rdquo;  There is no doubt the Constitution embodies that principle to a unique degree.</P>
        <P>There is the principle that the Constitution is vested in the people and can be changed only by amendment by popular plebiscite in a referendum, which establishes a rigidity within it.  One cannot, as in some constitutions, amend it by universal agreement of the Houses or by some special majority in both Houses.  One must have a referendum on every word, comma and full stop contained in it, which has been our arrangement since 1937, or rather since 1942 when the transitional period for amendments elapsed.  This is not the practice in any other European state, as we know from the course of the current referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.  It is the practice in some, though not all, jurisdictions in the United States to have frequent referenda and, of course, there is one other European state, not a member of the European Union, which has frequent recourse to the referendum, Switzerland.</P>
        <P>There is another view, of course, which is that the people express their authority through their elected representatives.  That view is accepted in the French Republic and in such states there is far less ready recourse to the device of a referendum.  The idea of popular authority is also embodied in the President who is the ceremonial expression of that popular authority.  As Senator Regan pointed out, the President has a valuable power in ensuring that the Legislature does not trespass on the rights of the people, preventing it from doing so in the first place by having recourse to a Supreme Court opinion.  Equally, the courts preserve the rights of the people in their interpretation of the Constitution.  There is, therefore, a strong emphasis on popular authority in the Constitution as well as on national sovereignty.  That theory of popular authority runs right through the Constitution.  I will not dwell on the political institutions, which we talk about often enough.  Our presidents have served us with great distinction and the creation of that office in the Constitution was a valuable step.  One can see the idea of popular authority shining through the provisions.</P>
        <P>In most European states the election of a ceremonial head of state is unusual.  Normally a head of state is elected by Parliament in a special procedure.  I am subject to correction but I think <Col N="525"/>Iceland is the only other European country that elects a president.  However, some of the new central and east European states, which have unshackled themselves from the Soviet system, may have a similar arrangement.  Nonetheless, that arrangement is an unusual one and contributes to a certain unreality in the presidential election.  Senator Harris, who is present, can talk about presidential elections with greater authority than most.  However, it seems to me that such an arrangement reduces the candidates in a presidential election to promise to do all sorts of things in the presidential palace.</P>
        <P>The Icelandic Prime Minister told me that in a recent presidential election one of the main issues was whether the cellar in the presidential palace would be opened up to voters.  There is a difficulty in that because if the president does not have executive powers a presidential election can of necessity become a beauty contest.  It is important, however, that the President should be elected because it means that people are personified in some way in the State through the person who transmits the seals of office and can safeguard the public interest concerning legislation.</P>
        <P>The courts are a public institution of the State, not a party political one.  One of the key features of the courts, as established in the Constitution, is that they are given express powers to review legislation.  The earlier United States constitution, on which many of the provisions of our Constitution were modelled, did not have an express power for judicial review.  Chief Justice Marshall identified that power as being in the constitution and it was expressly conferred in our Constitution.  It has been exercised frequently since 1937.</P>
        <P>As regards exercising powers of judicial review, it is important to bear in mind that Ireland is a common law jurisdiction.  Many continental jurisdictions have constitutions with fine-sounding statements about rights but their legal systems are not strong in vindicating and enforcing such rights.  One of the great strengths of the common law has been its emphasis on remedies rather than rights, including the fact that the individual plaintiff can sue for damages, obtain an injunction, obtain an order for contempt of court when a court order has not been enforced, or attach a company for sequestration of its assets when it is not in compliance with a court order.  The common law therefore developed a powerful battery of remedies for the enforcement of rights.  If that is combined with a constitution that declares abstract rights, one confers great judicial powers.</P>
        <P>In many jurisdictions of continental Europe there are many fine declarations of abstract rights.  The French constitution, for example, contains the declarations of the rights of the citizen, which was made during the great revolution there.  However, the French constitution does not contain a system for the enforcement of these rights.  In fact, the French constitutional court is dependent on a reference from the president or <Col N="526"/>some other court to arrive at a determination.  Likewise, the German system has a constitutional court.  Individuals have far greater access to that court but there must still be an element of reference from another body.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In our system, by contrast, the High Court is vested with full and original jurisdiction to determine all matters whether of law or fact and the individual has a right to invoke that jurisdiction to enforce individual constitutional provisions.  That is a powerful protection for the individual, leaving aside how the rights are formulated or expressed.  How far it can extend was illustrated in the proceedings brought by Raymond Crotty against the Single European Act.  Senator Regan also instanced the case of electoral legislation and the insistence on equality of representation in the delimitation of constituency boundaries.  There have been many other examples but I will not recite them all.  The most fundamental one of all, however, is the case of Byrne <i>v.</i> Ireland in which the Supreme Court decided that the State was a juristic person subject to its own laws and accountable to its own citizens before the courts.  That was a fundamental decision.</P>
        <P>I agree that the Constitution was enacted in a context when the courts did not have these powers.  While the 1922 Constitution had envisaged the development of judicial review it never came into being because of the troubled circumstances of the time.  Therefore there was no effective power of judicial review.  Many judges of that generation had grown up in the late 19th century where it was axiomatic that Parliament was sovereign.  The idea of a sovereign court deriving power directly from the people and reviewing their charter was not congenial to them.  That changed in the years following the enactment of the Constitution.  Lawyers are slower to change their habits than other professions but eventually the lawyers and judges did change.  Men like Judge Gavan Duffy, Mr. Justice Walsh and Chief Justice &Oacute; Dalaigh developed the courts and gave a dynamic interpretation to the Constitution.  Both Se&aacute;n Lemass and &Eacute;amon de Valera were on record at the time as welcoming that development.  They welcomed the fact that the Irish Supreme Court modelled itself on the United States Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>Fundamental rights provisions are an important element of the Constitution.  In 1937, the formulation of fundamental rights in a constitution was common.  I have already mentioned the Soviet constitution of 1936, which guaranteed fundamental rights but of course that was illusory given the character of the state in question.  We arrived at a different conclusion as a result of the formulation of those rights but it does raise a difficulty.  I discussed that difficulty in this House some years ago when I was acting as Minister of State in this Department in the debate on the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  There is a difficult question of how one harmonises the recognition of fundamental rights in <Col N="527"/>our Constitution with the recognition of fundamental rights under the European Convention and the Community legal order.  This is an aspect of the debate on the Lisbon treaty which will be very important.</P>
        <P>In 1972, we joined the European Communities, as they were then called, and the people voted on the necessary constitutional amendment to permit the State to become a member of the European Communities.  At that time, a provision was inserted into the Constitution providing that the State was authorised to be a member of those Communities and that any acts done, measures taken or obligations necessitated by the obligations of membership of those Communities would be immune from our Constitution.  That has been the legal position since 1972.  Matters pertaining to the Community legal order are determined by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  A separate legal order exists side by side with our Constitution as envisaged first in the Rome treaties and latterly in the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty &mdash; a consolidating and codifying document &mdash; purports to put that whole arrangement on a final footing.  While we will have a debate on this matter in the next few months, it is important to make an important preliminary point.  For the first time the Community legal order will have its own fundamental rights guarantees &mdash; not ones that will entrench on our legal order but fundamental guarantees with the Community legal order.  That is a desirable development.  In effect, in 1972, we gave a blank cheque in legal terms to the European legal order.  Our legislators and Ministers have worked to lobby and secure the best possible arrangements for Ireland but the Community legal order as a whole has not been ring-fenced by the idea of fundamental or individual rights.  It will be ring-fenced with concepts of such rights in the Lisbon treaty.  These rights are carefully drafted and formulated so as not to entrench on the domestic fundamental rights guaranteed in our Constitution.  Essentially, we are witnessing in the Lisbon treaty the establishment of a treaty of union at European level that resembles the constitutional order with which we have been familiar in our jurisdiction.  That is a welcome development, which should be supported.  I fear it is open to misrepresentation and people will suggest it has something to do with the fundamental rights clauses in our Constitution, whereas it is concerned with the competences we have conferred on the European Union.  Its purpose is to ensure that such competences are subject to a regime of fundamental rights in the same way as the competences, that we as a national Parliament and Government exercise, are also subject to a regime of fundamental rights.  It is important that the competences of the Union should be subject to a similar arrangement.</P><Col N="528"/>
        <P Just="Left">Professors Keogh and Hogan were mentioned and I refer to the question of the status of the texts of the Constitution, which was enacted in the Irish text as well as the English text.  Both texts are authentic and both are texts of the Constitution.  On occasion, it is said the Irish text is the sole text of the Constitution but that is not correct, as the Constitution was published in both texts.  Both texts are official and authentic.  The Irish text is enrolled in the original cl&oacute; gaelach and subsequent amendments to the Constitution have been so enrolled.  If there is a conflict, the Irish text prevails.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il conducted an excellent study for the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, when I was its chairman, and he explored the implications of the Irish text.  One of the most interesting features was that the text was not drafted as a translation of the English text.  Rather Mr. de Valera assembled a separate collection of translators who worked through the text in tandem with the evolution of the English version.  As a result, the Irish translation is a free rather than a literal translation of the Constitution and this has led to discrepancies between the two texts.  The Constitution itself provides that in the case of such a discrepancy the Irish text should prevail.  However, the courts have rarely found a discrepancy and they have sought to harmonise the text.  Both texts, therefore, have served to illustrate each other.</P>
        <P>I refer to the question of whether the separation of powers envisaged in the Constitution is true and in fact.  Clearly, the people have the supreme authority under the Constitution but it then goes on to envisage that the people have ordained that there should be three separate powers &mdash; legislative, executive and judicial.  While the judicial arm of Government is independent and its independent sphere of operation is carefully safeguarded by the Constitution, the political institutions of Parliament and the Government are interdependent under it.  The Government is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann advises and assists D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on legislation but these institutions are related to each other.  It was admitted by de Valera that he considered in 1937 introducing an American style government in which the President or the Taoiseach, as President, would exercise more executive power and Parliament would be a separate body but he reflected upon it and declined to do it because he believed in the importance of individual responsibility of Ministers to the House.  He was correct in that judgment.  It is important that Ministers should be individually accountable to Parliament as well as collectively accountable as a Government.  That was the effect of that decision on the drafting of the Constitution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend the Seanad on having this worthwhile debate.  I have referred to the past and I have examined essential features of the Constitution.  Looking to the future, the greatest issue <Col N="529"/>relating to the Constitution is the sheer volume of judicial interpretation placed upon it.  The late John Kelly made the point that it was never envisaged by the drafters that the document would go through the minute exegesis it has gone through in the courts.  As a result, we have thousands of judicial decisions giving precise interpretations of different clauses, subclauses and paragraphs of the Constitution.  That can put a substantial fetter on the capacity of these Houses to legislate as they might please.  I do not envy the Parliamentary Counsel who advises on legislation because clearly the range of constitutional interpretation must be taken into account in the formulation of legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, the fundamental issue relating to the institution of judicial review is how far the courts go in the interpretation of the Constitution.  Reference was made to the fact that in 1965 the courts decided there were implied rights in the Constitution as well as those expressed therein.  Once an implied right is recognised, the courts have substantial power to develop implied rights and to read into the Constitution many matters not thought to be within its province.  It is welcome that recent Supreme Court decisions clearly recognise judicial self-restraint in social and economic matters.  In a number of decisions over the past decade the court has reaffirmed that it is for us in the Oireachtas to determine issues relating to the allocation of resources.  The judgments on social and economic matters must be made by us, as legislators, in the Oireachtas and not litigated in the courts.  It is clear the Supreme Court has developed that doctrine in recent years, which I welcome, because the reality is that a social problem examined from an administrative and legislative point of view can be tackled from that point of view but a social problem litigated in the Four Courts will not always be litigated to a correct conclusion in terms of the broader interest of the people.  That is my view on judicial review but others may have different views.  I do not speak on behalf of the Government in that regard but I thank Senators for their contributions to date and I look forward to the rest of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for their learned contributions and it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the Minister&rsquo;s fine contribution.  As a former student of law, I felt a twitch in my hand as I had an irresistible urge to take notes as when I was in college.  If the people of Dublin West ever do what I do not expect them to do, the Minister would be a welcome guest wherever constitutional law is taught.</P>
        <P>We are marking the 70th anniversary of the coming into force of the Constitution.  Like de Valera himself, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann has been singled out for a great deal of scorn over the past quarter of a century.  For example, it has been dismissed as out of date in a pluralist Ireland.  It is far too suffused with Catholic social teaching, some have said, to be relevant for contemporary <Col N="530"/>society.  As Senator Regan stated, for a period during the 1980s, we even had a constitutional crusade, designed to make the Republic more palatable to those Unionists who were supposedly chomping at the bit for a united Ireland minus so-called &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; elements of our Constitution.  However, Unionists of various stripes had made it clear over the decades that their opposition to unification was far more deep-seated.  The most intransigent Unionists are more socially conservative than any Irish politician.  The notion of a more secular constitution being attractive to them was a ruse by liberals keen to get their legislative way with voters in the South.</P>
        <P>Those arguments have passed and de Valera&rsquo;s Constitution, for the most part, still stands.  Leading constitutional expert, Dr. Gerard Hogan, to whom the Minister rightly paid tribute, points out that it has only been amended 23 times in 70 years.  Such stability is down to the fact that there is more to this document that the caricature of it would have us believe.  At the time of its drafting, it was a remarkably advanced legal document.  It limited the sphere of influence of government when the trend in Europe was heading in the opposite direction.  Mussolini came to power in Italy in the 1920s while in Spain rival ideologies battled it out, each as totalitarian as the other in their ambition, in a vicious civil war that claimed 600,000 lives.  Four years before the Constitution was drafted, Hitler came to power in Germany and in the Soviet Union, Stalin was imposing his own brand of tyranny.  None of this was accidental because at a time of huge economic and social upheaval, many people were attracted to the notion of strong state influence.  Over time, this would prove tyrannical in many ways.  Thankfully, the drafters of the Constitution had set sail in a different direction by setting out the fundamental rights of the individual and ensuring no power &mdash; not even the State &mdash; could deny those rights.</P>
        <P>Today, Ireland is top of the class in Europe when it comes to rulings by the European Court of Human Rights.  There have been fewer rulings made against this State than any other European country.  Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution might provide an explanation because these provisions protect freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of speech and family rights, among others.  We can have recourse to our own courts before we need to go to Europe because we have these rights.</P>
        <P>It is true that the Constitution reflected the Catholic values of its time.  The preamble with its reference to &ldquo;our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ&rdquo;, the inclusion of Article 44, which until the 1970s recognised the special position of Catholicism and the echoes of Catholic social teaching in its provisions on marriage, family life and education, were hardly surprising given that the majority of the population were practising Catholics.  However, this Catholic influence can be overstated.  Some church leaders wanted Catholicism to be made the official religion but de Valera <Col N="531"/>would not agree.  In the UK, lest it be forgotten, Anglicanism is still the state religion.  In Norway, supposedly a bastion of liberal tolerance, Jesuit priests were banned until 1956.  There are plenty of influences from Catholic social teaching, however, and these are not confined to the role of religion.  The document&rsquo;s references to &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; rights reflect the influence of natural law principles, which although promoted with enthusiasm by the church are not the exclusive property of religious believers.  Natural law thinking asserts that some rights exist ahead of man-made or positive law.  The Constitution singles out the right to private property as such a right.  It also states that the family possesses these rights.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge natural law is not without its critics.  Recent Irish Supreme Court rulings have not been kind to the idea.  In 1995, when lawyers for the unborn argued that abortion information legislation went against the natural law basis of the Constitution, the Supreme Court replied that the people had voted for such legislation and they, not natural law, were the ultimate arbiters of the fundamental law of the State.  However, it is wrong to forget the importance of natural law in several rulings which actually expanded the rights of Irish citizens.  Prior to the 1960s, the courts did not recognise rights not explicitly set out in the Constitution.  However, in 1965 the court concluded that such rights existed all along.  The right to bodily integrity, said Mr. Justice Kenny, flowed from the Christian and democratic nature of the State.  Over the years, this idea has been used to acknowledge other rights, including the right to strike, the right to communicate and the right to privacy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Without natural law, citizens have to rely on positive or man-made law which leaves many in a perilous situation because they are dependent on the Legislature for rights which they ought to have by virtue of their dignity as human persons.  The role of natural law might not be so obvious in Ireland of the early 21st century but contemporary events in Kenya show how people can turn on each other and how a majority of the population can trample on the rights of a minority if they are led by the wrong people.  Natural law, which protests that there are some things that even man-made law or a majority of the voters can never make right, is the bulwark against chaos.  The Constitution reminds those of us who serve in public life that we are not only obliged to follow what the people want but are also required on occasion to provide leadership in promoting the common good.  The natural law of our Constitution offers similar leadership.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There has been criticism of Article 43.3 on the protection of the unborn and Article 41.3.1&deg;, in which the State pledges to guard with special care the institution of marriage as the foundation of the family.  These Articles and others, such as the former constitutional ban on divorce, have been <Col N="532"/>used as a stick with which to advance the idea that the Constitution was a Catholic document for a Catholic people.  However, while the Catholic nature of the State was undoubtedly influential in the formulation of the Constitution, it is not true to claim that the basis for ongoing protection of the unborn can be understood only in theological terms.  These positions are based on rationality and those who continue to argue, for example, that protection for the unborn is of exclusive concern to people with religious faith are doing a disservice to the community.</P>
        <P>We should not forget either the influence of democratic liberalism on the Constitution.  The document mandates a balance between the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature, thereby ensuring that no single branch of Government has unlimited power.  This was not revolutionary given that the United States and the United Kingdom had such arrangements in place for centuries but it was not guaranteed in the context of the trend in the 1930s towards increased State powers.  Some officials in the Department of Justice objected to the idea that the Judiciary would have the final say on interpreting the Constitution because they worried that the Supreme Court could thereby restrict the actions of the D&aacute;il.  The provision remained, however.</P>
        <P>Article 6 of the Constitution states that the people have the final say on &ldquo;all questions of national policy&rdquo;.  Article 46 makes this a reality by requiring that the Constitution can be amended only by a vote of the people.  The 1922 Constitution, by contrast, could be amended at will by the Legislature.  We see the limitations of that today in other EU countries when we consider that only Irish people will speak directly on the subject of their country&rsquo;s accession to the Lisbon Treaty.  While I do not doubt the truth of what the Minister has said regarding the provisions in that treaty on fundamental rights, that is not the final word because we will probably have to consider what will happen if the competences of the European Union are interpreted by the Irish courts as being hostile to the natural law elements of the Constitution.  We will have to reflect on that openly and truthfully.</P>
        <P>In speaking about the constitutional crusade of the 1980s, the Minister appeared to suggest there was something regrettable about the introduction to Article 43.3 of protection of the unborn.  We should never regard any debate by the people, however divisive, as undesirable.  The debates that have taken place on that issue as a result of the requirement to put it to the people have contributed to a high level of maturity and awareness among Irish people, even if they have not always agreed on the correct policy.  It is politically convenient for some to claim that Article 43.3 opened some kind of Pandora&rsquo;s box to the disadvantage of those who proposed it but we could also argue that it continues to guarantee a significant measure of protection for the unborn.  If it <Col N="533"/>had not been inserted by the people, it is reasonable to suggest that the provisions of 19th century legislation, which had fallen in Britain in the Bourne case, might similarly have fallen and been replaced by legislation which did not answer the precise and considered will of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Throughout its 70-year history, the Constitution has enabled the people to speak in their own voices rather than be dictated to on issues that mattered.  I am reminded of a story about  &Eacute;amon de Valera on the first of two attempts by Fianna F&aacute;il to get rid of proportional representation by means of a referendum of the people in 1959.  The <i>Dublin Opinion</i>, or some other journal, carried a cartoon depicting de Valera the mathematician, complete with mortarboard, writing out the equation &ldquo;FF minus PR equals infinity&rdquo;.  Fianna F&aacute;il was probably right in its surmise because, without proportional representation, the smaller parties would have lost out and the larger parties would have hoovered up the seats.</P>

	<P>We have not done too badly with proportional representation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They never got to prove the equation because the deletion of proportional representation was twice proposed in an amendment to the Constitution and twice the people said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  De Valera may not have realised in 1938 that the Irish people would use Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to frustrate his wishes concerning the voting system but that does not lessen his achievement in putting the document before us as a wonderful piece of constitutional history on a worldwide scale and an enduring and valuable legacy to the Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proper that the upper House takes this opportunity to mark the 70th anniversary of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann given that it is a creature of that document.  We need to use this opportunity to examine in a positive and, in so far as we can, critical way the value of the basic law of the country.  It is our second constitution since independence.  A close debate took place on whether the Constitution should be adopted and a review of the numbers who were in favour of its ratification demonstrates that it certainly would not have got past a Green Party convention deciding on a party constitution.  That said, it was ratified and as a document has served many valuable functions.  Strangely, it is one of the oldest written constitutions in Europe.  Our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, has no written constitution and most of the constitutions of the western European democracies date from after the Second World War.  It even has been seen as a source document for constitutional law and was considered during the establishment of the Republic of India.  It helped India to shape the manner in which it has become both the most populous democracy in the world and one of the most effective democracies in Asia.  On those <Col N="534"/>grounds, the Constitution&rsquo;s drafters can take a great deal of pride.</P>
        <P>It has been presented very much as de Valera&rsquo;s Constitution and undoubtedly his personality informed it and brought it about.  Recent research by Professor Dermot Keogh and Dr. Andrew McCarthy of University College Cork, however, placed four people into the proper historical context who have not been properly acknowledged in respect of drafting of the Constitution.  It is important to mention them in this debate.  Chief among them was John Hearne, the legal adviser to the then Department of External Affairs.  The other drafters included Philip O&rsquo;Donoghue, who was a legal assistant to the Attorney General, and Maurice Moynihan and Michael McDunphy of the then President of the Executive Council&rsquo;s department, which was the equivalent of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Much of the subsequent debate on the Constitution has focused on the influence of the Catholic Church and of Archbishop John McQuaid in particular.  As a creature of its time, however, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann can be seen to be a highly liberal document and the manner in which it has been interpreted subsequently by the Irish courts system shows that to be the case.</P>
        <P>One difficulty with Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann concerns its lack of a large number of specified rights.  A number of particular rights are specified while, as Senator Mullen has noted, a large number are implied.  Some rights have come about in the strangest of circumstances.  For example, the right to bodily integrity came about as a result of a Supreme Court case in the 1960s taken by people who opposed the addition of fluoride to public water supplies.  While that was not the point of taking the case, the principle emerged subsequently from the Supreme Court judgment.  Furthermore, some specified rights require re-evaluation and reconsideration in respect of their position within modern Ireland.  There has been a constant debate on the right to private property and how it has assisted widespread speculation and has not assisted the application of the recommendations of the Kenny report of 1972.  Perhaps that is a constitutional matter which should be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Irish Constitution lacks a specified section on a Bill of Rights such as can be found in other countries.  Some of the arguments that Senator Mullen has just made may run counter to what I am about to argue.  There should be an inclusion of specified rights in a future evolution of the Constitution.  It is not good enough to depend on international documents such as European or United Nations standards on human rights or even the charter on fundamental rights that might come about as part of the Treaty of Lisbon.  Our Constitution should define a list of basic fundamental rights that should be immediately apparent to our citizens.  The difficulty when one begins so doing on an individual basis is that one encounters the sort of constitutional difficulties <Col N="535"/>that Ireland has experienced since 1983 when tackling a particular matter.  This should be done in a broad sense and not by interfering with the Constitution item by item.  Otherwise matters should be left as they stand.</P>
        <P>I also seek Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s evolution to bring about a more participative democracy.  It describes the political institutions of the State and apart from numbers of Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and reducing the voting age to 18, there have been few changes since 1937.  The required debate in respect of Seanad reform is highly appropriate in this regard.  One of the strange points of genesis of the Seanad&rsquo;s present form was the adaptation of a political philosophy and political structures that operated in Portugal in the 1930s, which was far from the best example of democracy at the time.  The idea of corporatism, what it then represented and what it can represent in 21st century Ireland, must be changed if Members wish to bring about a more active and participative democracy.</P>
        <P>Members should consider issues such as the age at which people become politically active, if not the voting age itself.  I have often found it strange that since the voting age was reduced, people are allowed to vote for Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad but are not entitled to be voted on to become Members.  Such anomalies, which have been created since the Constitution&rsquo;s original enactment, probably should be tackled.  The Oireachtas has been fortunate to have a highly active committee that has produced eight reports to date on the Constitution, many recommendations of which have been acted on.  As a Member of the present Seanad, I serve as a member of the current committee and I wish to see it operate, as is mentioned in the programme for Government, in order that elements of constitutional change that are uncontentious and that bring us toward being a more open, democratic and modern democracy can come about in future.  Although the Constitution is a valuable document that should be left intact in so far as is possible, it also is an evolving document and Members&rsquo; role as legislators is to engage in a constant debate with one another and with the people and citizens of Ireland to ensure it is the best Constitution possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not intended to make a contribution until I heard the extraordinary and lucid exchanges between Senator Regan&rsquo;s fine exegesis on the background to the Constitution and the Minister&rsquo;s subsequent response.  It is not often that one is unwilling to leave the Chamber.  While I had planned to attend to more urgent business in my office, as I listened to them I realised there was nothing better on the box, so to speak.  On a day on which the Oireachtas concerns itself with what I believe future historians will consider to be no more than a hill of beans &mdash; I refer to the fallout from the <Col N="536"/>Mahon tribunal &mdash; it is good to be reminded of the great mountains of our democracy.  During the Minister&rsquo;s exceptional <i>tour de force</i> on the historical, legislative and political aspects of the Irish Constitution, I shared Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen&rsquo;s urge and felt the same twitch in my fingers to take notes because he opened my eyes.  Having grown up with John M. Kelly&rsquo;s marvellous work on the Irish Constitution, I had believed that I knew a little about the subject but I discovered the limits of my ignorance.</P>
        <P>This has prompted me to mention my recollection of reading the great conservative historian, Michael Oakeshott.  Shortly after the enactment of the Irish Constitution he undertook a comparative study of all European constitutions and considered the former to be the most perfect of them in its attempt to achieve social and political harmony at a very difficult time.  The aspect of the Irish Constitution that I like, about which the Minister has reminded Members, is its modesty.  Unlike the great prescriptive constitutions such as the French revolutionary injunction to liberty, equality and fraternity or the American constitution&rsquo;s injunction to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the Irish Constitution does not tell its citizens to do anything.  It has no prescriptions for a happy and better life.  It simply tells them modestly how they might live with one another in a body politic.  This was a tremendous achievement.  Senator Regan correctly demonstrated its origins in the Free State constitution, to which the Minister rightly paid tribute, as well as reminding Members that its origins went further back into the great home rule parliamentary tradition and to British common law.</P>
        <P>One of the Irish Constitution&rsquo;s fine points is that it breathes the Christian and Graeco-Roman tradition.  It is deeply informed by the Greek spirit of liberty, the Roman respect for laws and the Christian notion of social justice and harmony.  We should applaud the fact that such a Christian document is so capable of serving in such secular times.  We are very lucky because, whatever today&rsquo;s contributions lacked in quantity, they certainly made up for it in quality.</P>

    <Title>Substance Abuse: Motion (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Larry Butler on Wednesday, 19 December 2007:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recognises the epidemic in our society of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use, in particular cocaine and related substances, and acknowledges the need for a coordinated cross-departmental approach to this problem.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callely was in possession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>When this motion was moved, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was <Col N="537"/>present.  Today I am delighted to see here my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, and I wish him well.</P>
        <P>In my contribution on 19 December 2007, I indicated that the Dublin County Coroner stated on the previous day that cocaine was the commonest cause of death in more than half of all inquests.  The year 2007 saw a large number of inquests into drug-related deaths and nearly all deaths involved young people.  It was also stated that Ireland has the third highest level of cocaine use in Europe.  Other reports give one a handle on the volume and in this regard the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na state that seizures of the drug have risen by 800% in the past five years.  There are statistics we cannot ignore in respect of illegal drug use, particularly cocaine and related substances.</P>
        <P>That Ministers of State from more than one Department have been present during our consideration of this motion shows we are adopting a cross-departmental approach to the problem.  In the past, some of the agencies of the State may have been out in the field alone when trying to address some of the issues that arise.</P>
        <P>Cocaine has been glamorised and romanticised in terms of its perceived benefits.  On the last occasion on which I spoke on this matter, I asked how one could glamorise and romanticise a drug brought to the country in questionable circumstances.  If one knew how it was transported here, one would have second thoughts about using it.  I highlighted the fact that cocaine can be mixed with kerosene, sulphuric acid, calcium and a range of other chemicals to convert it into an appropriate paste.  Its journey to Ireland might easily involve transportation in a person&rsquo;s stomach or rectum.  Eventually, the cocaine is likely to reach Joe Scumbag, a low-life character who will mix it with flour or talcum power, if one is lucky, or rat poison, if one is not.</P>
        <P>As we know, cocaine is divided into lines and snorted on cisterns or toilet lids.  The pure form of the drug may cause heart attacks, haemorrhages or strokes.  Contaminated versions may lead to a range of other potentially lethal problems.  Although many people have taken it and lived to tell the tale, all have fallen victim to the substance and have helped to further the activities of the low-life drug dealers in our communities.</P>
        <P>Drug-taking is a personal choice.  However, before the powder-nosed sniffers take their next sniff, they should ask themselves whether they would consume a product offered to them it if it had been trampled into the mud, mixed with powerful chemicals, stuffed up somebody&rsquo;s back passage for some time and if they were asked to eat it using a toilet lid as a plate.  If this were the case, would they have second thoughts?</P>
        <P>One must question the value and success of the drugs strategies employed over recent years <Col N="538"/>across Departments and agencies of the State.  I have no doubt strategies were put in place on the basis of priority, the balance of advantage and the attempted reconciliation of various competing demands.  While there may have been general agreement on the illness associated with substance abuse, there has been no such agreement on the correct strategy to be applied.  Far too much comment is devoted to diagnosis, use and abuse and not nearly enough to strategies and their results.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I raised this issue on the Order of Business, I referred to the fact that we had been dealing with substance abuse on a sectoral, regional and independent departmental basis.  Different interests seize on particular aspects but we now need a uniform national response to the substantive and broader associated issues.  The cocaine epidemic is and has been demonstrated to be a menace to human life, including family life, and society.  The string of injuries, deaths and blatant abuses by the low-life involved in the drugs trade, which are becoming more frequent, is unacceptable.  The available information and statistics justify the imposition of emergency measures to remove known activists in the drug trade from the communities in which they operate.</P>
        <P>A known criminal was shot last weekend and is now seriously ill.  This person was freely walking the streets of Dublin when he was shot several times.  It is not the first time a person known to the Garda has been attacked in this manner.  The Garda and other security forces of the State do tremendous work and put their lives at risk to protect the public.  However, the system lets them down in so far as particular individuals are able to go about their business gaily while putting others at risk.  We have reached the stage where emergency measures are required.</P>
        <P>A recent documentary on the drugs industry indicated that the people involved at different levels in combatting drugs crime, including garda&iacute;, customs officers and so on, know the identities of the main movers and are aware of their activities and movements but can do nothing about it.  This is unacceptable to the citizens of this State.  I understand the Garda could point out every one of the principals.  There is public support for the imposition of emergency measures to prevent what we have repeatedly witnessed on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere with the associated risk to innocent members of the public.</P>
        <P>Alcohol, drug and substance abuse in any form has been clearly demonstrated to be a positive menace to human life.  Good work has been undertaken both by agencies of the State and by private industry in educating the public.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, and I are familiar with the work of Michael Patten of Diageo, for example, within the drinks industry.  It has run a good campaign, particularly through the use of television advertisements, to encourage people to use alcohol sensibly.  I also pay tribute <Col N="539"/>to the work done by Irish Distillers, where my brother works, in highlighting the importance of drinking sensibly and the pleasure to be enjoyed from an appropriate use of alcohol.</P>
        <P>As a former member of a health board, I am aware of the work done by outreach workers who put their lives at risk to make contact with people who slip through the existing safety nets.  Progress has been made in certain areas and I congratulate the personnel involved.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, referred to the important work done by State agencies and observed that there is significant scope for greater co-operation.  It is important that we consider how best to maximise the potential for raising awareness in our 21st century society about the dangers of illegal drug use and alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P>The time is opportune to embark on a new policy and strategy.  We all accept that a great deal remains to be done to improve the existing position.  I have heard and read speeches by successive authorities on the subject of substance abuse which included expressions of the finest humanitarian sentiments one could wish to hear.  However, I question the progress we have made to deal with the root cause of the problem.</P>
        <P>I had far more to contribute to this debate but the Cathaoirleach has indicated that my time has expired.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on alcohol and drug abuse.  Alcohol related injuries are the main cause of visits to accident and emergency departments, whether as a result of road traffic accidents, binge drinking leading to injuries and fatalities, or domestic violence.  One fifth of motorists killed on the roads have alcohol concentration levels above the legal limit, with many far in excess of the limit.  The Irish population continues to be among the highest consumers of alcohol in the EU.  In 2006, alcohol consumption per adult was 13.4 litres of pure alcohol compared with an EU average of 10.2 litres.  We are second after Luxembourg in the European league of alcohol consumption.  This is a damning statistic and not something of which we should be proud.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Half of Irish children aged between 15 and 17 describe themselves as current drinkers and more than one third report being &ldquo;really drunk&rdquo; in the past 30 days.  These figures are a cause for great concern.  Social, personal and health education officers are needed at senior cycle, and these officers should work closely with community garda&iacute; and local drugs taskforces.  There is evidence that multi-component programmes, such as school and community or school and parent training, are more effective, but this type of linkage is currently missing.  I urge that such an approach be taken sooner rather than later.  One of the key findings in Alcohol Action Ireland&rsquo;s 2006 report <Col N="540"/>was that 85% of people are of the view that our cultural attitude to alcohol must change.  A values-based educational approach is urgently required to effect a change in attitudes.</P>
        <P>The new report of the national advisory committee on drugs indicates increased usage of illegal drugs among all adults, having increased from 18% to 24% in the last four years.  Men and younger age groups reported higher drugs usage.  Among 25 to 34 year olds, for example, a lifetime usage rate of 34% was reported.  I cannot overemphasise the need for school and community based initiatives, including parent education.  This age group includes those who leave school early, which is often when the greatest void in terms of prevention programmes and interventions arise.  Greater resources should be allocated to vocational educational committees in particular to deal with this area.</P>
        <P>Cannabis is identified as the most commonly used drug and is sometimes referred to as a gateway drug.  That is very worrying as cannabis users often progress to heroin or cocaine addiction which breeds violence and criminal behaviour with devastating effects on local communities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Cocaine use is on the increase and it was alarming to hear the Dublin county coroner call cocaine the biggest killer of all.  Cocaine was a factor in almost one third of drug-related deaths into which inquests were held in Dublin city in recent years.  This shows the direction in which society is going.  There have been incidents of multi-organ failure leading to death as a result of damp and pure cocaine being used.  In my city of Waterford, young men died as a result of taking damp cocaine.</P>
        <P>Education is the key.  We need to educate young people about the dangers of drugs and experimenting with them.  People can be unlucky in that young lads trying cocaine for the first time can lose their lives as a result of experimenting with these drugs.</P>
        <P>Law enforcement in this area needs to be addressed.  Serious investment in the use of high quality breeds of trained drug dogs and trained handlers for random searches in pubs and nightclubs should be addressed.  This should be available on a regional basis.  This suggestion has been welcomed by publicans and nightclub owners whose hands are tied unless they have proof.  I heard some nightclub owners and publicans say that they must put Vaseline on toilet seats and other surfaces to prevent cocaine use in toilets.  This is how under-resourced they believe they are in tackling this drugs epidemic.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt there has been a major breakdown in society since the mid-1990s.  As a nation, we have failed to produce sound role models which our young people can proudly emulate.  They believe the church has let them down in many ways and that the Government has let them down with many broken promises and the squandering of resources.  There is nothing to fill <Col N="541"/>the void but a Celtic tiger which has fuelled greed and where consumerism has become the new God.  As we know, that could not last and for many, it has come to nought.</P>
        <P>We have seen a horrific increase in the suicide figures and an increase in violent crime as a result of alcohol and drug abuse.  Any effective cross-party approach must invest in the family and in parenting as a major priority in the fight against substance abuse.</P>
        <P>I welcome the setting up of the alcohol advisory committee as a way to combat alcohol abuse.  However, the Minister has set very strict terms of reference for the review group and I urge him to expand its remit to include an analysis of the current advertisement regulations.  Without a realistic framework, it is unlikely that the review group&rsquo;s recommendations will be acted on.  Its remit should be expanded.</P>
        <P>I am glad to contribute to this debate.  We need to take a cross-party and cross-departmental approach to tackle alcohol and drug misuse which are tearing our society apart.  Any suggestions made by Members on both sides should be taken on board by the various Ministers and acted on as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important the agreed all-party motion gives equality of importance to the issues of alcohol misuse and illegal drug use.  In the past we have tended to portray the situation in regard to illegal drug use as a crisis while the abuse and use of alcohol has been seen as a minor problem and some type of local difficulty.  The reality is that alcohol, as a legal drug, contributes to most deaths in this country.  It is also a lubricant which breaks down resistance, particularly among young people, and enables them to experiment with other types of illegal listed substances.  On these grounds, we should be more honest in admitting that the ultimate gateway drug is alcohol.</P>
        <P>The ambivalence towards alcohol in our society has led us down a road where we have failed to take the necessary action, either through legislation or informed public debate, to bring about better standards.  If there is to be a value to this debate, this is one of the areas we might explore.</P>
        <P>I can cite a particular example of the dangers of alcohol without the added complications of illegal drug use.  A number of months ago I became aware of an incident in Cork city centre involving a group of young people who were out one Friday night.  They were mostly over 18 years of age but there was a young girl in their company who was 17 years of age and who was drinking without her parents&rsquo; permission, like tens of thousands of young people every weekend.  The group of four to five young people left a bar and went to some type of fast food outlet to get food but came across another group comprising slightly older young people of 20 years of age or so and mainly male.  That group had also consumed large quantities of alcohol and, having been fuelled with <Col N="542"/>alcohol, it was more menacing.  There was an exchange of words which led to jostling and punching.  People were singled out, including the 17 year old girl who was picked on by two other women who scratched her face beyond recognition, pushed her to the ground and knocked her unconscious.  As she was coming to, a hero of modern Ireland kicked her in the face causing her to lose four front teeth.  I cite this incident because that young girl was my daughter.</P>
        <P>Experiences such as this happens every weekend.  That weekend when we went to the accident and emergency department in the local hospital, there were five similar cases &mdash; one involved a young woman while four others involved young men of a similar age.  Until we can get our heads around the idea of alcohol being one of the biggest menaces in our society, I do not believe we can even come close to tackling the problem of illegal drug use.  Even though it is damaging, pernicious and brings about a culture of criminality, I do not believe it causes the kind of damage caused by alcohol use and abuse in our society.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We have made a number of incorrect political choices on this road.  The legislation put in place that allows a voluntary code of practice by the drinks industry is bad legislation.  From time to time in this House, we rail about the dangers of self-regulation and the need for independent bodies to bring about better standards.  Nowhere is this more necessary than in the area of alcohol advertising.  I hope that during the term of this Government, that legislation is revisited.  We cannot allow people to police themselves in this area.  The knock-on from that is how advertising is used and how alcohol use is glamorised and associated with young people and sporting events.</P>
        <P>We live in a country where one of our major exports is an alcoholic product.  Despite that, there is a lack of honesty in the debate on alcohol.  Such an attitude has led to an ambivalence towards illegal drug use here.  While many authority figures have railed against the use of cocaine in recent years, it did not seem to be a problem when it was an upper middle class drug of choice, as it has been for the past 15 years.  It is only when it began to be used by those with a different socioeconomic status that more questions started to be asked.  In spite of all the deaths, it is often glamorised, depending on the status of the exponents involved and their lifestyles.  It is the ambivalence that we have towards taking alcohol that has led to this double standard towards drugs such as cocaine.  While we allow this ambivalence to continue, it will be very difficult to put in place alternatives that stop the supply and ultimately reduce its use.</P>
        <P>We must admit that the taking of any drug &mdash; legal or illegal &mdash; occurs for a number of reasons.  For many participants, it induces a euphoria.  This euphoria is compensation for something lacking in their lives.  We can rail all we like against the <Col N="543"/>medical dangers involved in taking any drug in any quantity, but while people feel they take something positive out of taking drugs, our job becomes even more difficult.</P>
        <P>There have been innovative proposals on how we might get around this.  Some people talk about market mechanisms.  Others talk about making illegal substances legal.  However, the reality is that we have an economy in this country that supports drug use.  While it is an illegal black economy, it sustains the lives of far too many people.  We do not offer a better social or economic alternative.  While millions have been pumped into organisations like the local task forces, I must wonder, as somebody with a youth and community background, to what extent has too much of that money gone to sustain an administration and how little has gone into providing the actual services and facilities needed to provide an alternative to young people.  Until we get that balance right, we will be engaged in an exercise of running up the hill backwards.</P>
        <P>I hope we face this debate with more honesty in the future.  There are signs that the type of knee-jerk reaction that such debates would have caused in the past are no longer as prevalent as they used to be.  Public representatives from across the political spectrum are addressing this issue with an intelligence which I believe has been sadly lacking in the past.  However, we need to be consistent in addressing the problem, understanding it and coming up with an appropriate response.  Ultimately, we must be honest and admit that much of the approaches we have taken to date have failed.  Until we reach that level of honesty, the approaches we need to take might be further away than ever.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this all-party motion on alcohol misuse and illegal drug use.  I listened with interest to what Senator Boyle had to say on the topic and the story about his daughter.  Unfortunately, many families have experienced this.  It is an all too common occurrence on our streets that young people are attacked unprovoked by people who are either drunk or on drugs.  The question of safety of young people in our cities and towns is predominant on parents&rsquo; minds.  They hear stories from their children about the experiences and the risks and one no longer feels confident about young people going out at night, such is the nature of the threat on our streets.</P>
        <P>I also agreed with Senator Boyle when he spoke about the ambivalence in our attitudes.  The ambivalence has been seen in these Houses over the years as well.  The time has definitely come for change.  The publicans and the drinks industry lobby have been too strong and have had too much influence on legislation.  They have also had too much influence on Government policy.  We must get clear about what we want to see happening.  I hope the Senator and his party will <Col N="544"/>use their influence on the Government so that we do not see this ambivalent attitude continuing, because I think it still exists.  The only thing it has come up with is the expert task force on the issue of alcohol misuse, which reported to the Government in 2005.  Rather than implementing the recommendations of this task force, the Minister of State has now put in place a new group to report to him.  We need to examine the recommendations of that task force and ask what the delay is about, why are the original recommendations not being implemented and where is the national policy on alcohol.  The ambivalence is in not having stricter codes of practice for advertising to young people.  It is there in the glamorisation to which young people are continuously exposed.</P>
        <P>I recognise the work which Senator Keaveney did in this area with her committee.  We must pull together all the recommendations from these various groups and come up with a strong, integrated policy that is not ambivalent on the issue.  If we do not do so, the implications will be even more serious.</P>
        <P>Reading the report that came out on 25 January leads me to believe there is a crisis at present.  The statistics are startling.  One in four respondents aged 15 to 64 reported taking illegal drugs at one point in their lives.  These young people have the access, the money, the need and the opportunity to take drugs.  It is frightening.  The most commonly used illegal drug is cannabis and 23% of those questioned used it at least once in their lifetime, while 7% used it in the last year and 3% used it in the last month.  There is a 22% use of cannabis among all adults.  There are very different views on cannabis, but I believe it can be a gateway drug for people.  The damage it can do has been greatly underestimated and I would refer the House to the studies that have been done on cannabis use and psychosis.  Young men are very much at risk.  All of this is linked to alcohol, because it is difficult to separate alcohol policy and drugs.</P>
        <P>I wish to talk about the task force and the new group appointed by the Minister of State.  I welcome the fact that it will report quickly.  Again, I agree with Senator Boyle about the legislation that has been passed and that there are flaws.  One can see from every garage one goes to nowadays that cost and availability influences usage.  Availability is ubiquitous and this is a major problem for communities.  They are very unhappy that alcohol is so easily available, whether at garages or off-licences, and about the disorder this leads to.</P>
        <P>It is important that the needs and views of young people should be taken into account in the new group set up by the Minister of State.  There is no representative, for example, from either the youth work sector or the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  We must also recognise the enormous cultural attitudes that are at play.  To change cultural attitudes and <Col N="545"/>values is tricky.  It can be done through education and information.  The links between the drug task forces, for example, and the schools have not been made effectively.  We want to see greater linkage between what is being done by Government and reaching young people in the schools.  That is where the change in mindset can be brought about at an earlier stage, as well as in the home.  I would be interested if the Minister of State could address this.</P>
        <P>A clear national strategy is needed to tackle alcohol misuse, not just task forces and expert groups but a clear plan with goals and a timeframe.  Many people believe the illegal drug problem is being exacerbated by the Government&rsquo;s lack of action in tackling alcohol misuse.  The report by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, published on 25 January, reveals some stark statistics which give a real insight into the scale of the problem with drugs.  I have quoted some of them already.  An increase of 18.5% in four years is extraordinary.  We need a more co-ordinated plan in our schools.  The Minister of State has yet to appoint a social, personal and health education regional development officer to liaise between young students and the local drugs task forces, and this is a lost opportunity.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address this.</P>
        <P>The quantity of drugs coming into the country is clearly a major issue, given the statistics available and the volumes being found.  The Garda says this is only the tip of the iceberg.  It is nothing compared with what actually is coming in.  The question of small airports and how well resourced the Customs and Excise service is should be looked at as well as the role of the Naval Service.  It is small but whatever we can do to intercept drug supplies must be done.  This is a worldwide issue and is not easy to deal with, but clearly in this country we are losing the fight against the importation of drugs.  That is a key area that needs to be taken much more seriously and addressed in greater detail.</P>
        <P>In my constituency I see how intimidated individual families feel.  They are very nervous about reporting people who cause anti-social behaviour in the area.  It difficult for families to do because they are nervous about repercussions and there is a real sense of being intimidated.  I do not envy the Garda its job in this area.  There is no doubt that gangland feuds, violent crime and intimidation are becoming widespread in many areas in large towns and cities.  The Dublin coroner recently released statistics which show that cocaine is a factor in almost one third of all inquests into drug related deaths in the capital.  We have discussions in the Seanad on the increased use of cocaine and the frightening damage, danger and death to which it can lead.</P>
        <P>On the crime side, we have seen the Central Statistics Office figures which show a 21% increase in drug offences.  This indicates that something serious is happening in terms of access and usage and the resultant health implications <Col N="546"/>and offences.  The type of scenario Senator Boyle spoke about is being fuelled by all these factors.</P>
        <P>It is very distressing for families when young adults who are drug-addicted find it very difficult to get services.  Frequently, one hears of 18 or 20-week waiting lists.  If a young person has reached a point where the family can support him or her into treatment, we must seek to ensure it is available.   This is far from being the case, as we know, and it certainly is so in Dublin.  I am not so familiar with other regions in the country but in my area it is a real problem for families as they try to hold the young person who says he or she is ready for treatment but cannot access it.  The lack of inpatient beds for detoxification is also an issue.  If we want to support people in giving up drugs, that issue must be looked at as well.  I believe cross-party support is available for whatever initiatives are needed in this regard.</P>
        <P>Having alternatives for young people is important.  The youth caf&eacute; movement, for example, is a great help.  A youth caf&eacute; was established recently in my area.  It has taken the young people a couple of years to get it up and running because of the work they had to do in terms of premises, resources and agreements.  We need a youth plan urgently.  Alternatives at an early age so that young people can get involved in sports and community activities, and having safe places where they can meet are clearly important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The pressure for this debate probably arose from the high-profile deaths before Christmas, in the same way that the initiative to do something about crime stemmed from the killing of Veronica Guerin.  Whatever the reason for this debate, I am pleased it is not just focusing on cocaine, heroin, ecstasy or cannabis and includes our drug of choice, alcohol.  The Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which I chaired, produced a large number of reports on these topics, and reviewed the request to have alcohol brought under the National Drugs Strategy.  I do not have much time in which to put the few points I want to make, many of which evolved from visiting other countries and meeting experts in each of the fields.  There are two key issues concerning all drugs, namely, supply and demand.  There is no supply without demand, and that is the most difficult item to deal with. </P>
        <P>The introduction of alcohol from a very young age, from ten onwards it seems, often creates major difficulties.  By the time a young person has been drinking for two years, he or she finds there is not the same buzz and often resorts to other substances as well.  In the past drugs replaced alcohol as it was deemed unsafe to mix them.  Now the buzz of the drug is no longer sufficient and we are at a stage where drugs and alcohol are commonly mixed.  Many people start with smoking, and then move on to alcohol as well, and thence to habit forming addictive substances.  This <Col N="547"/>progression ensures the next step for some &mdash; not all &mdash; is to another addictive substance.</P>
        <P>We must look at demand and how it is culture related.  If the culture of an area or class is such that drugs are tolerated or accepted, this will yield its own pressures and results.  Drugs are classless and permeate all sections of society at this time.  If the culture in an area is such that drugs are not accepted, however, this will yield its own type of pressure and results.  In Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s when communities said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drugs, this was seen to have a major impact.  Out of this emerged the National Drugs Strategy and perhaps, too, the reluctance to link alcohol with drugs at that time.  However, there was a strong movement by the people to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drugs.  Those same people who sought to keep alcohol out of the equation at that time are now begging for its inclusion because alcohol and drugs combined now comprise the issue.  One is as difficult an issue as the other.</P>
        <P>From the international perspective, we need to look at the source and where they are grown.  The debate should focus on whether farmers there should be paid to grow the raw materials and have the crop openly destroyed by a responsible organisation or paid to set aside the land so that the crop is not grown.  We must consider major measures such as these.  With regard to who pays for it, internationally it would pay us more to support an effort to provide these farmers with a different income.  When one considers what they are paid for the drug when it is harvested compared with what it is sold for on the streets, it is much less of an investment and many countries should contribute to this.</P>
        <P>Sniffer dogs are not the answer to everything but they are quite significant.  If they are as effective as they seem to be, why do we not have more of them?  We have fewer than 20 in the country between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs and Excise, unless the situation has changed since I chaired the committee.</P>
        <P>In New Zealand they even have dogs to sniff out fruit.  If one flies into New Zealand one will see the dogs at the airport.  We arrived very late after a long journey.  I approached the handler of a dog who probably wondered what I was doing racing up to ask about their dogs at that hour of the day.  I quickly declared I was a Member of Parliament and I was interested in the dogs.  I asked whether the dogs were for drugs but they stated while they did have dogs for drugs, the particular dogs they had were there to sniff out apples.  In my presence, the dog discovered an apple in a lunch box in someone&rsquo;s hand luggage.  The dog did all the actions to prove something was present.</P>
        <P>Why are the New Zealand people worried about apples?  To them, their agricultural products are very important, as is their good name for agricultural products.  They do not want anything entering the country to disturb the equilibrium of <Col N="548"/>their agricultural produce.  If they protect at this level for apples at airports, why do we not seek the same protection for our young people by the use of similar measures?</P>
        <P>Sniffer dogs have a potential not only at airports but also roaming around with a handler on a street or in green spaces as we have in my area.  It sounds over the top to discuss bringing them into discos and pubs but if we are serious about drugs, surely the dogs should be more prevalent and used more at various locations and in spot checks.  In Border regions they would be particularly useful.</P>
        <P>Recently, I watched a programme on tobacco trafficking and the issue was that people knew a great deal of cigarettes were trafficked into the country and they could discover the people involved and the cigarettes but they could not do much about it.  Does this show up gaps in legislation which need to be filled?  If we are accessible for illegal cigarettes does the message go out that we are lax about other substances?</P>
        <P>I congratulate Customs and Excise, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Minister of State and all involved in the ongoing discoveries.  However, I accept we only discover approximately 10% of what comes into the country.  Another way of putting it is that it is only a drop in the ocean.  Is it time to man the lighthouses again?  Recently, a major cargo of drugs was discovered.  If the lighthouses were manned to watch for unusual behaviour of vessels or vehicles we would have another arm to our security.</P>
        <P>We should resource the Criminal Assets Bureau properly and ensure cross-Border co-operation and that information crosses the Border.  This is pertinent in my area.  We must take account of those with no visible means of income.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced prior to Christmas that he will expand the role of CAB.  We will only succeed when we hit in the pockets those making serious money.</P>
        <P>We need full co-operation with international police forces and to continue to work with an excellent organisation based in Lisbon.  We have strengthened our links to this.  Having attended a number of conferences in Brussels dealing with drugs I know the organisation based in Lisbon is internationally recognised as superb at what it does.</P>
        <P>People must know this issue is taken seriously and this can be demonstrated through enforcing the mandatory ten-year sentence.  I call on judges to explain why they do not impose a mandatory sentence.  I thought A plus B equals C.  However, it does not seem to work like this.</P>
        <P>Alcohol should be taken seriously as it is a gateway as well as a dangerous drug in itself when abused.  It affects organs and kills people through enabling or facilitating them to commit suicide or have an accident brought on by being drunk.  It also causes serious injury through fighting.  We have seen billboards recently which portray med<Col N="549"/>ics as stating they do not want to face the drunk abusive person any more.  They want to do their jobs in a safe environment.</P>
        <P>While it is not popular to state it, only through raising the cost of alcohol will we ensure consumption decreases.  In the recent budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, promised that the issue of the cost of alcohol would be examined.  However, it must be examined on an all-island basis.  In the area I am from, if alcohol becomes more expensive here than it is in the Six Counties we will have massive trafficking of alcohol across the Border.</P>
        <P>We should support those with addictions and we do not do it enough.  I want more support for drugs task forces.  Young people should be given the tools to be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drugs.  Ireland is known for its enterprise skills base.  Why not have a skills base for society?  No Name clubs must be expanded as must the role of sports clubs in demonstrating the virtues of not celebrating everything through drink.  I would like to see the GAA supported in what it was doing.</P>
        <P>I would also like to see investment in the arts.  I heard everyone in the Tallaght band went on to third level education.  The discipline the music gave them enabled them to feel part of a team.  This decreases isolation and gives people the ability to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; if they want to.</P>
        <P>I love the idea of enjoying a drink sensibly or responsibly.  How can one drink responsibly when one does not know what is in it?  We must consider the labelling issue with regard to alcohol, sugar, calorie and fat content.  If I want to be responsible when I go on a diet I can do so with food because I am facilitated by the food industry.  From the perspective of drinks, however, I cannot do so.  I do not know whether one drink has more calories than another or whether one has a higher sugar content than another, which means I cannot drink responsibly.</P>
        <P>It is stated that it takes a long time for culture to change.  Drink-driving stopped very quickly.  We need to introduce more media education.  I am not sure whether the voluntary code of conduct is working.  I welcome the new initiative by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, however, which will examine many of these issues.</P>
        <P>I am delighted we finally had a chance to exchange our views here even though the time seems short.  I could go on all night but I appreciate the forbearance of the Cathaoirleach.</P>

        <P>I listened to the debate on the monitor in my office and I believe a certain amount of misinformation has been stated.  We must honestly face the facts about drugs.  I know a number of people who smoke cannabis regularly and it does not appear to do them the slightest bit of harm.  It relaxes them, they do not become violent and they do not take any other type of drugs.  They have done this for years.  This nonsense about trying to link it to violence is simply that.  It is not factual and we ought to face this.  A small number of people may experience psychotic episodes or depression and this is the same as with any other substance.</P>
        <P>The State must be careful about intervening in these areas.  I have stated for a long time that when considered in the cold realistic light of day, what is driving the drugs epidemic is the enormous amounts of money available to criminals.  By our actions we are feeding into this system.  They way to kill it is to legalise, regulate, control and quality-control.</P>

        <P>With regard to alcohol, a schizophrenia or double-think exists.  I agree with what Senator Keaveney stated but she was not hard enough on the drinks industry.  The Senator made a very useful point on labelling.  How can one be careful or prudent?  The industry does not give a rattling damn whether one is careful because it is interested in profit.  The &ldquo;Drink Responsibly&rdquo; slogan is a soft soap and mirage.  It is a classic fig leaf because the last thing the industry wants is responsible drinking.  It targets young people in the same way the cigarette industry, having been driven out of this country by action, is targeting Africa.  We need resolute action and if the Government were serious, it would stop all booze advertising straight away.  Having had the courage to take this step in the case of nicotine, it should do so once more with alcohol because advertising spreads the epidemic.</P>
        <P>We know what are the factors that drive up alcohol consumption, namely, cheap prices and ease of access.  This has been demonstrated by scientific studies all over the world, yet we have this stupid, industry-funded organisation, MEAS &mdash; how independent is that? &mdash; producing idiotic slogans and doing its best to undermine the professionals and medical experts working in this area.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that Mr. Prasifka from the Competition Authority is now sticking his nose into this issue.  As a member of the policing committee for the north inner city, I raised the issue of licensing as part of our discussion of planning <Col N="551"/>and licensing.  I noted that every huckster&rsquo;s shop in the north inner city is stacked to the rafters with gin, wine, whiskey and every damned alcoholic drink one wants.  The response I received was that any restriction on this practice would be a restriction on competition, which is not in the interests of citizens.  Where did this idea come from?  It derives from the fact that at the highest levels we have an ideological commitment to competition which frequently is not in the interests of the ordinary consumer.  The case I highlighted is a classic example.  The neighbours of the shops in questions, the local police and, in some cases, the city council objected but the shops still have licences.  Why?  People should be made accountable.</P>
        <P>We know consumption declines when taxation increases.  Taxation on alcohol was last increased on spirits and the measure led directly to a 20% diminution in the consumption of spirits.  In recent years, however, we have not had a single increase in the rate of duty on pints of stout, beer, alcopops and so forth, whereas the profit margin on these products has increased by 50%.</P>
        <P>We still have people such as Bill Prasifka objecting on ideologically driven competition grounds to any interference with the practice of selling below cost.  In what kind of society does one charge 50 cent for a tin of beer as an inducement?  I am utterly opposed to this practice.  In a way, I am like Janus in that I am facing both ways.  On the one hand, I am a liberal who does not believe what people ingest is the State&rsquo;s business unless it leads to them manifesting bizarre and dangerous behaviour.  The reason people manifest such behaviour and batter old ladies is that they are starved of the drugs they want, principally heroin.  By demonising cannabis, one does not do justice to the cause.</P>

	<P>I do not propose to discuss drugs because I do not know enough about them.  However, I disagree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s view on their legalisation.  That approach is much too simple, as we have seen elsewhere.  The other way to achieve success is to change hearts and minds, as we did in the case of plastic bags.  I was interviewed today by the <i>International Herald Tribune </i>about plastic bags and those with whom I spoke were thrilled to learn how attitudes have changed in this regard.</P>
        <P>Ireland also has succeeded in changing attitudes to drink-driving, particularly among young people.  While there are exceptions, most young people do not drink and drive.  We must achieve a similar change in attitude towards alcohol and drugs but this will not be done through legislation alone.</P>
        <P>Two years ago while in Salt Lake City my wife and I visited a restaurant with our hosts.  When one of us ordered red wine and the other ordered white wine, our hosts told us that this presented a problem because under the city&rsquo;s law one <Col N="552"/>cannot have two bottles of wine on a restaurant table at the same time.  We had to drink white wine first and then red wine.  Legislation is difficult to enforce but it can be effective, as it has been in the case of plastic bags.</P>
        <P>Those in the drinks industry and those trying to encourage people to be more sensible about drinking are operating on an uneven playing field.  For the umpteenth time, the old controversy about alcohol advertising is being rehearsed.  The anti-alcohol lobby wants drinks advertising banned, while the drinks industry argues that it should be allowed to apply voluntary controls.  Both arguments are flawed.  A 100% duty should be imposed on all publicity expenses incurred by alcohol companies.  This money should be ring-fenced in a fund, which would be used by an independent body to put across an anti-alcohol message to the public.  Publicity expenses would cover advertising and promotional bills as well as the administrative cost each company incurs in running a marketing department.  It would apply to Irish media expenditure and to an appropriate proportion of expenditure on overseas media whose coverage spills into this market.</P>
        <P>At one stroke, this measure would achieve two objectives.  It would make available to those who argue against alcohol exactly the same level of resources available to those who promote drink products.  Second, since the anti-drink promotion would be controlled by an independent body rather than the drinks lobby, this body would be free to highlight dramatically the downside of excessive drinking which, unsurprisingly, the current industry-sponsored promotional activity does not do.</P>
        <P>Spending liable to the 100% publicity duty would extend to sports sponsorship which is widespread and used incongruously to get around the recent restrictions on direct advertising.  This would remove at least part of the moral dilemma facing the GAA and other sports bodies which must now sup with the devil to secure the resources they need to develop their respective games.  If they knew every euro they received from the drinks industry was matched by a further euro to propagate an anti-drink message, many conscientious members of the GAA would sleep better at night.</P>
        <P>Our current approach to this issue is not working and our dependence on drink consumption continues to increase, with negative results on all aspects of society.  The question is whether we have the courage to take a decisive step to reverse the process before we are all too sozzled to do anything.</P>
        <P>Dr. Joe Barry asked why we have not implemented the findings of the task force on alcohol.  Certain steps can be taken.  The task force report was issued three or four years ago and we know what must be done.  All that is required is courage on the part of the Govern<Col N="553"/>ment which must grasp the nettle and take the action needed.</P>
        <P>As Senator Fitzgerald stated, we must change the mindset of the population.  We have good examples of achieving this in other areas.  We need to take some steps to encourage this change.  I do not agree with imposing total bans or with the legalisation and control of drugs, as proposed by Senator Norris.  Both views are wrong.  Let us see if we can change the hearts and minds of our population.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, to the House.  I acknowledge the achievements of the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Pat Carey, in his efforts to minimise the problem of drug abuse.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with Senator Norris&rsquo;s view on the legalisation of drugs and I sing from the same hymn sheet as Senator Quinn on many of the issues he raised.  We must address the roots of this fundamental problem, for which there is no fixed solution.  Why is there such an escalation in the misuse of drugs?  Despite prosperity, full employment and a great deal of money in circulation, the increase in our standard of living has a dark side.  We have a society in which people are not happy with their lot.  We have misery, dysfunctional families, erosion of the fabric of society and questioning of society&rsquo;s structures.  I do not want to be negative but these are fundamental reasons there is unhappiness.  One way of alleviating it is through the use of drugs.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the work being done through the national drugs strategy to tackle the problem but money is not always the answer.  We are bringing together all the elements of the drugs policy in Ireland under a single framework.  The strategy deals with supply, prevention, treatment, research and rehabilitation.  We already have a framework which refers to the integrated approach involving the community, educationalists, the Department of Health and Children, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, parents, agencies, the community and voluntary workers.  The question is how to integrate all these groups.</P>
        <P>I shall speak about the prevention aspect, that is, creating a national awareness programme.  That should be done through television, radio, information booklets, targeting schools, parents, better education programmes and better information.  Schools must be vigilant.  There should be no tolerance threshold whatever in schools while a student is wearing the school uniform.  It should be acknowledged that pushers are about while children are on their way to school.  When information comes to the school about a student who is dabbling, schools should come down like a ton of bricks on him or her.  School policy should be reinforced regularly at every parent-teacher meeting.  Parents must play a role.  Schools should <Col N="554"/>look to parents for support and co-operation within the community.</P>
        <P>Space must be provided in the curriculum for people working with drugs.  The target in education today is points in the leaving certificate and a concentration on academic achievement.   We all had to go in that direction.  Sometimes it is difficult to find slots in the timetable to invite guest speakers on drugs.  Programmes must be put in place.  We do not want old fogies dressed in collars and ties as guest speakers but people who have dabbled in drugs and came out at the other end.  These are the people we want, not people like me, a careers guidance councillor.  I could go in and speak about drugs but I do not have the experience of what it is like to have been there and done that.</P>
        <P>While parents express concern about the scourge of drugs in society, there is not enough vigilance in regard to knowing where their sons or daughters are or who they are with.  Parents must have the gumption to monitor their children&rsquo;s whereabouts.  Parents say to me that the problem of drugs is dreadful.  There may be a household down the road where a young boy or girl has been dabbling in drugs.  We need to become leaders in our community and in society.  This is not my issue, rather it is a societal one that affects every one of us.  It is not a money issue.</P>
        <P>Premises must be put in place in communities and funds must be made available for the provision of sports or recreational services in them for young students.  Funds should be available for training initiatives for teachers, councillors and voluntary groups.  I compliment the regional and local drugs task forces, all of which are working well.  It will fail, however, if we all do not take it into our own hands to help alleviate the problem.  It is about goodwill.  A Senator said earlier it is a mindset.  One has to change the mind and the body thinking on this issue.  Otherwise it will creep into every household.</P>
        <P>How do we teach our young people to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  It cannot be done when they have reached the age of 18 or 19 years.  It must be done from an early age, examples must be set and a model must come from the home in terms of a family life.  In my reading of this problem there is no other way.  I appreciate that schools are trying hard and are reaching out but it is a societal issue.  If every community takes it on itself to work with the teachers, the Garda, the local voluntary groups, the leaders in the community and the doctors, we have some hope.  The old saying is that one starts at one&rsquo;s local base and if the local base is right, it will be right up along the ladder.</P>
        <P>What programmes can be put in place in our communities and schools to help lure those who have dropped out to come back into play?  There are the community employment scheme, the lifelong learning programme and the vocational training opportunities scheme.  I compliment the vocational education committees who are reaching out to communities at large and have become <Col N="555"/>aware of the existence of such problems in their midst.  That is the way we should go about treatment and rehabilitation.  There are no fixed solutions to this problem.  We must be flexible in our attitudes and policies as the challenges arise.  It is possible to beat it because it is in our nature.  As Irish people we never let things get on top of us in a community and we must deal with it in this way.  We are all leaders in our communities but parents, families and society must get this right.  Money and legislation will not do it but if we all work together we will eradicate this awful scourge in our society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is an appropriate and worthwhile debate.  The first thing we need to give our young people is the confidence to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Therein lies the key.  To give young people the confidence to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; is to engage in a holistic set of practices from the time children are born.  I believe that a State system of preschool education, which may seem far removed from the issue, is an element of the solution to the extent that from early childhood the intervention in children&rsquo;s lives will make them confident and able to feel sufficiently good about themselves that they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the crowd.  Therein lies the key.  The tragedy is the youngster who, because he or she does not have that self-belief and has not built-up and developed confidence and knowledge, is afraid to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and is influenced by peers and goes with the flow.  Those who lack confidence and self-belief suffer most in the long term.</P>
        <P>Every imaginable strategy, and I do not need to list them all in such a learned assembly, such as preschool intervention and intervention right through the school system should be put in place.  Between the Health Service Executive and various Departments youth caf&eacute;s should be created in every town of reasonable size.  I appreciate that some moves are afoot in this area but it needs national development, co-ordination and active promotion.  There should be a youth caf&eacute; in every town of reasonable size, a drop-in centre with an infrastructure and facilities such as pool tables, the Internet, appropriate games, a seating area, coffee and soft drink facilities and so on, as well as the discreet presence of professional counsellors who could be accessed by the young people.  The provision of such caf&eacute;s is critical.  There is also a compelling case for the provision of skate parks, of which there are none at present in my constituency, as well as running tracks and sports infrastructure.  I was heartened to see my local authority recently appoint a sports officer, which is happening in many local authority areas.</P>
        <P>The holistic approach to the development and creative support of young people unfortunately needs to be paralleled by active policing.  I understand the Minister of State will be proactive in this regard.  With his colleagues in Government, <Col N="556"/>he should consider the policing issue.  The Government stands condemned in that the drugs squad is not sufficiently large, an area which needs correction.  For their small number, drugs squad officers are doing great work but we need a beefed-up drugs squad and increased numbers of young, plain-clothes garda&iacute; going into clubs to maintain a police presence.  The greater that presence, the better.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s suggestion that we should have clear labelling of drink to give people a responsible attitude to drinking.  The Minister must seriously consider the issues of drinking in the home and binge drinking outside the traditional public house situation.  Those of us who grew up in the era of the traditional public house and who are familiar with its way of operating know that a type of moral sanction operated owing to the presence of other people in a pub.  There was a closing time and some sort of structure, and drink was relatively expensive, all of which provided some sort of control.  Now, with below cost selling, youngsters are coming out of supermarkets with trays of cans and bottles of drink at a very cheap price.  It is a serious issue.</P>
        <P>I declare an interest in that I previously had an active involvement in the pub trade which I do not currently have in the sense of actively working in one.  None the less, a local publican told me over Christmas that he could buy trays of drink cheaper in his local supermarket and make more by selling it in his pub.  I see Senator Ellis concurs.  That trolleys full of drink are being brought to house parties has serious implications.  I ask the Minister to consider curbs in this area, perhaps with regard to the times at which one could not purchase drink in supermarkets, such as during peak weekend times.  While the issue of age is being considered, availability is another issue and there is a case for having shuttered areas of off licences so the shutters could be pulled down at certain times.  The ease, attractiveness and simplicity of purchasing drink as well as its cheap cost are issues to be considered.</P>
        <P>Drink advertising is a vexed question.  Although I am no expert, I feel we would be better not having such advertising.  I do not know the degree to which this would help but it should be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The drug culture that has developed is a tragedy and one of the major issues in contemporary society.  Despite addressing all of the issues with regard to personal development, policing, youth caf&eacute;s, labelling and the availability of drink, none of us likes to get into the question of the decline of traditional religion and morality and the rise of a kind of epicureanism, hedonism or a belief in or need for pleasure as a substitute for core beliefs.  This is not something that can be addressed at a political level but the lack of spirituality is a problem.  While it is not our brief to deal with this problem, it is at the core of these difficulties.</P><Col N="557"/>
        <P>This is a complex and serious issue.  I am aware of the points made in the debate and there is no logic in repeating them other than to give my personal view.  In summary, we need investment in youth caf&eacute;s and sports infrastructure and an emphasis on the pastoral care of youngsters.  We must address the issue of labelling, advertising and the availability of drink as well as the upgrading of the drugs squad in terms of numbers and resources.  We need plain-clothes police at all public functions that young people attend.  It is sad to say it, but it is a necessity and the good that will accrue from this will far outweigh any costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House for this important debate.  We do not realise the type of social problems being created for our young people and among families by alcohol and drugs abuse.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has pre-empted me in some of his comments but I reiterate that off-licences have become a problem.  We know many rural pubs have disappeared and their licences have been sold for off-licences at petrol stations and other premises.  This has had a detrimental effect on social life in rural Ireland.  As we knew it, the rural pub was a place where many young people learned to drink.  If they got out of order, the mammy or daddy knew it before they were home.  Locals would try to keep them under control and educate them in how to use alcohol.  Education is the first issue we must consider in dealing with alcohol, drugs or cigarettes &mdash; they are all drugs and must be treated with contempt perhaps, or the sternness that is needed to deal with such substances.</P>
        <P>Another new phenomenon is the rise of drinking in the home.  Some people in rural Ireland no longer feel safe going to the pub owing to the drink driving laws, although none of us would suggest leniency for those who drink and drive.  However, as people cannot go to the pub, they bring the alcohol to the house.  We all know a house measure is about three times a pub measure &mdash; we have all had to suffer when a householder offers a glass that contains enough for a night&rsquo;s drinking.  Alcohol is now being taken home and a much greater volume is being consumed than if people were in the pub or drinking socially.  People feel secure because they do not have to drive home.  If they want an extra drink, it does not matter and they hope the effect will have worn off before they drive the next day.</P>
        <P>We do not take enough time to consider the issue of young people and alcohol.  Many young people feel they have not been out drinking if they do not get stoned.  This is a result of a lack of education.  There is a need for schools to educate students when they reach transition year &mdash; in fact, many are drinking long before they reach transition year.  We must accept that if they want to obtain alcohol they will do so, but we must <Col N="558"/>educate them on its use and the dangers it can pose in later life if abused.  We have all seen people who have been destroyed by alcohol as well as others who have taken on the challenge, won and moved on with their lives.  It all comes down to education.  We must show our young people that while it is grand to have two or three pints, they must think hard about the consequences, both for themselves and those around them, if they decide to drink 13 or 14 pints.  The big problem is that alcohol is being purchased in off-licences by older people for under age drinkers.  That should worry us all.  Most towns and villages have an area where young people go to drink alcohol which has been bought for them at the off-licence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O'Reilly referred to the availability of cheap drink, which is a major problem.  In some cases one can buy drink at an off-licence for a third of the price in a bar or disco.  That must be tackled.  There is a case to be made for preventing under-cost selling of alcohol.  Publicans say it is impossible for them to buy alcohol at supermarket prices.  Some supermarkets are selling alcohol as loss-leader products and that needs to be addressed.  People may say that nothing can be done because we must have competition, but when it causes social problems we have a right to examine the matter.</P>
        <P>We can all see the glamorisation of alcohol in advertising sporting or social events.  The drink industry&rsquo;s sponsorship of major sporting occasions, with logos appearing everywhere, provides an accepted profile that basically says it is trendy to be involved with drink from such companies.  Guinness sponsors the GAA championships, while rugby has the Heineken Cup and other major sporting events also attract alcohol sponsorship.  Senator Quinn was right to say that money spent on drink advertising should not be eligible for tax relief.  If such relief was dropped the amount spent on promotion by drink companies would be seriously reduced.  The percentage of drink industry profit margins that goes back into advertising is phenomenal.  While such a change might have a detrimental effect on the advertising industry, we must examine this matter.  The drink industry itself must become responsible for the costs borne by the State in treating alcohol-related problems.  We have seen the positive effect of the smoking ban and, while it may not have reduced smoking that much, it has raised awareness of the dangers involved.</P>
        <P>The biggest scourge is the drugs problem.  A combination of drugs and alcohol has become a common cause of death among young people both here and abroad.  Drugs are available at every street corner and while people know exactly who is pushing them they do not have the courage to tell the Garda authorities, even anonymously.  People think that if it does not affect them it is none of their business.  We have a responsibility to persuade people who are drunk not to drive, but a blind eye is being turned to <Col N="559"/>drug abuse.  Certain people &mdash; and they are not all on the bottom rung of society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;see it as trendy to be regularly involved in cocaine use, which is frightening.  Cocaine sniffing has now become almost as acceptable as snuff was in the early 1900s.  We must tackle this problem.  Everyone can say who is using it and who is pushing it.  In fact, certain sections of our society are very much involved in the transportation and pushing of drugs in the community.  They will have to be targeted by any means at the disposal of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In turn, garda&iacute; must get full support from the public to put an end to drug abuse.  Citizens have a responsibility to do so, although many prefer to turn a blind eye.  There is sufficient legislation to deal with this problem but it must be used to good effect.  When someone is fined only &euro;50 for possessing ecstasy it makes one think.  It is not what one expects.  There are severe sentences for drug pushing but they are not implemented on many occasions because the Judiciary wishes to exercise its discretion, which is its prerogative.  </P>
        <P>As with alcohol, education is required to combat drug abuse.  People who have suffered from alcohol and drugs should be asked to explain to secondary school pupils the dangers involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the growing problems of alcohol and drug misuse.  I agree with virtually everything Senator Ellis has said, including his statement that sufficient legislation is in place to tackle the spiralling problem.  However, insufficient resources are being provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies trying to curb illegal drug abuse.  For some time there has been a growing view that the Government should consider the possibility of banning drink advertising and sponsorship.  Originally, I did not support that position but I think there is a strong case to be made for it now.  A number of years ago we banned sponsorship and advertising by tobacco companies.  Something similar needs to be put in place for the alcohol industry.  I realise it would have knock-on effects for sporting bodies but we must break the association between drink and sport, which glamorises alcohol.  Senator Ellis&rsquo;s point in that regard is correct.  The first step might be to ban sponsorship of sporting events by drink companies.</P>
        <P>Pubs are the focus of the community in many rural areas.</P>
        <P>In recent years, many services have been abolished and the only outlet in many villages is the public house and even they have become more scarce in the past few years.  Alternatives to the public house must be provided, particularly for young people.  Most Oireachtas Members have <Col N="560"/>been involved in voluntary organisations and we are all familiar with the reality in rural areas.  The only venue in which a voluntary organisation can run an event is a public house.  Recently, in a village near where I live, a presentation of medals to an under 14 team had to take place in the local bar because it was the only public building in which it could take place.  Something as simple as that places the focus of the community too much on the public house and that is not good.  We must think of ways to break that relationship.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with those who contend the Government should fix the price of alcohol.  There is no reason the ordinary decent drinker who does not engage in anti-social behaviour or abuse alcohol should pay for the minority who do.  A move to increase prices artificially would be wrong and would not be the correct way to solve the problem.  I have long been a proponent of a ban on the sale of alcopops.  I have drunk the odd alcopop, which is very easy to drink.  It is virtually like drinking lemonade.  Generally I do not favour draconian measures such as banning particular products, but something needs to be done about alcopops.  They are targeted at under age drinkers and the reality is that drinking half a dozen alcopops tastes the same as drinking half a dozen bottles of 7 Up but the effect is somewhat different.</P>
        <P>Speakers have referred to the problems caused by the abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs.  Suicide is a  problem which has not been adequately addressed.  Youth suicide is a particular issue and there is a direct relationship between substance abuse and suicide rates.  If we are serous about tackling the suicide problem, measures must be put in place to tackle these abuses.</P>
        <P>On the issue of illegal drugs, I had the dubious distinction of being present in Waterford Regional Hospital when the two young men who died from cocaine use were brought in.  My father died that evening and I was leaving the hospital via the accident and emergency department, which was empty at the time.  I was a little distracted and I recall passing through the waiting area, where I was presented by an horrific scene.  Nobody in the waiting area had a physical problem but their friends had been transferred to the main hospital and it was a shocking scene with a great deal of screaming and roaring and upset.  Their deaths brought to the forefront the increasing problem of the abuse of illegal substances.  Senator Ellis is absolutely correct that illegal substances can be bought in virtually every village in the State.  They are available at every crossroads and nobody should doubt that.</P>
        <P>The issue is how to counteract this problem.  Policing strategies alone will not solve it.  We must try to influence people&rsquo;s behaviour.  Security should be increased along our seaboard.  A number of my relatives live in west Cork near the spot where the massive drugs find took place last year.  They told me that 15 years ago they gave information to the authorities about strange <Col N="561"/>movements in the area in the middle of the night.  They lived on a cul-de-sac beside the sea and nine or ten cars would travel up and down the boreen at 2 a.m.  Ireland has a lengthy coastline which presents a difficulty, but the State is falling down badly in providing a security presence.  The Government needs to protect and secure our shores.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde referred to the role of families.  A garda or customs officer cannot be deployed on every street corner but the education system could be given an enhanced role in helping young people to make the correct decision to stay away from illegal substances.  Not enough is being done in this regard.  I agree with Senator Ellis that the increase in drugs abuse in recent years has become socially acceptable in middle and upper class Ireland.  He is correct that many of those taking drugs are not on the bottom rung of the socio-economic ladder.  It must first be identified where the problem lies before it can be resolved.  The education system has an important role in this regard, while the security forces also have a role in protecting our coastline.  However, the most important role must be taken on by families to ensure young people do not find themselves in a position where they take illegal substances.  This is not an easy problem to solve and I wish the Minister of State and his colleagues all the best in their work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We were both in Darndale earlier where he launched a project.  We are all proud of Darndale and the Minister of State has done a great deal of work in the area.  The project involves the restoration of a Volkswagen van.  Drug abuse was a major problem in Darndale and the north east drugs task force was established in the area.  I compliment those running the task force on the tremendous work they have done.  As Senator Phelan said, prevention is important.  Thankfully, many drugs after care centres have been set up in Dublin North East.  The centre in Kilbarrack is managed by Marian Clarke and Michael Finn and they do excellent work.  It is very important to support them, because without them the problem would be 100 times worse.  They have achieved a great deal of success.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to the problem of alcohol abuse.  I attended a party on Dame Street a few weeks prior to Christmas.  One young fellow at the bar ordered six drinks costing &euro;122.  I asked the man sitting beside me, who worked in the building industry, what was in the drinks.  He said they were triple vodkas and Red Bull and they cost half the week&rsquo;s wages of the young fellow who had ordered them.  That gives some indication of the education needed at primary level.</P>
        <P>Drink has been glamorised to a degree, and sponsorship in particular should be curtailed.  This Christmas, I witnessed eight to 12 year old children with cans of bulmers going absolutely bananas on the street.  One wonders how much <Col N="562"/>attention their parents are paying them.  Television presenters and others in the media also have a role to play.  It is unacceptable that a television presenter can say it is all right to take recreational drugs because doing so sends the wrong signal.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, who referred to these issues, had a pub which I visited on many occasions.  He ran his business in a responsible manner.  Years ago, customers could not order triple vodkas from publicans until they fell off their feet.  In those days, publicans were responsible.  I worked in pubs on the northside of the city and if a publican assumed that a customer had drank enough alcohol, he or she served no more.  That is no longer the case.</P>
        <P>The Garda has done a tremendous job in terms of the confiscation of drugs and most garda&iacute; will attest they have sufficient resources to do their jobs.  I congratulate the force on the significant success it has achieved in Dublin North.</P>
        <P>Another issue pertaining to drugs is that 19% of the population of the country are on legal drugs, including prescription medicine and anti-depressants.  We should seek statistics from the coroners courts regarding the number of accidents that occur as a result of people consuming legal drugs.  Any legal drug that alters one&rsquo;s mind gives rise to problems which should be investigated.  We should not solely focus on cocaine and heroin.  We seldom see television advertisements warning about the danger of driving motor vehicles under the influence of illegal or legal drugs.</P>
        <P>Senator Ellis referred to the amount of alcohol consumed by some young people.  Education in that regard is needed at an early stage in the school system.  When I attended primary school, officials from the health board visited us to warn of the dangers of smoking.  Such education no longer takes place.  Prevention is the key to the matter.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Dublin north east drugs task force and the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.  A friend of mine, Larry O&rsquo;Toole, sits on the task force and does tremendous work.  He has been on the wrong end of the stick on many occasions but he has great courage.  I also commend the Kilbarrack drug project and Marion Coyle, who is now Marion Clarke.  Unfortunately, certain politicians in the area disagree with her because of her background but I have no problems in that regard.  She is a great person and I do not worry about anybody&rsquo;s background because many people have reformed after experiencing difficulties in their earlier lives.  It is great to see somebody like her doing a good job because her work is important for the children of the area.</P>

	<P>I am pleased we are holding this debate, which reflects on many communities across the island of Ireland.  A number of Senators referred to alcohol and drug <Col N="563"/>abuse, which is prevalent in every townland in the Republic.  We have to face that reality.</P>
        <P>In my role as a public representative and particularly since becoming a Senator, I have liaised with many parents, school teachers and principals, third-level educators and people in the world of sport.  Their concerns about drug abuse seem to increase as the months pass.  Our society is being targeted by those who push drugs and bring them through our ports and borders from mainland Europe and further afield to ruin the lives of families and the health of young people.  A lot is being done by the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, in this area.</P>
        <P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 contains several good proposals, including the establishment of 14 local and ten regional drugs task forces.  One such task force, the north-west regional drugs task force, is based in my area.  The five pillars of responsibility for the task forces are supply reduction, prevention of drug abuse, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
        <P>Drugs are a major problem in regional and small towns as well as in large cities.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na find it particularly difficult to address the issue because of the number of new strands that continually arise.  During the  last quarter of 2007, the issue of drugs rose to national attention because prominent figures lost their lives due to misuse.  The issue affects many people in society.</P>
        <P>I concur with other Senators that the issue cannot solely be addressed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have to consider a wider spectrum.  The drugs task forces, the Departments of Education and Science and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are working together on the issue but we need to address the misuse of drugs at an early stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2007, a consultancy firm was engaged by the Health Service Executive to carry out work on the possible location of a new regional hospital for the north east.  The company in question, The Health Partnership, received 44 submissions from potential locations in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Dublin and Meath.  I understand that two submissions were made from County Cavan and that the proposal regarding a site located in Virginia is one of three that have been short-listed for detailed examination, the others being Ardee and Dunleer in County Louth.  At its initial launch, the experts who prepared the Teamwork report believed that the new hospital should be sited in the south of the north-east region because of its larger population.  However, I disagree and an intense lobbying campaign has been carried out subsequently to have the hospital centrally located within the region.  A strong submission was made by the Virginia Development Association and its supporters to have the hospital located in Virginia close to the M3.  Cavan County Council also has played a vital role in the campaign by placing at its disposal a 64-acre site close to Virginia.  In addition, the county council made a presentation to the Health Partnership, the company charged with responsibility for deciding the new hospital&rsquo;s location.  More than 2,500 jobs would be created and significant spin-offs for the economy within a 30-mile radius of Virginia would arise.</P>
        <P>Although Fianna F&aacute;il and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, support the provision of a new regional hospital, it should not be at the expense of Cavan General Hospital.  It should be a regional hospital that will lead to enhanced services at Cavan General Hospital.  The Taoiseach recently outlined clearly that the new regional hospital proposed for the north east will be on a par with the best in Europe and it is evident that such a facility will be for the benefit of all the people of the north east region.  Essentially, this new hospital will provide those services that are not available to the people of the four counties of the north east and will reduce the region&rsquo;s dependence on access to Dublin hospitals for many aspects of care and treatment.  It makes no sense to propose the location of the new regional hospital for the north east on the outskirts of Dublin or in the towns located close to its outskirts.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Cavan County Council unanimously supports the location of the proposed new hospital in Virginia and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, has given his full backing to the location a number of times.  Moreover, he continues to fight for further investment in Cavan General Hospital and for enhancements to its <Col N="565"/>services.  To date, investment of more than &euro;10 million is under way at Cavan General Hospital.  The new modular building for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation has been provided and the provision of 21 additional beds, four high-dependency beds and a fourth operating theatre is under way and is almost complete.  Major investment has been provided in recent years at Cavan General Hospital and this will continue.</P>
        <P>I repeat that Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, fully support the provision of the new regional hospital and its location in Virginia.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank my colleague, Senator Wilson, for sharing his time on this issue.  I greatly appreciate it and it is consistent with his approach to public life, in that he puts the interests of the community ahead of narrow partisan considerations.  I reiterate my full commitment to and belief in the maintenance and development of services at Cavan General Hospital and at Monaghan hospital.  In that context, I condemn outright the content of yesterday&rsquo;s leaked HSE document that heralded a reduction of services in both.  The regional hospital should be built at the most satisfactory of the remaining locations under consideration.  I understand the Cavan town proposal and a number of others are no longer on the list.  Of the remaining sites, Virginia is by far the most satisfactory for the following reasons.  First, it is best placed geographically.  Second it is located on the N3, as well as the on new M3 motorway.  Third, it is sufficiently far from Dublin to reduce gridlock.  Fourth, a fully-serviced site in public ownership is available.  I urge the HSE to bear in mind these crucial considerations when making the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I will take this adjournment matter on her behalf.</P>
        <P>The aforementioned Teamwork Management Services Limited report, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards, which was prepared for the Health Service Executive, found that the present system in the north east, whereby five local hospitals deliver acute care to a relatively small population, is exposing patients to increased risks.  The report recommended a three-strand action plan comprising the development of a new regional acute hospital; the development of local services with the existing five hospitals and primary and community care providers playing central roles; and the development of a series of clinical networks to bind local and regional services to the needs of patients, including net<Col N="566"/>works for emergency care, surgery and critical care.</P>
        <P>The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE steering group.  Following a tendering process, the HSE appointed a firm of consultants to carry out an independent site location study for the new regional hospital.  The Department has been advised by the HSE that it anticipates the consultants&rsquo; report will be completed in February.  The report then will be considered by the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The first priority in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the north east have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life-saving emergency care.  In the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency inpatient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, the existing five hospitals will continue to provide services that meet the majority of health needs of the community.  The HSE has given an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of the Teamwork report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to recent reports in the media concerning services in the north east, the HSE has advised the Department that no decisions have been taken regarding a reduction in services in the region.  The HSE has indicated it is facing a challenging year and is exploring how best to deliver services within budget.  Senior managers in the north east met recently to discuss the budget for 2008 and how services could be delivered.  The document which was leaked to the media is a &ldquo;draft internal document arising from that meeting which sets out certain options for consideration&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised that it expects to be in a position by mid-February to be more definite about service provision for the year.  I acknowledge the valid points of Senators Wilson and O&rsquo;Reilly and I will deliver their message to the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for attending but I regret that the Minister, Deputy Harney, is not present.  I am happy to have an opportunity to discuss the urgent need for the Minister to provide the necessary and vital facilities required by young cystic fibrosis patients without delay.  Although I am happy to have the opportunity to raise this issue, I am very disappointed that I need to do so.  I am extremely disappointed over the way cystic fibrosis patients and their families have been treated and over the lack of urgent action over many years, bearing in mind that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have managed the Department of Health and Children for the <Col N="567"/>past ten years and given also the resources of the Celtic tiger.  The current lack of resources is very disappointing.</P>
        <P>It is hard to imagine another European country in which a cystic fibrosis sufferer would have to go on national radio to highlight the plight and complete lack of adequate health care to meet her medical requirements.  The bravery of the young cystic fibrosis patients in revealing the medical difficulties and obstacles posed by our health service is admirable yet heartbreaking.  Orla Tinsley, a young woman in her 20s, articulated, in a most effective manner, the daily challenges she faces as a patient.  These include unsafe and infection-ridden accident and emergency units, waiting rooms and general wards into which patients who are extremely susceptible to infection are expected to go.</P>
        <P>Ireland has one of the highest incidences of cystic fibrosis in the world, yet we tolerate such shoddy treatment.  We almost seem to accept that the age to which sufferers survive in Ireland is one of the lowest in the world.  One must ask why this group of patients has not received more attention and why there has not been a better response to its needs over the years.  Why has the Celtic tiger not delivered for it?  The life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients in the United States is in the 40s and in Britain it is in the 30s.  Northern Ireland, which has not had an equivalent economic boom to ours, has managed to push the average life expectancy up to 31, yet it remains at 21 in the Republic.</P>
        <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i>  and <i>Sunday Independent</i> journalist Gene Kerrigan described an article written by Orla Tinsley as the most extraordinary written during the course of the last general election campaign.  Her article asked for the Government to give her a chance to live.  Tonight I echo that call for Orla and all the cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country.  The age of 21 years need not be the average life expectancy of a cystic fibrosis patient.  The national airwaves should not and need not be the place where patients must plead for action and care.  What action does the Government intend to take?  There have been some reports of urgent action.  What action is being planned over the coming weeks and months to achieve a positive outcome in the very near future?  Failing to act immediately will cost lives and lead to premature death.  It does not have to be like that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who is unable to be present.  I am responding on her behalf.</P>
        <P>The Minister acknowledges the need to improve services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  Negative experiences recounted recently by a number of young patients are a matter of much <Col N="568"/>concern to us all.  The Minister identified the enhancement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis as a key priority in the Estimates process in recent years.</P>
        <P>In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of &euro;6.78 million was provided to the HSE.  It has advised that 44 additional staff, covering both adult and paediatric services, have been appointed across a number of hospitals, including St.  Vincent&rsquo;s, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Galway, Limerick and Waterford hospitals, and Cork University Hospital.  The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</P>
        <P>The HSE was asked to place particular focus on the development of services at the national adult tertiary referral centre at St.  Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.  These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus&rsquo; ward and a new accident and emergency department which includes single-room accommodation.  However, these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients.  The HSE has been working intensively with the hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements.  My Department is advised that the option of developing a modular unit is being examined in this context and the position will be clarified shortly.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently fast-tracking the redevelopment of a ward that is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area.  The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms.  On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms.  This will result in a total of 14 single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and it will include 120 replacement beds in single <i>en suite</i> accommodation, including accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients.  The Department is advised that planning permission has been obtained, financial provision has been included in the HSE capital plan and the contract is to be awarded by the end of 2008.  It will be a condition of the contract that the design-build period is to be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</P>
        <P>Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 budget, a special allocation of &euro;2.5 million capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide outpatient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
        <P>Specialist paediatric services for children with cystic fibrosis are provided at the national tertiary centre at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  Services <Col N="569"/>are also provided at other centres in Dublin, including<i> </i>Temple Street and Tallaght, and on a regional basis at centres including those at Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Drogheda.  The majority of paediatric cystic fibrosis care is delivered on an ambulatory care basis.  The developments I have outlined will significantly enhance the level of service provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 was seen as innovative legislation because it sought to ensure that new housing developments made provision for people who could not afford to purchase a home at current market prices.  Part V stipulated that 20% of all new housing developments must be ring-fenced for social and affordable housing.  It is, therefore, despicable that developers were subsequently allowed to offer money in lieu of providing 20% of new developments as social and affordable housing or to build Part V housing units away from the primary site.  I ask that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government contact all local authorities to discover how much money has been accepted from developers in lieu of Part V housing, how the authorities spent that money and how many developers have been allowed to develop social housing away from the primary site and, in many cases, not within reasonable distance of infrastructure and services.</P>
        <P>The philosophy of the Part V provisions was to ensure mixed housing development so that different social and economic groups would not be separated into different housing environments.  Having a home means access to a place that is private, safe, secure and affordable and has links to a community with a social infrastructure.  Councillors throughout the State tell me that a considerable percentage of their work involves housing issues and that thousands of people remain on housing lists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mary White for the opportunity to update the House on what is essentially a good news story, namely, the continued progress in implementing the ground-breaking housing supply mechanism introduced under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006.  Part V originated following a major review of planning legislation and is now a key measure in providing for housing for all.  Crucially, it makes the community&rsquo;s needs for social and affordable housing a material planning consideration.  Part V stipulates, among other provisions, that up to 20% of land zoned for residential developments or for a mix of residential and other uses is to be reserved <Col N="570"/>to meet social and affordable housing needs and made available to the local authority at its existing use value rather than its development value.</P>
        <P>However, Part V does not simply apply across the board to all residential planning permissions granted, as is sometimes perceived and often mischievously portrayed by the Opposition.  The incorrect assumption is frequently made that Part V should yield the equivalent of 20% of total housing output.  However, Part V does not apply to developments of four units or less.  Therefore, for example, the significant share of total housing output accounted for by once-off houses is not subject to Part V.  Nor does it apply to developments on sites of less than 0.1 hectares.  Moreover, housing provided through the main social and affordable programmes of local authorities and voluntary and co-operative housing associations is also not subject to Part V.  The voluntary sector was responsible for delivering some 1,600 units last year.  In addition, in the early years after Part V came fully into operation in 2002, much of the housing development taking place was on foot of pre-Part V planning permissions.</P>
        <P>I mention these factors to provide a proper context within which delivery under Part V can be considered.  The most recent figures available to my Department indicate that close to 6,000 affordable and social homes had been acquired by local authorities through Part V agreements up to September last year.  In excess of 5,400 further homes were in progress at that stage, with 2,700 more proposed on foot of completed agreements.</P>
        <P>In addition, developers have transferred almost 100 acres of land and close to 400 partially or fully serviced sites.  Furthermore, some &euro;78.6 million had been received in payments in lieu of land under Part V.  Although much spoken about, this particular aspect is estimated to account for only about 15% of the overall yield from Part V.  These moneys are ring-fenced for social and affordable housing purposes.  I have already taken steps in this year&rsquo;s housing allocations to ensure that any unutilised Part V funds are brought into play at an early stage.  I have asked all local authorities that have taken money in lieu to indicate their plans for spending that money in 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Future delivery under Part V is necessarily subject to several variables, including overall housing output and the phasing of Part V units within developments.  Taking account of all the factors involved, I estimate that some 10,000 homes under Part V will be delivered in the next three years.  I am satisfied that Part V is operating effectively, as evidenced by its significantly increased delivery of both social and affordable housing.  Annual output in 2006 was some 60% higher than in 2005.  This is <Col N="571"/>attributable, at least in part, to the significant efforts of my Department and the affordable homes partnership to provide guidance, training and other supports for those involved in implementing the Part V process.</P>
        <P>We had some concerns about the uniformity of delivery of Part V throughout the State but we <Col N="572"/>have introduced a toolkit for all local authorities so that there is a uniform approach in determining Part V requirements.  While I have no plans to amend the legislation, I will continue to monitor closely the workings of Part V to ensure it continues to realise its potential.</P>
