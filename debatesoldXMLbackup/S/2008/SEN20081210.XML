      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Eurojust, which is back from the committee; No. 2, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 &mdash; Report Stage; No. 3, Statements on the recall of Irish pork and bacon products; and No. 4, a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Criminal Law (Admissibility of Evidence) Bill 2008.</P><Col N="932"/>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader reconsider not having an Order of Business on Fridays in this House?  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised this issue yesterday, I would ask the Leader to reconsider it.  The precedent in the House has been that when there is business there would be an Order of Business and I would like to see us reverting to that.</P>
        <P>It is clear from the debate on and the international reaction to what has happened in our food industry in recent days that enormous damage is being done internationally.  I am sure many Senators will be aware that international newspapers such as <i>Le Monde</i> and <i>Le Soir</i>, and Sky News, have been leading with stories about the damage to our industry.  It is clear that once the serious issues on traceability and inspection which I raised yesterday have been dealt with satisfactorily here and the package has been put in place, a major initiative will be needed internationally to restore confidence in Irish food.  I would point out that Bord Bia, which would traditionally have been very involved in such a campaign, had its budget slashed by 8% in the budget.  There must be clear and decisive leadership in terms of this campaign internationally if the damage done already is not to be compounded.  Perhaps that is matter to which we can return at a later date in this House.</P>
        <P>Today marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We have called for some time for a debate in the House on the broad range of equality issues.  Yesterday there was one manifestation of those equality issues when we had a photograph taken in the House of all of the women Members and former Members who were available.  That is the first time ever that close to 50% of those sitting in the Chamber were women and that is a goal for which we should strive.  Equally, I commend <i>The Irish Times</i> on the booklet it produced, and gave away yesterday with the newspaper, to mark the anniversary.</P>
        <P>I note in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that former Senator and former President, Mary Robinson, has an interesting article on climate change.  She writes about its impact on rights and the poorest people, and calls for the issue to be put at the top of our agenda.  We ought to be debating climate change in this House and I ask the Leader to facilitate such a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of taking motions without debate has regularly arisen in this House.  For the benefit of Members, I will explain the long-standing protocol.  There is agreement that a proposal to refer a matter to committee will always be taken without debate on the basis that Members of the House can sit in any joint committee where the issue may be discussed.  According to convention, when the matter comes back from committee, a Member is entitled to raise it here if he or she genuinely feels it was not adequately addressed, although the arguments made in committee should not be simply rehearsed.  However, motions such as the one before the House today, which is neither coming from nor going to committee, should be discussed among the leaders&rsquo; group on Tuesdays to determine whether Members desire a debate.  Senator Regan raised this issue a few times and I agree with his arguments.  It is bad to get into the habit of taking motions without determining whether somebody wishes to discuss them.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>It does not give me pleasure to be disruptive to this House.  At the end of the day, these matters fall on the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s lap.  I believe we have been treated with disdain and contempt in regard to the Order of Business, although I do not know if that was the Leader&rsquo;s intention.  We have held long debates on the importance of the Order of Business.  It is the most energised, well attended and relevant part of the day&rsquo;s business for both sides of the House.  It is, therefore, unacceptable that it should be lost or threatened in any way.</P>
        <P>When we made this point last week, the Cathaoirleach adjourned the House so that a group of us could find a solution.  In deference to the Leader, who said that he made arrangements which he could not change, we conceded to the arrangements for last Friday on the basis that the matter would be reviewed before this week&rsquo;s sitting on Friday.  We acted in good faith, despite having difficulties with the proposal.  However, before we had the opportunity to discuss the matter &mdash; it was agreed we would discuss it on Tuesday &mdash; the schedule issued for this week which did not include an Order of Business on Friday.  I cannot do business on that basis.  Irrespective of whether the Leader intended that outcome, I find it contemptuous.  Advantage was taken of the good nature with which we approached the matter.  We have always endeavoured to be co-operative, but the proper way to do business involves consulting and discussing before making decisions.</P>
        <P>If I shake hands on an agreement, it is written in blood, and I am prepared to live with the downside as well as the upside of my decision.  What is happening here is undemocratic.  The Cathaoirleach called at least three meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss an extension of the Order of Business from 40 minutes to 45 or 50 minutes.  How does that sit with the Leader who dismisses the entire Order of Business without discussion?  It is not logical and I am not sure whether the Leader has thought his way through the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise that occasions arise when the Leader comes under pressure from the Government to bring legislation through the House.  We have never been found wanting in co-operating with him in that regard.  However, the fine traditions of this grand institution are being threatened.  The Order of Business is a precious jewel and I ask the Leader to reconsider his position.  I am not asking for people to back down but I cannot accept the proposals for the next two Fridays.  It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to act in ways that Members opposite would view as disruptive.  I prefer to fight my battles straight.  If this disagreement continues, the Cathaoirleach will eventually put Members out of the Chamber and it will become a mess.  We should deal with the matter now and come to a conclusion on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that education is not on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  I will not make a long speech as to why we need to debate the issue, but I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the impact of the education cuts be discussed by this House.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct.  The Order of Business in this House is an excellent system that allows Members on all sides to raise issues of national and local significance.  The issue of the marine radio stations in Malin and Valencia, for example, was raised by all Members on the Order of Business.  The welcome decision by the Government to do a U-turn on that issue was due in no small part to the fact that it was debated at length in this House.  We should be very careful, therefore, about preserving the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Unemployment figures are alarming and are deteriorating on a weekly basis.  Unfortunately, they will further deteriorate in the new year, not least because of the downturn in the construc<Col N="934"/>tion industry.  During the good times, when huge amounts of money were available to people who were willing to work in construction, young people decided to work on building sites rather than enter third level education.  Unfortunately, these people, who were lured by well paid employment, now find themselves in dole queues.  It is time that we discussed reorganising the schemes that are available to people in those circumstances.  The back-to-education allowance, for example, is one such scheme that needs to be changed to reflect the current economic crisis.  In light of the downturn in the construction industry, it is unacceptable that any scheme would operate on the same basis as it did during the Celtic tiger.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the role of the job creation agencies, particularly IDA Ireland, which is not promoting employment outside the large urban centres.  Recently it pulled jobs out of one town in Cork and put them into another.  Given IDA Ireland&rsquo;s remit of encouraging job creation, particularly in rural areas, it is a disgrace that an agency that should be executing Government policy is moving jobs from one town to another.  That is completely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Defence to attend the House to outline his plans for the refloating of the <i>Asgard II</i>.  That vessel sank to the bottom of the Bay of Biscay three months ago and the Minister has not yet made a decision on refloating it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>He has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>As the insurance policy on the vessel is worth &euro;3.8 million and it would cost &euro;2 million to refloat it, an economic case cannot be made to ignore the issue.  The national sail training programme has been called into question because the<i> Asgard II</i> was the main training vessel.  Are we to take it that the programme has been abandoned?  Is the sinking of the vessel being used as an excuse to abandon that programme, which has trained thousands of young people to sail?  It is disgraceful that the Minister has not made a decision on the issue.</P>
        <P>Every year, the commercialisation of Christmas gets worse.  Blatant Christmas advertisements were broadcast on television in October this year.  That over-commercialisation completely misses the point of Christmas.  In this context, the decision to ban the Veritas advertisement was bizarre.  The Broadcasting Complaints Commission needs to reconsider its role if it continues to ban such advertisements while allowing Christmas advertising to begin in October.  I respectfully suggest that it should ban Libertas rather than Veritas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call two Members who did not get the opportunity to contribute on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business due to time constraints.  The first Member is Senator Coffey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer very briefly to the pork crisis.  I thank the Leader for making time available today for statements on this matter.  The agrifood sector has significant potential to exploit international markets but it is badly damaged.  We must ask ourselves why this crisis happened and how we responded to it.  I hope that will be addressed in today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>We do not have a State laboratory with the capacity to test for dioxins.  A similar problem arose on foot of the cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway, when samples had to be sent to the UK for testing.  The HSE is exporting cervical smear samples to America for testing.  How can we, as a country, justify this and is it any wonder we bemoan the fact we have very few science graduates at this time?  What kind of message is the Government sending out to young people, as it is clear science is not a priority?  Recent cuts in education which will affect science subjects in schools also make it clear that we will have lesser science subjects in future, with correspondingly weaker graduates.  It is clear that science is a low priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>What incentive would exist for youngsters to do science in schools and colleges if the private sector was not there?  I ask the Leader to take the lead on the issue.  I call for a debate on <Col N="935"/>science and science education in this country as a matter that must be addressed.  It is no good paying lip service to the matter; we must debate it to discover the underlying problems.  It is a very low priority for Government currently on the signals it is sending out.</P>
        <P>I put on record my abhorrence of the recent murder of that unfortunate man, Aidan O&rsquo;Kane.  I am a parent to two children and I am very saddened that my generation has passed on this type of society and legacy to our children.  People in here would agree that our parents did not pass on this uncaring and valueless society to us.  We have a responsibility as a society, as parents and people in this regard.  We must all ask ourselves if we want to pass this legacy to our children.</P>
        <P>Where does responsibility lie and where is the Government&rsquo;s role in this?  I do not need to remind the Leader that when Fianna F&aacute;il was in Opposition, it continuously went on about zero tolerance.  We all remember it.  The Government has been in power for more than 11 years and what do we have?  There is murder of ordinary citizens on our streets and they are unprotected in their homes, by all accounts.  There is increased use of hard drugs on our streets and greater rates of gun crime.  There is no respect for the Garda and criminals are running our communities.</P>
        <P>We must wake up and the Government needs to ask itself when it will act.  Now is the time for action and I call on the Leader to organise a debate on justice and criminality, which is urgently needed.  Society is calling for it and we depend on politicians and Government to show leadership on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I also refer to the murder in East Wall.  It is my understanding that a further two people have been arrested in connection with it.  East Wall is in my constituency and is a part of Dublin I know very well.  I stood on the exact spot where the tragedy took place last Tuesday and know very well how people are feeling about what is taking place at the moment and the sheer despair running through the community.</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to put on the record three truths that must be addressed regarding what is happening in the country.  The first is that in many inner city communities the people have no faith in the ability of the Garda to protect them from serious crime.  That is a real indictment of where we stand as a society.  Yesterday afternoon, two families contacted me to say their homes or property were shot at as well.  These people have no involvement in any kind of criminal activity.  The only thing they have done is to have a home in a certain area.</P>
        <P>The second truth we must face is the fact that there is a serious parenting crisis in our country.  There is a very small number of families that have completely abdicated any responsibility for where their children or teenagers are at night or during the day and what they are up to.  We can put garda&iacute; on every corner and lane in the city but unless we tackle that issue, we will not deliver the type of society we seek.</P>
        <P>The final and most disturbing truth is that we now find ourselves in the position where some minors &mdash; children &mdash; are able to get their hands on guns.  The horror of this must sink in.  We read about this happening in some countries far away, get scared and think it is terrible but it is happening in our own city.  Our response to this must be comprehensive and serious.  I was sickened to see the Taoiseach point to the tragedy and state that it shows the Government is taking the right action on handguns.  It is an important step but it points to how much more needs to be done.</P>
        <P>I join with Senator Coffey in calling for a debate on this.  I repeat a call from this side of the House that was made a number of months ago that we have a debate on all the different Departments which must make a contribution in dealing with this issue.  These are the Departments of Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="936"/>Reform.  Unless each of them plays a part in dealing with this, we will not deliver the kind of society we want to pass to the next generation.</P>
        <P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business but I differ mildly from the comments of my colleague, Senator McCarthy.  We do not need to ban Libertas but must encourage its members to get out into the open for a serious debate on the kind of Europe they want.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the appropriate response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We all appeal to the concerned parties in the pork issue to finalise an arrangement and begin production again.  Farmers will be protesting today because of the delays as they are very frustrated.  They are also party to the negotiations.  We should lead by example and have pork products on the menu straight away.  Some 90% of the production process is perfect and pork, beef, sausages and rashers should be on the menus in the self-service and main restaurants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have a debate on that matter later today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We can lead by example.  I have no fear whatever about the quality of the Irish product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is missing his breakfast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We should show exactly what we can do as a form of leadership in this regard.  It would be very practical.  People are very sad about the damage being done to the economy.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate on the following matter.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 60 years ago today, on 10 December 1948, in Paris.  We should recognise this milestone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The membership of the commission in charge of the declaration was broadly representative of the global community and included Eleanor Roosevelt as chairperson.  It was a great honour for the wife of an American President to be chairperson of the organisation.  We were not members of the UN at the time but adopted the charter and we have ratified the six core UN human rights treaties, as well as a wide range of other international human rights instruments.</P>
        <P>The broad principles of the declaration are almost universally accepted, and although it is a fundamental document of the United Nations and forms part of customary international law, a human rights declaration can be truly effective only if it can be enforced by an international court.  For this reason, on International Human Rights Day, I draw the attention of the House to the matter and ask the Leader to discuss last year&rsquo;s report of the human rights committee of the Council of Europe, of which I am a member.</P>
        <P>The report called for the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights and was overwhelmingly endorsed by the parliamentary assembly.  The Lisbon treaty would allow and require the EU institutions to sign up to the convention, which would mean the institutions of the EU, as well as member states, would be subject to the jurisdiction <Col N="937"/>of the European Court of Human Rights, the only international court which directly enforces a human rights document.</P>
        <P>I call on the Leader to give this very early consideration as it is an important issue.  It is only by taking further steps like this to consolidate the international community&rsquo;s commitment to human rights conventions and declarations that the principles set out in the universal declaration will be universally enforced.</P>
        <P>Today is very special and we in this country have a great record on human rights.  We cannot always be proud of some actions taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am very glad Senator Leyden raised this matter as I intended to raise it myself.  I strongly support his suggestion that Pamela Izevbekhai should be allowed to remain in this country.

I did not get it through the European Union either but through the European Court of Human Rights.  At the end of the 19th century, the great French novelist &Eacute;mile Zola rebuked a government by saying &ldquo;J&rsquo;accuse&rdquo;, I accuse.  I accuse this Government of having the worst record on human rights of any Government I remember.  </P>

	<P>Yesterday, we discussed the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, but it included a sneaky little provision, which was provided to the House in an unreadable manner, smuggling in the destruction of the Combat Poverty Agency.  How is that for human rights?  The Human Rights Commission has effectively been neutered in defiance of the Good Friday Agreement.  In addition, the Government has refused to include human rights under the Charities Bill.  I have a briefing from Amnesty International, FLAC, ICCL and Frontline, which states &ldquo;It is clear from the Seanad debate on 4th December that there are no legal constraints raised by the Attorney General on the inclusion of the advancement of human rights.&rdquo;  Why are they not doing so?  It is perfectly clear that there is an anti-human rights agenda in this Government.</P>
        <P>The document that came from Amnesty International to celebrate International Human Rights Day states that under the 1945 charter, Ireland is obliged to incorporate the rights set out in the treaty to be ratified.  However, Ireland has failed in particular to incorporate rights that impact on people living in poverty.</P>

	<P>In that context, when will the immigration and asylum Bill come before this House?  That is a disgrace.  How dare the Government produce this and continue with a chairman who is so discredited.  I have never known this to be done before.  It is a blatant violation of human rights.</P>
        <P>Today&rsquo;s newspapers report on another shameful asylum case where somebody is to be sent back to the Congo.  I know a bit about the Congo; I was born there and I have followed the events in that tragic country.  Here is a man who is clearly going to be butchered the minute he gets off the plane.  The case went to the Refugee Council and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal &mdash; rats they are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The format of the Order of Business has been raised and I have pushed this matter continually.  It is obviously not a matter of time because we routinely meet <Col N="939"/>ten minutes late.  In his generous and decent way, the Cathaoirleach takes people who were not heard the last time.  Why do we have to take them out of sequence, however?  Why not take the whole lot?  It means issues that were more relevant yesterday are still brought up today.  Everybody should be taken.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The time should be extended then.  With regard to the question of gun crime, which was raised yesterday and today, yesterday&rsquo;s meeting in the D&aacute;il Chamber of former women Members of the Oireachtas provided a wonderful example of a gun-toting lassie, Countess Markievicz, a toff like Se&aacute;n MacBride, who rather enjoyed shooting the Irish peasantry. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What kind of example was that when one is talking about gun crime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can relate to the woman Senator Norris referred to a minute ago.  Yesterday was the 90th anniversary of the 1918 election that produced the First D&aacute;il.  In that context, we should evaluate the current Oireachtas Commission&rsquo;s outreach programme to see if it will target the participation of women in politics.  Yesterday&rsquo;s events proved how long it has taken to raise the percentage of women participating in politics &mdash; the number of women who participated in parliament only half filled the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I hope that in the coming decade that percentage will improve.  It is a hardy annual and the chestnut that is raised after every election.  Local elections will be held in June 2009 and we should consider the matter from a cross-sectoral viewpoint as well as the political and educational perspectives.  In addition, we must consider the work of the Oireachtas Commission to see if there is a mechanism to tease out the problems and increase the percentage of women participating in politics.  </P>
        <P>On a different but related note, this is the final day of the international campaign to recognise the issue of domestic violence.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss the matter.  Since 1996, 146 women have been murdered in the Republic of Ireland.  Some 92 of them were killed in their own homes, and 107 of the murders were resolved.  Some 50% of the victims were murdered by a partner or ex-partner, while 40 were killed by someone they knew &mdash; in other words, a relation or acquaintance.  This week we discussed the serious issue that arose in East Wall, but domestic violence is going on all the time.  It merits a particular focus and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be invited to address the House as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Donohoe that we need a broad sectoral approach to parenting and children.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should examine the implementation of the Children Act which places responsibility on parents for the negative actions of their children.  I wonder how many people have been through that system to date because the legislation has been in place for some time?  I do not believe it is being pursued, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made her point and a number of other Senators are waiting. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>While it might sound like a negative approach, if parents got the support of the courts system with parenting skills, it would have an overall positive effect of supporting them and helping them to improve their parenting.  </P><Col N="940"/>
        <P>Later we will discuss the recall of Irish pork and bacon products, but we should push the all-Ireland dimension of the resolution as a confidence-building measure.  It is a cross-Border issue, as we in the north west are aware, but I know the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who is from a Border area, will support that initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and seconded by Senator Donohoe.  We recognise the importance of education. Some 70,000 people gave voice to their concerns about this matter in Dublin recently and we cannot continue to ignore it.  I do not think it is the Leader&rsquo;s intention to ignore it, but I strongly support what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said.  I also strongly support the points made by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Norris and others on the proposed absence of an Order of Business on Friday.   It beggars belief that an Order Paper is produced without an Order of Business.  As well as being inconsistent, it is demeaning to this House.  I would not like to think that is the Leader&rsquo;s intention, however, because he has been a loyal servant of the House for many years.  Let us get this right.  Nobody wants to be disruptive; we want to be constructive in all the matters we are dealing with.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the comments of Senators Coffey and Donohoe on crime and I support their call for a debate on that issue.  I also welcome the debate we will have today on the recall of Irish pork and bacon products.  It concerns the absence of inspections of the premises at the source of this crisis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the equality issue.  Today is International Human Rights Day and I will focus on the lack of human rights for older people.  Over 10% of our population are over 65 and that figure is set to double in the next 30 years.  There are approximately 500,000 people aged over 65 in Ireland.  In my document entitled A New Approach to Aging and Ageism I spelt out how a person under 65 is seen as an asset to the country, while someone over 65 is seen as a liability.   A woman aged over 65 years cannot avail of free BreastCheck screening and a woman aged over 60 years has no free cervical cancer screening.  A person aged 65 years or over cannot have a ten-year driving licence.  Instead, he or she can have a three-year driving licence or, if this cannot be granted for medical reasons, a one-year licence.  Worldwide travel insurance for the elderly is &euro;100 more expensive than it is for someone aged under 65 years.</P>
        <P>When the Government was being formed in June 2007, I worked with it to ensure it delivered the abolition of mandatory retirement at 65 years of age.  It should follow through on this initiative.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is doing it again in relation to criminal law in the EU sphere.  On today&rsquo;s Order of Business is a motion re Eurojust, back from committee, to be taken without debate.  Much has been said about how ill informed the population is regarding EU matters, but the Leader seems determined to ensure the House is also ill informed, especially in terms of important legislation into which Senators should have an insight.  If the Taoiseach announces a second Lisbon treaty referendum, Senators must sell the message.  The Leader has a responsibility in this regard.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate that losing a vote last week has been of considerable embarrassment to the Government side, those benches should get over it and allow Friday&rsquo;s Order of Business as normal.  I hope that the Leader takes this suggestion on board.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to address an issue when we debate the pigmeat and beef industries?  We seem to be going from one extreme to another.  The Government seems to have conveyed messages&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have all of this in today&rsquo;s debate.  To be fair to the Leader, he arranged it on short notice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a question for him.  It has been reported that the beef samples were two to three times above the legal limit.  It is difficult to explain the situation to German and French supermarkets.  According to telephone conversations I held this morning, exporters have been asked to collect their beef despite that the Irish Government has not recalled beef.  The suggestion is that we are two or three times above the legal limit.  It is like someone suggesting that driving while two or three times above the legal alcohol limit is fine.</P>
        <P>Since 1 September, 3,000 cattle have been slaughtered.  Given our traceability system in respect of beef, it would not be comparable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have an ideal opportunity to discuss this matter with the relevant Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supply of cattle in question is limited and may already have been consumed.  If the Government had indicated that this specific quantity of beef should have been recalled pending further tests, a line could have been drawn under the matter.</P>
        <P>I referred last week to the 6,500 Irish people who have pensions with Equitable Life.  According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, more than 1 million policyholders in the UK who lost money in the Equitable Life debacle are due to learn the UK Government&rsquo;s response next week to a report that described a decade of regulatory failings.  I asked the Leader to inquire of the responsible Minister whether any representations had been made to the UK Government to ensure that, if the compensation fund called for by the European Parliament and the UK&rsquo;s parliamentary ombudsman comes into effect, Irish policyholders would benefit equally.  This is a relevant question, given the imminent decision by the UK Government.</P>

	<P>The House has played a central role in the issue of human rights and our voices have been heard many times.  Given our history, it is important that we dwell more on the spirit of the law and less on its letter.  We should avail of every opportunity to show mercy and charity when we witness a particular plight or know of people who feel vulnerable.  Most human rights issues, apart from the considerable debate on the Charities Bill, were raised on the Order of Business, which is an important part of the working of the Seanad.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is afraid to be held accountable in the House.  I will give an example and ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on two matters.  The Minister for Education and Science has not attended the House since 14 October to discuss the education cutbacks.  He is ashamed of what he has done.  This is the first debate required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader.  It is not a debate on the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Statements have been made in the House concerning F&Aacute;S, unemployment and consumer affairs, but the senior line Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for <Col N="943"/>Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has not attended.  Why is that?  Why have the two Ministers in the eye of the political storm over education and unemployment not attended the House since the budget?  This fundamental question must be answered.</P>
        <P>An Order of Business is necessary on Friday because we must hear the Government&rsquo;s views and express our own on the important issues of the day.  It is what makes the House relevant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">The event provided a glorious opportunity for women to reflect on how far they have progressed in the past 90 years.  Lessons should be learned from occurred yesterday.</P>
        <P>I will not repeat the matters to which other Senators referred.  However, there is one issue which disappeared from the agenda for two or three days as a result of the food crisis, namely, the horrific murder that occurred in the East Wall area.  When confronted by groups of children of 12, 13 and 14 years of age gathering together in the absence of parental control, one must ask where we and society are going wrong.  Who has responsibility in this regard?  Is it the Garda, parents, teachers, Deputies and Senators or people in general?  There is a need for a debate on this matter.  Such a debate should focus on parents and their role and responsibilities.  Members can shout from the rooftops about this issue all day but it will do no good, particularly if by 6 p.m. young boys and girls are running around the streets under no one&rsquo;s control.</P>
        <P>There is a need for a major debate on society.  The economy is in a downturn and people will be obliged to change their lifestyles, the way they work and even their jobs.  It will also be necessary to change society.  We must start from scratch.  Let us engage in a debate that will encompass everything &mdash; human rights, whether particular agencies should be rationalised, etc.  A full day&rsquo;s business should be devoted to a debate on this issue.  I compliment Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on referring to what occurred on the Order of Business in the House yesterday when there were major issues to discuss.</P>

I had no idea that egg throwing would be a factor in the death of a father of one in the East Wall area in recent days.  I accept Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s point to the effect that there is a need for people to take personal responsibility.  We cannot solve problems of this nature by introducing new legislation; we must instead impress upon people the importance of personal responsibility.  I understand the response of the community in East Wall to Garda inquiries has been positive and helpful.  I hope such co-operation will help us to solve problems of this nature and that we will not be obliged to introduce new laws to assist in this regard.</P>

	<P>As previous speakers noted, today marks the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It is fitting that we should acknowledge its success.  It <Col N="944"/>was drawn up in 1948 and has proved to be the inspiration for rights movements across the globe.  There is no doubt that human rights-based approaches make rights real for people.  Will the Leader arrange, whenever possible, for an audit to take place with regard to Ireland&rsquo;s success in the area of human rights and the issues that need to be addressed?  I record my appreciation for and solidarity with groups such as Amnesty International and Front Line, the organisation for the protection of human rights defenders.  I congratulate those in the media, particularly Se&aacute;n Love, Roddy Doyle and Gerry Smith, whose work appeared in the excellent publication that accompanied yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support Senator Mary White's comments on the issue of ageism.  I have made a number of public pronouncements on the matter over an extended period.  If we engage in a debate on the matter, we might consider issues such as the dignity of older people and the various rights to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s comments on the <i>Asgard</i>.  I support his views on the importance of the vessel in training people to sail.  Like many thousands of individuals, two of my children trained on the <i>Asgard</i> and had a wonderful experience.  I understand it is the desire and intention of the Minister for Defence to raise the <i>Asgard</i>.  However, it will be necessary to await the arrival of suitable weather in the Bay of Biscay before an appropriate survey can be carried out to ensure the vessel can be raised in a safe manner and that value can be obtained for the taxpayer&rsquo;s money in this regard.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to contribute.  On Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s comments on Friday sittings, it must be noted that we are living in exceptional times and that the Seanad will have met on four occasions on Fridays by the time this session ends.  Friday sittings are no longer exceptional.  As a result, some form of Order of Business should be held.  I suggest a compromise.  I accept that the Leader is under pressure but we could limit the Order of Business to 30 minutes and also commence our proceedings at 10.15 a.m.  I ask the Leader to give consideration to this arrangement because it would probably be of assistance in accommodating everyone&rsquo;s needs.</P>
        <P>The document circulated to Deputies and Senators today by Amnesty International to mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains ten action points, one of which states: &ldquo;Interestingly, the Government tends to be more enthusiastic about incorporating human rights treaties where the beneficiaries are mainly outside the State rather than those benefiting people living in Ireland&rdquo;.  Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to include in the Charities Bill a clause specifically relating to the promotion of human rights.  The Labour Party will be pushing an amendment to this effect and will be asking for support from Members on all sides.</P>

As stated last week, having an Order of Business on a Friday is not the norm, it is actually a complete exception.  We were obliged to arrange three Friday sittings in order to accommodate the taking of statements on the economy, the Health Bill and the Finance Bill.  We will be obliged to wait until the D&aacute;il has disposed of the Finance Bill in its entirety before we can deal with it on Friday, 19 December.

Due to the fact that the model used in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was so successful, I thought that, on a trial basis, we would adopt it and commence business at 10.30 a.m. on Fridays with the relevant Minister in place from the outset.  Last Friday&rsquo;s sitting was extremely successful.  It was fabulous to be present as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to witness how the affairs of the House were conducted.</P>
        <P>I fully respect and support the entitlement of Members to bring matters to the attention of the House on the Order of Business.  I suggest the current arrangements for Friday sittings remain in place and that the leaders of the various groups come together in the near future to review the position and discover how we might progress.  Nothing is set in stone.  I have an open mind on the matter.</P>

	<P>It is fine for Members who live in Dublin to be here on Fridays.  However, it is difficult for Senators who arrive in the city on Monday, leave the House at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday and, having travelled long distances, only arrive home at 1 a.m. on Saturday.  I ask Members who live in close proximity to the House to bear in mind the difficulties which Members, who are representative of the country as a whole, must take into account.  I am doing this purely and solely on humanitarian grounds in respect of Members who live far away from the House.</P>

	<P>I thank the leaders of the groups for their co-operation and support which they give me in carrying out, in an orderly way, the manner in which we conduct our affairs in this Upper House of Parliament.</P>
        <P>On the debate in regard to the recall of Irish pork and bacon products, I look forward to the presence in the House this afternoon of the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  I thank the <Col N="946"/>Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith and Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace for their hard work on behalf of the people of Ireland.</P>

	<P>There is no reason this cannot be done.  On my way to the House this morning I heard on radio the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, confirm sponsorship of the Irish Open for the next three years, which is good news.  I am an ardent golfer and proud of it.  This is a great opportunity for us given Sky television will broadcast this event for 28 hours to all countries in Europe where Irish produce is being sold on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>Last year, I complimented, in the House, Bord Bia for its promotion of Ireland during the Ryder Cup in the K Club.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a shining example of good marketing of Irish produce.  I agree with Senator Frances Fitzgerald that Bord Bia should receive an increased allocation from Government to market Irish produce, of which we are very proud.  The opportunity, as announced this morning by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in respect of the three year sponsorship of the Irish Open, is to be welcomed.  Members will be aware that Sky broadcasts to every country in Europe and this will provide us with an opportunity to repeat what was done during the Ryder Cup at the K Club.  What Bord Bia did, in terms of marketing, was a shining example to all of us.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Callely and Hannigan offered their congratulations in respect of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Members may also have heard on radio this morning the voice of the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt.  I join in the expression of congratulations in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It was enlightening to see many former Members.  I recall many famous ladies from all sides of the House who have passed on to their eternal rewards.  I congratulate and wish well all those who made this historic occasion possible.  It was a terrific day for former and current Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I look forward to many more occasions during which we can all celebrate our membership of both Houses of the Oireachtas, D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senators called for a debate on climate change.  I have already given a commitment in respect of such a debate.  Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan and Buttimer asked about comments on the Order of Business in respect of items returning from committee.  I wish to inform the House <Col N="947"/>that I have no difficulty leaving aside a short amount of time to allow a Senator to comment on a matter returning from committee.  The difficulty that arises is that I send out the Order of Business on a Thursday in respect of the following Tuesday and very often committees do not meet until Tuesday or Wednesday.  In my opinion, the most important issues that arise in this regard relate to EU scrutiny, which is a serious challenge for Members of the Oireachtas and for committees.  I propose, subject to agreement with the other leaders next Tuesday, that where an issue arises at a committee meeting on a Wednesday morning on which a Member of the Seanad wishes to make a point, if such Member contacts their leader or my office by early afternoon on Wednesday, I will allocate 30 minutes for that matter to be discussed the following morning, if that is in order.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by various Members in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the call for a debate on education, I contacted the Minister&rsquo;s office yesterday and am awaiting word on the matter.  I will report to the House tomorrow morning on whether it is possible to make time available next week for such a debate, bearing in mind the Minister&rsquo;s diary and this House&rsquo;s schedule for next week, which is an unbelievable sight in terms of the amount of work before us and the late sittings required to facilitate that.</P>

        <P>Senators Coffey, Donohoe, Keaveney, Ormonde and Quinn expressed strong views in regard to the murder of Aidan O&rsquo;Kane.  As stated earlier this morning, this is an issue for society and, in particular parents, and the Departments of Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We need to discuss this matter in the House with the Minister.  I will endeavour to provide time for such a debate.  As I stated, yesterday I passed on my condolences on behalf of the House in respect of this terrible tragedy, which we do not want to see happen again.  Whatever we can do, we should do.  The concern and experiences expressed by many Senators in the House this morning may be of assistance to the Minister in addressing this issue.</P><Col N="948"/>
        <P>Senators Leyden and Norris expressed their support for human rights.  Today is an important day for Pamela Izevbekhai and her family and we await the outcome of this case this evening.  Senator Norris called for a debate on emigration and asked when the emigration Bill will come before the House.  I will inform the House of the position in this regard tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Keaveney called for an evaluation of the work of women in the Oireachtas and the work of the Commission.  I have no difficulty in making time available for a debate on this matter.  She also called for a debate on domestic violence and requested that take place at the same time as the proposed debate on justice.  It would be timely to have such a debate.  I will endeavour to arrange for it to take place at the earliest time possible when we resume following the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White called for a debate on the role of senior citizens, those over 65 years of age, in our society.  As the Senator said, half a million people over the age of 65 years now live in our country.  She outlined serious concerns about the lack of the BreastCheck service for ladies over 60 years of age and about more minor matters such as the higher cost of worldwide travel insurance for older people and other issues.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Senator on her report and on getting <i>The Irish Times </i>life achievement award, which covers the Thirty-two Counties.  <i>The Irish Times</i> and Senator Mary White will highlight the fight against ageism and promote justice and the human rights of older Irish people.  She is to be commended on that.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I will speak generally on all five amendments because we have discussed them in some depth on Committee Stage.  The amendments seek to draw on the language contained in the Government&rsquo;s homeless strategy.  It seeks to put homeless action plans and homelessness at the centre of the Bill.  I do not think the inclusion of these amendments would cause any great problem <Col N="950"/>for the Minister of State.  They do not go beyond the spirit of The Way Home strategy published in August 2008.  I urge the Minister of State to consider the inclusion of the amendments.</P>

	<P>I will be brief.  I support the amendment for precisely the same reason as my two colleagues and also because this is a matter that was urged upon us by the various lobbying bodies.  It is not in conflict with the Minister&rsquo;s objectives.  In fact, it is putting a kind of headline for him to take specific action.  Everything he said in the earlier part of the debate looked towards the question of action and a real plan to implement the fine sentiments we have heard.  I believe the Minister of State is committed and that he will do it.  I can see no real problem about having this wording.  I support Senators Hannigan and Coffey in this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments all deal with the subject of homeless action plans and in so doing return to an issue that was raised by a number of Senators on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  It is an issue about which I, as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, am concerned also and that is why I published The Way Home in August 2008.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated to Senators previously, The Way Home was launched after the publication of the Bill and therefore certain aspects, including those with statutory implications, were not sufficiently advanced to be comprehended by the Bill.  I have indicated also that following on from the publication of the national implementation plan for the strategy, I propose to bring forward legislative provisions to place local homeless action plans on a statutory footing.  These plans will provide the focus for locally sensitive and relevant action and will inform housing services plans and the wider delivery of housing supports, including the development of appropriate local housing allocation policies.</P>
        <P>It is important to repeat that work on implementation has already begun.  A circular has issued to all local authorities providing further details regarding action plans and advising authorities to commence work on updating their existing plans.  The circular also advises authorities about their local homeless forum and the formation of the management group of the local homeless forum.</P>
        <P>In addition, we are working on bringing forward necessary legislative provisions, in conjunction with the more broadly based implementation plan.  It is envisaged in The Way Home that these plans, as well as containing an overall vision and objectives, would include output targets and timescales for achievement.  The associated actions to be included in these plans must take account of the local situation as the experience of homelessness varies throughout the country.</P>
      
        <P>I thank Senators for tabling amendments suggesting how the action plans might be put on a statutory footing.  However, in light of the ongoing work, including on appropriate legislation that I have outlined, I ask them to withdraw their amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  While I am disappointed with it, I look forward to debating the implementation of his homelessness strategy, The Way Home, in the House over the coming months.  I will not be pushing my amendments in this grouping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to introduce legislation to deal with local homelessness action plans, I cannot understand why we cannot <Col N="951"/>make provision for it in this Bill.  After all, it is a housing Bill.  We have debated this long and hard during the preceding Stages.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendment No. 16 is substantial.  All we are calling for is the establishment of a local homelessness forum within the administrative area associated with each homelessness action plan.  I cannot understand why the Minister of State will not consider accepting this amendment, even at this stage.  The Way Home has been published and adopted by the Government.  I am presenting a good opportunity to enshrine in legislation many of the commitments in that document.  If the amendment is accepted, it will go a long way towards progressing the local homelessness action plans about which the Minister of State speaks.  Not only will it save time, it will also furnish local authorities and housing authorities with clear criteria with which to work.  Drawing on The Way Home and this amendment would certainly tackle the needs of the homeless.</P>
        <P>When I was going home last night I came across three or four homeless people sleeping rough in the cold of the night.  They cannot wait and we should act now to try to help them.  There is an urgent need and we cannot turn a blind eye for much longer.  It is all very well to have plans but they must be implemented.  Many have been produced by the Government in respect of various sectors but they are gathering dust.  The Fine Gael proposal is not one that should be allowed to gather dust but one that should have legislative traction.  For that reason, I hope amendment No. 16 will be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, the implementation plan is being worked on as we speak and I hope to have it in place before Christmas.  It would be inappropriate to put the cart before the horse.  I stated on Second Stage and Committee Stage, and I reiterate on Report Stage, that I intend to bring forward the parts of the implementation plan that require legislative underpinning.  As stated, the House will have an opportunity to debate the implementation plan.  I am sure it will be subject to much debate in the House.  This is the simple reason I do not propose to accept the amendments.  I commend the Senators on paying attention to this matter and on their attempts to address it.  I have no doubt but that the wise words of Senators will be taken very much into consideration when I am putting in place the legislative framework for those sections of the implementation plan that require legislative backing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments in the names of a number of Senators on the issue of tenancy support services were tabled and discussed on Committee Stage.  The amendments sought to make provision for housing authorities to undertake to offer tenancy services in the sense of providing support to tenants to sustain and continue with their tenancies.  As promised on Committee Stage, I have examined this matter with Parliamentary Counsel.  However, in the time available it has not been possible to resolve the issue satisfactorily.  As Senators are aware, housing authorities already undertake activities such as tenant training in estate management, the production of tenant handbooks and the employment of tenant liaison officers.  Finance is available from my Department for these activities.</P>
        <P>It is important to define carefully what is meant by tenancy support services, however, if that activity is to be added to the listing in section 10 of housing services authorities may provide in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts.  As the amendment stands, the concept is too vague to include as a function related to the provision of housing services and clarity as to the nature, extent and scope of the proposed services would be required.  The proposed function in this regard would need to be developed further before it could be included in an amendment to the Bill.  I hope to do that during the passage of the Bill through the Lower House.  I cannot accept the amendment at this stage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Specifically in relation to community groups and residents&rsquo; associations, many of us will have dealings with the latter on a daily basis and know that when matters such as housing plans arise, they often have very good reasons for contributing to the proposals.  I believe this will enhance the role they play already and put it on a statutory footing.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment in the light of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments generally seek to expand the list of bodies and persons with which the housing authority formally consults on housing service plans.  I do not consider the combination of amendments adds to the provision.  I am satisfied the list in paragraph (<i>f</i>) is sufficiently broad to cover the groups referred to in the proposed amendments.  When work is completed on the homeless action plans, however, I envisage that homeless forums may need to be included in that listing.</P>
        <P>As for amendment No. 10, which seeks to expand paragraph (<i>d</i>), it is important to say that the paragraph provides that approved bodies must be consulted.  Such bodies must have as primary objectives the relief of housing needs, poverty or hardship.  It is also relevant in the context of the proposed amendment to say that they receive their approved status for the purpose of the provision of housing accommodation for homeless persons, among other purposes.  The use of the phrase, &ldquo;approved bodies engaged in the provision of accommodation or shelter&rdquo; in subsection (1)(<i>d</i>), I believe, is sufficient to cover the work engaged in by approved bodies.  The additional phraseology is not necessary in this instance.  I have concerns that by trying to draw out the provision, there is a danger of excluding a group that would have been covered by the more general terms.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes including recognised associations under section 128 of the Local Government Act 2001.  I am satisfied that section 16(1)(f), which specifies that the draft plan may be made available to local community bodies or any other person, as the housing authorities consider appropriate, is sufficient to cover any groups that are active locally that are relevant.  In these circumstances, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response.  At a time when we are trying to encourage involvement in local communities, including groups like residents&rsquo; associations, it would not have taken much effort nor would it have done any harm to include them specifically.  However, I will not push the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated to the House on the Committee Stage debate on section 16, dealing with the preparation and making of a housing services plan, that I would examine this amendment, which proposed to extend the timeframe from six week to eight <Col N="955"/>weeks within which the bodies or persons notified in accordance with section 16(1) must make their observations on the housing services plan.  I have carried out that examination and I am satisfied the timeframe suggested in the amendment can be accommodated.</P>
        <P>As the House will appreciate, no matter what timeframes are chosen, there will be always demands for an extension to those limits.  The current limits are demanding on all parties, but are reasonable.  However, there is no major issue of principle involved.  Therefore, on balance and in order to meet the concerns of Senators I propose this amendment.</P>
        <P>Given the extended timeframe now proposed for persons and bodies under section 16(3), I also propose to increase from three to four weeks the time limit for the submission of the manager&rsquo;s report under subsection (5), in the interest of balance between the various parties.  I ask the House to support these two amendments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment arises from the debate on Committee Stage when the Labour Party sought to include the words, &ldquo;economic, cultural, ethnic or other&rdquo;.  At the time, the Minister of State stated that in his view, the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; includes &ldquo;economic&rdquo;.  While I do not dispute this, I merely seek to set down in writing that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; includes &ldquo;economic, cultural, ethnic or other&rdquo;.  It is more or less in line with the comments of the Minister of State on Committee Stage and as a result, he should accept this minor amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is simply to make mandatory the obligation on a housing authority to carry out a social housing assessment under section 20(3).  I ask the Minister of State to accept that.

	<P>I second Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment.  It calls for precisely what the Minister intends, which is, action in the matter.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is not necessary.  Subsection (3) will allow housing authorities, where they consider it necessary, to assess households which have been receiving rent supplement for a specified period which have not applied for local authority housing.  These would generally be households which become known to the housing authority by virtue of them being potential clients of the rental accommodation scheme.  It is not necessary to compel housing authorities to assess these households.  They have not applied to the housing authority for social housing support and may not wish to do so in the future.  However, the authority has the power, if necessary, to assess such a household for social housing support at any time.  If a household, following on this subsection, requests that a social housing assessment be carried out, the housing authority is obliged to make an assessment under subsection (2).  I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment in those circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment. There was extensive debate on these three amendments on Committee Stage, as the Minister of Stage will recall.  I think he indicated at that point that he would go back to the Parliamentary Counsel about the interplay between section 20(5) to which these amendments are proposed and section 35(5), which I think is now section 34(5).</P>
        <P>The amendments propose to allow flexibility within section 20(5), which provides that a household shall not be eligible for social housing support where, under subparagraph (<i>b</i>), it was in arrears of rent for an accumulated period of 12 weeks or has otherwise breached a condition of the tenancy agreement.</P>
        <P>I expressed the view on Committee Stage that this was too absolutist in tone and that if one member of a household had breached even a minor condition of the tenancy agreement, the household would become automatically ineligible for social housing support.  I was concerned about the hardship this section might impose on households.  I suggested that there should be more flexibility built in.  The amendments proposed by Senator Hannigan and Senator Norris, and supported by me, would allow the flexibility to the housing authority where undue hardship would be caused.</P>
        <P>The wording of amendment No. 22 is taken from section 34(2), which currently does not seem to apply to section 20(5).  When I raised this with Senators Hannigan and Norris on Committee Stage, the Minister of State indicated he would go back to the Parliamentary Counsel about this issue.  What, if anything, has the Minister been advised by Parliament Counsel about whether either section 34 could be amended so that it clearly applies to section 20(5) or whether an amendment might be put to section 20(5) to give the housing authority some leeway in cases of undue hardship as a result of this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The arguments were made at the earlier Stage.  At that point Senator Bacik raised what I felt was a significant legal point.  Her memory is quite accurate.  The Minister of State said that he would consult the Parliamentary Counsel and take legal advice.  He has not yet had the opportunity to give the House the burden of that information.</P>
        <P>My amendment also seeks to facilitate.  It introduces a discretionary element so that people will not automatically be ineligible in all circumstances, some of which, that could be imagined, could be unduly harsh and discriminatory.</P>
        <P>It does not, on the other hand, remove the power from the local authority, either to evict or to charge arrears.  That survives.  All that is allowed is a discretionary power.  In fact, the language was specifically taken by the agencies that drafted these amendments for all of us from other sections of the Bill.  Therefore, the spirit and language of this amendment are already contained in the Bill.</P><Col N="959"/>
        <P>This is an important amendment.  The Minister of State said he would take a look at it but I see he has not tabled a similar amendment.  There does not seem to be a Government amendment addressing this issue, including the issue raised by my colleague about a possible conflict between two sections of the Bill.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned the question of Government amendments, these are usually indicated by an asterisk but an amendment in the name of my colleague, Senator Hannigan, amendment No. 13, was marked with an asterisk as well.  Does that mean that it is accepted by the Government or it is being taken over as a Government amendment even though it is in his name?  I seek a technical clarification on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I somewhat support the view expressed, in particular, on amendment No. 21.  My experience of dealing with my local housing authority, DCC, and the housing manager, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n McNamara, who seems to have what Senator Norris referred to as the flexibility to accommodate in certain instances, is that it has always been very accommodating.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State, particularly in light of amendment No. 21, what type of flexibility exists or would he review or reconsider the position that has now been put.</P>

	<P>The intention of section 20(5) is to underline the seriousness of actions such as the breach of tenancy agreement or non-payment of rent.  The consequence of these actions is that they are to be taken into consideration by a housing authority in determining the household&rsquo;s eligibility for further support.</P>
        <P>The subsection, as amended on Committee Stage, provides that a household that was previously the tenant or the owner of a local authority dwelling or site, and during a three-year period prior to the carrying out of the social housing assessment was either in arrears of rent for an accumulated period of 12 weeks or breached a condition of the tenancy agreement, will be deemed ineligible for social housing support.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge the sentiment of amendment No. 20, which seeks to qualify the provision where there are exceptional circumstances relating to inability to pay, I do not believe that such a proviso is necessary.  It is important to read section 20(5) in conjunction with section 31(6)(<i>f</i>) which allows for the waiving of rent in cases of financial hardship and section 34(2) which provides a hardship clause where moneys are due to a housing authority.  I am satisfied these safeguards provide an adequate safety net for tenants.</P><Col N="960"/>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 21, I indicated on Committee Stage that a more detailed consideration of the mandatory nature of this provision is warranted.  I propose to undertake this consideration in conjunction with the Parliamentary Counsel.  In the circumstances, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Amendment No. 22 makes new provisions in this section for moneys due to a housing authority.  I do not consider the amendment to be necessary.  Section 20 does not provide housing authorities with the power to charge rents, sell sites or dwellings or make tenancy agreements.  These powers are exercised by authorities under other Housing Acts and the provisions of section 31 of this Bill for the charging of rents.  Moneys owed to housing authorities and any other provisions in that context are addressed by sections 33 and 34 of the Bill.  I am satisfied that the proposed arrangements provide a sufficient level of relief for the circumstances envisaged by Senators Norris and Bacik and on that basis I ask them to withdraw their amendment.</P>

That is one of the reasons I am pressing amendment No. 22.  </P><Col N="961"/>
        <P>It is not clear to me that the waiving of rent will be operable for the tenant because questions of literacy may arise.

        <P FLI="0">This amendment has been debated on Committee Stage and I put it down again to emphasise the need to specify the different categories of household need rather than simply leaving them entirely up to the Minister.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Subsection (6) provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for the description and classification of household need.  It is intended that these regulations would include a revised classification system for housing needs centred on severity and persistence of need.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to base the revised classification system, in as much as is possible, on the model developed by FEANSTA, with which the Senator is familiar.  The proposed classification system has already been the subject of intensive consultation with social partners and housing <Col N="963"/>authorities from the perspective of both the general and special housing needs, and on the whole they have been in favour of the proposals.</P>
        <P>Providing the details for such a classification system in regulations will allow the necessary flexibility to adapt the model over time as circumstances and priorities change.  Flexibility is not as readily available in primary legislation.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, the list suggested by the Senator is drawn from the 1998 Act, which in light of changing housing needs has proved to be limited in providing an accurate picture of both the nature of need and the relative priorities.  People with multiple needs are not adequately captured by the current statutory definitions.</P>
        <P>The proposed revised classification based on the FEANSTA approach provides a more developed method of reflecting the urgency and persistence of different types of need.  It will provide the basis for the development through regulation of a better measure of need in the future.  Under those circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s concern to ensure that there are timely assessments of need.  However, this is adequately covered by section 20 which deals with individual assessments and section 21, which deals with the summary of assessments.  My intention is to have more regular reporting on summary of assessments of needs.  The whole intention of changing the current regime is to provide more timely assessments, both for the individual and in relation to the summaries which are required for planning purposes.  </P>
        <P>Subsection (7) empowers the Minister to make regulations to set out how an individual assessment of housing need would be carried out on a household including, under paragraph (<i>d</i>), the frequency of reviewing and updating assessments.

        <P FLI="0">While it has already been debated on Committee Stage, this important amendment seeks to ensure that needs assessments are carried out annually rather than on a tri-annual basis.  It is to ensure that such assessments are done on a more up-to-date basis.  As we know, conditions in the housing market change quickly and have done so in the past year or even in the past few months.  Therefore, annual assessments would be more appropriate than assessments done on the current tri-annual basis.  Perhaps the Minister can let us know if he has any view on whether they will continue to be tri-annual or whether more timely assessments will be made.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment for the reasons she stated.  I also emphasise the point that we are moving into pretty turbulent times.

	<P>I am satisfied that the current formulation in sections 20(7) and 21 would achieve the same aims as the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, by giving a framework for more timely assessment of need.  Subsection (7) empowers the Minister to make regulations regarding the frequency of reviewing and updating the assessment of housing needs of an individual household.  Where an individual seeks a housing assessment, the intention would be to undertake a preliminary examination immediately to determine if short-term or emergency housing supports are required and, if so, to respond accordingly.  A full housing assessment will be carried out once any immediate needs have been addressed and will seek to provide an accurate and objective account of the long-term housing needs of the individual household concerned.  Regulatory powers in subsection (7) are focused on the updating of this assessment to ensure that any changed circumstances of the household are taken into account.</P>
        <P>Section 21 deals with the summary of all these needs and replaces the current tri-annual assessment, which was provided for under the 1998 Act.  While the section provides that these summaries will be prepared for very specific purposes &mdash; i.e. housing service plans &mdash; they will also be undertaken at periods to be directed by the Minister.  My intention is to move to more <Col N="965"/>timely reports on the overall needs and the proposed provisions will facilitate this.  I therefore cannot accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for indicating that he will move towards a more timely system, so I will not push this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 27 arises from committee proceedings. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the maximum period in which an applicant for social housing or housing support shall stay in accommodation designated as emergency.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s new strategy on homelessness under which the current maximum period for which people should stay in emergency accommodation is stipulated as six months.  The amendment seeks to ensure that the maximum period will be one of the criteria by which assessments are made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second this important amendment.  On an earlier Stage, I made a point in support of Senator Bacik concerning those people who have been in hostel accommodation and so on for six months or longer and their families, who must go on to the streets.  The Minister of State indicated with a nod that he understood the problem.  On Second Stage, he also indicated his clear intention that people should not stay for more than six months.  In this light, setting a maximum period would be important.  Otherwise, people might stay in emergency accommodation for comparatively long and uncomfortable periods.</P>
        <P>We know from experience that emergencies can last a long time.  Emergency legislation dating from the last war is still on the Statute Book.  More than 60 years is a hell of a long time.  I would hate to believe that someone could experience an emergency that lasts as long as some of our emergency legislation.  In light of this legislation, the definition of an emergency does not include immediacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Before moving to the substance of the amendment, the intent of subsection (7) is to empower the Minister to make regulations to set out how an assessment of housing needs will be carried out for an individual household.  It deals with practical administrative matters, such as application forms, the timing of assessments etc.  In this light, an amendment of the type suggested is not appropriate.</P>
        <P>On the substantive issue, I have indicated that an important role within the new homeless strategy, The Way Home &mdash; A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, relates to the elimination of long-term occupancy of emergency homeless accommodation.  The strategy contains specific targets to ensure that no one will be in emergency accommodation for more than six months by 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the long term, this goal will be statutorily underpinned through the local homeless action plans.  It is intended that these plans will address a broad range of issues, including accommodation and community support services.  They will be developed through inter-agency co-operation and in partnership with the voluntary sector.  I have indicated that we are working on proposals to follow through on the strategy&rsquo;s commitment to place the plans on a statutory <Col N="966"/>footing, but it was not possible to complete the work on time for Report Stage of the Bill.  In light of the ongoing work, will the Senators withdraw their amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not press the amendment at this stage, but it is a shame that Report Stage was not delayed to allow the work to be completed.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 28 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) measures to prevent and reduce homelessness.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I have often stated, the Bill is a very good one and gives considerable structure to the housing allocation systems in housing authorities.  However, it is a pity that no clear provision for homelessness has been included and for that reason, the Bill is not complete.</P>
        <P>We have proposed the amendment to ensure homelessness is recognised in legislation.  As other Senators stated, Fine Gael has consulted many of the agencies, NGOs and organisations that are working at the coalface with the homeless on an hourly and daily basis and, like us, they are anxious that homelessness is properly recognised in legislation.</P>
        <P>The section refers to the allocation of dwellings and how allocation schemes are run.  It is only reasonable that the phrase &ldquo;measures to prevent and reduce homelessness&rdquo; is inserted.  Will the Minister of State consider accepting the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation scheme is a mechanism for housing authorities to fairly and transparently allocate dwellings to individual households.  Subsection (4) empowers the Minister to make regulations governing the matters that housing authorities must include in their allocation schemes, including the manner of allocation of different categories of dwelling and the order or priority of their allocation.  Including a policy objective of preventing or reducing homelessness within this framework would not be appropriate.</P>
        <P>It is a fundamental principle of the scheme that it responds to need.  Where a need such as homelessness has been identified, there is sufficient scope in subsection (5) for a housing authority to reserve a portion of dwellings in its area for the allocation to such households.  The broader strategy on the prevention and reduction of homelessness will be addressed through the proposed statute-based local homeless action plans, which I have just discussed.</P>
        <P>In light of the ongoing work, which will address the Senators&rsquo; concerns, and the interpretation of current provisions in subsection (20), will they withdraw the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Minister of State, the Bill provides housing authorities with discretion to make provision for the homeless through a percentage of their allocations.  On the other side of the coin, authorities will also have discretion to provide no allocation and for that reason we tabled the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) procedures for supporting tenants who fall into rent arrears designed to assist them in sustaining their tenancy.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to put in place measures to support tenants who have fallen into arrears in respect of rent, to assist them in getting out of those arrears and as such to sustain their tenancy.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 32 seeks to ensure, in respect of a termination of residency, that all procedures put in place to support tenants have been exhausted and that termination would be enforced only after all other avenues have been explored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 25 relates to tenancy agreements under the rental accommodation scheme.  It is not considered appropriate in this context to deal with non-payment of arrears as powers are provided elsewhere for housing authorities to deal sympathetically with tenants who fall into arrears.  Section 31(6)(<i>f</i>) allows for a housing authority to include in its rent scheme procedures, where appropriate, to waive rent in whole or in part on a temporary basis in cases of financial hardship.  A further provision included in section 25(11) relates to tenants under the rental accommodation scheme and allows the housing authority to reduce the rent contribution owing to a tenant&rsquo;s move into that scheme from a rent supplement position.  The amendments are not necessary and I ask Senators to withdraw them.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned earlier, I undertook on Committee Stage to consider the inclusion of some general provisions on tenancy support services and I remain minded to do so.  The description of the type of services involved in this area is potentially too vague for statutory interpretation.  As such, further work is required to develop a sufficiently robust provision for inclusion in the Bill.  I will continue to consult the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to bringing forth a suitable amendment on Committee Stage in the Lower House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  If the Government is favourably disposed to this proposal, it should accept the amendment of this House.  If, as has been clearly stated by the Minister of State in his response, the Government is favourably disposed to this proposal, the amendment should be accepted, in due courtesy, in this House rather than in the D&aacute;il.

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 33: </P>
        <P LI="2">In page 34, after line 49, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(5) Where exceptional circumstances arise such that arrangements under <i>section 34(2) </i>cannot be put in place without causing undue hardship, a housing authority may cancel the obligation of a household to pay part or all of the moneys referred to in that section.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the amount of money owed by tenants to a local authority.  It will give a housing authority the ability to waive any moneys owed by tenants if it considers it would result in the avoidance of hardship for the tenants of the house.  I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I also support it.  The amendment reads: &ldquo;Where exceptional circumstances arise such that arrangements under <i>section 34(2)</i> cannot be put in place without causing undue hardship, a housing authority may cancel the obligation of a household to pay part or all of the moneys referred to in that section&rdquo;.  This amendment gives a housing authority the power to waive moneys owed by tenants if the payment of such moneys would cause undue hardship.  If moneys are owed by tenants in the first instance, they must have accrued as a result of financial hardship.  I do not believe anybody is playing a game here in regard to that.  </P>
        <P>As the Acting Chairman will know from our division of Cork County Council, we have dealt with cases involving people who have fallen into difficulty weekend after weekend.  Given the downturn in the economic fortunes of this country and the fact that many more people are unemployed compared to this time 12 months ago, acceptance of this amendment is important to ensure we put on a statutory footing the obligation on a council to waive such moneys that have accrued given that the payment of them would cause tenants financial hardship.</P>
        <P>Another point also arises in this respect.  The executive functions of managers are far superior to the reserve functions of members of local authorities.  That is an issue I have continuously raised here in the context of powerful local councillors.  If there is discretion at executive level, we have no guarantee that such discretion would be used in favour of somebody who, in any reasonable thinking person&rsquo;s mind, should have any moneys in arrears waived because the payment of them would cause the person financial hardship.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  It is made in good faith.  If we have learned anything since 14 October, it is that times are tough in this country and they are most difficult on families, particularly those on low incomes.</P>

	<P>I listened with interest to my colleagues.  I understand where they are coming from in terms of tabling the amendment.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response with interest.  The only aspect of the amendment with which I disagree is the proposal that a housing authority would cancel the obligation to pay part of the money owed.  Nobody wants to cause undue hardship to people who find themselves in exceptional circumstances.  However, I recall a safety net was put in place in the past to assist with ESB, gas and other bills and cheques were written for that purpose.  A review of that scheme was undertaken and people were assisted, through community welfare officers, to par<Col N="971"/>ticipate in a payment scheme.  As a result, the amount of money paid out for utility bills has been greatly reduced.  People make a part payment over a period of time.</P>
        <P>In fairness, it does not cause undue hardship to request people to part pay over a period of time.  Such an approach is not unreasonable.  I put that to the proposers of the amendment and, equally, to the Minister of State.  I look forward to hearing his views on the proposal.  I understand the substantive part of the amendment but I believe most local authorities are accommodating to tenants, especially by way of part payment over a period of time.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept the amendment.  Section 34(2) sets out the arrangements for the operation of a hardship clause in the application of this section where moneys are owing to a housing authority.  It provides that, where a housing authority is satisfied that a household would suffer undue hardship, it can enter into an agreement with the household for repayment of the money due in reasonable instalments, in addition to any rents or charges the household is already paying to the authority.  I believe the provision is fair and provides a reasonable safety net for households.  It is also sufficiently flexible to allow housing authorities to operate it in a sensible manner.</P>
        <P>In section 31 the Minister has the authority to make regulation for rent to be waived, in part or in whole, on a temporary basis, in the case of financial hardship.  In those circumstances I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>From recollection, the measure to which the Minister of State referred in section 31 operates on a temporary basis.  I accept what he said in regard to section 34(2), that a local authority can enter into an agreement to receive payment by instalments.  I accept Senator Callely&rsquo;s implication that the instalments could be set at a low level.  I would prefer if the amendment was accepted in its entirety but I accept what the Minister of State said.  I will not press the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">We debated these amendments on Committee Stage, in addition to amendments Nos. 35, 37 and 38.  I had sought to insert these amendments, plus another amendment on which we voted on Committee Stage and therefore is no longer before the House.  The intention was to improve the provisions on anti-social behaviour.  I regret that the Minister did not accept them on Committee Stage.  I accept he indicated that he would consult the Parliamentary Counsel on the amendment that was put to a vote, so I understand there might be a further development in that regard at a later stage.  Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us more now.  I would have welcomed hearing from him some of the result of the discussion or consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel, not just on this principle but on other matters raised by colleagues.</P>

	<P>I am advised that ordering the paragraphs in such a subsection gives no particular pre-eminence to the items covered.  Therefore, the amendments are unnecessary and I ask the Senators to withdraw them.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the intent of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment is to focus on preventative measures and inter-agency work but I am satisfied that the section as it currently stands will achieve that purpose.  I indicated on the previous occasion that we would develop guidelines in this area that will reflect work already undertaken by the Centre for Housing Research, which provides important training to housing practitioners on dealing with anti-social behaviour.  Illustrating the types of matters that might form part of the preventative strategy in legislation might be overly restrictive.  I assure the House that innovative approaches are facilitated in this area and that the provisions stand the test of time by providing for flexibility.  Therefore, while I appreciate the intent of the amendments I do not accept them.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have already explained my reason for tabling the amendment on Committee Stage.  It would be useful to have specified that relevant residents, community and voluntary sector organisations might be consulted on the anti-social behaviour strategy.  I accept that the Minister of State has arranged for drawing up guidelines, but it would have been nice had more detail been available to us in this House for Report Stage.  I am disappointed that was not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and add my voice to that of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s.  The general thrust of the amendment is good and, if accepted by the Minister of State, would strengthen the Bill.  It is important that residents, community groups and the voluntary sector would have a forum enshrined in legislation to provide that they can contribute their views <Col N="973"/>to any anti-social plans housing authorities might propose.  I support the general thrust of the amendment.</P>

Importantly, subsection 5(<i>d</i>) provides for consultation with any other person as the authority considers appropriate.  As I consider the consultation envisaged by the Senator can be achieved through the operation of this section in its current form, I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">When we debated this on Committee Stage, I had the impression that the Bill took account of what I was trying to achieve.  With regard to the incremental purchase scheme, we are trying to allow tenants to buy  from the voluntary housing sector houses in which they live.  I do not refer to houses that will be built on foot of this Act or houses whose construction has already commenced.  Those individuals living in voluntary housing sector estates should be permitted to take part in the incremental purchase scheme.  This may not have been clear when we debated this on Committee Stage but I want it to be clear now.  I would welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this.</P>

	<P>This amendment is not necessary.  Section 37(1) already provides that this Part applies to dwellings provided by an approved body.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.  We cannot sell voluntary houses because we do not own them.  There will be provision under the new incremental purchase scheme in respect of homes that have yet to be built.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me distinguish between local authority housing and voluntary housing.  Local authorities run the tenant purchase scheme through which tenants can buy their local authority houses.  Under the incremental purchase scheme, which is covered in this legislation, tenants will be in a position to buy voluntary houses.  Existing voluntary houses are not in our ownership and thus we cannot sell them.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 38, to delete lines 3 to 7.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We debated this issue on Committee Stage.  While we accept issues arise in respect of management fees for apartments and that the inclusion of apartments in the incremental purchase scheme would give rise to difficulties, we do not accept those difficulties cannot be overcome.  We received promises from various Ministers in recent years to the effect that the issue associated with the operation of management companies would be sorted out, but that still has not been done.  I hate to see flats excluded from the scheme.  If the Minister of State will not accept this amendment, will he commit to reconsider our proposal when the legislation on management companies passes through the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Hannigan, who made a fair and valid point on apartments.  This issue has been around the circuit for a little while.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, in which I presume he will outline why he will or will not accommodate the amendment.  Given that there are some legal and other outstanding issues, will the Minister of State indicate when this issue will be addressed to accommodate the principle of the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated on the last occasion, the current tenant purchase arrangements do not apply to apartments.  While we are continuing to work to finalise proposals for a viable sales scheme for apartments, in advance of obtaining experience of dealing with the sale of apartments under any future legislative model, it would be premature to consider the sale of new apartments in this matter under the incremental purchase scheme.  In view of this, I ask Senator Hannigan to withdraw the amendment.  I am on record as saying on Second Stage and Committee Stage that I am working with the Parliamentary Counsel to bring forward a proposal for the sale of apartments.  This work is not yet complete.  I remind the House that management companies are the responsibility not of my Department but of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions during the passage of the Bill through the House and for the warm welcome afforded to me on my return to the Seanad as a Minister of State.  This has been a good, worthwhile debate and there were worthwhile and vigorous contributions from all sides.  While there is seldom complete agreement on any issue before the House, it would not be a misrepresentation to say there was a good, broad welcome for the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important milestone in the development of housing policy.  It provides a more strategic approach to the delivery and management of the housing service plans and anti-social <Col N="975"/>behaviour strategies.  It establishes a new, more effective and comprehensive basis for assessing need and allocating housing.  The introduction of an incremental purchase scheme aimed at helping people to become house owners is innovative.  The policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities set out a vision to guide the transformation of the housing sector over the medium term by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing so in a more strategic way that focused on the building of sustainable communities.  The Bill is a crucial element to the practical implementation of that agenda.  I look forward to returning to the House with the provisions that I signalled are being developed, which I hope to introduce in the D&aacute;il.  I wish the Acting Chairman, Members and staff of the House a peaceful and happy Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this Bill before the House.  My party acknowledged that it was a good Bill on all Stages and we tried to amend it to improve it further.  There is no doubt that the Bill will improve the lot of those on the housing lists, the homeless and those with other housing needs.  The various sections of the Bill, when enacted, will contribute to ensuring such people are well looked after by the various agencies and, more important, the housing authorities.</P>
        <P>Having housing action plans and service plans represents good management but following through is essential.  Like Senator Hannigan, I will be monitoring closely the implementation of this Bill and how it will be utilised by the housing authorities and local authorities.  They are the bodies we empower to house those with a basic need for housing, which is a fundamental right.</P>
        <P>I have certainly enjoyed contributing to debates on this Bill and I hope I have made some positive points.  I listened carefully to all sides and all Senators &mdash; it is important that we listen to all contributions because everybody has something to say from which we can all learn.  The Minister of State has a genuine listening ability, which I appreciate and acknowledge.  I thank him and his staff for their work on this Bill.  It is certainly positive and I look forward to making use of its provisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I should also like to thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill.  My party is very positive about it and we believe it has great potential as regards benefiting not just current tenants, but people on waiting lists as well as the homeless.  On the whole, we welcome the Bill.  We are pleased the Minister of State has accepted a number of our amendments.  We would have liked to him to accept more, but we are pleased with those he has accepted.  That is very gracious of the Minister of State, and I should like to pay tribute both to him and his staff for the work they have put into producing this very complex and detailed Bill.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am standing in for my good friend and colleague, our housing spokesman, Senator Larry Butler.  I know he would like me to put on the record of the House his appreciation of the manner in which this legislation was accommodated by all our colleagues in the Seanad.  I congratulate the Minister of State in that regard.  The general feedback is that this is good legislation. </P>
        <P>It is great to have our friend and colleague, a former Member of the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran back in this House with such a good item of legislation, and to witness the open and frank manner in which he steered the Bill through the House.  Even his few words in summary indicated that he will keep an eye on developments and come back to us with regard to progress on the various items we have teased out in respect of the Bill.</P>
        <P>We thank the Minister of State for his co-operation, and I know Senator Butler would like to express to his colleagues opposite his appreciation for the manner in which they teased out <Col N="976"/>issues, tabled amendments and accommodated the debate.  We should like to extend to the Minister of State and his staff our best wishes for a very happy, holy and peaceful Christmas.</P>

    <Title>Recall of Irish Pork and Bacon Products: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt sa Seanad ar an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach tr&aacute;th&uacute;il seo.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a comprehensive statement on the circumstances that led to the weekend&rsquo;s recall of all Irish pork and bacon products and to help clarify issues that have arisen since.</P>
        <P>I will start by giving a brief chronology of the lead-up to the recall of the pork and bacon products.  This issue came to the notice of the Department on Friday, 28 November when an indicative test on a sample of pork fat, routinely taken under the Department&rsquo;s national residue monitoring programme, was positive for the presence of a contaminant, non-dioxin like marker PCBs.  These are preliminary indicators of potential contamination, but do not confirm the presence of dioxins.  The sample was tested in the Department&rsquo;s laboratory complex in Backweston which I visited yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the Saturday the farm from which the sample had been taken was visited by officers of the Department.  They arranged for the slaughter and sampling of an additional three pigs from the farm and also took samples of feed.  On Monday, 1 September, the first sample was confirmed positive for contamination with non-dioxin like PCBs.  When the three further fat samples and one feed sample proved positive for non-dioxin like PCBs, the samples were taken by a departmental official to the Central Science Laboratory in York for analysis for the presence of dioxins.</P>
        <P>Some commentators have suggested the fact that there is no facility in the country led to a delay in getting the results of the test.  That is not the case.  Owing to the fact the samples were taken by hand to York, there was no appreciable delay in the results becoming available.  The State Laboratory in the Backweston complex is in the process of being accredited to carry out dioxin tests and it is hoped the accreditation process will be completed in the first quarter of next year.</P>
        <P>Following the non-dioxin like PCBs positive results, the premises of the producer of the positive feed sample was officially restricted and a list of customers was acquired.  The premises of the customers of the feed producer &mdash; ten pig farms and 38 beef farms &mdash; were then restricted.  Farm-to-farm movements from these farms have since been traced and a number of additional farms  placed under restriction.</P>
        <P>The Department issued a press release on Thursday, 4 December confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.  The following day the Dutch authorities contacted the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, about the discovery of PCBs in pork fat samples in Holland.  It is important to stress that the Department had not previously been made aware of the Dutch investigation and that we were made aware of it only after we had placed information in the public domain.</P><Col N="977"/>
        <P>At 3.40 p.m. on Saturday, 6 December, the Central Science Laboratory, York confirmed the presence of dioxins in pork samples.  A decision was immediately taken by the FSAI, requiring the trade to recall all Irish pork products from pigs slaughtered since 1 September.  This date was chosen on the basis of the evidence available to the FSAI.  The analysis of the feed samples taken from the feed manufacturer for the presence of PCBs supported this position.  The FSAI also advised consumers not to consume any Irish pork or bacon products, but stressed that people should not be alarmed or concerned about the potential risks from dioxins found in pork products, as a short-term peak exposure to dioxins does not result in adverse health effects.</P>
        <P>The decision to have a full recall of pork and bacon products was taken to reassure consumers that Irish pork and bacon products available on the market following the recall would be perfectly safe to consume.  I am entirely satisfied that it was the appropriate response to the confirmed presence of dioxins and believe it will provide the necessary reassurance for consumers as soon as Irish pork products reappear on shop shelves, I hope in the coming days.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s ongoing investigation into the source of the contamination has centred on a single food business operator and is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The particular focus of the investigation relates to the type of fuel used in a burner used to heat surplus food material for use as animal feed.  This process is regarded as a relatively simple one.  Preliminary test results on samples of the oil taken by the Department for analysis suggest the operator may have been using an inappropriate oil for this process.  Further investigations are being undertaken by the EPA into the oil used.  In the meantime, the farms placed under restriction remain under restriction and no animals have been allowed to move off them.  I am acutely conscious of the particular difficulties that the absence of any processing is causing for pig producers, many of whom have thousands of pigs ready for slaughter this week.</P>
        <P>The Government is anxious that processing recommence as soon as possible and particularly conscious of the impact on the thousands of workers employed at pig producing plants, as well as the many producers who are anxious to move animals for slaughter.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interests that slaughtering recommence quickly and that we get back into the market, restore consumer confidence and protect what is a vital element of the wider agri-food sector.  To this end, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, with officials from the Department, have been engaged in intensive discussions with representatives of the processing sector, with a view to putting in place a financial aid package that would facilitate the early resumption of processing.  These discussions are continuing and progress is being made.  I remain optimistic that we can reach an agreement that will ensure slaughtering resumes this week.</P>
        <P>There has been an amount of criticism relating to the recall of organic pork products, as organic producers should not and would not use the feed ingredient in question.  I know a number of organic farmers personally and I am fully confident they would not use the material in the feed.  However, not all consumers would be aware of the conditions under which organic farmers operate and in order to give all consumers full confidence in the recall process and reassure them that no contaminated product was on the shelves, it was important to recall all Irish pork and bacon products from the market.  I have, however, put in place arrangements to allow organic pig farmers to return their products to the marketplace and will make an announcement in this regard later this afternoon.</P>
        <P>I would like to address the results of the testing of beef herds.  The results show that eight out of the 11 samples were clear, while three were just above the proposed legislative limits for non-dioxin like PCBs in beef.  The PCBs in the three beef samples were found to be significantly lower than those found in the Irish pork samples.  The FSAI has also stated PCB beef <Col N="978"/>limits are completely different from those of pork.  It has concluded that as these PCB levels pose an extremely low risk to public health, there is no requirement for a consumer level recall of Irish beef from the market.  This conclusion is influenced by the facts that there is a substantially low level of PCBs in the samples and that there is superior traceability for beef.  Also, the farms in question are restricted and animals from them will not be released to the market.  We have a statement from the European Food Safety Authority to support that view.</P>
        <P>It has been suggested that because there was no requirement for a recall of beef, the recall of pork was unwarranted or was a disproportionate action.  From what the FSAI has said, there is a clear difference between beef and pork, and to suggest otherwise is to display a misunderstanding of the situation.  There has been some criticism of the Department&rsquo;s food safety controls, especially in respect of feed controls.  I wish to clarify, in particular, the feed control and residue control systems operated by the Department.  These control systems are major elements of the national control plan for Ireland.  This multi-annual integrated control plan is approved by the European Commission and covers all the controls on animal health and welfare, food safety and feedstuffs controls for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The feed inspection programme involves approximately 2,200 on-the-spot inspections per annum, covering all aspects of the feedstuffs chain.  It includes taking 1,800 samples from the complete range of feed materials.  These samples undergo a total of 72,000 laboratory analyses, which include tests for PCBs.  The inspections cover a range of areas, including imports, mills, mineral mixture plants, retailers of animal feed and farms, and are carried out without prior notice to the owner of the premises being inspected.  The level of inspections carried out complies with, and in many cases exceeds, the requirements of the EU legislation.  Premises are inspected on a risk assessment basis.</P>
        <P>The premises from which the contaminated feed originated is regarded as low risk because it receives its raw materials from companies registered with the Department to supply food to be used in the animal feed sector.  As the raw materials were fit for human consumption, a feed premises using such raw material is regarded as low risk and is subject to one or two inspections annually.  The premises in question was inspected in 2006 and 2007 and had been scheduled for an inspection in late November or December 2008, which had not taken place when the suspected contaminated material was found.</P>
        <P>On foot of the discovery of the contaminated feed, it has been suggested this premises should have had a higher risk rating because of the apparent misuse of fuel.  However, part of the risk assessment process is based on the results of previous inspections, in which no problems were discovered.  The possible use of the wrong type of oil in a premises could not have been foreseen on the basis of previous inspections of that premises and, therefore, could not have been taken into account in the risk assessment process.</P>
        <P>The national residue programme involves a risk-based sampling regime, in which more than 30,000 samples are taken from animal tissues at farm and primary processing levels.  These samples are tested for a broad range of residues, including, for example, banned hormones, authorised medicines and a large number of contaminants.  I am satisfied that the Department has in place a strong food and feed control system.  These are complementary systems and, in this case, the contamination was picked up by the food residue controls.  As with all controls operated by the Department, these will be kept under continual review to ensure that the food produced in Ireland continues to reach the highest standards of food safety.</P>
        <P>The position that has arisen in pigmeat and, to a much lesser extent, beef requires a balanced and proportionate response.  I am satisfied that the Government has acted swiftly, decisively and responsibly.  I believe the actions taken will reassure consumers and, with the assistance of <Col N="979"/>a new Bord Bia labelling system, Irish pork and bacon products will be back on the shelves very quickly.  Significant progress has been made in the discussions with the processing and producer interests and I am confident that Irish product will be back on the shelves very shortly.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am aware that he and his Government colleagues have been working hard on this issue in recent days, which is only to be expected.  I am sure he shares my analysis of the scale of this problem and the crisis it poses for the Irish pork and bacon industry in particular and the Irish food industry as a whole.  Ireland still depends greatly on agriculture for exports and the flag one flies for Irish food is that its quality always is deemed to be supreme.  One still can state without equivocation that Irish food is the best not merely in Europe but, from a quality perspective, in the world, and this point must be proclaimed loudly.</P>
        <P>However, Ireland faces a crisis that must be resolved.  I was pleased the Minister of State&rsquo;s concluding remarks expressed the hope that Irish pork would be back on the shelves within the next few days, which obviously is vital.  I come from an area of north County Cork in which the pig industry is a significant farming enterprise and employer.  For many years, it has been a beacon of the agrifood industry and last weekend certainly was an extremely depressing time in parts of north County Cork.  I spoke to a number of constituents who are directly involved in this industry and, to put it mildly, they were both disappointed and distressed by what transpired.  They wish to work with the Minister of State and his officials to resolve this problem.</P>
        <P>When the Government took the decision last Saturday to take all Irish pork products off the shelves, the initial guarded political view was that the correct, and perhaps the only possible, decision had been made.  Since then, there has been some debate on whether the initial Government response might have been excessive.  I do not wish to enter into such a historical debate at present because what is done is done, but we must reflect on the scale of our response in respect of any such issues in the future.  Obviously, I am pleased that, notwithstanding the difficulties that arose within the beef sector in the past day, the Department was able to respond in what could be deemed to be a slightly more measured manner.  I hope this is the full extent of the required response.</P>
        <P>The response now being sought from our pig producers, processors and those who work in the industry is a package of aid, which will allow the industry, first, to survive the current crisis and thereafter to flourish and grow.  We also must ensure that consumers in Ireland, Europe and worldwide again are comfortable and confident to have Irish food on the dinner table.  Some highly disappointing scare stories have been doing the rounds about this scare on British and European television and on worldwide media sources.  It certainly is being exaggerated beyond the realms of reality.  The Minister of State, the Department and Bord Bia must work hard to redress this issue in the crucial weeks and months ahead.</P>
        <P>Were it possible to get Irish pork back on the supermarket shelves this week, it would be highly satisfactory.  However, in the medium to long term, one must ensure that domestic and international consumers will wish to purchase this product.  Consequently, the Department must lead the way in respect of a huge job of marketing or rebranding, if the Minister of State will excuse the pun.  I earnestly hope that whatever investment is required in this regard will be made.</P><Col N="980"/>
        <P>I appreciate my time almost has concluded.  I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the scale of the problem this crisis has caused for families and producers, as well as processors and workers nationwide.  While this is a valuable component of Irish agri-industry, the entire Irish food industry depends on consumer satisfaction with the safety of Irish food, and this is where the political argument now must go.  Ireland should work closely with its EU colleagues and if assistance is required, it should argue strongly that it should be forthcoming because the European Union has a strong role to play in rebuilding confidence across Europe in the Irish food sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice of concern on behalf of the constituents I represent in County Waterford, where many intensive pig farmers and processing factories are located, all of which are going through a difficult time at present.  I do not doubt that the Minister and his departmental officials are working as hard as possible to try to alleviate the effects of the bombshell that has hit the entire agrifood sector since last Saturday.  Everyone acknowledges that Irish agrifood has been a major player on international markets.  It is the threat to that which is the issue as well as the implications it has for production lines from farmers rearing pigs to processing plants to retailers and consumers.  A vast and wide-ranging sector of society has been seriously affected by this crisis.</P>
        <P>On the response to the crisis once it became known, it is worrying that we must send samples for testing to a science laboratory in York in England because we do not have a science laboratory in Ireland, even though we pride ourselves on being a leading technological country.  The same occurred last year during the water crisis in Galway when tests for cryptosporidium had to be conducted in foreign lands and we waited weeks for a response.  The same may be said of the cervical smear tests, which the Minister of State might think is not related but which I certainly think is.  We do not have the capacity in this country to test for toxins or otherwise in the food chain.  That is a disgrace and needs to be addressed urgently.</P>
        <P>Time is of the essence in this crisis.  The Minister of State has given it his full attention, as has the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith.  We need to see pork back on shop shelves, as the Minister of State said in his closing remarks.  We need to see confidence returning across the sectors, from retailers to consumers to processors to farmers.  I urge the Minister of State to give them all the assistance possible, for example, through grant aid for farmers, who are innocent in this crisis, need all the help they can get, and depend on the Government, the Department or its agencies, such as Bord Bia, which has always done a good job for Ireland in promoting food exports.  Bord Bia needs to be resourced well to tackle this serious crisis.  We have one shot at it and we need to get it right.  I urge the Minister of State to give it all the resources he can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  I compliment him, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the Taoiseach on the quick and decisive action they took over the weekend in dealing with the recall of Irish pork and bacon products in which dioxins were discovered.  There have been comments in the media that the action taken was over the top.  The same sources would have had banner headlines had action not been taken, accusing the Minister, the Department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of sweeping a serious issue under the carpet.</P>
        <P>We must remember that 85% of all agricultural produce is exported and it is imperative we have a perfect product free of any contaminants so that consumers in the countries to which we export need have no worries that the product is safe and of a very high quality.  As an exporting country we have built up a reputation over a number of years, often through annoy<Col N="981"/>ing producers with regulations which they think are unnecessary but which have proven very necessary for us to maintain a high quality product for sale and export.</P>
        <P>There are 2,200 inspections carried out each year throughout the food chain under the feed inspection programme and 30,000 samples are taken from across the food chain and tested under the national residue programme for more than 200 possible contaminants.  This testing complies with, and even in many cases exceeds, the requirements of the EU legislation.</P>
        <P>I know this is true because in another life, before I became a Member of the Oireachtas, I worked for the Department and spent some time in meat factories, and there was stringent sampling of the liver, urine and kidney parts from one pig in every batch.  By batch, I mean that if a producer sent in 100 pigs to be killed, at least five or six samples would be taken.  Those were sent to the laboratory to be tested and the products would not be released until the results came back that everything was clear.  If the results were not clear, the batch was condemned and the producer notified that he or she would have to change his or her ways.</P>
        <P>The pig farms placed under restriction will have that restriction lifted, I believe, as soon as the pigs are slaughtered.  To this end, I appeal to the Minister of State, the Minister and the Department to act as quickly as possible and treat as highly urgent the need to have the pigs killed so that producers can get back in business.  They have gone through a torrid time over the past week and deserve every help they can get because this was not their fault.</P>
        <P>Retailers and processors also have been under great pressure in recent days, and the way in which they co-operated and helped in every way possible should be recognised.  I was delighted to hear the Minister of State say he will make an announcement later in the afternoon that the organic pig producers will be allowed get back into business.</P>
        <P>I have one criticism.  While I did not hear the programme about it on national radio yesterday, I received telephone calls about it last night from constituents.  Galtee makes up hampers which people in Ireland request to be sent to their friends and relatives in England, the USA and other destinations.  These constituents received a telephone call from that company to say the pork products in the hampers were fine because they were not Irish sourced.  This is dishonest because the people who purchased them believed them to be Irish or would not have bothered to send them at all.  I hope after this the company rectifies the situation or at least is honest with its customers.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State alluded in his speech to the issuing of a statement by the European Food Safety Authority, and I welcome that statement dealing with dioxins in Irish pork.  Its two key conclusions are that in the most likely scenario, if someone ate an average amount of Irish pork each day throughout the 90-day period of the incident, 10% of which was contaminated at the highest recorded concentration of dioxins, the body burden would increase by approximately 10%.  The EFSA considers this increase to be of no concern for this single event.  Second, in a very extreme case, if someone ate a large amount of Irish pork each day throughout the period of the incident, 100% of which was contaminated at the highest recorded concentration of dioxins, the EFSA concludes that the safety margin embedded in the tolerable weekly intake, TWI, would be considerably undermined.  Given that the TWI has a ten-fold built in safety margin, the EFSA considers that this unlikely scenario would reduce protection but would not necessarily lead to adverse health effects.</P>
        <P>That speaks for itself.  It gives confidence that we have acted correctly and that we have a very high quality product, as has been alluded to by other speakers.  That is as it should be.  We should be proud of our producers and of the Department in getting this right, especially in light of the fact we must export 85% of our product.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="982"/>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House, especially on this topic.  I hope I do not repeat myself.  I spoke on the radio this morning about my understanding of this.  The example I gave was of an event that occurred approximately ten or 15 years ago in America where poison was placed in Tylenol, a highly successful product belonging to Johnson &amp; Johnson.  A threat was made that if the company did not pay a very large sum of money, poison would be placed in more Tylenol.  Johnson &amp; Johnson was faced with a considerable challenge.  What did the company do?  It took Tylenol off shelves right around the world.  It was done at significant cost to the company, but it is one of the more interesting marketing studies of crisis management.  The company took the produce off the shelves until it managed to replace it with product in caps which were tamper proof, and it took some months to do so.  When the company reintroduced Tylenol, it was known to be safe and ensured that what occurred could not happen again.  I mentioned this because the company moved immediately at considerable cost to the extent that I am sure its shares were damaged and confidence in the company&rsquo;s viability was questioned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The action that the Government took last Saturday was correct.  We had no choice.  I congratulate the Government on the alacrity with which it responded to the problem.  The Government did the same as the company to which I referred.  It stated it was taking all pork products off the shelves, thus putting people&rsquo;s minds at rest that they would not be in any danger of consuming Irish pork which might result in a health problem.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That was last week but we have to decide how to address the serious challenges we now face.  I was delighted to hear that the Minister of State intends to announce that organic pigs are safe to eat.  However, I hope he also moves quickly to support pig farmers and processors who are able to demonstrate the safety of their products.  I am aware his heart is in this but that will not be enough to solve the problem.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The pork recall arose during a meeting I attended in Brussels yesterday of business people from various countries.  I was asked how Ireland intends to solve the problem it faces.  We need to blitz all our customers because our competitors are moving into the gap in the market that has opened as a result of consumers&rsquo; unhappiness with Irish products.  I am aware the chief Government veterinarian is in Brussels to assuage the concerns of the EU authorities but we also need to assure our customers in Europe, whether these are hotels, restaurants, processors or supermarkets, that we have addressed the crisis.  Bord Bia will have to use its considerable marketing skills and its global contacts to ensure our competitors do not take advantage of the situation.</P>
        <P>We must re-establish our customers&rsquo; trust in our products.  Yesterday in Brussels, the issue was raised with me by ordinary business people who heard about it on the radio.  They asked me how we planned to address the crisis.  It was only towards the end of my meeting that people began to ask whether beef products were compromised.  I was horrified on my return to Ireland to learn that questions had indeed arisen about beef.</P>
        <P>Significant damage will be done by this scare.  When BSE was discovered in the mid-1990s, it took the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, ten years to lift the bans imposed on its beef exports.  The Belgian crisis over contaminated animal products, which was also the result of dioxin contamination, resulted in the withdrawal from French shops of Belgian eggs, chickens and chocolate.  In taking a precautionary approach, we have learned the lessons from these crises.  Earlier this year, Italy was very slow to react to a scandal involving dioxins in mozzarella cheese, with the result that the EU imposed a ban.  By acting quickly on our problems, we avoided this situation.  The European Commission has recognised that we have acted more promptly than the Italians.  I am also reminded of the scandal that broke some years ago <Col N="983"/>involving de-icer in Austrian wines.  The Minister of State gave a clear explanation for the withdrawal from sale of all pork products.</P>
        <P>Anecdotal evidence from my visit to Brussels suggests that Ireland has lost a lot of goodwill from EU institutions and member states.  I wonder whether our rejection of the Lisbon treaty will affect the Government&rsquo;s efforts to persuade Brussels to provide an aid package for farmers.  The business people I met yesterday asked me the Government&rsquo;s plans to recompense those who suffered losses because they assumed our checking system was inadequate.  The Minister of State has done a good job of explaining that situation.  Several people asked me why, after 20 years of success with our economy, exports and taxation system, we voted to reject Europe.  I almost found myself defending the &ldquo;No&rdquo; voters even though I supported the treaty.  I had to explain that Ireland is in favour of Europe and that we voted against the treaty for various reasons.  People asked me how we managed to get so many things wrong over the past six months.  We have to work out an aid package for those who suffered losses, although I am not sure how we will go about this task.</P>
        <P>The lesson Belgium learned from its scandal was that the way in which animal food is prepared is often a disaster waiting to happen.  In the Belgian case, approximately 20 companies were involved in the collection of animal fat from slaughterhouses for use in animal feed, and it was common practice to include household waste.  As a result of the scandal, the country&rsquo;s agriculture minister, Karel Pinxten, and health minister, Marcel Kolla, had to resign.  I am not suggesting a similar response in Ireland&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P>The real challenge we face lies not in studying the past but in restoring our customers&rsquo; trust in Irish pork products in the future.  Our customers comprise ordinary citizens as well as processors and supermarkets.  Let us ensure this does not destroy their trust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The crisis that followed the recall of Irish pork and bacon products relates as much to the economy as to food safety.  We need to consider the impact on the turnover of pork producers during the worst possible time of the year.  Already we are seeing a short-term impact in terms of staff being laid off.  Further down the production chain, the impact will be even more strongly felt on individual farms.  As well as dealing with the short-term revenue losses, we will have to restore sales of Irish pork nationally and internationally to their previous levels.  We will also have to consider compensatory measures, either from our much depleted national purse or, it is hoped, with the appropriate assistance of the EU.  Although as yet difficult to measure, the economic impact will be significant.</P>
        <P>As Senator Quinn noted, the Government&rsquo;s response to the crisis was immediate and appropriate in terms of inspiring public confidence.  Lessons were learned from the experience of other countries, such as the toxins in Belgian meat, the recent mozzarella scare in Italy and the powdered milk scandal in China.  If any question arises in regard to contaminants in food, the only responsible reaction is a prompt and comprehensive response.  The Government and the State agencies have acted appropriately in this regard.  The presence in the House of my party colleague, the Minister of State, gives me the opportunity to commend him on his reassuring statements which have helped to restore public confidence in Irish pork.</P>
        <P>The impact of a total recall of these products is diminished by the fact that people need to be exposed to them for 40 years before they develop symptoms. If the quantities of dioxin build up in a person&rsquo;s system they may not feel the impact, either immediately or in the long term, on their own personal health.  That is not the issue.  A product was found that is a known contaminant and it should not have been in the food.  It affects the quality of our branded products and our reputation in the world.  We must immediately put in place systems that eliminate this risk and ensure the risk cannot happen in future.  Government actions and the actions of State agencies are dedicated to that and the crisis has been handled well to date.</P><Col N="984"/>
        <P>There is a job to be done.  There are banner headlines on the 24-hour news stations and foreign newspapers that are now stating toxins have been found in Irish pork products.  There will not be similar headlines in a week or ten days that will state Irish pork products are clear of toxins.  Senator Quinn is correct in stating there is a big selling job to be done by Bord Bia to restore that international reputation.</P>
        <P>The fact we have acted in the way we have and with speed is the best card we can play in restoring that confidence.  As a country committed to agricultural exports of the highest quality, we can say that we acted appropriately in trying to ensure any contamination which existed is eliminated from our food chain.  We can point to the example of other competing countries in the food market which have not acted similarly.  It may take some time but I am sure the way in which Irish food products have been viewed in the past can be restored.</P>
        <P>Not only is it the worst possible time for pork producers because of the Christmas market but it is not the best possible time at all for the Irish economy, as we are seeking to restore our competitive advantage, increase our exports and get more added value from our economy.  The fact we have acted in the way we have should be taken as a mark of confidence.  There is a danger that given the cycle of news events we have received in the past nine months in particular, we could retreat into a shell, look at the dark side and be despondent and pessimistic.  We should take pride in the fact that we are capable of producing goods of the highest quality.  That is what we are good at, and we must get back into the international market.  If and when occurrences of this type happen, we should take appropriate measures.</P>
        <P>We have to isolate this issue but there are lessons that can be learned in bringing a level of traceability to pork products that currently exists in regard to beef.  We must ensure the risk of dioxins is minimised to the largest possible extent, and that will have ramifications for other areas of local, national or international policy.  For example, should we be encouraging the creation of incinerators that produce dioxins that may end up in the food chain?  These questions must be asked and I am sure they will be considered in the wider context of a review of Government policy.</P>
        <P>The common view of all within the Chamber is that what can be done is being done.  Our common hope is that Irish pork products can be restored to shop shelves in the quickest possible time.  The Minister of State will get a great deal of support for the actions he has taken in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in welcoming the Minister of State.  There are a number of steps that must be taken as a matter of urgency.  They merit repeating, although a number of them have been in the media over the past few days.  As a result of the grave losses that processors and producers have had to accept, a compensation package must be put in place.  That matter is under negotiation but there is a clear need for it.</P>
        <P>It would be welcome to get as much funding as possible from the EU in this respect.  I note that the result of the Lisbon treaty referendum is not helping in this regard.  There must be a compensation package &mdash; irrespective of whether it comes from the EU &mdash; and the economy must take this hit if necessary.  The people involved could not continue otherwise.  A point has emerged today of banks facilitating both processors and producers over the next week or so, and this should come about.</P><Col N="985"/>
        <P>It is crucial to get processing up and running immediately.  I and others welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement on organic pig production and the processing thereof.  I hope that within hours we can have a similar announcement for the entire sector.  We must get back to normal very quickly.</P>
        <P>The incident is an indictment of our licensing and inspection of food processing facilities.  We must examine this inspection system of food facilities.  It is horrendous this processing system was allowed to operate under the radar and was described in memoranda as a low-level risk.  There had been no scrutiny of the facility in 2008.  Immediate action is required.</P>
        <P>This was a systems failure and there is no point in saying otherwise.  We did not have a better system of inspection or detection and more consistent monitoring.  We have discussed this matter in the House before as it is in stark contrast with the kind of red tape and almost daily inspections that ordinary producers go through.  It was an horrendous failure in this respect.  Ordinary farmers experience red tape to a prohibitive degree and they must feel so frustrated, angry and that they are the innocent victims of something over which they had no control.</P>
        <P>The question of traceability arises and it is great that there is such a high level of traceability in the beef sector.  I am interested in the response of the Minister of State on this matter, as we will need a specific and almost renewed charter of traceability criteria, rules and regulations.  There must be a re-evaluation of what we are doing about traceability.  We will need aggressive marketing of Irish products.  We know our Irish food is the best but we got horrendous publicity yesterday on Sky News, whose reporting was very bleak.  I hope that can change but we will need an aggressive marketing programme.</P>
        <P>I know the country is in bad shape but we must compensate farmers and processors to help them cope with the horrendous losses they have experienced.  Similarly, we must spend some money on an initial tranche of advertising to cope with the current difficulty.  That would be money well spent.  We spoke about spending money in foreign countries on a different matter in previous weeks.  I am not talking about that but we need effective marketing of our produce abroad over the next couple of months to get over this difficulty.  The problem will be surmounted at that level.</P>
        <P>These are the only suggestions I can make in the confines of my time.  I will promptly hand over to my colleague, Senator McFadden.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  Why was the source factory not inspected and tested for the unlicensed oil and why was the oil unlicensed?  The EPA and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have both indicated it was not within their remit to have checked and inspected the oil.  To restore confidence we must have answers to those questions. I read the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech and cannot see the answers in it.  I ask that the answers be given to the broader public, as it would inspire confidence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Without repeating what everybody else has said, this is a very important and worrying issue for the country in terms of the overall economy and particularly for pig producers, processors, factory workers and consumers.  I commend Senator O&rsquo;Reilly on a very measured contribution and the Opposition, in the main, has been responsible in this debate, which is very welcome.  The matter is too important to play politics with it.  I am not sure I would agree with the Senator that there has been a systems failure.  No system is perfect anywhere in the world and the human condition is fraught with problems and failures.  The matter was handled well and I would not call it a failure but a field test of a system.  The backup and safeguards were present.  I commend the Government and the Minister, in particular, as well as the State agencies concerned, on the prompt manner in which they dealt with the crisis.  They had a tough call to make but made it, for which they must be respected.  Initially, my <Col N="986"/>view was that the image of Ireland as a producer of clean, high quality foods would be damaged.  However, given the manner in which the matter was handled by the Government and its agencies, our reputation has been enhanced because one can see how serious we are about protecting the image of our food.  One also sees that we are prepared to announce a total recall of a product.  One must compare this with what happened in Belgium in 1999 when the Belgian Government and its agencies fiddled around with the problem encountered in that country.  Information was doled out sparingly and the action taken was not as clear-cut or decisive as that taken here.  That puts the matter into proper perspective.  It is interesting to note that the French Minister for agriculture has commended the Government on its handling of the matter.  In addition, the European Commission is clearly satisfied because it issued a welcome statement within the past hour.</P>
        <P>I thank the chief veterinary officer for his good media presentations, with the director of the Food Safety Authority, which reassured the public.  I agree with previous speakers that we must now go on a PR offensive to rectify the damage caused.  I call on the media, in particular our national broadcaster, RTE, to help us out in dealing with the crisis and to rectify the damage done by the less than balanced coverage on other television channels.  There is an opportunity for us to do so.  In the past I commended the work of Bord Bia but it has much to do before Christmas.  I have no doubt that it will be able for the job.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed to learn that organic pigmeat was also being included in the ban.  It is a big disappointment for the Minister of State who has done such tremendous work in promoting organic food.  I can understand the reason &mdash; to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that all possible dangerous products had been recalled.  However, it still presents the organic food sector with an opportunity to step up to the mark and enjoy an even greater profile.  The sector has grown under the Minister of State&rsquo;s supervision in recent times and there is still a major opportunity with the approach of the Christmas market.  People will now be looking far more closely at all of their food products; therefore, the message should be that organic food is of high quality.  Although there was no problem with it, it was recalled to be safer than safe.</P>
        <P>One worrying aspect concerns the labelling of so-called Irish food products.  Products are marketed here as being Irish when, in fact, they are not but sourced abroad.  If my information is correct, one of our business people is having it both ways in this respect.  They have been happily importing pork before slicing and vacuum packing it here to market it as an Irish product.  I am told that they are busy telling people that it is not an Irish product and is quite safe to eat because it is sourced abroad.  Talk about having an each-way bet.</P>
        <P>Obviously, we have to get processing back on stream again and it should happen before the end of this week.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s intended announcement this evening on the organic sector.  I support his efforts to introduce our own testing process shortly.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  What I have to say will not be greatly different from what previous speakers have said.  I happened to be in London over the weekend and received a few messages about what happened on Saturday.  British television coverage of the story was the most appalling advertisement for Irish food that one could imagine.  Every hour on the hour, the first item on Sky News was about Irish pork products being withdrawn from shelves across the world.  It was presented in a sensationalist way as an immediate threat to health because it claimed that all Irish pork products were affected.  It will be difficult to convince shoppers that it is safe to buy Irish pork products in the future.  It will require a lot of investment and effort by those charged with that task.  I sincerely wish them the best of luck in that regard.</P><Col N="987"/>
        <P>The incident raises a few puzzling questions.  I emphatically disagree with those on the other side of the House who have spoken about the Government&rsquo;s fast reaction.  I have read in a number of publications that questions were raised about dioxin contamination of Irish pork last September by a Dutch gelatin producer.  That information was passed at the time to the relevant Irish authorities.  The Dutch producer was able to narrow down the inputs and test them.  He found that there was a problem with his Irish inputs and this information was passed to some of the relevant authorities here.  It seems, however, that no action was taken.  I may be wrong and it may be one of those stories one hears&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Other speakers have mentioned the rigorous testing and inspection procedure to which farmers are subject.  It is appalling that the plant in question in Carlow was not inspected this year.  It is strange that pig producers are required to keep feed samples for six months, yet the testing of these samples by the relevant Government authorities must have been inadequate.  Nonetheless, it is their responsibility to ensure feed inputs meet certain standards.  Why are pig producers keeping such samples if they are not being tested by the relevant authorities?  It must not have happened in this case, given the problems that have emerged.</P>
        <P>The pig sector is the Cinderella of Irish agriculture.  The approximately 400 to 500 producers remaining are on their knees.  I join colleagues who have urged that some compensation package be put in place for them, as well as for pig processors.  A number of such businesses are in serious difficulty, including three in my area in south Kilkenny, in which a number of employees have been placed on protective notice.  Some 300 have been temporarily laid off.</P>

        <P>Since my time is concluding, I have a final point to make.  I do not disagree with Senators who have referred to the Government&rsquo;s response in removing all pork products from shelves, but a question remains, as 90% of that product was unaffected.  The PR impact of the complete removal has been negative globally, if not so much in Ireland.  I hope the Minister of State will respond.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>That industry is up to scratch in practically every sense of the term.  The problem was not caused by the food.  Rather, it was caused by the process through which products were dried for use as animal feed.</P>
        <P>Two or three questions must be pursued vigorously.  Why is a recycled oil that is banned in other countries allowed for use in Irish industry?  Derogation was sought, but I hope the Minister of State and the Department will discover who was the culprit behind the supply of substandard oil.  The oil&rsquo;s usage is a knock-on effect of everyday events in food production.  Multinationals have taken control of the entire food industry and are forcing people to produce food at uneconomical rates.  This is the problem.  If people are unprepared to pay producers realistic prices, the latter will not be able to produce.  The knock-on effects cross the board.  We have been told that the oil was at a reduced price because it was not up to scratch.  According to my information, some of it should have been destroyed by incineration, not used.  This situation must be examined.</P>
        <P>Farmers purchased feed in good faith because it was cheaper than anything else available.  Their margins are being so squeezed by the multinationals, the largest food sellers across Europe, that they are unable to produce at a realistic price.  Until we decide that farmers should be paid properly, we will continue to encounter such problems.  Costs and corners are being cut, the net result of which equates to people being forced into the actions taken.  Multinationals are taking frightening margins and farmers must realise that, unless everyone involved takes a stand, nothing will be done.  Consumers must stand with farmers and make it clear that multinationals will not be allowed to take criminal margins.  Considering the prices paid to primary producers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> what housewives pay in shops, the margins are phenomenal.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I compliment him and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, on taking effective and stern action on this major crisis.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s hope that organic food producers are recognised for their work and that restrictions on them are lifted as soon as possible is welcome.  Organic farming is close to his heart and is something in which I have developed great faith.  Given the increase in the number of old style country markets in every town in west County Cork, it is evident that organic farming is on its way back.  Unfortunately, its economic viability is not strong and those farmers have a tough task, but the artisan and slow food industries must be promoted.  Were there ever a catalyst for the promulgation of their types of food product, the current crisis has pointed us in the right direction.  I welcome the fact that they will be set to one side.  Sometimes, they are sneered at by large producers and multinationals, but the general public is rowing back towards such foodstuffs.  This is evident from the crowds that attend markets in Schull, Skibbereen, Bandon and Kinsale each weekend.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The crisis surprised me.  The Department took a hands on approach and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and other State agencies became involved.  However, it is time for a single food safety authority with ultimate power and responsibility.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, could be doing something while the FSAI could be doing something else.  There should be a single food safety authority in respect of all foodstuffs, from the land to the sea.  In line with the old Latin maxim, <i>delegatus non potest delegare</i>, there <Col N="989"/>should be no delegation or dereliction of duty.  I support the FSAI, but it should be the final arbiter in terms of food.  There should be no shilly-shallying or side-stepping by State agencies.</P>

	<P>I grew up on a pig farm and, during my student days, I worked in the Henry Denny and Sons bacon factory in Tralee.  At the time, standards were so good that one could eat dinner off the factory floor.  In this light, it is surprising that someone was so sloppy in the manufacture of foodstuffs as to have left us in this crisis.</P>
        <P>When the dust settles, we must determine why the system went wrong.  We must also ask hard questions about whether we overcorrected when we pulled all of the products.  Instead, a partial withdrawal and a full release of the results could have been considered, as the pigmeat industry has been done untold damage.  It cannot take such hits.  More information on the crisis and how such crises are dealt with is necessary.  The situation is not similar to the BSE scare or a salmonella infection.  The contamination is not as serious as it has been made out to be.  The negative response when the general public reads about it and after certain media outlets have hammed it up is out of proportion with the reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The source of the final product must be examined if we are to determine how the regulations were broken and how this disaster for the pigmeat industry came about.  When the dust settles and after further inquiries have been made, I would appreciate additional information.  I would like to say more, but time is against me.  I hope the House will hear more about this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of issues arise in respect of this matter, one of which relates to Members on this side of the House not being obliged to second-guess the Government in respect of the action it took with regard to the pigmeat sector.  There is also the issue of compensation.  The Taoiseach referred to the EU providing assistance in this regard, but then it looked bad when the European Commission was obliged to clarify the rules for him.  There are market support measures that can be provided in the form of aids to private storage, APS.  However, the Taoiseach got it wrong in calling on Brussels to provide aid or to subsidise such aid.  The responsibility in this regard is national in nature.  The position was the same in Belgium when a similar food scare occurred some years ago.</P>
        <P>The Government must face up to the fact that it will be obliged to compensate those affected by what has clearly been a failure in the regulation of the sector, particularly in the context of feed input.  There are many controls in place in respect of manufacturers and farmers.  However, it appears that there is a gap in the system of control.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to superior traceability for beef.  His comments in this regard were absolutely correct.  He also stated that farms where suspect feed was used have been restricted and that animals from those farms will not be released to the market.  The Minister of State further indicated that there is no requirement for beef to be recalled.  Different responses were required in respect of the two sectors affected by this problem.  The traceability system relating to beef is extremely comprehensive.  For example, it has been established that <Col N="990"/>since September 3,000 cattle were produced on the 45 farms affected.  Much of that beef has already been consumed.  There was a case for the recall of such beef in circumstances where it could be traced and had not been consumed.  If that was done, it would highlight the validity of our traceability system and a line could be drawn under this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that cattle from these farms are being restricted while further tests are carried out.  A logical extension of that would seem to be that there should be a call-back in respect of beef which emanated from such farms during the specified period.  The names of the farms involved have not been provided or made public.  If the traceability system is to work, manufacturers and processors should be informed as to the identity of these farms.  Manufacturers and processors have the ability to trace beef back to source and if they can do so, it will assist them in their dealings with their customers in European markets.</P>
        <P>I was informed this morning that Irish beef exporters who supplied products to German supermarkets were asked to recall and collect the beef on foot of concerns that have arisen.  There is no problem in the beef sector.  However, statements were made about tests showing PCB levels of two to three times above the legal limit.  While the benchmark is given as the extraordinary excess in the case of pork, the figures being provided still look wrong.  It is difficult to explain to supermarkets throughout Europe that there is no difficulty with Irish beef.</P>
        <P>The Government must be more precise and clear in how it approaches this issue.  The recall of beef that is still in storage or transit would be a positive development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent.  I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this serious issue that came to light at the weekend and the information that emerged yesterday regarding PCB found in certain herds of cattle.  I express my distress in respect of this matter and my concern for all parties involved.  It is extremely upsetting that so many families are affected by this crisis with only two weeks to go until Christmas.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister, Deputy Smith, the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, and their officials on moving so speedily to deal with this matter in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  I have no doubt that the Ministers and the relevant bodies will work speedily to get the market back on its feet and to assure the public, at home and abroad, that Irish pork is fit for human consumption and continues to reach the first-class standard for which it is well known.</P>
        <P>The measures we have put in place are an indication of our commitment to the health of our citizens and the reputation of the agrifood sector.  We have acted responsibly at all times and I am optimistic that the negotiations with the processors and the producers will deliver an outcome that will facilitate the resumption of slaughtering as a matter of urgency.  Such resumption is vital for thousands of employees, producers and processors and is in the national interest.</P>
        <P>I greet the up-to-date press release from the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, with some relief.  The EFSA carried out scientific tests under several different scenarios and discovered that the dioxin contained in Irish pork would not give rise to adverse health effects.</P>
        <P>As with all matters relating to the agricultural sector, this issue is close to my heart.  I have been involved in the beef and pig sectors for many years in County Laois and the surrounding counties, which have a tremendous history of rearing prime stock for breeding and slaughter.  Agriculture is a substantial contributor to GDP.  In these tough fiscal times, Ireland, as a small producing nation, cannot afford to have its pork industry adversely affected for an extended period.  We must get the sector back up and running at the levels of productivity that obtained prior to the weekend.  It must be made clear to consumers that checks will be put in place so <Col N="991"/>that there will be no recurrence of the mistake that was made in this instance.  The Department and bodies such as Bord Bia will work tirelessly to regain confidence in the beef and pork sectors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement to the effect that organic pig farmers will be allowed to return their products to the marketplace.  I compliment him, the Minister, Deputy Smith, and all the team in the Department on the tremendous work they have done in recent days.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it.  As my party colleague, Deputy Ferris, stated in respect of the current crisis, the priority now must be to limit the extent of the damage done to the sector and to protect the many livelihoods and jobs that have been affected.  I spent the past couple of hours in my office trying to deal with pig farmers from County Donegal whose animals could not be slaughtered today and other individuals who have either lost their jobs or been laid off on a temporary basis as a result of this crisis.  The scale of the losses incurred by individual pig farmers and suppliers is massive and this issue must be addressed.  Large-scale temporary lay-offs have taken place and it is likely that matters will get worse if corrective measures are not put in place.  That is why it is vital that the processing and supply of product to shops begin again immediately.</P>
        <P>The crisis relating to contaminated produce could not have come at a worse time, particularly as farmers have already been obliged to cope with steep falls in the prices paid to them by factories in recent months.  Unfortunately, this can be attributed to some degree to the lack of domestic consumer demand for Irish pork.  The position in this regard will not be helped by current events and it is all the more important, therefore, that the correct measures are taken quickly to ensure that the sector gets back on track.  This also highlights the need to address various issues relating to the marketing and labelling of Irish pork.</P>
        <P>We must consider whether the ban on the slaughter of pigs and the withdrawal of produce from retailers was an over-reaction to the discovery of the contamination.  Professor James Heffron of University College Cork, a leading expert in this field, stated that if the data collated by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland prove that the levels of dioxins were within the acceptable limit, there was no reason the order to withdraw pork products from sale was made.  Professor Heffron stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">... these dioxins are in the atmosphere anyway and if the amounts likely to have been consumed in the small number of products that were sold were similar then no harm will have been done. Indeed from the very moment the measures were announced people were being advised that there was no need for anyone to be overly concerned and no need for anyone to seek medical advice.  So there was and is no real threat to public health.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Food Safety Authority themselves have said that, based on previous studies into dioxin contamination both from food and from the chemical plant explosion in Seveso, the health risks involved are minimal and will remain minimal even for any person who has consumed contaminated produce.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The question must be posed as to whether the withdrawal of all pigmeat products was necessary or, perhaps, a public health warning might have been more appropriate.  People could have been told the facts as known on Sunday morning and the level of risk entailed and advised it was up to them whether to consume the products affected.  While, undoubtedly, this would still have had a major impact on the sector with presumably a significant number of consumers opting not to consume pigmeat, it would have lasted only until current stocks had expired and been replaced.  We could then have avoided the massive shock to the sector which we are <Col N="992"/>currently experiencing and, in the process, prevented the laying off of so many workers in the run-up to Christmas and the loss to the farmers, butcher shops and suppliers affected.</P>
        <P>An issue arises in respect of traceability.  Was there a failure in the system that prevented the determination of which farms and animals had been contaminated and in tracing the supply line to the processors involved thus affecting the entire sector?  Ought it not to be possible once it was known which farms had used the feed to then determine exactly where the processing of contaminated animals took place, what products were affected and to which retailers or exporters such products had been sent?  In that way the remainder of the sector, which is free from contamination, could have been ring-fenced.  Were officials able to establish this and, if not, why not?  If they were able to trace where the feed went and where the contaminated animals had been slaughtered, why then was it not possible for them to impose more limited restrictions in this regard?</P>
        <P>Another issue that needs to be considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The reason some Irish retailers continued to sell Irish pork products after the recall on Sunday is that the products were produced in other countries but labelled as Irish products.

	<P>I compliment the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Mary Wallace and Deputy Trevor Sargent, on their work so far.  While the decision made on Saturday was dramatic, any attempt to cover up this situation would have been disastrous.  The Government showed great leadership in taking this tough decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is clear from the statement read into the record of the House today by Senator Carty that we have, from a European viewpoint, a clean bill of health, which is vitally important.  That is positive news.  The Government must now engage in a public relations exercise internationally.  Money will have to be spent on advertisements on Sky television and CNN and in the red tops and other newspapers that have published negative articles in regard to our products.  This will cost us but there is a great deal at stake, including the approximately 6,000 jobs in jeopardy as a result of this situation.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that this does not happen again.  It is happening too often.  I thought we had finally dealt with this problem during the BSE crisis some years ago.  I was trade Minister at that time and we had to go abroad and convince other countries that our product was 100% safe.  The Minister of State will make a statement in the next hour or so in respect of organic pig products, which must be returned to the shelves tomorrow.  I appealed in this House this morning for leadership in terms of our restaurant and self-service catering facility which must make available to people tomorrow morning sausages, rashers and white and black pudding, thus proving such products can be consumed and are safe.</P>
        <P>I regret what happened at the plant involved, which is a recycling plant and not a food production plant.  I cannot understand why such a plant would be used by beef producers.  I am involved in an organic farm which produces quality products.  We are regularly subjected to on-the-spot inspection by the organic organisation to which we are affiliated.  The products we <Col N="993"/>use are regularly inspected.  While we cannot turn back the clock, we must ensure this is not allowed to happen again.</P>
        <P>Senator John Ellis made a good point in respect of the cost of foodstuffs from abroad, including soya beans, and the big push in this regard.  Years ago, swill was collected from the hospitals.  As far as I recall, this was done on a tender system by big producers.  Pigs always seem to get the worst possible foodstuff and that sector has never been treated respectfully.  What one puts in has a bearing on what one gets out, namely, one must feed quality food to get quality production.  We must all work together to ensure our pig products are returned to the shelves and marketed internationally.  Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Minister, the Taoiseach, the President, Senators and Deputies must work together to push our products and show we have the best food in the world, of which there is no doubt.  Nobody has valued food more than we have.  I thank the Leader for arranging this debate.</P>

I, too, would like more time to debate this matter but, like the Cathaoirleach, I am bound by the orders of the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford asked if the response to this crisis might have been a bit over the top.  The lessons internationally are that it was not.  We know what happens when one tries to offer caveats in response to situations like this.  The Belgians thought they would be able to quietly deal with their crisis.  People are punished if there is a perception that they are in any way trying to avoid taking hard decisions and that punishment is often worse than the pain of the initial response.  The decision made on Saturday was a painful one.  It was one of the most traumatic days of my political career.  The Taoiseach, the Minister and I, with our officials, were forced to face up to the reality of what had to be done to save this sector and to ensure Ireland, the food island, restored its reputation.</P>
        <P>We are dealing with more than 30 countries.  One cannot, when speaking to people in Japan or Singapore, make anything other than black and white, simple statements.  As mentioned earlier, Sky News was dishonest in its broadcast last night which stated there was a dioxin problem with beef, given that there had been no confirmation to that effect.  We must take on board the challenge we have been set to rebrand and relaunch Irish food.  Bord Bia is already doing this and the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, is ready to travel to those markets on which we depend and have served well for many years, and will continue to serve into the future, God willing.  Investment will be needed.  We have engaged in this regard in discussions with the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach.  The investment called for by Senator Bradford will be made.</P>
        <P>I believe EU money is well justified in this instance.  I have for many years insisted that country of origin labelling be established not alone for beef but for all food products.  Given that we do not have in place a requirement in respect of country of origin labelling, the pork about which we are speaking is EU pork, and the EU must, therefore, recognise that.  The Commission insisted it regarded Irish pork as EU pork and it must, therefore, respond to this crisis.  I will be arguing strongly in this regard and I hope and expect a good outcome on the matter.</P><Col N="994"/>
        <P>Senator Coffey spoke about dioxin testing.  Dioxin testing is more complex than PCB testing.  Regardless of where in the world it is done, it takes longer than PCB testing.  When in Backweston I was impressed by the sophistication of the laboratories there.  Techniques have been developed in our laboratories to speed up PCB testing.  We have moved from a two and a half day turn-around to a one day turn-around, which is the norm internationally.  When dioxin testing is up and running, I hope in February, we will have state-of-the-art facilities.  Such testing is expensive, but we have to pay for it.  The cost per test for dioxins is between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,200.  As is the case in many areas, prevention is better than cure.  We do not want to have to deal with this type of situation again and, therefore, we need to take whatever steps are necessary to avoid dioxins getting into the food chain at the start of the process.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>No, absolutely not.  We have been testing, and paying for it, and we have been happy to do so because we need those tests.  I am simply giving Members this information because I am being absolutely honest with them to ensure they are not under any illusion as to what is involved.  It is well worth the money involved.  Our laboratories are sophisticated in dealing with everything other than dioxins, but because dioxins require particular conditions for testing, a state-of-the-art facility is required for such testing, which we are currently accrediting.  It is unfortunate it is not accredited at this point. </P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Carty that the Taoiseach played a decisive role in dealing with this matter.  I compliment him on that, given that his hands-on role was essential in bringing together the Departments of Health and Children, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which needed to be brought together to work closely with each other and they must continue to do so.</P>
        <P>Senators Carty, O&rsquo;Sullivan, Doherty and others mentioned that a producer who had argued that the products were Irish suddenly turned around and said they were not Irish to try to maintain an element of the market.  I hope that kind of cynicism can be seen for what it is.  It highlights the campaign for country of origin labelling which we need to succeed.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn cited important examples from his international experience.  I agree with him that this is not just about the organic producer by a long shot.  As was stated by Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and others, the organic producer has had to jump over many more hurdles than the conventional producer.  They are not allowed to use GM feed, regardless of the price, or many other products, and they have to pay to ensure the quality of their product.  Because of the certification that applies to their products, they are able to get them back on the market because they have got guarantees that other producers cannot give.  The majority of producers should follow hot on their heels in getting back into the market because they have nothing to fear and there is no question of contamination.  That applies to artisan producers and the wider sector.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, is not here because he is fully engaged in discussions to get that process under way.</P>
        <P>Senators mentioned the need for a blitz in marketing, which I take on board.  I heard Joe Duffy on his &ldquo;Lifeline&rdquo; programme say that he is prepared to eat bacon and to urge everybody to eat it.  Perhaps he and a few others can get around the table and give a high profile example by highlighting what is safe, enjoyable and the best of Irish food.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comment that there is an issue in terms of our waste facilities and we need to ensure we do not add to dioxin burden.  However, we should understand and spread the message that we have the lowest dioxin burden in this country because of our traditional location and because we have not had dioxin creating technologies here.  It is ironic that we have a dioxin problem because, traditionally, we are one of the lowest dioxin level countries in the world.  I hope that will continue to be the case.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I appreciate his presence.  This is a Bill to refine the law of evidence.  I preface my introduction of the Bill by stating that Fine Gael is fully committed to upholding respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  That is one of the reasons we have been forceful in trying to ensure that the bodies and authorities in this country which are mandated to uphold human rights here are properly funded.  We believe in a just society, an education system and social supports which give young people a chance in life and ensure that the preconditions exist which would prevent them from, or at least give no encouragement in, going down the route of a life of crime.  We believe in a prison system that is fit for purpose and provides the necessary rehabilitation, drug treatment and educational programmes that give people a second chance and encourages them not to reoffend.</P>
        <P>We also believe in effective policing, an effective prosecution system and a criminal justice system that guarantees a fair trial to the accused.  This Bill is introduced in that context.  It is grounded on considerations of the rights of the accused, the rights of the victims of crime, society&rsquo;s interest in the effective prosecution of criminals and public confidence in the administration of justice.  The Government&rsquo;s programme provides for addressing this issue of the exclusionary rule.</P>
        <P>As regards what is that rule, it is a judge-made rule which deems evidence that is obtained improperly or illegally, in particular where it is obtained contrary to some constitutional right, is automatically deemed inadmissible.  Regardless of the seriousness of the crime, there is a rigidity in this rule, which means that prosecutions are impeded and, in many cases, cannot proceed.  In simple terms, I would call it dismissal of a case on the grounds of a technicality because of this automatic exclusion, even where the breach is, in many cases, not intentional and not that serious.</P>
        <P>The basis for this Bill is also grounded on the fact that we are out of line with other common law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and even the United States, which originally had a rigid rule regarding this issue of admissibility of illegally or improperly obtained evidence.</P>
        <P>This issue has been aired in the courts and various issues have been raised about this rule.  One is that it can be argued that the rule, in its current form, is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In a recent High Court case, the judge considered that a rule <Col N="996"/>providing for the automatic exclusion of evidence obtained in consequence of any mistake that infringes any constitutional right of an accused may be incompatible with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to provide, for both the accused and the community, a fair disposal of criminal charges.  The rule is anachronistic.  It is potentially incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and it is out of line with jurisprudence in other common law jurisdictions.  Moreover, it is a rule that is not mandated by the Constitution.</P>
        <P>The case law in our courts has varied over time but there is a view that the rigidity of that rule should apply.  I attended a criminal law seminar on Saturday and conflicting views were expressed as to whether the exclusionary rule should be amended.  It has been the subject of debate by the balance of the criminal law review group, which also expressed different views.  The merit of changing the role was acknowledged but there is some dispute about how that is done.  I will return to that point later.</P>
        <P>A substantial volume of criminal cases are reduced to arguments of procedure and not substance.  The focus in so many criminal indictments is an attempt by the accused to assert the rights arising from those breaches.  They tend to get elevated to the status of a breach of constitutional right.</P>
        <P>The textbook of Peter Charlton and Paul Anthony McDermott states: &ldquo;In consequence, the rules of substantive criminal law have been either ignored or overlooked in favour of this process.&rdquo;  The right of the accused to have evidence excluded is elevated to an absolute right without other considerations.  The same textbook points out that Article 40.3.1&deg; of the Constitution refers to protecting the personal rights of the citizen, as far as practicable, and protecting those personal rights as best it may from unjust attack.</P>
        <P>There is a reference to a judgment of the Supreme Court, which states that this implies circumstances in which the State may have to balance its protection of the rights as against other obligations arising, having regard to the common good.  In a recent case the High Court made a point that is common jurisprudence, namely, that none of the personal rights of a citizen was unlimited.  The decision of the Oireachtas on the reconciliation of the exercise of personal rights with the common good should prevail unless it was oppressive to some or all the citizens and unless there was no reasonable proportion between the benefit which the legislation would confer on the citizen, or a substantial body of them, and the interference with the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
        <P>The justification for the rigid exclusionary rule is to prevent and minimise abuses by the police or to discipline or penalise it in some way for the breaches arising.  The reality is that all we are doing is penalising society and the accused who may be the subject of the criminal offence in question.  We have a Garda Ombudsman Commission and procedures are in place.  We have learned a lot about how much Garda discipline and behaviour can deteriorate.  However, lessons have been learned and we have established the procedures now in terms of the necessary oversight and discipline.  It is no longer valid to use that as a reason to have this rigid rule.</P>
        <P>It is beyond question that there is a constitutional right to a fair trial.  It is part of our constitutional provisions and it is also part of the European Convention on Human Rights to which the State subscribes.  There is no question that if there are flagrant violations of fundamental rights without any excusing circumstances that can undermine the administration of justice.  However, it is also the case that if an accused is released without the hearing of the evidence, without the opportunity for a jury to consider the evidence or for the judge to give the necessary directions which can ensure there is a fair trial, that also brings into disrepute the administration of justice.  That happens frequently and it is a deterrent, as shown by the <Col N="997"/>examples we have of where that occurs and the cases where the Director of Public Prosecutions may be deterred from taking cases because of some procedural flaw in the collection and prosecution of a case.  In the People (DPP)<i> v</i>. Joseph Dillon it emerged that during the arrest of a person involved in drug dealing a garda answered the accused&rsquo;s mobile telephone when it rang and linked up with and subsequently arrested the person at the other end of the telephone for drug dealing.  That was found to be a legal interception under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act.  Those types of perverse results can arise from the application of this rule.</P>
        <P><?oasys _dc18- ?>To deal with the elements that are necessary to ensure that this is correct, there needs to be a balancing rule and it should be put on a statutory basis as that would bring us into line with the law as is applicable in other jurisdictions and with the European Convention on Human Rights.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The question then is how we do it.  It has been suggested that it may be done by referendum or in ordinary legislation.  I believe it can be done by the latter method.  The Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to deal with this type of legislation nor deemed it unconstitutional.  The Oireachtas passes legislation with some regularity on the rules of evidence.  It is not correct to say that where the Supreme Court deals with issues touching on the Constitution that always creates a constitutional rule which is immune from being the subject of legislation.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court would apply two tests to the legislation.  Article 38.1 states: &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo; and Article 40.3.1&deg; states: &ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.&rdquo;  I suggest that the safeguards in the Bill ensure that the legislation is compatible with those two provisions.  If there is any doubt as to the constitutionality of the legislation it will be referred to the Supreme Court and to the President under Article 26 of the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the Second Reading of the Bill.  I pay tribute to my party colleague, Senator Regan, who drafted the Bill.  It is in the best traditions of this House that Members submit Private Members&rsquo; Bills.  This Bill is timely and relevant.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan introduced the Bill to end the practice of criminals avoiding convictions due to a technicality arising from outdated rules of evidence.  The Bill will end the practice whereby evidence obtained improperly or illegally by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is automatically excluded from criminal trials.  The purpose of the Bill is to abolish the rules of evidence otherwise known as the exclusionary rule.  It provides that evidence obtained by some mistake or oversight by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is automatically deemed inadmissible in trials.  The Bill proposes that admissible or improperly or illegally obtained evidence is decided on the basis of balancing the interests and rights of the accused with the constitutional rights of the victims of crime, the public interest in the prosecution of crime and public confidence in the administration of justice.  As it stands, the exclusionary rule stipulates that evidence obtained by a mistake of one kind or another by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which may have the effect of infringing a constitutional right of an accused individual is automatically deemed inadmissible and excluded from court proceedings.  Due to the automatic exclusion of such evidence, many cases, ranging from drink driving cases to more serious ones, are dismissed on what is generally termed &ldquo;a technicality&rdquo;.  This prevents the effective prosecution of criminals and certainly destroys public confidence in the criminal law system.  Public confidence is the key in that there must be public confidence in our laws and in their administration.  Too often, cases involving drink driving and more serious cases have been deemed inadmissible on the basis of technicalities.</P>
        <P>To formulate a rule of exclusion based on a mere accident deprives the jury of the ability to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused fairly on the basis of all the relevant evidence.  The Bill places the rule of the admissibility of evidence improperly or illegally obtained on a <Col N="998"/>statutory basis and brings it into line with that applicable in other common law jurisdictions, as outlined by Senator Regan.  It is not the function of the criminal courts to discipline police officers by the exclusion of evidence.  As was pointed out, there are mechanisms for dealing with this that involve other agencies, including the Garda Ombudsman Commission, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Crime is rife in Ireland today and the sophistication of crime lords is making it increasingly difficult to ensure the effective prosecution of crime.  The enactment of Senator Regan&rsquo;s Bill will go some way towards ensuring the effective prosecution of criminals while, at the same time, balancing the interests of the accused with those of the victim and society in general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Regan and Cummins for raising this issue.  </P>
        <P>The aim of the Bill before us is to revise the law of evidence in criminal proceedings.  Its particular target is the exclusionary rule of evidence as enunciated by the Supreme Court in its 1990 judgment in the People <i>v.</i> Kenny<i>.  </i>There is no doubt but that the impact of the Kenny judgment on criminal trials has been profound.  While it is not appropriate for me as a member of the Executive to make any comment on the decisions of the Judiciary, I note that Mr. Justice Charleton said in respect of the Cash case of 27 March 2007 that &ldquo;the entire focus is on the accused and his rights; the right of the community to live safely has receded out of view.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The operation of the rule affects not only the ability of the State to sustain prosecutions but also decisions to prosecute in the first instance.  I agree that some relaxation of the rule needs to be considered and, therefore, I have some sympathy for the sentiments in this Bill.  As Senator Regan stated, this view is reflected in An Agreed Programme for Government.  I refer to the relaxation of the rule because I do not believe anyone would argue that all evidence should be admissible irrespective of how it was obtained.  An exclusionary rule of evidence is now a feature of most common law countries and many civil law countries, and public debate centres on the scope of the rule rather than on the need for it.  It is in this context that I welcome this Bill as a contribution to the ongoing debate on this issue.  However, agreeing that the rule requires change is the easy part; it is a little more difficult to determine how that change is to be brought about.</P>
        <P>Before commenting on the course of action proposed by this Bill or its detail, it would be useful to set out briefly how the current state of the law has come about.  The origin of the rule has a direct bearing on how it might be changed.  The rule in its current form was set out by the Supreme Court in the case of the People <i>v.</i> O&rsquo;Brien in 1965.  The facts of that case, a larceny case, are well known.  The evidence against the two accused was obtained on foot of a search warrant which contained an error in respect of the address to be searched.  The warrant referred to &ldquo;118 Cashel Road, Crumlin&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;118 Captain&rsquo;s Road, Crumlin&rdquo;, a minor error that appeared to go unnoticed by the garda&iacute; executing the warrant.  The rule applied by the Supreme Court in concluding that the evidence obtained on foot of the warrant had been properly admitted was that evidence obtained as a result of the conscious and deliberate violation of the accused&rsquo;s constitutional rights is not admissible as evidence, unless there are extraordinary excusing circumstances.  This remains the case today.</P>
        <P>The Kenny case in 1990 gave us the present interpretation of the words &ldquo;conscious and deliberate&rdquo;.  That interpretation is at the core of the debate on this rule.  This case, like the O&rsquo;Brien case, also concerned the lawfulness of a search conducted on the basis of an invalid warrant.  The error in this case was on the part of a peace commissioner.  In the Kenny case, the Supreme Court held that the words &ldquo;conscious and deliberate&rdquo; qualified the actions of the garda rather than his state of mind in respect of the lawfulness of the search.</P><Col N="999"/>
        <P>The court based its interpretation of the rule on the constitutional obligation on the State to defend and, as far as practicable, vindicate the personal rights of citizens and on the constitutional right to a trial in due course of law.  Therefore, the rule in its current form appears to be constitutionally based.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us this evening seeks to abolish this rule and replace it with a statutory rule.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill, in particular, appear to be premised on the proposition that it is possible to modify by statute the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Kenny case.  I am advised that such a course of action is constitutionally very doubtful.  We must bear in mind that the provisions of the Constitution may be amended only by means of a decision of the people in a referendum.</P>
        <P>As the House will be aware, this issue was very helpfully examined by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group established by my predecessor and chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan, senior counsel.  Its report was probably the first document I read when I took office in this Ministry.  The chairman dissented on the question of amending the rule in any way but the remainder of the group took a cautious view in regard to how the issue should be addressed.  The majority indicated they would wish to see circumstances in which &ldquo;the court would have a discretion to admit unconstitutionally obtained evidence or not, having regard to the totality of the circumstances and in particular the rights of the victim.&rdquo;  Essentially, the group recommended that, initially at least, the powers vested in the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 should be utilised, where appropriate, to refer the question back to the Supreme Court.  Prior to the coming into force of section 21 of the 2006 Act on 1 August 2006, the director did not have any legal avenue to have the issue revisited by the Supreme Court.  That section inserts a new section 34 in the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, which now provides such an avenue.  A decision of a trial judge to exclude evidence on the basis of the decision in the Kenny case may now, in the event of an acquittal, be the subject of a reference to the Supreme Court.  The decision as to whether such a referral should be made is a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
        <P>I understand the sense of frustration that prompted this Bill.  However, it is my firm view that, before this House embarks on a constitutionally suspect course of action, other options should be exhausted.  In particular, time should be allowed for the counter arguments to the Kenny case to be ventilated before the Supreme Court in a suitable case.  I believe there are strong arguments in favour of a recalibration of the exclusionary rule, including the failure of the rule to allow the trial judge to weigh the public interest in ensuring that constitutional rights are protected by the agents of the State as against the public interest, in ensuring that crime is detected and punished and that the constitutional rights of victims are vindicated by the courts.  This is a compelling argument for a relaxation of the rule, as is the failure of the rule to take into account whether the defect that occurred was caused by factors outside the control of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and whether its members acted in good faith.  A further argument is that the consequences flowing from the application of the rule, the unjust acquittal of the accused, is often out of all proportion to the trivial nature of the breach of the accused&rsquo;s rights in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In setting out these arguments against the rule as interpreted in the Kenny case, it is not my intention to diminish the principles underpinning the rule.  Clearly, breaches of the constitutional rights of the accused must be treated seriously and sloppy police practices must not be tolerated.  It is my view however, that a modified rule which would encompass a &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; exception or which would allow the trial judge to weigh the rights of the community at large and that of the victim against the rights of the accused, would continue to ensure that the guaranteed rights of the accused are treated seriously.  It must also be recalled that changes in the operational practices of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na such as the video-recording of interviews <Col N="1000"/>with suspects and, of course, as Senator Regan said, the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, make the strict exclusionary rule less relevant as a protection against sloppy police work.  As I said, my preference is that time be allowed for these arguments to be ventilated before the Supreme Court in a suitable case.  I made my views in this regard known, in July this year, to the Attorney General who, I understand, in the context of the statutory consultations which take place from time to time between the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and permitted by section 2(6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974, raised this matter in September.</P>
        <P>I understand that the DPP is very conscious of the benefits of identifying cases in which the scope of the decision in the Kenny case can be argued so as to clarify the circumstances in which the rule applies.  While the lodging of an appeal in any individual case is, of course, solely a matter for the DPP and appeals can take some time to be heard and adjudicated on, I believe this course of action should be allowed time to come to fruition.  In the event that the arguments are put to the Supreme Court and it takes the opportunity to reaffirm the court&rsquo;s analysis in the Kenny case, we will need to think again and look at other options.</P>
        <P>I have focused thus far on the overall aim of the Bill which, as I said, is constitutionally doubtful.  There are, however, numerous defects in the drafting of the Bill which, were it not for this fundamental flaw, would make it unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Section 2 defines &ldquo;improperly or illegally obtained evidence&rdquo; as evidence which is obtained by the Garda or other law enforcement agency in a manner which breaches an accused&rsquo;s rights which exist under or derive from common law, statutory criminal law or the Constitution.  The section fails to distinguish between illegally obtained evidence and unconstitutionally obtained evidence.  The strict exclusionary rule as enunciated in the Kenny case applies only to unconstitutionally obtained evidence &mdash; if unlawfully obtained evidence does not fall to be excluded under the Kenny test, the court has the discretion whether to allow the evidence to be admitted.</P>
        <P>Section 3<b> </b>seeks to abolish the exclusionary rule &ldquo;whereby improperly or illegally obtained evidence, which may amount to a breach of the constitutional rights of the accused, is automatically excluded from criminal proceedings&rdquo;.  This is not an accurate reflection of the exclusionary rule as enunciated in the Kenny case and applied by the courts.  As I stated, unlawfully obtained evidence is admitted at the discretion of the courts.  In circumstances where the court finds that evidence has been obtained in breach of the constitutional rights of the accused, the evidence may be admitted if the court considers that extraordinary excusing circumstances exist.  While it is the case, as I have outlined, that the rule as set out by our courts is strict, it is not so strict as to require the automatic exclusion of evidence.</P>
        <P>Section 4 requires the court, when determining the admissibility of improperly or illegally obtained evidence in criminal proceedings, to conduct a balancing exercise as between the rights of the accused, the constitutional rights of the victim of crime, including the right to life, bodily integrity and property, the public interest in the prosecution of crime and the public interest in the administration of justice.  The section specifically provides for the constitutional rights of the victim but does not specify similar rights for the accused.  This is a serious omission.  Any attempt to modify the exclusionary rule must recognise the constitutional rights of the accused.</P>
        <P>Section 5<b> </b>presents a number of difficulties.  For example, paragraph (<i>c</i>) suggests that the seriousness of the crime with which the accused is charged is an appropriate factor to be taken into account by the court in determining the admissibility of evidence obtained illegally or improperly.  In differentiating between crimes of varying severity, this paragraph appears to conflict with Article 40.1 of the Constitution which guarantees that &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human <Col N="1001"/>persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;  Indeed, such a provision could arguably encourage double standards by the Garda in gathering evidence.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that where it has been found that evidence was improperly or illegally obtained by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a court may, where it is appropriate, refer the matter for investigation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I am doubtful about the usefulness of this proposal.  The Ombudsman Commission already has, under section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, a discretionary power to investigate any matter that appears to indicate that a garda may have either committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  A complaint is not needed.  Second, the Minister of the day can also refer any such matter to the commission.</P>
        <P>These are just some of the difficulties with the Bill as drafted.  They by no means constitute a complete list.  To sum up, this Bill is based on a very shaky premise, that legislation can abolish a rule derived from the Constitution.  My strong advice is that this is constitutionally suspect.  In view of this, I am inclined to wait to see whether the new legal avenue opened up by the Criminal Justice Act 2006 will allow the counter arguments to the Kenny judgment to be ventilated before the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>I urge Senators to oppose this Bill, but I genuinely accept the sentiment and the bona fides under which Senator Regan brought it forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose, with the leave of the House, to share time with Senator Norris, who will take one minute at the end of my speech. </P>
        <P>First, as a practising criminal barrister who has argued some of these issues before the courts, I declare my interest in this.  I welcome the opportunity to argue in this debate and I welcome the Minister.  While the Bill may appear somewhat technical in terms of its subject matter, this is a very important issue, as other speakers said.  Indeed, there is an ongoing debate, as Senator Regan said, among criminal practitioners in particular and among those with an interest in the criminal justice system, about the nature of the exclusionary rule.  I spoke at conferences on this issue.  A seminar was held at the weekend in Trinity College Law School on the criminal justice system and recent developments, at which the exclusionary rule was discussed &mdash; Senator Regan referred to the fact that I was one of its organisers.</P>
        <P>The balance in the criminal law review group in March 2007, to which the Minister and Senator Regan referred, took a comprehensive look at the working of the rule.  I am grateful to Senator Regan for raising the issue, but I cannot support his Bill.  I share the Minister&rsquo;s views on the flaws in drafting of the Bill.  However, there are a number of other fundamental points and I will make those.</P>
        <P>As the Minister said and the balance in the criminal law review group made clear, this Bill would be unconstitutional.  Not alone did the chair of the review group, Dr. Gerard Hogan, dissent from the majority on the exclusionary rule and take the view that any legislative approach to change it would be unconstitutional, the majority of the group took the view that a &ldquo;full frontal&rdquo; assault through legislation on the exclusionary rule &ldquo;would be likely to be held to be unconstitutional&rdquo;.  I am quoting from page 162 of the report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Supreme Court is due to revisit this issue in the appeal of the Cash case, already referred to.  That is the judgment in DPP (Walsh) <i>v.</i> Cash, a High Court judgment given by Mr. Justice Charlton on 28 March 2007.  A Supreme Court appeal is due in that regard.  To go to the substance of the Bill, it is too absolutist in its tone and mistakes the current rule.  This is an exclusionary rule, as set out in The People <i>v.</i> O&rsquo;Brien, as modified in The People <i>v.</i> Kenny, but not, as the Bill states, a rule that operates automatically to exclude in all circumstances.  The Kenny case, although it has been construed as being utterly strict, allows for modification. <Col N="1002"/> I am indebted to Dr. Yvonne Daly of Dublin City University, who delivered a very useful paper on this at the weekend seminar.  As she pointed out and as the Minister said in his speech, the discretionary rule as adopted in the O&rsquo;Brien case and later in the Kenny case allows a judge, where evidence has been obtained illegally, to take into account varying issues when determining its admissibility.  A different and stricter rule applies to unconstitutionally obtained evidence.  Any evidence obtained in breach of constitutional rights must be excluded, unless it can be shown there were extraordinary excusing circumstances in existence.  Even in its stricter sense, therefore, it is not an absolute rule.</P>
        <P>The courts have modified the rules somewhat over the years.  Both the case of DPP <i>v.</i> Buck in 2002 and the case this year of DPP <i>v.</i> A.D., in which Mr. Justice Finnegan made a judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal, show that where there has been a breach &mdash; in both cases a solicitor had not been obtained for an accused under detention and being interviewed in a Garda station &mdash; there must be a causative link between the breach of constitutional rights and the making of the incriminating statement for the statement to be excluded.  Therefore, there are modifications to the rule.</P>
        <P>The case of Dillon, which is usually cited by those seeking to overturn or abolish the exclusionary rule, has been widely misinterpreted.  I reread the judgment made by Mr. Justice Hardiman of 20 December 2002 again today.  Senator Regan gave the facts of this case already.  The Dillon case turned on the fact that garda&iacute; in intercepting a phone call &mdash; as found by the Court of Criminal Appeal &mdash; were carrying out the offence of interception as defined in section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act 1983.  Garda&iacute; were carrying out an illegal action in intercepting the phone call.  The Court of Criminal Appeal therefore found the evidence obtained through that interception could only be admissible if there were extraordinary excusing circumstances because not alone was it an illegal interception, it also amounted to a breach of the constitutional right of privacy.</P>
        <P>However, the Court of Criminal Appeal said it could not decide the issue whether there were extraordinary excusing circumstances because the trial judge had found that the act of the garda taking the phone call had not amounted to interception under the 1983 Act.  That may sound highly technical, but it was not as clear cut a case as the court simply saying this was unconstitutionally obtained evidence and therefore could not be admitted.  There were a number of steps that could have been taken and the evidence could have been admitted at trial had the trial judge found that the evidence was obtained either through illegal or unconstitutional means.  The other issue to note about the Dillon case is that the sentence had already been served by the accused.  The Court of Criminal Appeal mentioned this at the end.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed Bill, one would be very wary of taking on a Bill that is constitutionally suspect or that purports to abolish outright a rule that has been developed and refined by the courts and that is more nuanced than is often understood.  Also, while much has been said about the way in which the rule operates here &mdash; it is more absolute than in other common law jurisdictions &mdash; it must be said that in Ireland we have a much more absolute position on the other side of the scale also, in that we allow people to be convicted on the basis of secret evidence, the evidence of informers and the opinions of chief superintendents, particularly in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>Balance in the criminal law does not always go the one way.  I am of the view that the rights of victims should be given greater priority within our criminal justice system and there has been a move towards that generally, but in the context of the exclusionary rule, I would have to agree with Dr. Gerard Hogan, the chair of the balance in the criminal law review group, when he points out that the rule was developed not just to discipline garda&iacute; or stop them from abusing their powers, but to protect the constitutional rights of individuals.  He points out that <Col N="1003"/>the development of the exclusionary rule has been the logical corollary of a series of interlocking constitutional provisions.  If we value the fundamental protections in our Constitution, we cannot seek to abolish or undermine so thoroughly this rule.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is important the Seanad plays its role in introducing legislation.  When I introduced a Bill some four years ago, that was very unusual, but we have had a flurry of Bills introduced in the House and this shows political energy.  While I compliment Senator Regan on introducing the Bill, the Minister was persuasive when he listed five principle sections of the legislation he felt did not meet the strict requirements of legislation because they were flawed in one way or another, either because of legal technicalities or constitutional matters.</P>
        <P>The reason I asked for a minute of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s time was because I am concerned about this.  First, it is a question of professional standards.  I do not believe an amendment to the legislation should be used to excuse a lack of professional standards on the part of garda&iacute;.  If they made a mistake, that is fine and they must live with it.  It is important to establish professionalism, and not just in this country.  For example, in the OJ Simpson case, the chain of custody of the evidence was impugned.  That was a mistake and it was quite right it was highlighted.</P>
        <P>I feel the old saw &mdash; I am not sure whether this saw comes from European, American, British, European or Irish law &mdash; &ldquo;The fruit of the rotten tree is always suspect&rdquo; is right.  If it is a rotten tree, its fruit should be suspect, subject to the kind of considerations that were put on the record so ably by Senator Bacik.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that would concern me in particular is not telephone bugging.  My telephone has been bugged, but it was impossible to do anything about it at that stage.  I asked Mary Robinson to get involved, but I lived with it.  There is something much worse than telephone bugging.  It should be remembered we collaborated with the Americans during the rendition period.  They, our democratic allies, extracted information from people under torture.  The information obtained was found to be so rotten and lousy, it was unusable in most instances.  The obtaining of it was a violation of decency.  Evidence extracted under torture should never be allowed.  Although the British claimed they did not participate actively in this practice, they were perfectly happy to use the fruit of the rotten tree.  I never want to see that happen in this jurisdiction.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the introduction of the Bill by Senator Regan.

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Regan on the personal effort he has put into this Bill.  The Minister was complimentary in acknowledging the thrust of what the Senator is endeavouring to achieve through the Bill and I am glad he will now have a close look at the issue to see what can be achieved.  I accept the point made by the Minister and by the committee chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan who is probably the main constitutional lawyer in the country. <Col N="1004"/> It appears that among the legal eagles there is a doubt whether legislation <i>per se</i> can overturn or uproot a constitutional rule of evidence that has evolved since approximately 1965.</P>
        <P>I commend Members of the Opposition, such as Senator Regan, who introduce Bills in the House.  Back in 1996 when the current Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, was in Opposition, he produced a Bill that was not accepted by the Minister of the time, Nora Owen.  However, within 12 months or less, the coalition Government revisited the issue and the upshot was the creation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue would probably claim his prints are on that particular legislation.  I have no doubt, therefore, that when this issue is revisited, that Senator Regan will be able to claim he, by bringing this Bill before the House, introduced a springboard or catalyst to move the issue forward.  This must be acknowledged and appreciated.</P>
        <P>However, if one considers this rule&rsquo;s history, and I am inclined to bow to the strong knowledge evinced in this regard by my colleague, Senator Bacik, it is certain that legislation introduced by the Oireachtas on a rule that has evolved through the courts all the way to the Supreme Court cannot of itself reverse the Supreme Court&rsquo;s thinking.  As the Minister noted, my fear is that were such a Bill simply passed in the Oireachtas, the constitutionality of which inevitably would be tested in the courts, it might simply be thrown back in Members&rsquo; faces, which would put back by another decade the work Senator Regan and others are trying to do.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I am greatly interested in the remarks of the High Court judge last year in a case that may end up in the Supreme Court.  Senator Bacik mentioned its name which now evades me.</P>

	<P>The DPP (Walsh) <i>v.</i> Cash case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  My understanding of the judge&rsquo;s remarks, when put in layperson&rsquo;s terms, is that he was deeply concerned that a balance on this rule was not being achieved.  In other words, he expressed a strong view in this case and regardless of whether one can call it <i>obiter dictum</i>, any view of an eminent judge in this regard must be taken on board.</P>
        <P>I also was interested to note the Director of Public Prosecutions and Attorney General are putting their heads together and may be considering possible other test cases that could be taken before the courts.  While I do not believe the Kenny judgment will be completely reversed, it certainly can be ameliorated &mdash; &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; would be the wrong term &mdash; and the legislation subsequently could be applied.  I believe that Members are treading on difficult ground in that the Oireachtas is being asked by simple legislation to overturn and reverse the Kenny decision which has evolved and has been supported.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, the thrust of what Senator Regan is doing under this Bill appears to be going in the right direction.  Undoubtedly, in many serious cases, including some involving murder or drugs trafficking, for whatever constitutional or other reason, when evidence sometimes is stumbled upon, such cases are being thrown out by way of a technicality.  I have been a practising solicitor for many years and when I started out in the late 1970s and early 1980s, if a defendant was up for an offence such as drunk driving, which now is a serious offence, or for having bald tyres and the incorrect townland name was put on the summons, the case would be thrown out.  However, matters have changed arising from jurisprudence, thinking by lawyers and changes in laws, including the famous case of Duggan <i>v.</i> Evans.  Thereafter, if the townland in which the defendant lived was spelled incorrectly or his or her car registration was spelled as HIN 242 instead of HIN 224, this was deemed to be technical.  In other words, the Duggan <i>v.</i> Evans case had huge positive repercussions in the operation of the District Courts because <Col N="1005"/>simple frivolous mistakes could be amended.  A superintendent or the prosecution in the form of the State solicitor could ask the court to make such an amendment.  Apparently this cannot be done in this case.</P>
        <P>Given my position in the House as Government spokesman, I will oppose and vote against the Second Reading of the Bill.  Nevertheless, I record my admiration for what Senator Regan has done.  This issue cannot be ignored and Members do so at their peril.  This matter must be seriously considered, whether through constitutional means, better jurisprudence or better laws.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend the Fine Gael Senators on introducing this Bill to the House.  It shows their concern for the criminal justice system and their knowledge that it is facing incredible pressures at every level.  The Labour Party supports their well-intentioned motives which are firmly directed at improving the lot of the innocent in society and the victims of crime.  While I wish to address specific aspects of the Bill in the broader context of crime and safety in our communities, I wish to discuss the Bill&rsquo;s contents first.</P>
        <P>Elements of this Bill are indisputable.  For example, it is indisputable that Members&rsquo; responsibility as legislators centres firmly on the victims of crime and not the criminal.  This Bill rightly addresses the potential for a public crisis of confidence in our judicial system should criminals and those who prey on innocent members of society continue to exploit the system through technicalities and bureaucratic red tape.  There is much Members can debate in this Bill.  For instance, while the Labour Party Members commend the well-intentioned motives of the Bill, they suggest there may be other more appropriate ways that could be used to ameliorate the current position.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, the exclusionary rule can hurt victims, marginalise the innocent and embolden criminals.  Undoubtedly, it is undesirable that Irish law is out of step with so many other countries.  It is at the root of this discord that I find cause to have concern for the direction in which this Bill would take us.  The exclusionary rule came about from a judicial ruling which has since caused or contributed to the collapse of numerous trials that might otherwise have been able to continue, some of which have been mentioned by other Members during the debate.  However, there is a danger that this Bill simply will swap one form of judicial activism for another by bestowing discretionary powers on a judge who may or may not deem evidence admissible in court.</P>
        <P>The Bill sets out a number of criteria for the examination of evidence that previously might have fallen under the exclusionary rule.  These include whether the obtaining of the evidence was a mere mistake as opposed to a deliberate violation of rights; whether the breach was serious or merely technical in nature; the seriousness of the alleged crime committed; and the effect on the administration of justice of including or excluding the evidence.  While there are other criteria, those four examples provide a clear picture of the kind of territory to which this Bill would take us.  While it is inexcusable that important trials are being hamstrung and are in danger of collapse by virtue of the exclusionary rule, the criteria for the inclusion of evidence, as outlined in this Bill, are not the answer.</P>
        <P>Although I agree that this aspect of the criminal law mechanism requires reform, outsourcing discretionary powers of interpretation, literally on a case by case basis, is not an appropriate response.  If enacted, such a Bill doubtless would present a brand new set of challenges and delays.  Who is to say these criteria for inclusion could not be challenged, thereby setting back countless trials and leaving us with an equally flawed variation of the same system?  If the criteria cannot be challenged, should Members not be at least slightly uncomfortable with the provision of such broad discretionary powers?</P><Col N="1006"/>
        <P>It is questionable whether a top-down approach as outlined in this Bill will redress the fundamental problem of crime in our society.  While we must address imbalance in the judicial scales in our courts, first it is essential to get the balance right on the streets.  The Bill implies the Garda is under pressure, the victim of too much bureaucracy, and struggles to do its job, and I absolutely agree.  While judicial reform is vital, the way to redress the broader issues of making our country safer is not by tinkering at the top but by investing on the ground.  Resources must be refocused at street level.  In recent weeks Members have seen the spectacle of members of the Garda assaulted and badly beaten on the streets of towns such as Clonmel as well as the capital city.  How can one expect optimal performance from those on the ground while the Government resolutely fails to provide the necessary investment in front-line police services?</P>
        <P>At local level, the Garda must be supported and facilitated in its efforts to reassert its affinity and connection with regional communities.  However, any local newspaper from anywhere will contain stories of petty crime, vandalism, violence and intimidation.  These are not the horrific stories that are published in the Sunday newspapers or that are reported on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;.  However, they occur in every town and village and such incidents cause enormous concern and unease among local residents.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Rectifying the absence of sufficient numbers of garda&iacute; surely is a first step towards addressing such issues and the provision of proper facilities for garda&iacute; within their local community also is vital.  That is why previous commitments on Garda stations need to be honoured.  For instance, the failure of the Minister to provide new accommodation in places like Laytown, where premises have been promised on numerous occasions in the past, will not help policing in that area.  Neither will the policy of opening Garda stations for only short periods during the day, particularly in commuter towns such as Dunboyne, from where people work in the capital for most of the day and, as a result, rarely get the chance to visit the Garda station.  We need to start from the bottom up, rather than from the top down.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House rightly points out that Ireland is out of step with other countries on the issue of admissible evidence.  However, Ireland is also at odds with international best practice in other areas where my party thinks reform is needed sooner, such as specialist drugs courts to tackle the resurgent illegal drug crisis and legislation on joy-riding which affects many communities, not only across Dublin but across other cities and towns also.  We need such legislation sooner than perhaps legislation such as that outlined in this Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we invest in the front line, we will rebalance the burden of fear from the innocent law-abiding member of society to the drug-pusher, the joy-rider, the gang and the murderer.  We must push forward a rational and coherent system of justice and policing in order that those who display a disregard for the innocent in society can be dealt with quickly, efficiently and to the full extent of the law.</P>
        <P>I commend Fine Gael&rsquo;s commitment to solution-based politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il promised us zero tolerance, but what we got was zero action and zero competence.  It is incumbent on us all to work together to put forward a coherent and strategic set of proposals, fit for purpose and fit for a modern Ireland.  We welcome the opportunity today to have this debate, although we regret we cannot support the Bill.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach um thr&aacute;thn&oacute;na chun an Bille t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  I listened with interest to the debate and, in particular, to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the legislation which is before the House.</P><Col N="1007"/>
        <P>I note that the Kenny judgment has had a fairly profound impact on the administration of the justice system but the Minister&rsquo;s quotation from Mr. Justice Charlton was fairly pertinent.  It states,&ldquo;the entire focus is on the accused and his rights; the rights of the community to live safely has receded out of view&rdquo;.  Many of us in this House would share those sentiments.  Over the years we have had many debates on the criminal justice system and there is a strong sense, which I would certainly have detected among Members and which is also evident among the public, that there is a need for rebalancing in terms of where we have gone with the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>Obviously, nobody wants to encounter situations where there has been a travesty within the system where innocent people are found guilty and are incarcerated.  Therefore, the rights of those who come before the courts must be vindicated.  However, the public, and indeed victims, often feel their human rights are not up in lights, not to mention getting equal recognition within the legal system.</P>
        <P>We have seen many examples of people being released from prosecution on technicalities, which is neither desirable nor acceptable.  In this instance, there is a clear distinction between constitutional rights which are enshrined by the people in the document which governs all of our laws and to which all laws are subject, and that is appropriate and as it should be.  However, if we roll back where we stand with criminality, there is a real need to ensure that people who engage in such activity must face the rigours of the law and must, where they have been heavily involved in serious crime, pay due recompense to society for those crimes.</P>
        <P>Even in minor areas of law I have seen solicitors who can cleverly and intelligently use mechanisms, and perhaps contradictions, within the law to have clients exonerated or released from facing sentences or fines.  From speaking to many in the legal profession, I am aware that there are certain judges who indulge this.  I can understand, if one is on the bench for a number of hours hearing all these hard cases, that when somebody engages one&rsquo;s intellect on different points of law it must be tempting to engage in the process.  However, doing so has sometimes given rise to public confidence in the system being put at risk.  It can also be soul-destroying to garda&iacute; who perhaps have put much time, effort and energy into preparing and compiling evidence and presenting their cases to find that on a technicality they are thrown out, despite all of their hard work.  To some extent, that makes a mockery of the system.</P>
        <P>This Bill seeks to abolish the exclusionary rule of evidence in criminal proceedings, and particularly where that would be obtained in contravention of an accused&rsquo;s constitutional right.  I think it is accepted by all that such is not feasible and is not desirable without looking to a change in the Constitution, and the people deciding on that.</P>
        <P>I have met people, even in recent times, who have been engaged as witnesses in serious criminal cases  who subsequently said to me that they came away totally disillusioned, having spent a number of days listening to the cases in the Circuit Court.  They said it was like a game being played out between lawyers and had nothing to do with the administration of justice.  Senior members of the legal profession have also said to me that if one wants justice, one should not go to court &mdash; that is not what it is about.  It is about the interpretation of the law and that is all one will get.  Perhaps we need to examine that.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, who is a eminent member of the legal profession, would probably have a more educated view on the matter than I have.  I wonder whether our common law system, with its adversarial approach, is as good as the French model which is based on a more inquisitorial approach.</P>
        <P>I have been a long-time critic of the exorbitant and unjustified legal fees, which do much to bring the entire system into disrepute.  I am amazed the issue has not been tackled by some Government and, more vigorously, by the Competition Authority.  I know there is a report on <Col N="1008"/>competition within the legal profession which has not been acted on yet by Government but there is a need to do that.</P>
        <P>There is also a need for a judicial council, although I know work is being done in that area.  Nobody in a Republic should be above the law.  In other jurisdictions there is peer accountability.  It is essential that the separation of powers of the Judiciary from the Executive be maintained and undiluted, but that does not mean people should not be accountable to a body of their own peers, and that needs to be done.</P>
        <P>Members of this House spent long hours over weeks and months on the Judge Curtin case.  That case involved a judge charged with an offence which was not pursued on the basis of a technicality &mdash; a wrong date on a warrant.  That is the kind of technicality which we should be trying to eradicate from the system.</P>
        <P>On the Kenny judgment, this comes back again to judges&rsquo; interpretation of the Supreme Court decision.  The strict interpretation does not seem to distinguish between genuine errors in the collection of evidence and the state of mind of the Garda in question.  These distinguishing issues should be part of the adjudication of a lower court.  While I agree with the report of the review group that any legislation introduced to overcome or abolish the Kenny judgment would be unconstitutional, it is essential for the sake of public confidence in the effective and fair administration of justice that the exploitation of legal technicalities is prevented.  The spirit of the Bill proceeds in that direction and we should attempt to resolve the problem either through a constitutional referendum or in legislation.</P>

	<P>As someone with no legal training, I will have to stick with the plain English school of thought.  I was fascinated by the arguments made by Senators who have expertise in this area.  The problem remains, however, that people are not satisfied the courts are acting properly.  I would have liked solutions from the Minister but he seems to prefer doing nothing until the Kenny judgment is tested in the Supreme Court.  If a constitutional issue arises, we will already be holding one referendum at some stage in 2009 and could hold a second referendum on the same day.</P>
        <P>When members of the medical profession are presented with a problem, we do not go into a room to argue about it or say we have an idea what could happen but the patient will die.  We try to get to the nub of the problem.  I do not see that attitude from the Government in terms of presenting legislation to this House.  In recent years, a number of changes have been made in the area of criminal law.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, was constantly bringing legislation before the D&aacute;il.  It was almost impossible to keep up with him because he rammed Bills through at an unbelievable rate.  Has the Minister plans to bring legislation before the Seanad to address some of the problems he identified earlier?  Can we amend legislation or is a referendum necessary?  It is important we get this right.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We could discuss these matters for hours on end but our voters are being driven crazy by the low level harassment they are experiencing in their communities.  People are creating trouble in housing estates throughout the country.  I have experienced incidents in which people have driven up to my house only to turn around as soon as they saw me.  Organised crime has gone completely out of control over the past decade.  All the people want are solutions to their concerns.  They do not want us to waffle about judgments and constitutional issues.  That should be the basis of our discussion.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation in this area?  He identified the mistakes but has he plans to address them?  Is he prepared to act on constitutional issues?  The law reform group which considered this issue has not stated that matters should be left as they are.  It <Col N="1009"/>acknowledged that something can be done.  I would like to learn whether a solution is possible because this debate seems to concern the process rather than the facts.  Court cases often contain a certain element of pantomime and grandstanding.  Perhaps the process is emphasised because the facts are not crystal clear.  Spurious arguments can be made to sow doubt and win cases.</P>
        <P>This legislation was introduced in the spirit of protecting citizens.  Ordinary citizens and victims are not getting a fair deal in our courts at present and the criminals are making a mockery of the justice system.  It is believed that those who have no interest in society are able to manipulate the law to their own ends.  We should not be complacent when we hear people speak of vigilantism or taking the law into their own hands because I can see their frustration.</P>
        <P>We should decide whether changes can be made to legislation to address these problems and weigh up the pros and cons of making constitutional changes.  We do not need another review group.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate whether he is prepared to act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator Regan on producing this Bill.  As someone who has introduced Bills in both Houses, I recognise that legislation should come from Members on all sides.  It is regrettable that the majority of legislation we pass comes from the Government.  In drafting this Bill, the Senator has made the case for investigating this area.  The Minister indicated the issues arising are being considered on an ongoing basis and he hopes to test the current legislation in this regard.  He is prepared also to introduce amending legislation if it becomes necessary to do so.</P>
        <P>I would diverge from Senator Regan on the text of the Bill, however.  It appears to come from the perspective that if only everyone was on our side, we would get everything right.  We took a similar approach with the Lisbon treaty by believing that if we had changed the rules on how the people should have been informed, we would have got the right answer.</P>
        <P>Crime is obviously a cause of concern for the public.  It is important to address the issue of jurisprudence to ensure society and the rights of the accused are protected.  One of the central problems of the Bill is the impression it gives that evidence is proof.  Evidence can become proof if it is accepted by a judge and jury, but it is only part of the background story and extenuating circumstances that may be used to prove a point.  If a conviction ensues, the evidence is genuine but if the evidence is flawed in terms of how it is obtained or its constitutionality, it undermines the process.  There is a need to be careful in how we proceed down this road.  We must ensure public concerns are addressed and that the justice system is fair to all our citizens.  One of the possible consequences of rushing into legislation like this &mdash; although not necessarily this Bill &mdash; is to condone sloppy practices in judicial and legal enforcement.  That point has been already made by Senator Norris in this debate.  On those grounds we must move very slowly.</P>
        <P>The idea of common and constitutional law is that it is not created in an instant; it is not reactive.  The examples cited relating to our last Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform show that we should not legislate on such a basis.  I was a Member of a D&aacute;il that saw significant pieces of legislation being presented in draft form which were dissimilar in form and content from what was eventually agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was legislation on the hoof that we could be coming back to time and again.</P>

	<P>It was more like a machete taken to legislation going through the House.  That is another argument.  This is the reason we must be slow, careful and cautious about <Col N="1010"/>legislation of this type.  Public concern about serious crime must be addressed and we should have confidence in our system of law enforcement and judicial behaviour.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, there have been incidents where there has been a propensity to take shortcuts, although they have been small in scale and have been responded to by the formation of bodies such as the Office of the Garda Ombudsman.  There has been a willingness to create what is being presented as evidence to secure particular convictions that have not been evidenced and are certainly not in proof.  They have been unfortunate in compromising people in being convicted for crimes with which they probably were not involved.</P>
        <P>It is not enough to have a suspicion or vague hope in that regard.  In a democratic system we need both a constitutional and legal basis which allows people to go through our legal system and be sure they are being judged on the basis of properly obtained proof that would secure a sound conviction.</P>
        <P>That is not what Senator Regan is trying to achieve in his Bill.  He speaks of technicalities, different interpretation and looking at some of the more obvious issues coming through the system such as wrong dates or addresses.  There may be some classes of case, such as drink-driving, that are relevant because of badly drafted legislation.  That last instance is one of the reasons we should move very slowly in this area.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been produced with the best intentions but I am most concerned about having the Bill challenged by the President through the Council of State to test its constitutionality.  To even suggest this in a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas is constitutionally unsound in itself.  It is a decision for the President to convene the Council of State and such a call would be made as appropriate.  To suggest an issue might be open to a debate on constitutionality is not for any debate in this House or any piece of legislation presented to the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the tabling of the Bill and accept its good intentions.  I accept much of what it is trying to achieve will be addressed in future legislation.  This Bill, as it is framed, is not the vehicle to do so and the contribution made by the Minister this evening gave us sufficient grounds for us not to allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House.  Senator Regan deserves great credit from all of us for having drafted this legislation.  As a layman I know nothing of the niceties of criminal law but as legislators all of us are concerned with the greater good and protection of society.  It is our prime duty.</P>
        <P>Given our spiralling crime rate and increasing gun culture, as evidenced by too many appalling and tragic happenings, particularly in our cities, this Bill must be welcomed.  The Bill, as the memorandum makes clear, proposes to abolish the rule of evidence which has become known as the exclusionary rule.  That is a judge-made rule, as Senator Regan has already told us, which has the effect of ruling out evidence offered in a criminal trial which may have been obtained by a mistake of one kind or another by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other law enforcement agencies.  It may have the effect of infringing a constitutional right of an accused.  I hasten to add that nobody wants to infringe anybody&rsquo;s constitutional rights.</P>
        <P>Any breach of procedure by the garda&iacute; or an investigatory agency is regarded as an infringement of the accused&rsquo;s constitutional rights.  As a result of this many serious cases are dismissed on what can best be described as a technicality.  Unfortunately this prevents the effective prosecution of crime and is destroying public confidence in our criminal law system.  How often do we hear complaints from members of the public of cases that fail or fall for what is often correctly seen as a frivolous reason?</P><Col N="1011"/>
        <P>We should not consider the rights of the accused as being absolute to the detriment of the rights of the victims of crime.  We must redress this imbalance, as the Bill does, and there should be a general welcome for this Bill.  It is timely if not greatly overdue.  It is interesting to note that our rule excluding some evidence is not in line with that of other common law jurisdictions, including Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps some others, such as some American states.</P>
        <P>The European Convention on Human Rights does not require the exclusion of such evidence.  What is required is that an accused is assured of a fair trial.  It could be argued that the exclusionary rule is incompatible with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, which include that the right to life should be protected by law, as well as the right to liberty and the security of the person.  As a result of the Supreme Court decision in the People <i>v</i>. Kenny 1990, it was decided that all or any evidence improperly or illegally obtained should be excluded.</P>
        <P>That was my belief but I found it interesting to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and Senator Ivana Bacik, as well as the Minister of State present &mdash; all notable legal brains &mdash; arguing about exceptions.  As a layman I was not aware of these.  Perhaps there is some further tweaking that could make this perfect if it is not quite there yet.  They welcomed this debate, as Senator Walsh and others have.</P>
        <P>We are concerned about fundamental rights and human freedom and nobody wants to see them infringed.  We must insist on an effective prosecution system for the good of our society.  Public confidence in the administration of justice must be paramount and a judge and jury should be allowed to hear evidence.  We need a balancing rule, as this Bill would provide for.  We must not tie the hands of the State or a judge, although this is what we are currently doing.</P>
        <P>Good faith exceptions should be allowed, although the Minister stressed that we do not want sloppy police work.  Senator Norris spoke on that and we heartily agree.  The evidence should be tested, following the direction of the judge to the jury.  This would be the right course.  How this should be addressed and tied up in the correct legal terms is something to which I do not have the answer.</P>
        <P>I found it interesting to listen to many of the contributions.  There is a general welcome on both sides of the House for the Bill, although I know the Minister of State is arguing that it cannot be accepted just now.  An appeal case awaiting hearing before the Supreme Court could have a bearing in this respect, and hopefully that is not too far distant.  Perhaps following that case, the matter could be re-addressed, if it cannot go beyond this evening&rsquo;s debate.  Some of the Government side&rsquo;s quibbling is understandable and I do not want to rule it out because I am a layman.  However, perhaps we could allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage with the Government&rsquo;s position being reserved.  While the timing could be left to the Government, appropriate changes could be made by way of Government amendments on Committee Stage.  I strongly recommend that course because, as legislators, we are concerned by the greater good and the protection of society.  That is our primary duty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I compliment Senator Regan on bringing forward this legislation, which touches a nerve that definitely needs to be addressed.  I accept his point that there is a huge demand for this kind of legislation.  I would not question his objectives for one moment, but I have significant difficulties with parts of it.  I would like to see the Bill going to Committee Stage where it could be amended.  That would meet the needs both of the Minister and Senator Regan in dealing with the relevant issues.  I am uncomfortable with some aspects of the Bill.  Perhaps in an old-fashioned way, I still believe it is better for 99 guilty people to go free rather than have one innocent person imprisoned.  There is not much demand for that viewpoint at the moment and I can see why, given the significant levels of crime. <Col N="1012"/> Nonetheless, issues have been raised by Senator Regan which do not cut across my idea of the basic principles of law and constitutional rights.  One, for instance, is where the Garda &mdash; not improperly, but through properly established surveillance &mdash; comes across information or hears conversations, which would be useful if introduced as evidence afterwards.  I think there would be no objection to the Bill dealing with that issue, but it does not do so.  That is a matter of concern.  I am talking in particular about a situation where the Garda properly obtains authority to intercept telephone or other communications and in the course of that comes across certain conversations which would be useful as evidence.  In that situation, it should be allowed because it does not contravene the laws of hearsay.  Those laws are complex but the problem arises when people use the evidence to back up something said by a third party who is not present.  Using evidence which is put together in that way to convict somebody in court would not be a breach of the laws of evidence.  It seems to be a sensible thing to do.  </P>
        <P>Senator Regan has touched on items where it would be reasonable for the courts to draw conclusions from certain actions or information being brought forth.  I am uncomfortable with the idea of using what the Senator describes as improperly or illegally obtained evidence.  In light of all we have seen in Donegal and elsewhere, I am uncomfortable with that, although I do not question the reasons given by the Senator for putting forward that proposition.  I am worried about it nonetheless because, at the very least, it could allow for sloppy Garda behaviour.  It could even support corrupt Garda activity, although Senator Regan would never have envisaged that.</P>
        <P>I support his point about obtaining evidence as the result of a mere mistake or oversight, as opposed to a deliberate and conscious violation.  The issue of a writ being 24 hours out of date, for example, should be dealt with in a sensible and practical way, as Senator Regan has outlined in section 5.  I can see how it could be included in a Government Bill or could be accepted by the Government with minor amendments.</P>
        <P>It is absolutely right for us to address these issues, but I would like to tease them out further on Committee Stage.  I would like to see the Minister arguing over the Bill point by point.  I would like to hear the various views involved and in that way we could strengthen the law.  It is incontrovertible that the general population is uneasy with the way things are currently operating.  We cannot blame the courts because they implement what we decide, although we often ignore that fact.  We have regular debates during which Senators discuss the fact that judges do not hand down mandatory sentences for drug offences, despite the fact that we inserted three conditions in the legislation before the mandatory sentence can be applied.  We do this all the time and, as politicians, we get away with it.  Generally speaking, the Judiciary implements the law as they are given it.  If we are not happy with the outcomes, we need to change the law.  That is why Senator Regan&rsquo;s proposal is an important step.  It is an important part of the discussion which we must address.  I would like the House to go through the Bill section by section.  The Government side should be prepared to support this as far as Committee Stage and then let people put up or shut up.  Senators can put forward their views and table amendments to make the desired changes, thus moving forward the legislation.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Regan on the work he has put into this legislation.  It was interesting to hear Senator Boyle bemoaning the fact that such a large percentage of legislation comes from the Government.  I nearly fell off my chair with laughter when I heard that because, having been sitting here for almost 20 years, I know it is extraordinarily difficult to get legislation through the House which is proposed by the Opposition.  Senator Boyle is right, however, in saying that Governments should examine legislation, such as the Bill before us, and ask whether there is a need to address the issues.  Nobody would deny that.  The Government should also decide whether it agrees with the points articulated in the legislation.  It is unusual <Col N="1013"/>to find people 100% in agreement, but the logical next step is to take what is there and build on it, or alternatively reject it and start again.  If a Senator has gone to the trouble of bringing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill before the House, which raises issues of public concern, we should deal with it.  In that regard, I compliment Senator Regan.  Although some work remains to be done on the Bill, this is, nevertheless, an important debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in congratulating Senator Regan on bringing this legislation before the House.  It is a good use of the Seanad and his role as a legislator.  We are fortunate to have someone like him to handle this.  As an eminent senior counsel, he has a particular knowledge of the area.  As a practising public representative, he has an appreciation of the implications for the people of this legal anomaly.  I congratulate him on this achievement.</P>
        <P>While people may quibble about the detail, no one can dispute the merit of the Bill&rsquo;s fundamental point or the quality of the legislation.  Senator Regan would be the first to accept amendments and to consider the legislation on Committee Stage with other Senators.  He has done well in introducing the Bill and deserves our warmest congratulations.</P>
        <P>Under the Kenny judgment in the Supreme Court, the exclusionary rule effectively means that a minor mistake or technical error made by a garda in the presentation of a case will end the trial in question and discredit all of the evidence.  It is important to state that Senator Regan is attempting to modify the exclusionary rule to allow for judicial discretion.  As such, a judge could weigh up the prosecuting garda&rsquo;s error and make a judgment.  He or she would either accept the bona fides of the evidence and let it go to the jury or disallow it.  Senator Regan is careful to enshrine in the legislation the fact that it would be a judicial function.  It is a reasonable proposition because the judge would be in a position to weigh the community and public interests with the accused&rsquo;s constitutional rights.  While it is critical that those rights reign supreme, they must be balanced with the rights of the victims and everyone else concerned.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan would be at the vanguard of those who would say that evidence obtained by improper means, such as duress, brutality and so on, would not be admissible.  If the mistake fell in that sphere, the evidence would not be admissible.  The Bill is a bona fide attempt to remove a difficulty in the operation of the courts and the search for justice.  In light of the People <i>v</i>. O&rsquo;Brien, a case cited in the Bill&rsquo;s explanatory memorandum, the acceptance that discretion should be exercised is clear.  If a mistake is a technicality or a minor error, there is no logic in letting it stand before a prosecution.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to see reason.  What Senator Regan is attempting to achieve through the Bill is a noble and worthy objective, given the lawlessness that is sadly a feature of contemporary society.  Given our acceptance of the fact that the legislation would achieve the objective and our preparedness to consider the Bill on Committee Stage, the Minister of State should be reasonable and allow it to pass Second Stage.</P>
        <P>To take practical examples, we all read our local newspapers.  The provincial press has a good tradition of reporting the courts with significant detail.  Every Senator knows of someone who, after putting lives at risk through his or her drunken driving, has the case against him or her dismissed because a letter was missing from an address or some other incidental matter, the reason for which is normally the accused.  In one of the cases cited in the explanatory memorandum, someone in possession of heroin, possibly for resale purposes, got off on a technicality because his mobile telephone call was intercepted by a garda.</P>
        <P>We must protect against an abuse of the law and anything less than complete adherence to the constitutional rights of the accused should be out the window.  However, we must create a situation in which courts can be efficient, justice can be done, the rights of victims and innocent bystanders can be preserved and community interest in the rule of law can be maintained.  We <Col N="1014"/>need a functional court system that responds to society&rsquo;s needs, allows victims to plea for justice and protects the constitutional rights of the accused.</P>
        <P>This is precisely what the Private Members&rsquo; Bill seeks.  Senator Regan seeks to abolish the exclusionary rule in its pure form and to replace it with judicial discretion, which would evaluate the reasons for errors and whether they are genuine or represent infringements of constitutional rights.  Senator Regan would be the first to declare that evidence gained through a constitutional infringement should be thrown out.  However, evidence affected by a garda&rsquo;s technical error should be admitted.  If there is a problem in Garda practices, it would be a matter for the relevant garda and his or her superiors or for the Garda Ombudsman.  It is not sufficient reason to allow someone who is clearly guilty to walk out of a court, nor is it sufficient reason to send alleged victims out of courts frustrated by the law, disgruntled and under the belief that justice has not been done.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Regan on this groundbreaking legislation.  He has done the House much service and has an acute awareness of what we should be doing, namely, implementing reformative legislation.  If accepted, albeit with modifications, the Senator&rsquo;s Bill would make the courts more efficient and help the rule of law and justice to be achieved.  By any hierarchy of values, these objectives have a nobility that is beyond question.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, who is a good listener, to accept the merit of the legislation and to rise above the narrow political concerns that occupy us at times, particularly in this Chamber.  He should accept the worthiness of the Bill and allow it to pass on to Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s attendance and his acknowledgement of the problem.  He stated that, &ldquo;a modified rule which would encompass a &lsquo;good faith&rsquo; exception or which would allow the trial judge to weigh the rights of the community at large and that of the victim against the rights of the accused, would continue to ensure that the guaranteed rights of the accused are treated seriously&rdquo;.  These are the Bill&rsquo;s sentiments.  It is well-grounded and many Senators have referred to the need for legislation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I take on board the constructive criticism offered in respect of specific provisions of the Bill.  However, I would not accept all of that criticism. The Minister proposed that we should wait until this matter is adjudicated upon on the basis of the appeal provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The report of the balance in the criminal law review group was published in March 2007 and, in that context, I am of the view that we should legislate in respect of this matter.  If doubts arise in respect of such legislation, there is a mechanism by which these can be dealt with.  However, there is a presumption that legislation passed by the Oireachtas is constitutional.  Concerns arose in the past to the effect that legislation relating to the Criminal Assets Bureau might not be valid or that certain other legislative measures might not withstand a constitutional challenge in the Supreme Court.  The Bill before the House is well drafted, provides the necessary safeguards and ultimately gives wide discretion to the courts in passing judgment on the admissibility of evidence of the type at issue.  On that basis, I will conclude my remarks and propose that the debate on the legislation be adjourned.</P>

      <sTitle>Pharmaceutical Sector.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the registration fee being imposed on the pharmaceutical sector.  Three elements in the new regulation cause concern.  The first is the extraordinarily high level at which the fee is being set.  The second is the bureaucracy and duplication involved, which is wasteful, especially in the registration process itself.  The third is the concern about what the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland intends to do with its enormously increased revenues.</P>
        <P>The whole system of registration of pharmacies is a new development that was provided for in the Pharmacy Act 2007 that we passed last year.  The case made for it was that the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland needed to be able to hold pharmacy owners who are not pharmacists, <Col N="1019"/>principally the groups of pharmacies owned by large companies, accountable to it.  That was reasonable.  However, both the PSNI, the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland and the RPSGB, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, have been maintaining a register of pharmacy premises for a number of years.  I wish to draw some comparisons between them to show how absurdly high and penal is the registration fee.</P>
        <P>The fee of &euro;2,500 is excessive and it has not been justified by any demonstrated need to expend this kind of money.  It is 15 times the fee charged in Northern Ireland.  I wonder sometimes when I see all this stuff about uniting Ireland, yet we magnify the gaps between the two parts of the island in every possible way.  I found it ironic during the week that some republican source called for a boycott of Newry.  That says a lot for the Thirty-two County republic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fee in Britain is three times less at &pound;162 sterling.  Let us compare that with &euro;2,500.  There is no transparency in how the fee was set.  The fee was recommended to the Minister for Health and Children by the council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which now has a majority of lay members, all appointed by the Minister.  It was inevitable that the Minister would accept the recommendation even though the amount indicated in a submission by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, which represents the majority of pharmacy owners in the State, was &euro;500 or one fifth of the amount.  It is extraordinary that the fee suggested by the professional body representing pharmacists was multiplied by five and the Minister got advice from her own plants to say that is what was necessary.  That is just extraordinary behaviour.</P>
        <P>We have moved away from professional self-regulation of the pharmacy sector but we seem to have no clear idea of how to replace it, what to replace it with, or how it should be funded.  One can ask whether it is appropriate that the new regulator for pharmacies should be funded by those it regulates.  Again, it is a question of principle.  I raised the issue in regard to the Press Council of Ireland where the newspapers, who are the interested party, pay the fees.  As far as I am concerned that corrupts the process.  We have a large sum of money but we have no indication of how it will be spent or for what uses it will be appropriated. However, it has been reported that it is to appoint 12 new inspectors to monitor the 1,600 pharmacies in the State so that there will be a ratio of one inspector to every 135 pharmacies.  Is this comparable with what happens in neighbouring jurisdictions?  The relevant British institution employs 26 inspectors for its 13,000 pharmacies, which is a ratio of 1:500.  There is duplication and waste in this country.  The HSE is already responsible for ensuring the suitability of pharmacy premises and staff in all 1,600 pharmacies with medical card contracts.  Therefore, the expenditure of the money in question is not necessary.</P>
        <P>The provision of pharmacy services to the public is covered by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It is a very responsible body and I am extremely impressed by it.  It was the authority that produced an audit on the cost efficiency of addressing the issue of human papillomavirus.  Tragically, the Minister for Health and Children ignored its advice.  This was another missed opportunity.</P>
        <P>The bureaucracy is extraordinary.  Thank God I do not have to experience this hell.  For somebody who hates forms &mdash; a fairly human characteristic &mdash; to be asked to fill a 25-page form complete with maps, plans of the buildings, solicitors&rsquo; letters, affidavits and the whole works during the busiest three weeks of the pharmaceutical year is appalling.  Evidence of insurance and sworn certificates signed by solicitors are also required, which is dreadful.</P>
        <P>Another correspondent of mine stated, &ldquo;I will have been practising pharmacy for 20 years next year and I have never had a complaint about my professional behaviour.&rdquo;  He states from the heart, &ldquo;I do not need to pay some blood-sucking, jobs-for-the-boys quango &euro;2,500 to regulate and inspect me into alcoholism or an early grave.&rdquo;  I understand from where that fellow is <Col N="1020"/>coming.  How much more unemployment do we want to create?  This is a very severe burden given that there are already cutbacks.</P>
        <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has introduced a fee of &euro;1,500, to be paid by pharmacy graduates for the privilege of completing their pre-registration vocational training.  There have been endless problems with this and I raised it a while ago.  As a result of a blockage in negotiations, a full annual intake of final-year pharmacy students was to be blocked.</P>
        <P>Why is the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, a statutory body with some degree of accountability to the Oireachtas, benefiting from a 200% increase in its fee income in an extraordinarily straitened time economically for pharmacists and everybody else?  The society currently has an annual fee income of approximately &euro;2 million from pharmacists&rsquo; membership fees, while the fee of &euro;2,500 per pharmacy will generate an additional &euro;4 million.  Why?  For what will the money be used and how can it be justified in these difficult times?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the Deputy on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The profession of pharmacy has undergone a dynamic change since the Pharmacy Act 2007 was passed by the Oireachtas in May 2007.  The latest stage of this transformation, which began with the commencement of additional sections of the Act on 28 November, includes the new registration regime for retail pharmacy businesses.</P>
        <P>Registered pharmacists and pharmacies have a privileged position of responsibility in the sale and supply of medicinal products to the public.  However, with this position of responsibility comes an obligation to maintain the trust that the public places in the profession.  It is important that the public have confidence in the compliance of the pharmacy sector with the laws governing the provision of medicinal products and the operation of the premises used to provide this service.  The registration sections of the Pharmacy Act 2007 set out to achieve this by putting in place a modern and robust regulatory regime for the pharmacists and their retail pharmacy businesses.  Under this new regime, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which will have increased powers of inspection and, where necessary, enforcement, will be in an enhanced position to monitor the application of the laws regarding the storage, sale and supply of medicinal products in retail pharmacy businesses.</P>
        <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has been, and continues to be, a self-financing body.  In arriving at a fee for the provision of the new registration regime for retail pharmacy businesses, the society engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to develop an evidence-based methodology for the determination of registration fees.  In engaging in this exercise, the society sought to put in place a viable and sustainable self-financing structure for the provision of the regulatory regime required under the legislation.  The process undertaken by PWC included a comparative analysis and benchmarking of the provision of pharmacy business registration services against comparable international pharmacy regulators.  The aim was to identify the appropriate costs of the registration process to the society and allow for the allocation of these costs in a proportionate manner.</P>
        <P>The PWC study found that regulators in very few other jurisdictions have such a comprehensive scope as the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in terms of its statutory obligations and role in public safety.  With respect to our closest neighbours, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, RPSGB, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland, PSNI, are primarily representative bodies, with little statutory responsibility.  The arrangements for registration in Northern Ireland and Britain are also substantially different.  The primary inspection and enforcement functions of pharmacy and medicine law are carried out by Government <Col N="1021"/>agencies such as the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland.  The pharmacy registration fee in England, Scotland and Wales in 2007 was &euro;683, with all statutory inspection and enforcement and the regulation function resting with other statutory agencies.  The United Kingdom is currently establishing an independent regulator similar to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  It is likely, therefore, that once this regulator &mdash; the general pharmaceutical council &mdash; is established in 2010, the position in the United Kingdom in terms of regulation and the funding of such regulation may change.</P>
        <P>The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland undertook the PWC process in order to estimate as accurately as possible the cost of the new services.  It has also undertaken to keep the fees for the registration of retail pharmacy businesses under review throughout 2009 and to update the position regarding their appropriateness when preparing its 2010 fee submission.  The Minister is satisfied that every effort has been taken to determine a fee for the registration of retail pharmacy businesses that is proportionate to the level of service required by the general public and the pharmacy profession in respect of the supervision of retail pharmacy businesses.  The registration fees for individual pharmacists and pharmaceutical assistants have not increased for 2009.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  There is a clear conflict of evidence between what the Minister of State and I, as advised, put on the record regarding the sums involved in this jurisdiction and in Great Britain.  With regard to PricewaterhouseCoopers, it did not exactly help us when we were tumbling into the financial abyss.  It is a classic practice to commission reports all over the place.  Why would PricewaterhouseCoopers object?  It will be paid.  However, I am not sure about the validity of the report in question.  Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Health and Children to accept my request, made on behalf of a considerable number of pharmacists, to postpone the deadline of 22 December?  It is practically Christmas Eve.  It is inhuman and stupid; it is a classic example of idiotic bureaucracy.  Will she postpone the date for three months to allow for reconsideration and an examination of what I describe, with a view to removing the awful burden imposed on pharmacists at Christmas?  Will the Minister of State pass on this message?  I do not want him to seek a commitment to reconsider the deadline but to ensure that it will be postponed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly undertake to do so.  If there is a conflict of evidence, as the Senator pointed out, I will raise it with the Minister.  There would be great criticism of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland if it tried to set its own fees.  Bearing in mind the society&rsquo;s use of an outside body to produce a report, it is difficult to see how it could have avoided criticism in one way or another.  I will certainly undertake to raise the need for postponement of the deadline with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, for taking this issue on the Adjournment tonight.  I am raising the proposal to increase fees in the Northern third level institutions and the impact this will have on Border students, particularly in Donegal.  I declare my interest by saying that I spent seven years at the University of Ulster, Jordanstown.  Students from Donegal tried to go to the colleges nearest to us and I was facilitated by the fact that we had no fees here and there was none there.  Subsequent to my finishing college there was a gradual imposition of fees in the North and that has had a considerable <Col N="1022"/>impact as regards the availability of those colleges to southern students.  While I say &ldquo;southern students&rdquo;, Donegal is part of the province of Ulster so it is a strange term in that sense. </P>
        <P>The Minister of State has recently received a report to the effect that the nine year olds are happy, content and physically active.  I would like to believe that at the other end of the spectrum, when they are leaving as opposed to just starting in the school system, we would look at the economic impact.  The north west is a region that continually needs high skilled graduates.  We believe there is a great workforce there and great opportunities, but like the rest of Ulster, there is no great impetus as regards employment and people being able to stay in the area.  If a person attends college in a particular area, he or she tends to stay there on graduating.  Ulster, which has nine counties, needs the drive of people educated in the area, with no brain drain from there.  People might say that we may have fees here in the next year or two, but the problem is how to deal with the realities of the moment.</P>
        <P>The reality is that there are fees in the North, which make it less available to students and they have to leave their own areas to attend college in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  The Northern institutions are trying to introduce fees for higher rather than further education whereby southern students, that is, students from the Republic, will be asked to pay fees.  That was resisted by me and others as it seemed to be unconstitutional, and it had to be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>However, under the Good Friday Agreement some students in Ireland have to pay fees while others do not.  There is also the situation whereby when these students go to the colleges, they are not eligible for bursaries.  Surely bursaries should be for students, for example, the people gaining the best results or whatever.  It should be emphasised that the Minister for Education in the North is not actually in charge of the universities, which come under Sir Reg Empey, MLA, who is Minister for Employment and Learning.  That is another difficulty and I know Mr. Mervyn Storey, MLA, chairman of the education committee, recognises that there is no continuity in their system between second and third levels.</P>
        <P>The reason I am pushing this is that some of the colleges are within 15 miles of where I live and where my constituents live.  For that reason they do not get the full grants.  They then apply for a bursary, to be told that because they are from the Republic, they are not eligible.  Fees are imposed on them, which, it seems, will increase in the next academic year.  The students will then be faced with the choice of whether to stay local to graduate, with the idea that they should remain in the area and be employed there, or take the option of going elsewhere.  They can choose to attend college in the Republic.  I emphasise that we have an excellent institute of technology in Letterkenny, which is going from strength to strength.  It is accredited to grant third level degrees, but not all courses are available.  In an all-Ireland post-Good Friday Agreement context, people from the nine counties of Ulster must go to Scotland because there are no fees there.  They then tend to stay in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK and do not return to Ireland.  The purpose is self-defeating.  The Minister, Sir Reg Empey, has launched a review of the hardship some students are facing.</P>
        <P>I raise this adjournment motion tonight to ask that we make an input to that review, to put forward the case that there are serious impacts financially for students from Donegal and the rest of the Border counties in going into the North.  It is to the detriment of the universities there as well as to the economy of Ulster into the future.  While there is an ongoing review, there should not be talk about increasing fees, particularly when the supports for students are not there.  The review will consider the hardship for those students.  Donegal and other Border county students are being denied bursaries and I ask whether they are welcome in Northern third level institutions, which are responsible for allocating them, as distinct from the various educational departments in the North.</P><Col N="1023"/>
        <P>I leave it to the Minister of State to ask whether there is potential for us to make an input into Sir Reg Empey&rsquo;s review and to accept and realise that our students are a valuable addition to the Northern colleges and should not be deterred from attending them, as appears to be happening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science. </P>
        <P>I propose to use this opportunity to outline to this House the formal structures for co-operation in the education sphere between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and existing arrangements under the Department&rsquo;s third level student support schemes relating to students from this State who undertake courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The general context is that the Department&rsquo;s North-South co-operation unit manages the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s funding and co-ordinates co-operation activities within the education sector with the Department of Education and the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.  The Department of Education in Northern Ireland has responsibility for all school and youth based education matters in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science formally engages with this Department at ministerial level on co-operation issues under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council in<b> </b>four main areas, special education needs, educational underachievement, teacher mobility and school and youth exchanges.</P>
        <P>The Department of Employment and Learning has responsibility for further, vocational and higher education matters as well as employment matters in Northern Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, wishes to reiterate what he clarified in this House when a similar motion was debated on 21 October 2008, namely, that the Department of Education and Science does not formally engage with the Department of Employment and Learning within the structures of the North-South Ministerial Council<b>.  </b>As the Minister has explained, this is due to the provisions of the Belfast and St. Andrews Agreements, which designate the specific sectoral areas for co-operation.  During that debate, the Minister also clarified that the Department engages in co-operative activities with the Department of Employment and Learning at official level on a number of issues and gave a number of examples.</P>
        <P>Specifically on the issue of student supports for those pursuing university courses, the Minister undertook, within the parameters of existing liaison mechanisms with his Northern Ireland counterparts, to do all he could to make them aware of the concerns raised by the Senator.  In that regard, the Minister asked his officials to relay those concerns to the Department of Employment and Learning.</P>
        <P>Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe also explained on the previous occasion that under the Department&rsquo;s third level free fees initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students, including those from Northern Ireland and other EU member states, who are attending approved undergraduate courses in the State.  The main eligibility conditions of the initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates, must hold EU nationality or official refugee status and must have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to extend the eligibility conditions of the free fees initiative to cover students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland.  With regard to eligibility for financial assistance under the student maintenance grant schemes, which are administered by the local authorities and the VECs on behalf of my Department, the position is that students who are entering approved full-time courses for the first time are eligible for grants where <Col N="1024"/>they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  An approved course for the purpose of the third level maintenance grant schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less two years&rsquo; duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved third level institution.</P>
        <P>Applications for grant assistance under the student support schemes are submitted to the local authority or the VEC, depending on the type of course in question.  Applicants undertaking undergraduate degree and postgraduate courses apply to their local authorities while those pursuing diploma-certificate and PLC courses apply to their relevant VEC.  The third level student support schemes extend to undergraduate study in Ireland and the EU and postgraduate study in Ireland, including Northern Ireland.  Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside the island of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.  There are no plans to expand the provisions in the grant schemes with regard to study abroad.</P>
        <P>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief at the standard rate of tax for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and postgraduate courses in most EU countries.  Tax relief at undergraduate level extends to approved full and part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU member state and approved full-time or part-time courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.  Tax relief on tuition fees is claimed directly from the tax office, using an IT 31 form.  Details of approved colleges and courses are also available on Revenue&rsquo;s Internet site.  Approved undergraduate courses must be of at least two years duration and both the college and the course must satisfy the codes of standards as laid down by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State bring to the attention of the Minister the fact that the only reason I am raising the issue again within six weeks of having raised it is that the situation is now even more dire?  The indications are that the fees will be increased.  While I welcome the information on tax relief, some parents of students are not in the tax bracket.  Therefore, the problem is that it is the poorest who are being denied easy access to their local third level institutions.  I accept there are agreements under the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, but in the context of the review taking place under the stewardship of Minister Empey, will the Minister of State engage in formal interaction with him to point out that hardship is being caused and that it is not being alleviated because colleges are choosing not to support students from the Republic of Ireland?  This has resulted in the lack of numbers able to access these universities.  I urge the Minister of State to convey the message to the Department of Education and Science that I would not have raised this issue if it was not more serious now than it was six weeks ago.</P>

	<P>I agree with the Senator.  In all contexts, thankfully, mobility across the Border has increased in the past few years.  Unfortunately, arguments about issues like this undermine the need for the Border, but it is part of our history and we must accept it.  The Senator has identified a serious problem to which we must try to find a solution.  I undertake to bring her concerns to the attention of the Minister again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for accepting this motion on the Adjournment.  I also welcome the Minister of State.  </P>
        <P>The reason I raise the motion is to make the case for two vocational schools in north Tipperary, Nenagh and Borrisokane, to be moved up the list of school building projects sanctioned by the Department.  They should be two of the main priorities.  In my travels throughout Munster I have not seen two schools more in need of upgrading.  Only for the dedication of the two school principals, Mr. Michael McNulty and Mr. Matthew Carr, they would not exist.  Mr. McNulty is principal of Nenagh vocational school and a woodwork teacher by training.  In the evenings and at weekends he maintains the school.  He does more maintenance work than anything else.  He hangs doors and fixes walls and ceilings, because if he did not, the school would fall down.</P>
        <P>I doubt that if these schools were the subject of a full health and safety audit, particularly Nenagh vocational school, they would pass.  The plethora of works required to be done is astonishing.  Both schools have reached phase three on the schools building projects list, but have been stuck there for a long time.  They were built in the 1970s and have not been upgraded since.  Many in the region believe North Tipperary VEC is being discriminated against for some reason and do not know the reason the schools kept being pushed back on the list.</P>
        <P>Nenagh vocational school does not have enough sockets to work equipment.  As it suffers from power surges, computers are constantly blowing.  The metalwork room is marked off by a yellow line half way across which students are not allowed to pass because there are so many leaks in the roof and water is getting into equipment.  The fear is that some student will be badly injured.  Showers in the school have not worked for 20 years.  The school won the schools all-Ireland hurling title, yet it does not have showers that work.  That is scandalous.  It also suffers from a lack of insulation and the heating only works properly on one side of the building.  It has to be turned on and off in order that one side does not get too warm and the other does not get too cold.  Parents must help in cleaning the school.  Because of the constant leaks and problems with the roof there is a need for constant maintenance by volunteers.</P>
        <P>There are similar problems at Borrisokane.  I have never seen a problem similar to one in the school where two classrooms have no windows.  Therefore, there is little ventilation and no natural light.  By any standards, let alone the standards expected in 2008, that is a disgrace.  The school also has issues with eating facilities.  An issue expected to arise in the coming year is that the school expects to enrol a student who uses a wheelchair, yet there will be no way for that student to move around the school.</P>
        <P>The matter is urgent.  The schools have tried their best with the Department but receive no response from it or the civil servants.  They cannot get information on the reason they are stuck at phase three.  Another aspect is the investment made by both schools.  Nenagh vocational school has spent &euro;290,000 to date on drawing up plans and doing the necessary work to reach phase three.  Borrisokane vocational school has spent &euro;369,000.  If there is no movement soon, that money will be wasted.  We are all aware there is a time limit.  It is ridiculous that more than &euro;600,000 has been spent to date on getting these schools to phase three, but they have not been allowed proceed.  I challenge the Minister to come and visit them.  I also challenge him to name any school he has seen which should have greater priority than Nenagh and Borrisokane vocational schools which are in a desperate state.  The health and safety issues are significant.  I do not want to hear some morning that a student has been badly injured in one of them.  We must act now and nip the problem in the bud.</P>
        <P>The schools offer significant community services and are available in the evenings.  They offer important PLC courses to significant numbers.  They do much work below the radar <Col N="1026"/>working with various groups, yet they do not have proper facilities.  I urge the Minister of State to find out their exact position on the list and the reason they are so far down and stuck at phase three.  I have visited schools all over Munster and have not seen cases as bad as these.  These two schools are located in my home area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position on the proposed building projects for both Nenagh and Borrisokane vocational schools.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department of Education and Science.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
      
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the schools building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and according as it is ready to proceed.</P>
        <P>There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places.  Band two projects largely address mainstream extension and refurbishment needs, band three projects address ancillary needs and band four projects make provision of desirable, but not necessarily urgent or essential, facilities.  Each band rating has a number of subcategories, which more specifically describe the type of works needed at a school and the urgency attaching to them.</P>
        <P>As for health and safety issues, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, under safety, health and welfare at work legislation for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care.  It is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have in place a safety statement in their schools.  The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put in place appropriate provision to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils.  The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.  In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Department of Education and Science is currently working with the Health and Safety Authority and State Claims Agency to develop a health and safety management system to support post-primary schools to meet their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  This work forms part of a wider initiative to reduce the administrative burden on post-primary schools by supporting them in preparing policies to meet a range of legislative and regulatory requirements.  A total of eight such policies have been published to date and these are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.  The Department of Education and Science takes great care to ensure that all health and safety requirements are incorporated into new school buildings and extensions.  The Department ensures that its technical guidance documentation takes cognisance of all health and safety legislation to inform design teams of their obligations in this area when designing building projects.</P><Col N="1027"/>
        <P>Provision is built into the school building and modernisation programme to enable schools address urgent health and safety issues.  This includes financial provision under the summer works scheme under which both of the schools in question have benefited.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, will provide the details of this at another time.  The Department of Education and Science also sets aside contingency funding each year to address urgent unforeseen issues with school buildings.</P>
        <P>Borrisokane Community College is a co-educational provider.  It has a current enrolment of 474 pupils and this number has increased slightly in recent years.  Following an application for capital funding from the VEC for an extension and refurbishment project at this school, a building project was approved to commence architectural planning.  A stage 3 submission, which is the developed sketch scheme, has been approved in this regard.  While it has not been possible to progress the project further due to higher competing demands, the school has received funding amounting to &euro;255,000 under the summer works scheme between the years 2005 and 2007 for an electrical upgrade and partial roof replacement.  This has improved conditions at the school.</P>
        <P>Nenagh Vocational School also is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 360 students, which is broken down into 257 mainstream pupils and 103 post-leaving certificate, PLC, and vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, students.  The school has experienced a 9% decrease in its mainstream enrolments in recent years, while its PLC and VTOS enrolments are stable.  An extension and refurbishment project for this school also is at stage 3 of the architectural planning process and the stage 3 submission has been approved.  Again, while the funding has not been available to allow the project to proceed further, this school also received &euro;384,000 in funding under the summer works scheme in 2006 and 2007 for an electrical upgrade and for universal access works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The extension and refurbishment projects for both Nenagh and Borrisokane have been assigned a band 2.4 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects, which I already mentioned.  This reflects the fact that although there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation in the schools, it does not represent a substantial or significant portion of the schools&rsquo; overall accommodation needs.  It also reflects the fact that the schools are in need of refurbishment.  Part of the refurbishment aspect of the projects has been addressed by the allocation of summer works scheme funding.</P>
        <P>Due to competing demands on the capital budget from higher band rated projects, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of the remainder of these projects at present. However, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, wishes to assure the Senator that he is committed to delivering the projects as soon as the necessary funding becomes available.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>While I thank the Minister of State for his response, I wish to raise a couple of matters.  First, it is difficult for Nenagh Vocational School to maintain its enrolment at the appropriate level when parents can see its current condition.  Would the Minister of State enrol his child in a school that he knew lacked showers and adequate physical education facilities and where health and safety risks abound?  Parts of some rooms cannot be entered because of the danger of electrocution.  The enrolment issue arises from the condition in which the school has been left.  While other schools have received funding down the years, the aforementioned two schools have been left out.</P>
        <P>Second, a serious issue exists which will make national&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1028"/>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>A serious issue exists in respect of wheelchair access and I ask the Minister of State to investigate it as a matter of priority.  One cannot have national headlines in which a student who attempts to enrol in a school cannot so do because he or she has a disability.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Minister of State should ask his ministerial colleague to re-assess the band rating for the two schools under discussion.  It is about time it was reassessed and I plead for this to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I again thank the Senator.  As I am sure he is aware, a large capital budget has been allocated for school building next year.  He will not wish to displace other projects that are ahead of the projects to which he referred today in an attempt to move them forward.  As for the last item he mentioned, he probably is aware that applications can be made for grants in respect of mobility access for students with special needs and I am involved with such cases in my constituency.  While major economic constraints obviously exist at present, in general I have found the departmental officials to be extremely helpful in such circumstances.  I certainly will bring the matters raised by the Senator to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
