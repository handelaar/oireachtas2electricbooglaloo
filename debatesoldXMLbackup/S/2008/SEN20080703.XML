	<P>I have notice from Senator Pearse Doherty that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the proper dispersion of the student services charge by higher education institutions throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the Government&rsquo;s waste management policy; its policy in regard to incineration; the role, if any, he sees for incineration in waste management in Ireland and both the number and capacity of incinerators he considers is required.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason the family of a person (details supplied) was refused payment under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 and if she will make a statement on the issue that several thousand such claims were rejected on the grounds of private hospitalisation despite the fact no health board alternative was available.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that RTE&rsquo;s FM service is received all over Northern Ireland, thereby enabling residents of Northern Ireland to access RTE.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dan Boyle of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Health and Children to outline if she is satisfied that the current policies on the investigation of deaths in hospital through negligence are adequate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Doherty, Fitzgerald and John Paul Phelan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The remaining Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I would like to acknowledge the very welcome news today of the rescue of Ingrid Betancourt.  It was wonderful to hear it on the news this morning and I congratulate everyone involved.  I thank all colleagues for their great support and thank the leaders of all the groups for the all-party motion we had in the House.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 2, Chemicals Bill 2008 &mdash; All Stages.  It is proposed that No. 1 will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, and No. 2 will be taken at the conclusion of No. 1.  Spokespersons may speak for eight minutes, all other Senators for six minutes, and Senators may share time with the agreement of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Leader in expressing my delight at the rescue of Ingrid Betancourt, after being held in captivity for six years. This is wonderful news. We raised the issue in the House on many occasions.  Perhaps at some point in the future, when she has recovered from her ordeal, we may be able to invite her to address the House.  However, it is critical that international attention does not disappear from this issue because the most high profile hostage has been released.  The FARC rebels continue to hold many people, perhaps up to 700.  This is an issue, therefore, on which international attention should definitely continue to focus.  In the House, we should continue to keep in touch on this issue and to raise it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in order that he can raise it at international fora.  It is wonderful news after the harrowing ordeal she and the other hostages have had.</P>
        <P>I want to raise an environmental matter this morning, given the situation in Haulbowline and the serious worries about the studies showing higher cancer rates.  This will raise concerns throughout the country because the whole question of the disposal of toxic waste and the management of sites that need clearance are critical issues.</P>
        <P>I particularly want to raise this with the Leader and Deputy Leader because two matters have come to my attention.  Last week the European Commission initiated legal proceedings against Ireland because we have failed to implement the environmental liability directive.  It has also emerged that we are the only country out of 27 not to have signed the Aarhus Convention.  If the aforementioned directive and convention were in place, we could deal with the situation in Cork more effectively.  The public would have more access to information and could demand more from the Government in terms of action on the issue.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to indicate the Government&rsquo;s timeframe for signing the environmental liability directive and the Aarhus Convention and for bringing them into effect, which would mean that Irish citizens were more empowered on environmental matters.  This is the kind of legislation that would give citizens some belief in the European agenda.  Indeed, it might have made a difference to the Lisbon vote, if people felt that some of the initiatives coming from Europe were empowering them.  It would make a real difference.  I ask the Leader to respond to my questions and perhaps we could have a debate in the House on these issues.</P>
        <P>Obviously the big news today is the release of economic figures from the Department of Finance, which are disastrous.  The days of the Taoiseach and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, trading on his reputation for sound economic management are over.  Clearly he did not take note of the many reports which highlighted that the economy was over-reliant on the construction sector.  He has mismanaged the finances of the country and we are now in an appalling situation.</P>
        <P>Cutbacks are effectively happening in front-line services, despite what is being said at Government level.  Any Member in this House could give a list of areas in health that are <Col N="705"/>already experiencing cutbacks.  Next week when we debate the economy in this House, I want to know what direction is being given to the Health Service Executive.  What economic management will take place in the executive?  I ask for transparency with regard to the cuts, as opposed to Members hearing from individuals about the effects of such cuts, whether in speech and language therapy, medical services, accident and emergency departments, hospitals in Galway with no receptionists because of a lack of staff and so forth.  This is what is happening in front-line health services.  Cutbacks are being implemented and we must have some transparency from the HSE and the Government in terms of what is happening on the ground at the moment, as opposed to vague talk about a future economic plan.  I ask for real engagement in this House concerning the cutbacks that are taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Senators in welcoming the release of Ms Ingrid Betancourt.  This is a topical global issue and who knows what minor incremental influence we might have had somewhere along the way, but the fact that nations cared and offered a view on her detention is very important.</P>
        <P>We are in an age when we are able to watch, when CNN decides to broadcast it, rockets going down streets in Baghdad before they turn into whatever house is their intended target that day.  We have watched wars and people being killed on our screens.  Despite this, 24 hours after the release of Ms Betancourt we still do not know if she was rescued, if her release was negotiated or how she happened to be freed.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We do know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>She was rescued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard various reports.  I do not believe she was rescued by the army without a shot being fired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator John McCain spoke about it on the television at 2 a.m. today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also find it difficult to believe that her release was negotiated.  I am simply making the point that we still do not have all the information.  It is another example of how news is manipulated and edited.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate in this House on neutrality in the context of Zimbabwe.  I would like to hear Members indicate what they feel Ireland, Europe and the UN should do.  I am certain about one thing in this regard.  I did not want the Americans taking decisions on their own to invade Iraq and other countries and I would not like to see the same thing happening in relation to Zimbabwe.  However, I would like to see the UN take action.  I would like to see sanctions being implemented and I would not object to military intervention, once it is done in a democratic way.  This is an appropriate time for us to debate this issue.  We have never had a debate on neutrality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>When people speak about neutrality, I never know what they mean precisely.  I know what it means to me but others have a different view.  We must examine the issue of neutrality in the context of Zimbabwe, the good samaritan and so forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>In Cork University Hospital, 48 graduates of the four-year bachelor of science in nursing course, costing &euro;85,000 per student, have been told there are no jobs for them, despite that they were interviewed and had undergone a week&rsquo;s induction, including <Col N="706"/>completing a manual lifting course in compliance with current health and safety legislation.  At the same time, Cork University Hospital has also confirmed that it has 60 vacancies.  It is inconceivable that these nursing professionals would have no jobs available to them, despite that there are identified vacancies.  If these nurses are lost to the profession, it will amount to a shocking waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money by the HSE.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the impact of the downturn in the economy on older people in terms of them not being able to heat their homes this winter.  The price of oil rose by 47% in the 12 months to May of this year.  It is the most common type of fuel used by older people, with 30% of those living alone and 39% of those living with others using oil as their main method of heating.  Bord G&aacute;is has applied to the Commission for Energy Regulation for a 17% to 19% price increase from October and it is believed the ESB has also applied for a double digit increase.</P>
        <P>The rise in fuel prices, together with the demand for fuel crops has driven up the price of essential foods.  This particularly affects older people.  In the 12 months to May the price of flour increased by 39%, milk by 30%, bread by 17%, butter by 17% and tea by 11%.  This is putting a lot of pressure on the capped income of pensioners.  The means test for the fuel allowance must be adjusted.  The real allowance that pensioners received last year amounted to 60 cent per week, which will not be sufficient this winter.</P>
        <P>While I realise this will have to wait until the new session, I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor, who has special responsibility for older people, be invited to the House so that we can discuss the many issues concerning older people, particularly in the context of our current economic difficulties.  Older people are already suffering and will suffer further disadvantage as the year progresses.  The seasons appear to have merged into each other.  I met a young and able person this morning who told me he had to light his fire last night.  It is not just older people who might feel the cold at this time of year although there is a particular cause for concern on their behalf.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in welcoming the release of Ms Ingrid Betancourt.  I also support calls for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider issuing an invitation to Ms Betancourt to come to this House, bearing in mind her availability and ability to do so.  As a former member of the Colombian Senate and a former Green Party presidential candidate in that country, her insight would help us to understand the ongoing difficulties in that country and the plight of the several hundred people who still remain in captivity, as has been mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to the National Cancer Registry statistics and the need for a debate on the transit of hazardous waste and the location of such materials in the country in general.  The Cobh figures for the urban area were 40% above the national average, although the rural area was 25% below the national average.  I welcome that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicated in the other House he will seek Cabinet approval for a baseline health survey to be conducted in the Cork Harbour area, which is the location of most of the hazardous industrial sites in the country.  All factors must be taken into account.</P>
        <P>One of the most disturbing statistics that emerged yesterday, apart from the environmental information, is that the town of Cobh has a deprivation index that rates nine out of ten in terms of how the cancer statistics are put together.  In essence, as far as the National Cancer Registry is concerned, Cobh town is one of the most deprived areas in the country, which represents a challenge for all of the public representatives in that area.</P><Col N="707"/>
        <P>The information that has come to light in recent days justifies the decision of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ask contractors to remove themselves from the Haulbowline site.  There are severe questions as to how such contractors were appointed and supervised.  That hazardous waste was being removed in an unsafe manner would contribute to a debate that needs to be held in this House at the soonest possible opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Against the grim economic background that is growing by the day, I appeal to this House, the Minister for Finance and the Cabinet to apply a very important sense of proportion to the areas to which they apply cuts.  I am referring in particular to the weakest and most vulnerable in our society.  I was phoned by ageing parents yesterday about their 42-year-old disabled daughter who has Down&rsquo;s syndrome and whose entire &euro;22 allowance has been cut.  She works padding headboards.  Worse than this is the fact that her parents&rsquo; respite care, which consists of one weekend per month, has been cut.  The total cut by Ability West in Galway on the instructions of the HSE is a little more than &euro;200,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Her parents told me that this cut is the same amount it took to refurbish the office of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not defending it.  That is just acknowledging that one can run the country whichever way one can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader intervene to request that a sense of proportion in the cuts is retained so that the weakest and most vulnerable people in society are not hurt?  The 100% allowance and respite care of the people to whom I referred are now gone.</P>
        <P>I will look for an early debate in the autumn with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on how dangerous dogs and their owners should be handled in light of the savage attacks on two garda&iacute; in Galway at the weekend by pit bull terriers.  I would appreciate this because one of those garda&iacute; is a neighbour of mine and had 150 stitches as a result of the attack, which could have been fatal.  Across the globe, it is children who suffer and, on many occasions, are the most vulnerable targets for dangerous dogs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of relief at the release from captivity of Ingrid Betancourt.  My question to the Leader relates to another person in captivity in Ireland and the need for a debate on the functioning of our laws against trafficking which were recently passed in this House and the D&aacute;il.  A young Nigerian woman was arrested and brought before the court for failing to show a passport or have identification last Friday.  This person could be a minor and is a suspected victim of trafficking.  Despite that under our trafficking laws and the current administrative provisions there is supposed to be a 45-day <Col N="708"/>reflection period, we find that out of concern for this person, she has been put in jail where she is at the moment.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise.  What is being done by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure suspected victims of trafficking, not just minors, are properly treated and not incarcerated in light of the spirit we are supposed to be following with our new legislation?  This person&rsquo;s identity was revealed in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  Is there a lacuna in our legislation?  In circumstances where there is the prosecution of an offence of trafficking, one can protect the anonymity of the potential victim.  What about a situation, as is likely to occur many times, where the first person to come before the court on a related potential offence is a suspected victim of trafficking?  This is not a matter that can be brought forward in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill.  It may be a matter that requires amending legislation to close this loophole to allow us to protect the anonymity of a suspected victim of trafficking.  I would like to hear from the Leader on that.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to do what he can to ensure there is courtesy among Members in our utterances inside and outside this House.  It has not been edifying to note the type of language used to demonise Senator Jim Walsh and his colleagues in respect of the motion they brought to their parliamentary party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>No one demonised them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, no one from Fine Gael demonised them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not relevant to the Order of Business. </P>

	<P>I will try to control what is said and happens in the House to the best of my ability.  I have no control over what people say outside the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is for the Leader.  I ask him to use his good offices.  The media rightly portrayed how divisive and negative campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s were on various sensitive social issues.  If we are going to go back to the politics of demonisation, which involve calling people &ldquo;dinosaurs&rdquo;, as happened in this House yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it sometimes in the Senator&rsquo;s context?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not and will never use abusive language but we need to try and set a lead so that we recognise the sincere convictions of people of all shades of opinion and treat them with the respect that is due to them, not just as public representatives but as human beings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Leader.  I do not want that debate to develop here every morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate has been very civilised here and is generally of a very high quality.  I do not think people have been engaged in name calling for the sake of it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?  I do not want to go back to that situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the language has been temperate.  We deal with great courtesy with people who express views that are deeply offensive to friends and colleagues.</P>
        <P>I join other Members of the House in welcoming the release of Ingrid Betancourt and the other hostages.  I pay tribute to the group in Ireland that campaigned for her release for many years and which was represented on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  It has done very well and it is with great pride we can say we passed a unanimous motion in this House calling for her release.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on child sex offences and offences of sexual abuse against children.  I support the call made by Senator Fitzgerald yesterday for this debate.  It is a matter of real concern to us all that the Director of Public Prosecutions recently said that he finds it very difficult to prosecute offences of sexual abuse against children.  It is a matter of deep concern to us all.  The problem is clearly that in the aftermath of the CC case and the Supreme Court&rsquo;s striking down of previous offences of strict liability, we are left with legislation that clearly is not effective.  Even the language in the Act, which refers to offences of sexual defilement of children, is problematic.  Senator Alex White said this could be dealt with legislation.  It would be nice to see that happen.  I would favour and have long called for codifying legislation of the type recommended by the DPP similar to the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in the UK which re-enacts absolute liability where an offence of sexual abuse against a child under 13 occurs.  The difficulty in Ireland is that I am not convinced that such legislation is possible under the current constitutional framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The question has gone to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, an amendment may be required to enact effective codifying legislation to cover this.  I ask the Leader for a debate in this House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Leader&rsquo;s announcement that we will have a debate on the economy next week.  As the rain comes down and interest rates go up, this is a clear time of gloom for us all on the economy.  What is important in any debate, as was said yesterday, is that it be fact-based and that no fictions are spoken of in respect of the economy.  It is equally important that we do not engage in hypocrisy.  Yesterday, we saw a great deal of hypocrisy from those on the Government side who criticised its handling of the economy and yet presumably will vote with the Government side on any vote on the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have that in the debate next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to speak about the heroic release last night of Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt after six years in captivity.  This is an important day for democracy.  Ms Betancourt was a candidate for the high office of President of Colombia when she was captured by FARC guerrillas and held captive in the jungle for six years.  What she must have endured in that time, we can only imagine.  Her composure and dignity on release is an example to us all.  That Ms Betancourt could consider running for the presidency again is remarkable and shows her strength of spirit.  I compliment the people here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to have a debate on human rights as soon as possible in the new session.  Columbia is a country bordering on neo-totalitarianism.  The members of the Columbian Government are not saints.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of all speakers regarding the release from captivity of Ingrid Betancourt.  I agree with the sentiments expressed.</P>
        <P>This morning we learned of the European Court of Justice ruling on the Derrybrien incident of a few years ago.  This concerned environmental impact assessments and the fact that one was not conducted in that instance.  It seems that the judgment, the detail of which we await, criticises Ireland&rsquo;s practice.  This has serious consequences for planning and I would like to hear the views of the Leader on the subject.</P>
        <P>In this time of recession, we are over-regulated in this country.  We need rationalisation of regulators.  This would provide for better regulation.  The administrative burden of regulation is huge.  We should set about reducing it.  Every Department should be required to conduct an efficiency audit.  Members regularly talk about the paper mountain and the number of reports we receive without requesting them.  People think they are doing well with that but we can effect a major cost reduction across the board with this exercise.  The Government should urgently examine this and perhaps we could have a debate on regulators and regulation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in welcoming the release of Ingrid Betancourt.  I compliment those who raised the issue in this House.  We have played our role in that regard by making people aware of the existence of this fine lady and what she must have been suffering.  I also welcome the release of other hostages.  I hope that a firm message is sent to people who use hostage taking as a military activity.  It must be the lowest and most brutal form of military activity.  The civilised world must make it clear that under no circumstances does it serve any cause.</P>
        <P>We should highlight other issues regarding people in captivity.  It is easy for them to be overlooked.  We should allocate a certain amount of time to human rights issues on a regular basis because it is clear that the Seanad has been a potent agency.  Unfortunately, we tend to focus on issues that have already been highlighted in the media, such as the Middle East and Guantanamo Bay.  They disappear off the radar very quickly.  I am still convinced that we are listened to, that embassies and agencies in this country and elsewhere are monitoring what is being said.  We might take it as a priority role in the future to highlight these issues.</P>
        <P>It is good to see the sense of relief among ordinary decent people at the release.  It shows they are conscious of what is happening.  They have no voice and depend on us to give that voice.  We can be an exceptionally powerful and honest powerbroker in this regard because of the country we are.  We can feel happy at the role we played in this case.</P>

	<P>Adding my voice to the relief and delight at the release of Ingrid Betancourt, I am reminded that I met Mr. Don Tidey last weekend.  It is not that long ago that Mr. Tidey went through the same thing.  We should remember both the young soldier and the young garda who lost their lives at his rescue.</P>
        <P>In seeking a debate on Northern Ireland last week, which may not happen next week but which should be kept in mind, I noted how short a distance in time since we had similar problems.  I am inclined to criticise those of us who do not have Northern connections of being quite partitionist in our attitudes.  We give a great amount of attention to good news from this part of the world.  Last night, it was announced that Seagate Technology, a company that had been in Clonmel some time ago, intends to spend &pound;120 million in Derry to open a new factory.  We do not give this even the same amount of attention.  I encourage us to recognise the sense of peace in Northern Ireland, which I hope will continue, and to celebrate good news across the 32 counties.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I raised my concern at the behaviour of one bank in Britain, which does not operate in Ireland, which targets children.  When I met the banks at the Oireachtas Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, I asked to be assured that they would not target children by sending them debit cards they could use in cash machines.  I received a reasonable assurance that this was not their intention in Ireland.  The other good news is that there was a young man in the same bank who went to a cash machine in Britain and discovered he had a balance of &pound;2 million.  He is a 16 year old and spent it on trainers, clothing and an iPod.  The interesting point is that, when questioned, he said he thought it was a government grant.</P>

        <P>I welcome the decentralisation of the HSE, something for which we have been calling for some time.  I am a Senator for almost one year and Members have sought the decentralisation of the HSE.  I am pleased that the article in the <i>The Irish Times</i> provides a breakdown.  I call for a full debate on the way the HSE will be decentralised and regionalised.  More local democracy should be included in the HSE when it is done.  This is an opportunity for the House to examine new legislation necessary for the regionalisation of the HSE.  It is also an opportunity for us to examine overstaffing in managerial positions.</P>

        <P>I welcome the investment of &euro;72 million in Shanganagh sewerage plant announced yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in welcoming last night&rsquo;s news of the freedom of Ingrid Betancourt.  Rather than issuing her with an invitation, what she most needs is to spend time with her friends and family and perhaps she needs space prior to the descent of the world&rsquo;s media on her.</P>
        <P>With regard to the debate on the economy which we will have next week, I wish to speak about affordable housing and how the Government can help to kick-start the construction industry.  Not many years ago, the previous Taoiseach spoke about building thousands of new affordable homes at the old military site in Gormanston, County Meath.  The housing figures in Meath show a need for more affordable housing.  In neighbouring Kildare, hundreds of people are waiting on the affordable housing list in Celbridge.  We know the stalled affordable scheme in Dublin is causing concern.  The Government can kick-start the construction industry by investing more in affordable housing schemes.  Will the Leader impress this upon the Minister and perhaps arrange for us to have a statement from him on the matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>Members will have received the Electoral (Amendment) Bill published last week.  We had consensus in both Houses with regard to counties such as Leitrim which have been subdivided, including the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s county, part of which has been included in Munster.  As long as it is not for hurling purposes I suppose it will be acceptable.  Part of Meath is with Louth, part of Offaly is with Tipperary and part of west Limerick is with Kerry.  Everybody is being thrown to the wolves.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party leader, Deputy Gilmore, gave a commitment that he wanted to see something done with regard to county boundaries.  Many Fine Gael Members who spoke in both Houses were of the same opinion.  Given that the Bill will not come before either House prior to the autumn, perhaps it would be a good idea to ask the Minister to refer it back to a new commission whose terms of reference should be that county boundaries should not be broken.  To ensure the people of Leitrim have representation and the people of south Offaly are not represented in Tipperary, the number of Deputies could be increased from 166 to 168.  The previous commission had the opportunity to do this but did not take it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, when the banks appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, they indicated that people suffering from negative equity and with cash flow problems are collateral damage of an economic bubble which has burst.  A cash flow problem can close a business.  Has the Minister for Finance any plans to increase the amount of credit available in Irish markets?  The Government, through the National Treasury Management Agency, has a large amount of assets tied up.  It is possible for some of these assets to be transferred into deposit accounts in all of the major banks in Ireland.  This could improve the credit flow for Irish banks, if this is the problem.</P>
        <P>The banks do not consider they have a problem, although their shares have collapsed.  People with mortgages and negative equity face serious problems.  If the economy needs to be stimulated, the Government has a role to play and it could use the National Treasury Management Agency and its assets to do so.  Will we get an idea next week from the Minister for Finance on whether he has plans to improve matters rather than cutting back and borrowing in the way he has indicated so far?</P><Col N="713"/>
        <P>I would also like a debate on the HSE.  The HSE has only been established for four years and an organisation has never undergone so much chopping and changing and centralising and decentralising.  The HSE was supposed to have been well thought out before it was begun.  It is a complete mess.  It is time we had a proper debate on it.  Every time we discuss it we are accused of being against reform.  All of the Government parties state the HSE is a mess but vote for the Government.  Will we have a proper debate on this?  This side of the House has indicated that the HSE and its structures have been a mess from the outset.</P>

	<P>It is time we had a proper debate on what happening in the HSE because it is costing patient&rsquo;s lives.  The Leader should organise this immediately.</P>
        <P>I extend my welcome for Ingrid Betancourt&rsquo;s release.  We should extend an invitation to her to address this House.  Democracy is fragile and she has experience of what can happen when one stands up for democracy and how human rights can be so easily abused.  It would be interesting to have not only Ingrid Betancourt addressing the House, but also opposition leaders of other countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.  The Seanad should extend an invitation to them and provide them with an opportunity to speak in a forum such as this about democracy, human rights and how we can make a better life for everybody.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator John Ellis in his comments on the boundary commission.  What has happened in the recent report is nothing short of ludicrous.  The entire county of Leitrim is without representation.  The northern part of my county of Westmeath is to be part of a three seat constituency in Meath.  We know from history about the creation of the counties but over the years the people of Ireland have developed an affinity to their county and as such they view it in a certain way.  Many people are no longer Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann arising from the recent boundary changes.  There has also been recent local electoral changes.  In my time as a local authority member I served in three different local authority electoral areas and I managed to survive.</P>
        <P>This commission report should be referred back.  I am glad people from all sides are of this view.  The message should go from this House that this should happen.  The recent report is not conducive to good governance and has not served well the fact that the people of Ireland have developed an affinity and loyalty to their counties.  I ask that the report be sent back for a complete review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>To restore some of the harmony which normally exists on the Independent benches, I wish to show the unanimity we feel about Ingrid Betancourt&rsquo;s release and I acknowledge the role my colleagues played in bringing this to the House and I hope we played some part in ensuring her release.</P>
        <P>The debate we will have next week is all very well but while the HSE should be put under scrutiny, it is an easy target.  I ask the Leader for an opportunity to examine in far greater detail another State agency, namely, F&Aacute;S, which has been something of a sacred cow in this and the other House for many years.  Recent revelations about activities in the agency are disturbing and uncomfortable and we should be prepared to tackle them.  F&Aacute;S has a budget of &euro;870 million and the Minister for Finance could consider this as being worthy of severe cuts when he examines cutbacks in the economy next week.  Judging by the revelations, it is in danger of becoming a political slush fund and it is difficult to know where the money allocated <Col N="714"/>to F&Aacute;S by the Oireachtas and the European Union has been going.  Perhaps we should welcome the European Commission asking what is happening to its money and where it is going because the Comptroller and Auditor General had some harsh words to say about F&Aacute;S in a recent report.  The impression is going abroad &mdash; I suspect it is right &mdash; that the agency has too much money and too little to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I am about to ask for a debate.  During the period of boom and employment, F&Aacute;S, although it had a mandate to tackle unemployment, had an inexplicable budget.  I do not dispute the organisation does good work and politicians, as a result, are reluctant to tackle the agency because they can always get it as a political favour in their constituency.  However, the F&Aacute;S budget is an absolute monster and the Minister should examine it in light of recent revelations and announce cutbacks in the House next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on environmental matters, with specific reference to the toxic dump at Haulbowline and others in the State.  I called some months ago for a debate on legacy landfills.  The Government and the State face many environmental and financial challenges because of those dumps.  There are EU and domestic obligations on the Government to deal with landfills in a proper, efficient and professional manner.  Our citizens depend on the Government and the professionalism of local authorities and Departments to protect their fundamental rights, including their environmental rights, and the environment in which they live.  It is important the House debates the matter.</P>
        <P>This is not an isolated incident.  For example, Senator Kelly has raised concerns about Silvermines in County Tipperary.  In my constituency, Irish Tanners Limited has a toxic landfill only 100 metres from the intake for the Waterford city water supply.  A blind eye has been turned to this matter for many years both by the local authority and by the Department.  The Haulbowline, Silvermines and Irish Tanners sites as well as many other legacy landfills need the urgent attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I am not taking a cheap shot at him.  We want to help him tackle these challenges because they are legacy issues spanning many generations.</P>

	<P>I have raised the issue of the HSE&rsquo;s failure to spend the &euro;50 million allocated for disabilities in last year&rsquo;s budget on anything to do with disability and I have also raised on the Order of Business and on the Adjournment the plight of school leavers with disabilities who left school last week with no assurance of a placement in September.  I, therefore, welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, that the money will be spent by the HSE on the planned disability projects this year and, in particular, that school leavers will have placements in September, which will do away with a summer of anxiety for them and their families.  Having ensured the money will be spent on disability issues, will the Leader invite the Minister of State to the House next week, if possible, to ensure it is spent in meaningful ways in order that <Col N="715"/>people with disabilities receive every support and opportunity to realise their full potential and their equal role in our society?</P>
        <P>I refer to yesterday&rsquo;s calls about the DPP&rsquo;s comments on sexual assault legislation.  The joint committee is sitting but its work is complex and it needs to complete it as a matter of urgency.  However, any amendments to legislation should not only provide for the protection of children but also vulnerable adults, whether they have a disability, an age-related disorder or mental health problems.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Senator Coffey&rsquo;s call for a debate on environmental issues.  He referred to Silvermines.  Unfortunately, Government commitments to date in this area have not been up to the level required.  Three schools lie within a  short distance of the Silvermines dumps.  There are six times more carcinogenics in the air in this locality than anywhere else.  Unless dust blows containing toxic particles can be prevented, the future of the school children and other people in Silvermines is not good.  The issue needs to be addressed and I have called on the Government on a number of occasions to support a total clean up in the area.  I would welcome a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the House had a good debate on the OECD report on the public service.  I endorse Senator Ross&rsquo;s comments about State agencies.  The current buzz word is &ldquo;public service reform&rdquo;.  Performance management is a component of the public service and partnership.  How many senior managers and chief executives go through the performance management process to have their performance measured on the tiered basis required?  In most cases, the staff of these agencies are monitored but how many chief executives are interviewed by their chairperson?  How many senior managers go through the process with their chief executive?  An audit of all State agencies and the Civil Service should be conducted quickly but performance management reviews are not taking place at the level required and tokenism is the order of the day.</P>
        <P>A few weeks ago, the Labour Party used Private Members&rsquo; time to seek amendments to the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.  We were 100% right.  The Act, as amended, is permitting State agencies and other bodies to use generic loopholes to avoid giving out information.  A number of Senators, including myself, have submitted FOI requests to the HSE, which provides a generic response that it would be detrimental to the future of the organisation and to industrial relations to provide the information requested.  That is a load of codswallop.  I have seen e-mails referring to reports about which I have submitted FOI requests.  The Teamwork reports are available and people are referring to them at meetings but when I submit a FOI request seeking a draft report, the HSE will not provide it.  Professor Drumm should publish the reports or provide them to Members because what he is doing is totally unprofessional and it is detrimental to us as politicians and to a debate in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Committee on Procedures and Privileges can examine this issue.  We have had 12 months of proceedings and perhaps we should return to my original proposal to place a time limit on Senators who wish to make a contribution following the group leaders.  It would assist the Cathaoirleach and the House and, as the Cathaoirleach pointed out yesterday, Senator Quinn made two points in less than half a minute, which speaks for itself.</P>
        <P>I join with colleagues in welcoming the news of the rescue by Colombian military forces of Ingrid Betancourt and 14 other hostages who had been held captive by FARC rebels for a long <Col N="716"/>time.  Ms Betancourt had been held captive for six years in a remote jungle area of the country.  I wish her and the other 14 hostages who were released well for the future and call upon the FARC rebels to release, immediately and unconditionally, their considerable number of remaining hostages.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Boyle, Bacik, White, Coghlan, Hannigan, Twomey, Coffey and Kelly expressed their concerns about the environmental challenge facing the island of Ireland and called for an urgent debate on the issue, particularly with regard to regulations.  The health of our citizens is sacrosanct and I will have no difficulty allocating time for such a debate at the earliest opportunity in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames and other Senators called for a debate on the economy and the challenges it faces.  I thank the nine Senators who contributed to the debate yesterday on the OECD report on the public service, but I was disappointed that the time allocated for the debate was not fully utilised.  Three Fianna F&aacute;il and three Fine Gael Senators as well as one Senator each from the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Labour Party participated in the debate.  The leaders in the House try to plan the business for the week on foot of requests made on the Order of Business but yesterday I was left wondering why the full amount of time was not used to discuss such an important issue.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole called for a debate on Zimbabwe in the context of our neutrality.  It is a good idea and I will allocate time for that debate in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast and many other Members raised a number of issues with regard to the HSE.  I wish to record once again my thanks to the Minister, Deputy Harney, for attending the debate last night.  Each time she has been invited to the House throughout the first year of this 23rd Seanad she has shown the House great respect by participating in debates whenever possible and outlining the challenges that face her and her Department with regard to the health portfolio.  I will note all the matters raised by the Senators.  I have a document detailing the considerable amounts of money that were allocated in the last and previous budgets to the health portfolio and to the portfolio of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  The amounts are considerable and I intend to provide a copy of the document to colleagues rather than take up the time of the House discussing them.  The figures speak for themselves.  I assure Senator Prendergast, who is the acting leader of the Labour Party in the House this morning, that her call, and that of other Members, for further debates on the HSE will be noted and a debate can be organised for early in the next session.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast also correctly raised the serious concern about the proposed increases in gas and electricity prices and how this will affect older people, particularly with regard to home heating.  I am sure Senator McFadden and Members from rural areas will agree that this is the main reason that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have to seriously consider, in the context of creating an opportunity to use alternative fuels for heating homes, a relaxation of the regulations with regard to turf cutting.  We will invite the Minister to the House early in the next session to ensure that this takes place.  Common sense must prevail.  If there is a challenge facing the world, Members on all sides of the House will respect the long-term aspiration of the Minister but the short-term good of the people we represent must take precedence in this regard.</P>
        <P>I will convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s views on dangerous dogs.  The horrific attack by dogs on the garda in Galway at the weekend shows what a danger such dogs are to society.  Senator Keaveney has raised this issue on many occasions on the Order of Business.</P><Col N="717"/>
        <P>Senators Mullen and Bacik asked for a debate on human trafficking and sex offences against children.  Senator Corrigan also raised this issue.  I will allocate time for such a debate.  Senator Mullen also mentioned the media spin regarding the remarks of Senator Jim Walsh.  Senator Walsh has been a respected Member of the House for many years and was chairman and secretary of the long-standing organisation, LAMA, which represents the local authority members.  He has a huge amount of experience.  He must be allowed to express his opinions like everybody else, and should not be demonised for doing so.  I respect the views he holds.  There was a questionable spin put on the call he made to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I must listen to the views of all Senators on the matters they wish to address.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White called for a debate on human rights in the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I will arrange such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan sought a debate and an update on the Government&rsquo;s position regarding the European Court of Justice judgment announced this morning on the Derrybrien incident.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Quinn, I welcome the announcement by Seagate Technology of a &pound;100 million investment in Derry.  It is good news for the north western counties of Derry, Donegal, Tyrone and Fermanagh.  I visited Derry recently and I am aware the investment will be a godsend to the people there.  They deserve it.  We are delighted and congratulate everybody associated with making it possible.  There is a meeting later today of the Good Friday Agreement committee, of which I am a member.  I will convey our congratulations to the members of the committee from those communities.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler called for a debate on the HSE.  I have already said there will be such a debate, particularly in view of the report in the newspapers this morning that it is due to regionalise its structure.  I would welcome such a move.  Like the Cathaoirleach, Senator Glynn and other Senators, I was a member of the Midland Health Board for many years.  It was always possible to reach personnel by telephone to discuss the difficulties about which we were trying to make representations.  The big difference with the HSE is that this facility is no longer available.  Colleagues on all sides of the House would agree with that.</P>

	<P>It is of the utmost importance that all Senators read the Standing Orders.  I am saying this for the last time &mdash; we should respect one another when making contributions.  I do not heckle anyone.  When Senators have the decency to ask serious questions, they should also have the decency to listen to the responses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have no difficulty setting aside time for a debate on the regionalising of the HSE, as requested by Senator Butler.  I welcome the announcement of &euro;72 million in respect of the Shanganagh sewerage scheme.  It is no wonder the Senator is pleased.  The money will be well spent on this project.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the serious housing issue, which I have considered.  Rather than having a discussion using a portion of next Wednesday&rsquo;s financial debate, I propose that we leave the afternoon free after next Tuesday&rsquo;s Order of Business to debate housing.  It will meet Senators&rsquo; requests concerning matters pertaining to the construction and housing industries, the challenges facing local authorities and everything else covered in the housing portfolio <Col N="719"/>of the new Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, a former Senator.  Given that it will be the only matter on the agenda, every Senator will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this serious issue facing the country.</P>
        <P>Senators Ellis and Glynn expressed their concerns regarding the report of the Constituency Commission and the upcoming Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008.  Every Senator has a responsibility to state whether political parties agree with the breaking of county boundaries.  Among others, Senator Ellis and I have been badly affected in this regard, but we are only individuals and everyone must realise that individuals are temporary passages of flight.  No one is more important than the people.  Their democratic wishes must be held sacrosanct.</P>
        <P>To leave a county without representation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not good policy and does not make sense.  Senator Ellis&rsquo;s request may need to be addressed by the chairmen of the various parliamentary parties and the Independents in the House.  If they can agree with the Senator&rsquo;s request, we can make progress on the proposal.  I will leave the matter for the consideration of the parliamentary groupings.  Senator Ellis has made a passionate plea to all of his parliamentary colleagues to express to the political establishment, including the Government, that County Leitrim deserves D&aacute;il representation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>They must ask the establishment what it will do about this matter.  Given that Senator Ellis has represented the people of County Leitrim in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad for almost three decades, this request is not being made by a first-timer.  It is being made on behalf of the people of County Leitrim.  I want to know what can be done in the interests of fairness.  Were any other county left without D&aacute;il representation, we would hear more about the situation.  How do the political parties view the proposal?  The Government side and Fianna F&aacute;il in particular will not be found wanting if other parties are agreeable.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly made known his strong opinions regarding his experience of making freedom of information requests to the HSE.  His complaint was serious and the Minister for Health and Children has a responsibility to ensure such does not recur.  The Senator should be assisted in acquiring information, particularly given that it was already in the public domain in another form.  That an elected Member of the Upper House of the Oireachtas was denied information is a serious matter.  Perhaps the Minister and Professor Drumm should ensure such does not recur.  Senator Kelly&rsquo;s proposal regarding management performance and an audit of State agencies is worthwhile.  Perhaps it could be formally made during next Wednesday&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey made a proposal on financial matters and the National Treasury Management Agency in particular.  These and negative equity issues can be debated next Wednesday when the Minister for Finance is in attendance.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross called for an urgent debate on the role of F&Aacute;S during the next four years, given its budget of &euro;70 million in respect of the special responsibility with which it has been charged, namely, upskilling 60% of the workforce between now and 2020.  The challenge is a serious one and immediate action must be taken.  Any regulation that interferes with anyone who loses his or her job by, for example, requiring that he or she be unemployed for the six months prior to upskilling must be removed.  Given that the employers of people in their 30s, 40s or 50s who want to avail of courses may not be in a financial position to pay the 25% requirement, F&Aacute;S should provide 100% of the funding.  Surely the &euro;70 million has been allocated to upskill people to face tomorrow&rsquo;s challenges.  In the national development plan, in excess of &euro;4 billion has been allocated up to 2020.  We want immediate action and assistance to be given to everyone experiencing an employment difficulty.  I would have no difficulty in setting aside time to debate this matter.</P><Col N="720"/>
        <P>Senator Corrigan welcomed the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, of &euro;50 million in respect of disability services.  I will determine whether the House can set aside one hour before the summer recess to discuss with the Minister of State his proposals regarding the distribution of that money.  Senator Corrigan also referred to the opinions expressed by the DPP on sexual assault cases and adults vulnerable to assault.  I will convey her strong remarks to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I thank the Leader for his unprecedented identification of speakers during a debate.  I assure him that he has lost much of this side&rsquo;s co-operation.  He should apologise to the Senator he threatened to name.  Despite the fact that the Leader of the House stood and asked a Member on this side to read the Standing Orders, he does not have the option of naming anyone.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Standing Orders are clear and I advise him to read them.  Instead of looking at the number of speakers who do not appear for a debate, a matter that will be regularly shoved his way during the coming months, he should read Standing Orders 50 and 51.  They state that only the Cathaoirleach may name a Member of the House.  An apology and a withdrawal of the threat made by the Leader would be in order at this stage.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that what I actually said was that if the Cathaoirleach asked me to name someone, I would.  The record is there to prove it.  On another point of clarification, I did not indicate to any Senator, rather I only asked all Senators, and the record will be there to prove that as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make it absolutely clear that irrespective of whether the Leader asked the Cathaoirleach whether he would name someone, the answer is still the same.  Even if the Cathaoirleach said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that, the Leader still could not do so.  Will the Cathaoirleach clarify that for the House?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators on this side of the House should not be threatened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It was not a threat.</P>

        <P>The point of order I want to make is that I am concerned about the number of Fine Gael Senators who did not get an opportunity to speak today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Cathaoirleach would name those Senators who did not get an opportunity to speak and take them first the next day.  He has done so previously.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a point of order.  It is certainly a matter for me in the Chair.  I certainly did my utmost in that regard today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said yesterday that I would take those Senators who did not get an opportunity to speak yesterday first this morning, and I did that.  I was trying to be helpful to those Senators who missed out yesterday.  In regard to the Senators who missed the opportunity to speak today, I will take them first next week.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and for the Senators if they want to control the speaking times.  I cannot do any more unless I have a way of switching off a speaker and moving on to the next speaker.  I cannot shorten the contribution of Members who spend time raising an issue.  Two minutes more was spent on this matter this morning than should have been spent on it.  I regret that six Senators failed to get the opportunity to speak this morning.</P>

	<P>On a point of order, I am not questioning the Chair&rsquo;s ruling on Senators who missed out on the opportunity to speak this morning being called the following day, but I foresee a difficulty with that down the line, and perhaps the Committee on Procedure <Col N="722"/>and Privileges might consider it.  In other words, if six or seven Members from either side want to book time for the following day, they would merely have to put up their hands and six people from one side could be called in rotation.  The Cathaoirleach might consider that suggestion. </P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, line 34, after &ldquo;text&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The point covered in this amendment was raised by my party during the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il.  The amendment seeks to reflect the fact that there are six languages in the original text.  The Bill, as drafted, refers specifically to one language and we ask that this be reflected by the insertion of the words &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;text&rdquo;.  As the Bill stands, the Schedule referred to is only one-sixth of what is in the other conventions.  A similar provision has been included in other Acts such as Aviation Act of 2006, the International Criminal Court Act 2006 and the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006.</P>

	<P>Section 1 contains the usual provision of a general nature dealing with such matters as interpretation and is a standard feature of all legislation.  I have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office that the Government cannot accept this Opposition amendment as the language used in the Bill in regard to the treaty in terms of the Schedule is English.  Therefore, there is no need to insert the wording &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; in the section.  As the Senator said, this point was raised during the debate on the Bill in the Dail.  I have been in contact with the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s office and that is the advice I have received.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I fail to understand why the Minister of State will not accept this point.  It is clear there are five other texts in the convention, yet this Bill only relates to the word text.  We need to be specific and insert that the text is English.  I will not push the amendment to a vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and colleagues on all sides of the House for the passing of the Bill.  The approach adopted by all sides is a victory for common sense.  It clearly shows the seriousness with which members from all sides viewed the contents of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I hope the other states who have yet to ratify the treaty will proceed to do so.  I wish the Bill well.  I hope it never impinge on this little State in any adverse way.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the manner in which they have guided it through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, thank the Minister of State for bringing this Bill before the House.  As I said on Second Stage I thank the officials who drafted this comprehensive Bill.  It reinforces and enhances Ireland&rsquo;s position in regard to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.  We are making a statement by enacting into law a Bill which legislates for issues <Col N="725"/>which, as Senator Glynn has said, we hope will never have to face, namely, any nuclear explosions in the jurisdiction of this State by any person or citizen of this State.  I wish the Bill well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on bringing this Bill to the House.  Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to speak on Second Stage, having missed by about ten seconds, but I made some points to the Minister of State afterwards.  My only concern is that while the treaty was open for signature in 1999 it has yet to come into force.  Some 176 countries have signed the treaty and Ireland is the 136th to do so.  I congratulate the Minister of State for accepting the tenor of the amendments tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate the Minister of State and his officials and thank him for taking on board the spirit of our amendments.  Like Senator Glynn I hope the passage of this Bill will help other countries move on towards ratification, especially the United States.  I hope a message goes out from our Government to the ambassador that this Bill has passed into law and I hope that will put some pressure on the US.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and all Senators who contributed to the debate and their co-operation in taking all Stages.  The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty will make an important contribution towards preventing the proliferation of materials, technologies and knowledge that can be used for nuclear weapons &mdash; one of the most important challenges facing the world today.  Like all Senators I hope we can get the remaining countries to sign up to and ratify the treaty.  The treaty, through its verification system, will also bring scientific and civil benefits, including those I mentioned yesterday, such as tsunami warning systems and possible other disaster alert systems, through civil and scientific applications of waveform radio nuclide technologies and the use of the data.  I thank all Senators for their positive comments and a constructive debate.</P>

    <Title>Chemicals Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring before this House the Chemicals Bill 2008.  The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il and reflects amendments based on some important issues raised by Opposition parties.  I will highlight these in going through the Bill.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the enforcement of certain EU regulations concerning chemicals.  These EU regulations include the REACH regulation, REACH being the acronym for the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, the regulation concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals under the Rotterdam Convention, and the detergents regulation.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides the means for giving effect to EU directives concerning the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.  The Bill does not apply to waste, human or veterinary medicines, food flavourings or feedstuffs, all of which will continue to be regulated under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the three EU regulations with which this Bill is concerned are directly applicable in Ireland.  That means their provisions must be complied with and cannot be <Col N="726"/>changed by any implementing legislation.  Therefore, the provisions of the Bill relate only to measures necessary for enforcement.</P>
        <P>Chemicals are critical to the way we live today.  They form part of virtually everything we make and use and provide enormous benefits to society.  Some chemicals, however, can present risks to human health and the environment.  They may cause damage if, for instance, they are toxic or carcinogenic, or they may give rise to major accidents if not properly controlled.  For that reason, it is important to have systems in place to identify, monitor and control chemicals and their effects while continuing to ensure they are available for the benefit of society.</P>
        <P>I will summarise the background and context for the Bill, outline briefly the approach taken in framing it and then describe the purpose and reasoning behind each section.  The best known of the EU regulations being given further effect to by this Bill is the EU REACH regulation.  This entered into force on 1 June 2007, giving a legal basis to the new European Chemicals Agency.  Most of the provisions of the REACH regulation entered into force on 1 June 2008 and the enactment of this Bill will ensure the necessary enforcement measures are in place without undue delay.  Under REACH, the burden of proof lies with industry.  All manufacturers and importers of chemicals must identify and manage risks linked to the chemicals they manufacture and market.  For chemicals produced or imported in quantities of 1 tonne or more per year per enterprise, manufacturers and importers need to demonstrate they have done so by means of registering the chemicals with the European Chemicals Agency.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that about 30,000 chemicals in use will have to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency.  The full registration will take place over a period of ten years from now, starting with chemicals with the greatest risk and finishing with those with the least risk.  However, all these chemicals are subject to pre-registration at the European Chemicals Agency over a six-month period which began on 1 June 2008.  That means all manufacturers and importers of chemicals will have to pre-register chemicals by 1 December 2008.  The European Chemicals Agency is expecting 130,000 pre-registrations over the six-month period.  During the first two weeks of pre-registration, the agency reported 7,360 pre-registrations.  It may then check that each chemical complies with the regulation and must evaluate testing proposals submitted by the registrant to ensure the assessment of the chemical substances will not result in unnecessary testing, especially on animals.</P>
        <P>REACH also provides for an authorisation system aimed at ensuring substances of very high concern are properly controlled and progressively replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies where these are economically and technically viable.  Where this is not possible, the use of substances may only be authorised where there is an overall benefit to society from using the substance.  In addition, REACH provides for the imposition of restrictions on the manufacture, use or placing on the market of substances causing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.  That is a feature of existing EU legislation.  REACH is probably the most ambitious chemicals legislation in the world.  It should enable us to significantly increase our knowledge on the use of chemicals and on how to use them safely.</P>
        <P>The EU regulation on the export and import of dangerous chemical implements in the EU is the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent.  A dangerous chemical that is listed in the annexes of the EU regulation may only be exported with the prior consent of the importer in the importing country.  In addition to provisions relating to chemicals listed in the annexes, the regulation also contains provisions that apply to all chemicals when exported.  These provisions address, in particular, requirements on packaging and labelling as specified by respective Community legislation.  The objective of the procedure under the regulation is to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to the environmentally sound use of such chemicals.</P><Col N="727"/>
        <P>The detergents regulation entered into force on 8 October 2005, replacing five directives concerning the biodegradability of surfactants, which are chemicals used in detergents to give them the ability to remove dirt, but that can have adverse effects on the environment.  The scope of the regulation is to harmonise rules relating to the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents, restrictions or bans on surfactants on grounds of biodegradability, additional labelling of detergents, including fragrance allergens, and information that manufacturers must hold at the disposal of the member states&rsquo; competent authorities and medical personnel.  The key aims of the regulation are to safeguard the Single Market in these products and to ensure a high level of environmental protection.</P>
        <P>The approach in framing the Chemicals Bill was to provide a clear regulatory framework for business that would result in high levels of compliance and increased co-operation between the various national authorities in order to maximise efficiencies in enforcement.  The draft heads of the Bill were the subject of public consultation in October and November 2007, and a regulatory impact assessment was carried out on a number of enforcement options.  The analysis in the regulatory impact assessment concluded that the principal benefits of the Chemicals Bill should be high levels of compliance; reduced administrative costs to business; increased co-operation between the various national authorities that will be involved in enforcement, and a coherent legal framework, which is an important factor for industry, and that would also further the better regulation agenda.</P>
        <P>By taking the approach of putting all enforcement measures in one Bill, the Chemicals Bill should put in place a more streamlined and coherent legal framework for the regulation of chemicals in Ireland.  For example, the detergents regulation, which is currently given further effect by statutory instrument, has been brought within the scope of the Bill to streamline and make more effective the national enforcement arrangements.  In addition, existing regulations apply to the control of major accident hazards made under the European Communities Act.  Remaking those regulations under the Bill when enacted will further streamline the approach to legislating for chemicals.</P>
        <P>Section 1 is a standard section, providing for the short title of the Bill and the commencement on enactment of ministerial order of its various provisions.  Section 2 is a standard interpretation provision.  The Bill, the directly applicable EU regulations and any regulations that may be made under section 5 are collectively described as the relevant chemicals statutory provisions.  Section 3 is a standard section and provides for the methods of serving notices under the Bill.  Section 4 is a standard provision, providing for Exchequer funding of administrative expenses.  Section 5 enables the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make regulations under the Bill.  EU regulations, as Senators are aware, are directly applicable but it can be necessary to make national regulations containing supplementary or incidental provisions.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may also, with the consent of each of the named Ministers with a specific functional responsibility, make regulations giving effect to an Act adopted by an institution of the European Communities relating to chemicals, including the control of major accident hazards relating to chemicals.  Currently regulations under the European Communities Act govern this area.  The provision in the Bill to make replacement regulations should result in a clearer legal framework.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides that the Health and Safety Authority can review legislation at the behest of the Minister or on its own initiative and make proposals to the Minister as appropriate.  Before it does so, it will be required to consult other parties as appropriate.  That is similar to provisions in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The chemicals area is complex and clear guidance is required to help industry comply with the relevant statutory frameworks.  Accordingly, section 7 provides for national codes of practice to be drawn up by the Health and Safety Authority setting out practical guidance as regards compliance.  Section 8 prescribes <Col N="728"/>the national authorities for the purposes of the EU regulations.  Six different national authorities are named, spanning the functional responsibility areas of five different Departments.  The Health and Safety Authority is given functions under all three EU regulations.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is given functions relating to pesticides under the two relevant EU regulations.  The Environmental Protection Agency is given functions under the REACH regulation in respect of the prevention of environmental pollution and under the detergents regulation in respect of matters relating to biodegradability of surfactants in detergents.  The  Minister for Health and Children is given a function under the detergents regulation relating to information on chemicals necessary for medical purposes.  The Irish National Accreditation Board is given a function to approve laboratories under the detergents regulation.  Last but not least, the Revenue Commissioners are given a function for controlling exports and imports under the export-import regulation.  The nomination of the range of national authorities under the Bill reflects the horizontal nature of chemicals policy, ensures that the relevant expertise from across the whole system is part of the enforcement framework, and reflects the policy choice of creating an enforcement network using existing structures.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for co-operation among the national authorities in regard to their functions under the Bill.  The purpose of the provision is to encourage and facilitate optimal efficiency and effectiveness by national authorities in carrying out their functions under the Bill.  The section also allows national authorities to make mutual co-operation arrangements with relevant authorities in other EU and EEA member states.  Section 10 allows a national authority, subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, to charge appropriate fees in regard to the performance of its functions or the provision, by that national authority, of services.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for the appointment of inspectors for the enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions and section 12 sets out their general powers.  Section 13 provides for the immunity and indemnity of inspectors or members of staff of a national authority.  Section 14 allows an inspector to issue a direction for an improvement plan if he or she is of the opinion that an activity is being carried out that involves a risk to human health or the environment.  Section 15 allows an inspector to issue a person with a contravention notice where the inspector is of the opinion that the person concerned is contravening the relevant chemicals statutory provisions.  That could include the removal from the market of a chemical.  Section 16 provides that an inspector may issue a prohibition notice if he or she is of the opinion that an activity is occurring that represents a serious risk to human health or the environment.  Section 17 allows an inspector to apply to the High Court for an order to enforce compliance with a prohibition notice.  Section 18 provides that a national authority may direct any of its staff or another appropriate person, that is, other than an inspector, to carry out an investigation and make a report of that investigation.  Section 19 applies where a national authority considers that an activity contravening the relevant chemicals statutory provisions is a serious risk to human health or the environment.  In such a case, the section provides that the national authority may apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting that activity.  Sections 20 and 22 effectively enable officers of Customs and Excise to act in the general enforcement of statutory provisions governing chemicals and also to take action at the specific request of a national authority.</P>
        <P>Section 21 relates to evidence in proceedings and was introduced by Government amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It allows for documentary evidence to prove what is stated and means that any documents generated by a company and any documents required under the EU regulations to be generated or kept can be used as evidence, subject to certain restrictions, including legal privilege.  Section 23 allows a national authority, in the interests of <Col N="729"/>the protection of human health or the environment, to make public information on matters giving rise to the issuing of contravention notices or prohibition notices.</P>
        <P>Section 24 obliges the Health and Safety Authority to publish a list of persons convicted of an offence under the relevant chemicals statutory provisions and a list of persons in respect of whom an order has been made under section 17 or section 19, and allows publication of names of persons on whom prohibition notices have been served.  That is partly a name-and-shame provision that should have a deterrent effect on would-be offenders.  The obligatory part of the section was introduced by Government amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, on foot of a Committee Stage Opposition amendment.</P>
        <P>Sections 25 and 26 are provisions to protect whistleblowers.  Section 25 is a more general provision, and Section 26, which was introduced by Government amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, on foot of a Committee Stage Opposition amendment, is more specifically focused on employees.  Section 27 provides that national authorities may, by serving a notice, require persons to give relevant information to that national authority and section 28 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  Section 29 sets out the offences under the Bill and section 30 sets out the penalties for offences committed under section 28.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction is a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or six months imprisonment, or both.  For certain summary offences the penalty of imprisonment does not apply.  The maximum penalty on indictment is &euro;3 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.</P>
        <P>Section 31 provides that the Minister may make regulations allowing inspectors to serve fixed payment notices in amounts up to a maximum of &euro;2,000 to persons who have committed an offence.  The regulations may set out different amounts for different offences.  Section 32 provides that where an offence under the Act is committed by a body corporate and that the act which gave rise to the offence is proved to have been authorised by or as a result of an omission by a director or manager of the body corporate, both the person and the body corporate are liable to be prosecuted.  Section 33 is a standard section and provides that a national authority may prosecute summary offences under the Act.</P>
        <P>Section 34, which was introduced by Government amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, makes it clear that there is a right of appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court by either side from a decision of the District Court to confirm, vary or cancel a notice issued by a national authority.  Section 35 sets out that notices or directions made under the Act shall be in writing.  Section 36 provides for regulations or orders to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 37 sets out two technical amendments to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</P>
        <P>The Chemicals Bill sets out an enforcement system.  It aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business in order to ensure high levels of compliance.  It also aims to achieve increased co-operation between the various national authorities that will be involved in enforcement in order to optimise the use of State resources and to alleviate any unnecessary administrative costs to business.  Compliance with the new chemicals regime by business should result in better management of the risks associated with the use of chemicals and therefore a positive longer-term health and environmental impact.  By taking the approach of putting all enforcement measures in one Bill, the Chemicals Bill should put in place a more streamlined and coherent legal framework for the regulation of chemicals in Ireland.</P>
        <P>On Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, we took a consensual approach to the Bill.  We accepted a number of amendments from the Opposition.  There were no divisions in the House and we had a very positive debate.  This legislation when enacted will streamline and assist businesses.  Most importantly it will allow us to gather information in order to assess <Col N="730"/>whether, and ensure that, the chemicals being used do not have a harmful effect either on human health or on the environment.  As time evolves it will give us the enforcement powers to address breaches in the Act.  It is very progressive legislation that represents the enforcement side of the REACH regulation, which is already in place and to which companies are obliged to adhere.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to this Second Stage debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I will also adopt a consensual approach to the Chemicals Bill.  Fine Gael has no objection to taking all Stages of the Bill today.  The Minister of State outlined in detail the effects of different sections.  The Bill relates to a number of directives that have been transposed into Irish law, principally the REACH directive to which he referred a number of times in his speech.  One of the main tenets of the Bill is the transfer of the burden of proof regarding testing and evaluation to the industry as opposed to different agencies that were responsible heretofore.</P>
        <P>I welcome the main provisions of the Bill, which provides for new national codes of practice.  I welcome that it provides for the Health and Safety Authority to review the legislation and to make proposals to the Minister as appropriate.  The Bill also designates as national authorities the HSA, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in respect of pesticides, the Minister for Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
        <P>The primary aspect of the Bill is enforcement, particularly of the REACH directive.  I welcome those enforcement provisions.  The national authority may appoint inspectors, who will have stringent powers to inspect the chemicals industry, which I welcome.  As the Minister of State pointed out they may at any time search any place to which the inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that the relevant chemical statutory provisions apply.  The inspector may require that a location and anything at it be left undisturbed.  The inspector may require that the person in charge produce any chemical or report relevant to the chemicals directive.  The inspector may remove records from a location as relevant.  The inspector may require the person in charge to give the inspector any such assistance as necessary.  The inspector may take samples of air, soil, water or waste near or at the place where the chemicals are located.  The inspector may also install monitoring instruments, which represents a step in the right direction.  The inspector may require the person in charge to supply any chemical or samples thereof or may remove any chemical or samples thereof when an inspection is taking place.  I welcome these provisions and that the inspection process will be given teeth.</P>
        <P>As a result of the new powers being given to inspectors a number of sanctions will be placed at their disposal in their implementation of the legislation.  The Minister referred to the contravention notice and the prohibition notice.  Under the legislation an inspector may apply to the High Court for an order prohibiting the activity, which is welcome.  I also welcome that the authority may compile and publish a list of persons in breach of the provisions of the Bill.  It is an old chestnut in this Chamber with a Senator from the other side of the House who is keen on naming and shaming.  I welcome that people who breach the regulations will be named and shamed.</P>
        <P>Much of the law that governs this area is more than 40 years old.  In recent years we have seen the introduction of a number of EU directives, including the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals, REACH, directive.  This legislation seeks to transpose the main tenets of those directives into Irish law.  I welcome that in the other House the Minister of State took on board a number of the concerns of the Opposition.  Fine Gael has no objection to the second reading of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="731"/>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is the first time under this Administration that I have had the opportunity to do so.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success with his endeavours on behalf of us all.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which will hardly be considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature.  Nevertheless that does not dilute the level of importance attached to it or to the EU directives to which it relates.</P>
        <P>The Chemicals Bill comes about as a result of a commitment under the programme for Government to implement the EU regulatory framework governing the manufacturing and use of chemicals in a way which does not impact on the competitiveness of our economy.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce an administrative framework for the enforcement of various EU chemicals regulations.  There are no substantive rules on chemicals in the Bill as they are contained in the EU directives.  I welcome the designation of a number of national authorities, including the Health and Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister for Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners to be responsible for specific areas of enforcement, drawing on the most relevant expertise and areas of competence across the system.  Co-operation arrangements for national authorities are to be welcomed to carry out joint enforcement activities, to make the best use of our resources and to minimise administrative costs to business.  They provide for strong co-operation between national authorities.  We should retrospectively put this clause into all EU directives and aspects of our own legislation in order that we can have a joined-up approach to dealing with issues as they arise.</P>
        <P>A range of enforcement powers aimed at encouraging compliance and discouraging non-compliance, including the issue of directions for improvement plans and contravention and prohibition notices and powers to apply to the courts for orders prohibiting certain activities, are also to be very much welcomed.  I welcome the provision for the various penalties.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction is a fine of up to &euro;5,000, as we know, and-or six months imprisonment and for indictable offences it is &euro;3 million and-or two years imprisonment.  There is also a provision for on-the-spot fines of &euro;2,000 for minor offences.  It is important we have in place the appropriate penalties and disincentives for breaches of legislation because we are talking about matters related to due diligence and health and safety in the workplace, including manufacturing environments where, all to often, we have ignored these.  We have seen internationally the kind of accidents and issues that can arise as a result.  The penalties proposed here are welcome.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the provision to make public certain information in the interests of protecting human health or the environment and the protection of whistleblowers in the event of breaches of chemical law being reported in good faith.  My colleague Senator Feeney mentioned the name and shame tactic.  Another colleague, Senator Leyden particularly likes that phrase and uses it on many occasions across various headings.  In this context it is welcome because we must encourage this if we are to achieve the goals as set out in the Bill.</P>
        <P>There are two main policy objectives in the Chemicals Bill, namely, to achieve a high level of compliance and to minimise the administrative cost to industry.  As anybody in business or industry knows, this burden is increasing on an ongoing basis and any steps which help alleviate the increasing costs to business that are not directly related to production and profit are welcome.  To achieve the various objectives, the Chemicals Bill aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business and increased co-operation between the various national authorities.  It will be involved with enforcement, which should support high levels of compliance and alleviate any unnecessary administrative cost to business.</P><Col N="732"/>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  In the D&aacute;il debate on this legislation there was a consensus approach and some amendments were accepted.  We can all proceed together.  There will be no divisions today because there is broad support for the Bill, and rightly so.  As I said, the Bill will not win any prizes for literature but is vitally important in improving the working and regulatory environment related to chemicals in industry.  It seeks to reduce the burden of administrative costs in that area for business and that is to be welcomed.  Like the Minister and other colleagues, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  I was concerned with the REACH directive.  Its objective was to give a level playing field in Europe but it was inclined to make European countries less competitive and attractive than other countries.  While there is a level playing field in Europe, the REACH directive presented problems in that area.  However, this is not the REACH directive, but provides for the regulation and control of the manufacture, use, place on the market, export, import, labelling and packaging of chemicals.  I was surprised to see more than 30,000 chemicals listed in the directive, and this gave rights to consumers and producers to obtain information on these dangerous substances.  This will give transparency and accountability in how industry deals with these chemical substances.  As the Minister said, it also aims to make industry and the public more aware of environmental protection and should lead to safer handling of chemicals during transportation in and out of European countries.  While this is Irish legislation, the REACH directive on all these chemicals applies to Europe.  We must be very careful in the years ahead to ensure we do not become less competitive in Europe than we would otherwise have been because Ireland depends to a very large extent on the pharmaceutical industry.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of queries on compliance that I would like to raise on Second Stage.  The only compliance burden in the Bill is the cost associated with the resources devoted to facilitating inspections and compliance checks.  This is provided for under the existing health and safety and environmental legislation.  While the policy objective is to minimise the administrative cost to industry, no calculation is provided.  The Minister said a regulatory impact analysis has been done and I would like to have some idea of that.  Will the cost of these inspections be the same or more than the current costs incurred by industry to pay for existing health and safety legislation?  There could be a danger that if industry must pay for these inspections, this could become a levy on chemicals that will be passed on to consumers and result in higher prices for European consumers and make us less competitive in international trade.  There is a real concern about that regarding the REACH directive.</P>
        <P>The Chemicals Bill is drafted in the context of a commitment made under the programme for Government and, as the Minister said, the intention is to implement the European regulatory framework covering the manufacture and use of chemicals in a way that does not affect the competitiveness of our economy.  However we must take into account jobs in Europe as well as in Ireland.  The importance of this sector is at stake.  What will happen to the downstream industries which use such chemicals?  How will this impact on them?  Will the same level of regulation apply to them and will it make it more difficult for them to survive?</P>
        <P>The pharmaceutical and chemical area has made a major contribution to high-quality employment in this country.  When I investigated the figures some of them surprised me.  Some 25,000 are employed in the chemicals industry in Ireland, which accounts for 23.3% in added value to the economy, compared to 1.7% for agriculture and 9% for construction, as it was in the past.</P>
        <P>One of the aspects of this Bill that must be considered is that it should not be the case that penalties of a minor nature only, for example &euro;2,000, are issued.  If we are serious about protect<Col N="733"/>ing our environment and our health, the Government must deal seriously with offenders.  As the Minister pointed out, penalties for offences under the legislation will be subject to a maximum penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 and-or six months in prison.  The maximum penalty on indictment is &euro;3 million and-or two years in prison.  There are also on-the-spot fines of up to &euro;2,000 for minor offences.</P>
        <P>From my experience in the supermarket business, it is possible to identify imported food products that have been subjected to chemicals that have been banned here for many years and which are banned in the context of this proposed legislation, so it is very welcome.  How can we accept this?  Some 50% of all cereals and fresh and frozen food and vegetables tested in Ireland have some chemical residues with 3% having more than the safe limits.  The EU average is worse at 46% with approximately 5% exceeding safe limits.  There is a new suggestion that some of these chemicals can cause cancer.  I am not sure how reliable that is but I have the figures.  This information came from an article entitled, &ldquo;European plans to tighten controls on food pesticides&rdquo; published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 24 October 2007.  Mr. Markos Kyprianou, the EU Commissioner for Health, and Ms Marianne Fischer Boel, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, recently warned that Europe could run short of food.  Consumers will suffer from food price increases and will be forced to buy imported food from countries where food may have been sprayed with dubious chemicals and where quality control is poorly regulated.  That is why I welcome the Bill but we must ensure it applies.  The attraction of this legislation is that it should put our minds at rest.  The Minister of State should put our minds at rest in regard to the cost control also.</P>
        <P>Eight years ago I was impressed by the Dublin food safety initiative that was aimed at the issue of food safety inspections around the world.  Every company that bought food throughout the world had to carry out inspections at the factories producing that food, whether in China, Thailand or elsewhere.  Some of those factories had to put up with visits from Europe, America and elsewhere almost every day.  The food safety initiative was an effort to have it recognised that if there is an accepted standard, companies will not have to send inspectors, which would reduce costs considerably and yet guarantee that standards would be in place.  It is a reminder of how we can reduce costs dramatically while increasing service.  This is just one way of doing it but I hope it is a step in that direction.</P>
        <P>I welcome the general tenor of the Bill.  While I have expressed my concerns, the objective of the Bill is one of which we must approve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, welcome the Bill.  It is particularly welcome that a European Union directive and regulation, which stems from Parliament decisions from 2006 and Council decisions from 2007, is being inserted in Irish law so quickly.  Unfortunately, this has not always been the case, particularly when the directives have had at least some degree of an environmental undertone to them.</P>
        <P>While this Bill is being led through the House, as it was in the other House, by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, it obviously has environmental consequences.  I am pleased that in terms of identifying the various agencies which are responsible and which must be consulted or from which agreement must be sought in the establishment of regulations, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environmental Protection Agency are included.</P>
        <P>It is fair to note that, in the past, we have had an ambivalence and indifference towards how chemicals were accounted for in our economy.  First, we lacked a national database of the quantities of substances that existed and, second, there seemed to be no acceptable standards with regard to how and where chemicals were stored or what chemicals could be stored <Col N="734"/>together.  Thankfully, we are moving away from that and legislation of this type will provide public confidence that has been eroded by the lack of such standards in the past.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting that we are taking Second Stage when there is obvious public disquiet on particular issues regarding the existence of hazardous substances.  One of the effects of this Bill is to identify the by-products of chemical residues in everyday substances.  The controversy in regard to Haulbowline, for example, has focused media attention on the existence in the waste stream of the substance chromium 6, which forms part of the plot of the film &ldquo;Erin Brockovich&rdquo;.  Chromium 6 also comes from the well-used, everyday substance creosote, which is used on many items of furniture.  To enable people to become more aware of the type of substances that are used in everyday life, how they are used and how they are eventually disposed of, legislation like this is an important step in the process.</P>
        <P>Having a database of all available chemicals and how and where they are stored will help in terms of their ultimate disposal, with which, as a country, we are still struggling.  The proof will be in the policing of legislation of this type.  The fear is that to avoid regulation and being under the watchful eye of any State agency or Department, people will take shortcuts and will still tend to use chemicals in a dangerous way.  I am encouraged by the fact the legislation is coming through these Houses so quickly in response to the European Union directives and regulations.  There seems to be an intent that this legislation will be made to work and that resources will be provided to police its provisions.</P>
        <P>As it is enabling legislation, I would make the simple request that the regulations as laid before the House are given every opportunity.  This will be the choice of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and will be discussed on a regular basis.  One thing we know about chemicals is that tolerance levels, or the amount of a chemical to which someone can be exposed over a period of time, are constantly being reassessed.  Once regulations are made, I would hate it if they were kept <i>in situ</i> for prolonged periods.</P>
        <P>We may need further legislation, perhaps through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that would ensure regulations issued on this basis are reviewed regularly.  While 12 months may be too soon, to have a set of regulations that would be in place for five or ten years and not take account of changes in scientific information as regards safe exposure to chemicals is not likely to be responsible legislation.</P>
        <P>Perhaps there could be a reporting mechanism on the condition of chemicals in the country at any given time.  One thing we are learning from the current controversy regarding Haulbowline in particular and other legacy sites throughout the country is that the lack of knowledge provided in the past creates a fear in the present and a lack of confidence that would be sustained into the future.  The Government, the representatives of the political system and the State agencies representing the legislation that is being passed in these Houses need to take a different approach with a view to restoring and maintaining public confidence in these areas.  No one could deny such confidence is badly shattered and in need of being repaired.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged that legislation of this type will be part of that process.  The fact it has been commented on so positively in this House and is being treated in a consensual manner in the other House gives great hope.  However, I would like to put on record those particular caveats.  The making of the regulations will be crucial in terms of making sure members of the public have confidence in this legislation and that it is effective at the end of the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  The Labour Party broadly welcomes the Bill, which is undoubtedly long and complex but also essential.  It enforces the REACH regulations which were the <Col N="735"/>result of many hours of intense talks and compromises, and it brings together 40 pieces of EU legislation under one umbrella.  It is, therefore, strong legislation.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the staff of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service who reduced the Bill to a relatively digestible size for Deputies and Senators.  Not many Senators, except those with an exceptional knowledge of the chemical industry, could speak today without the help of the library.</P>
        <P>This is a highly complex item of legislation that has its origins in EU directives and regulations.  It wraps up a difficult and long process that began in the European Union.  The REACH regulations were the most intensely lobbied subject in the history of the EU and even the man at the centre of the regulations, the Italian, Guido Sacconi MEP, said that the result is not perfect.  Mr. Sacconi is a member of Labour&rsquo;s group in the European Parliament, the PES, and it was he who shepherded this legislation.  The PES understood the massive undertaking these rules and regulations represented, which is why Labour will  support the Bill.</P>
        <P>I also pay a small tribute to the Government in this regard.  Ireland had a function in pushing forward the proposals and, as I understand it, the Minister of State responsible at the time, Deputy Tony Killeen, was in Brussels on numerous occasions to discuss the proposals.</P>
        <P>It is a complex document, probably more complex than any other EU-related text with which this House has had to deal.  It has become vital that this Bill be passed as soon as possible and I fully understand that, despite its complexities, the Seanad must take all Stages today.  In fact, it is my understanding the Government originally envisaged that these regulations would be in place by 1 June, although the Minister may correct me in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In light of the referendum that took place in this country a month ago, it is important we consider this Bill in the wider context of Ireland&rsquo;s place in the EU.  These regulations are a prime example of all 27 nations working together.  It is imperative that a Bill such as this would pass, thus ensuring Ireland complies with EU legislation sooner rather than later.  Like the Lisbon treaty, the Bill has a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and a &ldquo;No&rdquo; side, so to speak.  Those on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side argue that if the REACH regulations are introduced, it will lead to job losses, higher costs for chemicals companies and that environmentally, they do not go far enough.  However, I believe the pros outweigh the cons.  I do not believe that the Bill will result in job losses.  In the long term, it may increase jobs in this country in areas such as research and development.  Costs for the chemical companies may increase in the short term, but the research that I have seen suggests that the cost-benefit analysis is in favour of this Bill.</P>
        <P>As my party&rsquo;s spokesperson on health in the Seanad, I am particularly pleased that there will be considerable reductions in the risk to human health from chemicals.  A large part of the Bill is dedicated to the importance of human health, the protection of which is something to which we would all subscribe.  The Bill also deals with the potential hazards certain chemicals pose to the environment.  At a time when we are being told that our environment is extremely precious and somewhat at risk, any protection of the land on which we live is important, not just to our generation but to subsequent ones.</P>
        <P>The Bill incorporates the Seveso directive which came about as a result of a major chemical accident in Italy in 1976.  The aim of this part of the Bill is not only to prevent accidents but to limit the damage they cause when they do occur, which is very important.  We all know that one can only prevent so many accidents but this Bill allows the industry to cope with the aftermath of any such event.</P>
        <P>A significant proportion of the Bill centres on enforcement functions &mdash; ten sections in all.  It contains a name and shame provision, whereby those who contravene or fail to comply with the obligations imposed on them will have their names published.  Similar provisions have <Col N="736"/>worked in other areas such as tax compliance, so there is no reason why they should fail in the chemical industry.</P>
        <P>Much of the onus for chemical safety has been on the Government of the day, or on particular agencies.  The Bill provides for the establishment of the European Chemicals Agency, to be based in Helsinki.  This will mean a significant transfer of responsibility.  The onus will now be on the producer to prove that a chemical is safe, which is an important step.  Having said that, I understand that a number of Deputies in the D&aacute;il raised concerns about what that will mean in Ireland.  Of particular concern was the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority in implementing the REACH regulations in this country.  The authority already has a significant workload and Deputies were anxious to ensure that an increase in it will be met with an increase in staff and resources.  We all understand that an under-resourced agency will only get through a percentage of its workload.  I urge the Minister of State to keep in mind the HSA once the Bill is implemented.  It is an important Bill and it would be sad to see its sting removed because of a failure to implement it fully.</P>
        <P>There are massive benefits to be gained from the implementation of the REACH regulations.  At a time when this country is going through some economic troubles, I encourage the Minister to correlate this Bill with developing the research and development sector in Ireland.  The increase in knowledge about chemical substances and the necessity to substitute unacceptable substances, given their risk to human health or the environment, is expected to stimulate the research and development sector.  One can envisage Ireland becoming a leading light in this context.</P>
        <P>The former President of the European Parliament, Mr. Josep Borrell, described the REACH regulations as one of the most complex texts in the history of the EU.  It is important that industry embraces the thrust, content and objectives of the legislation.  It will be to their benefit to engage with the registration process at the earliest possible opportunity.  It is also important that this legislation is enacted forthwith and that everyone takes cognisance of the thrust and objectives of it.</P>
        <P>Undoubtedly, legislation of this magnitude will have its teething problems.  There is a significant amount of chemical substances currently in use and these will have to undergo health and safety screening before being submitted to the registration process.  However, I believe that the advantages of this legislation outweigh any disadvantages, even if its positive effect takes ten or fifteen years to become clear.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his time and ask him to consider the points I have made.  I have already had dealings with the Minister of State, who is going to sort out an issue in my constituency.  In that context, I am happy to keep the focus positive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on this comprehensive Bill.  The main policy objectives of the Bill are to achieve a high level of compliance while keeping to a minimum the costs to the chemicals industry.  The Bill provides a clear regulatory framework for business and allows for increased co-operation between the various national authorities involved in enforcement.  </P>
        <P>The Bill is complex as it derives from EU regulations.  I ask that those in key areas of chemical use are issued with a guide to the regulations and their rights.  A considerable period of time was spent formulating the regulations in Europe.  In this context, I compliment the work of Irish MEPs, which deserves acknowledgment.</P>
        <P>It is important that when the Bill is enacted people are made aware of the regulations.  The farming community should be well informed, given the amount of chemicals used on farms.  If <Col N="737"/>applied correctly, according to the instructions, chemicals can play an important role in the production of food in a safe way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the enforcement provisions contained in sections 11 and 12, including the right of the authority to appoint persons it considers would make suitable inspectors for the purpose of enforcement.  I also welcome the very clear outline, set out in section 12, of how such inspectors can operate.  The level of detail is welcome and there should be no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind concerning the powers of inspectors.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State for bringing it before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well with his portfolio.  I also welcome this legislation because it is very important that we have proper control over chemicals.  </P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised recently regarding the use of mercury in tooth fillings.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the use of mercury is covered by this legislation.  I note that some countries intend to ban the use of mercury for tooth fillings.  Furthermore, many people are having mercury fillings replaced with white fillings, although there are some dangers involved in that process of which people should be aware.  Does this come under the scope of the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>We can always rely on Senator Burke to come up with a good one.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their kind words and for their broad expressions of support for the Bill.  The official journal, L136 of 2007 contains the REACH regulations and while Senator MacSharry argued that the Chemicals Bill would not win any literary prizes, the same could also be said of the official journal.  It is probably as complex as the Lisbon treaty.  I encourage Senators to obtain a copy of the official journal and read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know what Commissioner McCreevy said about Lisbon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It refers to &ldquo;Distillates (petroleum), hydrotreated heavy naphtha, deisohexaniser overheads; Low boiling point hydrogen treated naphtha&rdquo;, which is just one example of the technical detail of the REACH regulations.    </P>
        <P>Senator Phelan asked whether there would be implementation differences in other member states but the fact that this is a regulation means no deviation is allowed.  All member states are obliged to enforce the regulation, whereas a directive allows for deviations.  The regulation must be enforced EU-wide.</P>
      
        <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give administrative and legal support to the enforcement of the REACH regulations.  Reference has been made to some issues outside the scope of the REACH regulations and this Bill.  These issues are waste, human and veterinary medicines, food flavourings and feedstuffs, all of which will continue to be regulated under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>In the context of Senator Burke&rsquo;s teeth and his concerns about mercury fillings, I suggest that this would come under medical devices and would not be under the scope of this Bill.  I note that there are concerns among the public and in medical areas about fillings containing mercury but that would not be contained within the scope of this Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about the burden of proof on the industry.  The fact that the onus is on the industry to prove that chemicals are safe is a positive development.  A statutory authority would not have the ability or wherewithal to ensure proper testing or pro<Col N="738"/>cedures were in place.  It would overwhelm any agency no matter how well-resourced it was.  That the burden of proof is on the industry is a good thing.</P>
        <P>This is an evolutionary process.  There will be pre-registration and then full registration which will build up a bank of information regarding the chemicals out there.  A suggestion was made that there could be up to 30,000 chemicals.  We will then formulate a considerable amount of knowledge over a period.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle asked whether a review process take place.  As I said previously, this will be evolutionary and will continue to be reviewed simply because as information comes in and new chemicals evolve, there must be a review mechanism in place and that will continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Quinn expressed the concern when REACH was first expressed by the European Commission that the industry would become less competitive.  When we were framing this legislation in the context of the enforcement side, we were very conscious and carried out a regulatory impact assessment in the context of the Chemicals Bill.  In respect of REACH, it is very important to state first and foremost that there can never be a compromise on human health or the environment so we must come from that position.  There was a great deal of discussion when REACH was being formulated in the EU.  Acknowledgement was made by Senator Carty in that context about our MEPs on all sides getting very involved, being proactive and bringing forward a regulation that could be implemented, was a high priority in terms of the protection of human health and the environment and ensured we had a competitive industry.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Quinn is correct in saying that the pharmaceutical and chemical industry is a very important plank in our economy and is very high in technical jobs.  A total of 25,000 people work in it and it has a very high value-added product in the context of the economy and gross domestic product, so we must be conscious of that as well.  However, we cannot compromise initially on health or the environment so we are coming from that basis.  I do not believe this will be anti-competitive.  Other countries and trading blocs around the world are looking at these regulations and see them as the pathway to ensure we have proper procedures in place so that we know what chemicals are being transferred and used around the world.  Certainly, the more countries that buy into this concept of having an agency and the knowledge and information in the context of the chemicals being used, the better.</P>
        <P>I re-emphasise, because people might be concerned, that waste, human or veterinary medicines, food flavourings and feedstuffs are not included in this directive or in the context of the Bill we are discussing today.  Senator Boyle referred to it in the context of Haulbowline.  It is important that we do not give false hope that this Bill is assessing and addressing all these problems when it is not doing so.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast raised the issue of resourcing.  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead agency in this context and received 33 additional staff over and above the complement to enforce the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The Environmental Protection Agency received two additional people.  Any other agency that has an obligation in this Bill should allocate resources accordingly to ensure it can comply with the expectations in respect of the enforcement side.  I am confident the HSA has the resources in place.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senators.  It is fine legislation in the context of what we are trying to achieve.  The REACH regulations are in place and this Bill is primarily the enforcement side of them to give us teeth to ensure REACH is enforced.  We had a very fine debate in the D&aacute;il.  There was a considerable amount of consensus that we took on board.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan asked me about section 24 in the context of whistle-blowers.  Again, we want to protect people who come forward with bona fide concerns and inform an agency. <Col N="739"/> This is very welcome and should be encouraged in all aspects of legislation before the Houses.  Concerned individuals who are putting their necks on the line and who perhaps are feeling vulnerable because they are bringing forward information on workmates or employers should be supported and encouraged if they make bona fide complaints.</P>
        <P>In respect of naming and shaming, the HSA is obliged under this legislation to publish names of people with indictable offences or court orders.  Again, this was made obligatory on foot of an Opposition amendment which we gladly took on board.</P>

However, the HSA does not have to publish in the context of prohibition notices.  This is left up to the discretion of the HSA for good reason which was explained in the other House.</P>
        <P>I again thank Senators for their kind words in the context of the support they are giving this Bill today.  I know this will have a positive impact on the chemicals industry, human health and our environment, which is what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We looked at this because this amendment was moved on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The advice we received is that it is unnecessary to include it and that if we did so, we could set precedents because it would have to be included in other legislation in which it is not currently included.</P>
        <P>There is a strong corpus of legislation to protect privilege which is primarily a matter for the courts.  Including this amendment could undermine that legal situation.  I know some Deputies did a lot of housework and found Bills where it is included.  However, the current advice is that this would be unnecessary and could set a precedent and undermine legislation where it is <Col N="740"/>included.  As far as I know, it is already in section 21.  I had it marked out for the Senator.  This section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">This section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) a document containing information that is privileged from disclosure in proceedings for an offence,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) a document prepared by a person who would not be compellable to give evidence at the instance of the party seeking to have the document admitted as evidence of the matters specified in the document,</P>

        <P LI="3">(i) the investigation of any offence,</P>

        <P LI="2">or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) a document (other than a technical document) prepared after the alleged commission of the offence concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is provision for this in section 21(3).  We examined this but our legal advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is that inclusion in this Bill would undermine other legislation without this provision on the Statute Book.

	<P>I welcome the contributions of Members in both Houses.  It is important legislation and the regulations are already in place.  I wish to state my admiration for and thanks to the MEPs of all sides, who were involved in the initial drafting of the REACH regulation, and our officials.  I also thank the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment who sat up long hours analysing Opposition amendments and trying to ensure they were included in a consensual way so that the Bill would have broad support.  While we did not have long sittings because of the conciliatory approach, I thank the staff of both Houses.</P>
        <P>It is up to industry to embrace this legislation and REACH.  At every opportunity I have highlighted the obligation on industry.  I plead with those involved to pre-register so that they will have no difficulty thereafter.  The Health and Safety Authority is running a campaign and has set up a website, <i>www.reachright.ie</i>.  The helpdesk number is also important: 1890 289 389.  If businesses or individuals are concerned, they should contact it.  I urge people not to be afraid of this regulation and to embrace it because it is for the benefit of all citizens of the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this issue that is important at a national level and at a local level to the people of Rathcoole.  I am delighted to raise the Government&rsquo;s waste management policy, its policy on incineration, the role it sees for incineration in waste management in Ireland and the number and capacity of incinerators the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government considers are required in Ireland.  This is especially important in view of the fact that the Meath incinerator is going ahead.  There is also a proposal for an incinerator in Rathcoole.</P>
        <P>On 6 May I attended a meeting hosted by the Rathcoole community council at which grave concern was expressed at plans to locate this incinerator and the impact it would have in Rathcoole, Clondalkin, Newcastle, Saggart and Lucan.  Many legitimate questions must be answered by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Why did he meet with developers of this private incinerator in July 2007?  Why did his colleague, the other Green Party Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, meet with the developers?  Why was the Department of Defence consulted by the proposers?  When it was consulted it stated it had no objec<Col N="742"/>tion to the incinerator.  What is going on with these Departments?  Why were three Departments willing to meet with the proposers of a private incinerator if this is not Government policy?</P>
        <P>Since the Minister came into office we have had a cloud of confusion over Government waste management policy and what role, if any, the Government sees for incineration in this policy.  Initially, the Minister stated no more than two incinerators would be required.  The then Taoiseach stated we would need four.  What is the actual number?  What capacity does the Government seek from incineration?  Has the Minister, Deputy Gormley, changed his views?  He was a strong opponent.  He sought a mandate from his constituents on his opposition to an incinerator.  Now, he is happy to meet with the developers of a proposed private incinerator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of what is considered essential infrastructure must be answered by the Government.  Legislation on strategic infrastructure was introduced, under which certain applications have planning exemptions.  If waste incineration is not a priority for the Government why did this go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, by-passing the local authority and why was it fast-tracked in a matter of weeks?  This raises legitimate questions on the Government&rsquo;s policy in this area.  The constituents and communities in Rathcoole, Newcastle and Saggart, who will be heavily impacted by the proposed incinerator if it goes ahead, deserve to know the answers.</P>
        <P>If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is meant to have a hands-off approach to essential infrastructure and the planning process, why did he meet developers at the same time the project was given exempted status as strategic infrastructure?  A conflict of interest exists.  I hope the Minister of State, in the absence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will be able to answer some of the questions I raised.</P>
        <P>It is time for the Minister to remove the confusion and state clearly and categorically his position on incineration and whether the Government supports the location of incinerators in Rathcoole, Meath, Poolbeg and throughout the country.  If the Government does not support this, what is its policy and what will it do to stop it?  I thank the Cathaoirleach for providing me with the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to have the opportunity to deal with this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, who is unavoidably absent as he is attending a meeting of EU environment ministers.  Many of the questions raised by the Senator will have to be answered by the Minister directly as they are outside the scope of the matter under discussion.  I shall take the opportunity to set out the progress already being made in delivery of the many commitments on waste management in the Government&rsquo;s policy programme.</P>
        <P>Incineration is not the cornerstone of Irish waste management policy.  The programme for Government commits us to exploring the full range of technologies available to us, and in particular the potential of technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste.  The State has no direct role in determining the number, type or capacity of incinerators which may be developed.  These are matters for the commercial sector or local authorities, who may act by way of public private partnership.  In either case any such projects must secure planning permission and a waste licence through statutory processes which are independent of the Minister and the Government.</P>
        <P>We need to see a step change in our approach to waste management if we are to rid ourselves of unsustainable practices and meet our national and EU ambitions and targets.  In particular, the Government is acutely conscious of the real and imminent challenge posed for Ireland by the EU landfill directive.  If we are to meet our obligations under this directive and avoid the <Col N="743"/>threat of legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice we must double the amount of biodegradable waste we divert away from landfill by 2010.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.7- ?><P>The scale of the challenge this presents was well-illustrated in the EPA&rsquo;s most recent national waste report for 2006.  This shows that while quantities of waste recycled increased so too did the quantity of waste sent to landfill.  The report demonstrates that good progress is being made in recovering and recycling packaging, in biodegradable waste, and in household and commercial waste.  However, this is being offset by the increase in the volume of waste we are generating.</P>
        <P>While the rapid economic growth of recent years, with the accompanying increase in the overall population and number of households, is the driver of this increase, it is not one that cannot be maintained.  Sustainable development is fundamentally about decoupling our increasing prosperity from the environmental impacts which can be a consequence of it.  Development and proper waste management are not mutually exclusive.</P>
        <P>We now need to chart a new way forward.  It is for this reason the programme for Government identified the need for a fundamental review of our approach to waste management.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has initiated this and consultants have been engaged to conduct a study which will underpin this review.  We need to accelerate the move away from landfill quite dramatically, we need to step up prevention and minimisation and to regulate the sector in a manner which supports optimal environmental performance at minimum cost.  However, we should be under no illusions.  Good environmental performance comes at a price.  We lead Europe in our application of the polluter pays principle through our system of use-based charging and the funding of most of our infrastructure in this way.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that the costs of using this infrastructure reflect the environmental burden imposed.  For this reason, the Minister recently increased the landfill levy by the &euro;5 per tonne maximum currently permitted in law and is developing proposals for a much more ambitious approach to using levies to minimise our reliance on landfill and incineration and to promote the viability of alternative technologies.  This is being done at a time when the fall in landfill gate fees runs counter to the need to rapidly reduce our reliance on this outmoded technology and avoid the sanctions which will result if we do not meet our landfill directive obligations.</P>
        <P>An ambitious programme to achieve the diversion of waste from landfill required by the directive is set out in the national strategy on biodegradable waste.  The programme for Government commits to implementing it.  This will involve diversion of up to 1.4 million tonnes of waste from landfill by 2010; 1.7 million tonnes by 2013; and an estimated 1.8 million tonnes by 2016.</P>
        <P>Putting this in context, of the 2.3 million tonnes of biodegradable waste generated in 2006 only 867,000 tonnes were recovered.  We are committed to ensuring the implementation of the national strategy, through segregated collection of biodegradable waste and the generation of compost and through the introduction of mechanical and biological treatment facilities as one of a range of technologies.</P>
        <P>The review will not just be about technology.  Its terms of reference are deliberately broad in order to promote a fundamental review of the legal, institutional and financial approach we take to waste management.  If the review indicates the need for significant legislative changes then the necessary proposals will be brought to Government.  Inaction is not an option and the approach reflected in the current crop of waste management plans, while facilitating some progress, is simply not going far enough fast enough.</P>
        <P>We need to move from being reactive to proactive, from accepting received wisdom in regard to waste management to seeking the most innovative solutions available internationally.  We can move from being an underachiever to world-class standard which will see us not struggle <Col N="744"/>to meet EU targets, as is the case with landfill diversion, but to a position of leadership.  It is for this reason the programme for Government sets the very ambitious long-term goal of reducing to 10% our reliance on landfill.</P>
        <P>There have been rapid changes in the waste management sector in the past decade due to the increased involvement of a developing and consolidating private sector, the changing role of local authorities as service providers and competitors within the industry, and the movement towards full cost recovery for waste services that has led to increased charges for the consumer.  While the sector is fully and properly regulated from an environmental perspective, no similarly comprehensive system of socio-economic regulation has yet been put in place.</P>
        <P>While there is general agreement that the existing regulatory framework needs modernisation, there is no consensus on what form this should take, such as whether a waste regulator is required or whether it would be sufficient to change the regulatory framework to provide for a form of public service obligation and to ensure that waste can be directed appropriately.</P>
        <P>A key overarching issue that has emerged is the dual role of local authorities as competitors and regulators in the same market and the perceived conflict of interest arising from this.  The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the recent OECD review of the public service which included a specific case study on waste management and which will be implemented in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy provided for in the programme for Government to which I referred.  I reiterate the Government&rsquo;s commitment, which is shared by the Members, to ensure we rapidly move towards a world class waste management system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the reply did not address the issue of incineration.  The Minister of State said waste management policy is under review.  On what date will the review be completed?  Cosy meetings are being held with developers who want to build incinerators, especially in Rathcoole.  What is the Government&rsquo;s policy on incineration while waste management policy is being reviewed and prepared?  A planning application for an incinerator was made under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  It has been exempted from the normal planning process and it has been submitted directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is my concern.</P>

      <sTitle>Third Level Charges.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I call on the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the proper dispersion of the student services charge by higher education institutions throughout Ireland and to guarantee all the moneys collected through the charge are invested in student services and not used to pay off institutional debt.  Almost &euro;1,000 is collected from every third level student at the beginning of each academic year.  The fee is colloquially termed the student registration fee but within colleges it is entitled the student services charge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Guidelines published by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in the mid-1990s advise how the money should be spent.  It is distributed among a variety of stakeholders, namely, the student health service, examinations and registry offices, student services such as chaplaincy, student advisory service, disability and support service, careers officer, the student&rsquo;s union, the societies office and sports clubs.  Principles such as these are applied throughout colleges and universities.</P><Col N="745"/>
        <P>The total net income from the charge was &euro;10.508 million in UCD this year but only &euro;6.676 million was spent on student support services.  Unbelievably, &euro;3.8 million was collected by the university but not spent on such services.  According to its accounts, this was due to the reduction in the HEA grant allocated to universities when Deputy Noel Dempsey was Minister for Education and Science in 2002.  UCD has taken a significant portion of the student services charge to cover its deficit.  This practice is being carried out in bad faith as students and taxpayers are not being told clearly about it.</P>
        <P>Money collected through the charge must be invested in much needed, under-resourced student services because students do not receive the support they need.  Child care and course equipment costs as well as accommodation issues and all the other problems facing students today add to the financial burden they carry and the least that can be done with the vast sum collected under this charge is to invest it in them to give them the support they rightly deserve.  Financial issues haunt students on a daily basis and too often they create a barrier to pursuing further education, especially for mature students, lower income groups and single parents.  Will the Minister commit to ensure the proper dispersion of the student services charges by higher education institutions throughout the State and to guarantee all moneys collected are invested in student services and not used to pay off institutional debt?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  The student services charge is levied by third level institutions to defray the costs of examinations, registration and students services, which include the planning, co-ordination and implementation of a variety of programmes and services designed to provide students with the opportunity to reach their full academic and personal potential.  The charge is &euro;825 for the current academic year.  All students eligible for means-tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by local authorities or the vocational education committees in addition to any maintenance and tuition grants to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>The HEA issued a framework of good practice for the provision of student services to the publicly funded higher education institutions in 1998.  Reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  The framework also provides that institutions should ensure information is available relating to expenditure from the fund arising from the charge and that this information should be made available to students.</P>
        <P>The HEA has written periodically to all institutions to remind them of their function in the student services charge to ensure correct procedures are in place in accordance with the framework.  The HEA recently wrote once again to all institutions about the charge reminding them of this framework.  I am satisfied the authority considers, generally, that the framework has operated quite well in the sector.  Third level institutions are autonomous bodies and they determine the internal disbursal of funding, including funding received under the student services charge.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the annual demands for additional resources for the higher education sector and I have afforded significant priority to investments in this area.  Spending on higher education has increased dramatically over the past decade.  When all higher education funding is taken into account, the overall provision by the Department for the sector amounts to &euro;2 billion for 2008, an increase of 25% since 2005, when the provision amounted to &euro;1.6 billion, and an increase of 135% on the &euro;850 million provided in 1997.  Unprecedented investment is being made in our higher education infrastructure in promoting excellence through system-wide collaboration and change, widening access and creating a vibrant fourth level sector.  These are key long-term investments in Ireland&rsquo;s future.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I acknowledge he mentioned the charge is in place to support students.  Can he do anything about the university to which I referred taking more than &euro;3.8 million under this charge during this academic year because of the reduction in the HEA grant, thereby forcing it to use the students&rsquo; money?

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, who is an able Deputy, I wish to put on record my disappointment that while three matters are being raised on the Adjournment, only one concerns education, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State.  The other two matters do not concern education.  This is a disrespect to the Members who raise these matters.  There are at least four Ministers in the Department of Health and Children and the matter I wish to raise is in the remit of that Department.  It is poor form that none of the four Ministers could be present to respond.  I intend to raise a number of supplementary questions on this matter but Deputy Haughey will not be in a position to answer them.</P>
        <P>This matter concerns the relatives of an individual in my constituency who made a claim for recompense under the health repayment scheme but whose claim was refused.  I understand a number of families throughout the country are in a similar position.  To outline the case I will read a letter I received from the son-in-law of the lady concerned.  I have been making representations on behalf of the family. The letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Dear John Paul</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Further to our conversation of recent days in connection with the ... family claim for the above deceased lady under the Health Repayments Scheme, I set out hereunder details of the application and related refusal.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">[She] was an elderly lady in possession of a medical card and in receipt of her Widows Pension, she became ill in March 1994 and subsequently required permanent hospitalisation.  At that time no suitable hospital accommodation was made available through the normal medical channels for this lady by the South Eastern Health Board simply for lack of hospital beds.  The family remained in constant contact with the Health Board on a regular basis for approximately two years in this regard to no affect.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">[She] was admitted to the New Ross Community Hospital initially on a week to week basis pending Health Board accommodation which did not materialise.  This Hospital allowed [her] to remain there until her death in July 2001.  The New Ross Community Hospital is affectively a private hospital and I understand was at the time partially funded by the South Eastern Health Board.  [Her] time at this hospital was funded from her small savings, pension and family contributions, [she] died penniless.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The family claim under the Health Repayment Scheme has been rejected primarily on the basis she was hospitalised in private hospitalisation, no consideration has been entertained by the Repayment Scheme bearing in mind the South Eastern Health Board failed in its duty to provide any accommodation for this elderly medical card holder.  My appeal on behalf of <Col N="747"/>the family has being rejected ... I understand there are in the region of between 2000/3000 similar cases having being rejected on the same basis.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">[She] was a very decent old lady and of a poor family background who today could not possibly consider affording High Court action in this matter and have no alternative remedy in dealing with the rejection.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">This stance by the Repayments Board is totally unacceptable and morally wrong.  Perhaps you would be kind enough to raise this matter in the Seanad on behalf of [her] family and indeed the other families who are in a similar situation today.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Yours sincerely.</P>
        <P el="5" FLI="0">The letter is self explanatory.  I have known the family concerned all my life and can confirm that the contents of the letter are true.  It is a disgrace.  The health board failed in its duty to provide a bed for somebody who was eligible for such and the family was forced to use the New Ross Community Hospital, which is a fine facility.  It is a charity that is funded by the people who live in the town of New Ross and in the catchment area of Kilkenny and Wexford.  In this case the family was forced to use that facility because no alternative was provided by the health board.  This family of modest means is now deemed not to be covered by the terms of the repayment scheme.</P>
        <P>That is not fair play.  This woman belonged to the generation of people who remained in this country and built it up.  It is shoddy treatment by the Department of Health and Children and its agencies, in this case the South Eastern Health Board, that this woman could not obtain a health board bed and, second, that her family is being penalised in this manner after her death.  Thousands more families throughout the country are being similarly penalised through no fault of their own.  The reason I had hoped for the presence of a Minister from the Department of Health and Children was so I could impress upon them the problem I have with this.  It is downright wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Senator John Paul Phelan for raising this matter and am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the position regarding the health repayment scheme.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of the implications of the Supreme Court judgment of 16 February 2005, the Government approved a statutory based repayment scheme.  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term residential care, including contracted beds in private institutions.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will also have the charges repaid in full.  Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for inpatient services only raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  Only these charges are repayable under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Supreme Court Judgment of 16 February 2005 do not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who have entered these homes under the nursing home subvention scheme.  Under that scheme, the Health Service Executive is empowered to make a financial contribution to an individual towards the cost of his or her private nursing home care provided he or she qualifies on means and dependency grounds.  In the case of private nursing <Col N="748"/>home care the contract is between the individual and the private nursing home owner.  All applications received under the scheme must be assessed within this legal framework.</P>
        <P>The health repayment scheme was launched in August 2006 and is administered by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator, KPMG-McCann Fitzgerald.  The HSE has indicated that as of 20 June 2008, more than 33,400 claim forms have been received, 11,332 payments totalling more than &euro;226 million have issued and 15,088 offers totalling more than &euro;267 million have been made.</P>
        <P>The applicant concerned submitted a claim under the scheme in respect of a patient who resided in New Ross Community Hospital.  New Ross Community Hospital is funded under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Section 39 allows the HSE to give assistance to any person or body that provides or proposes to provide a similar or ancillary service to the service the HSE may provide.  Any organisation funded under section 39 is not, however, providing services for or on behalf of the HSE and does not have the power to levy health charges recoverable under the scheme.  Any payment made by a resident of this institution is not a recoverable health charge and therefore no repayment is due under the Act.</P>
        <P>The scheme administrator, having assessed the details of the claim, rejected the application on the grounds that the institution in which the patient resided was outside the parameters of the scheme.  Section 16 of the Act provides for an independent appeals process for applicants who wish to appeal the decision of the scheme administrator.  The applicant concerned lodged an appeal with the appeals office and was provided with an oral appeal hearing.  The appeals officer, having considered the details of the appeal, issued a written decision to the appellant on 13 June 2008.  The decision agreed with that of the scheme administrator to reject the claim on the basis that the patient resided in an institution outside the parameters of the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is why I would have liked a Minister from the Department of Health and Children to attend.  More questions are raised by the reply than I raised in the first place.  The final sentence outlines my position.  The scheme administrator rejected the claim &ldquo;on the basis that the patient resided in an institution outside the parameters of the scheme&rdquo;.  Clearly, she did.  The health board did not provide a suitable bed in which the person could reside.  Not only was the person penalised while alive, but the family is being penalised after that person&rsquo;s death.  I know the family in question and its intention was to get a refund for some of the money it had invested with its mother&rsquo;s pension to pay for her accommodation and to make a donation to the community hospital in New Ross, a fantastic facility.</P>
        <P>The answer was not satisfactory.  The Minister of State cannot respond to the issue, but it is a clear case of a family, one example of many hundreds, that has been penalised by the State twice &mdash; the State failed to provide a bed and, for this reason, claims the person did not fall within the parameters of the scheme.  That is unacceptable and disgraceful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a great deal of sympathy for the family in question and the many others in a similar situation.  I would not like to estimate the number.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court issued its judgment on 16 February 2005, in response to which the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 was passed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and signed into law.  This position was decided by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and, in the absence of a Supreme Court judgment or legislation, no one can deal with the case in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
