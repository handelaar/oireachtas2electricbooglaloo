	<P>I have received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the application for top-up funding on the essential repairs grant, ERG, and the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, DPG, made by Westmeath County Council.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Pearse Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious anomalies, inequalities and maladministration procedures with regard to the third level Gaeltacht scholarship scheme, which led to many young people from disadvantaged Gaeltacht areas receiving less than half of their full grant with no indication of when the remaining grant will be disbursed.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the money, advice and budgeting service, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business, and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with spokespersons having ten minutes, all other Senators seven minutes, and on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For the past week on this side of the House we have been talking about protecting the taxpayers&rsquo; interest in any guarantee scheme we give to the banks.  The taxpayers&rsquo; interests can be served at the moment if the interest rate cut is passed on to customers.  We heard the Consumer's Association and other people say this morning that this should happen.  If that were to happen it would certainly give some hope to hard-pressed families in the current climate.  I hope in the coming days when the Minister for Finance holds discussions with the banks on the regulations and the scheme to be laid before us he will bear that strongly in mind.  Given the increases they have suffered that would make a difference to many families.  It was unprecedented yesterday for China to agree with the worldwide move to <Col N="388"/>try to bring stability to the market.  It would be good to see taxpayers and the hard-pressed people who are paying high mortgages benefit from that.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two other topics this morning because, while we are discussing the banks and the serious financial situation affecting everyone, obviously life goes on.  I am very concerned to see that in Letterkenny General Hospital three babies contracted MRSA.  We have very high rates of MRSA in this country and it raises the most serious concerns that vulnerable babies are now at risk of contracting MRSA in public hospitals.  People are already very concerned about going to hospital and now babies are getting this infection.  Very often the cause is that basic hygiene is not observed.  We should have another debate in the House because people all around the country are concerned.  They are concerned about the elderly contracting MRSA when they have to go to hospital.  They are concerned also about their loved ones who have routine operations and are at risk of infection.  That is a major issue in the health service and I would like the Leader to organise a debate on the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency published yesterday contained very disturbing information about our failure to meet environmental targets.  I would like the report to be discussed in the House to see what action the Government can take to deal with this disturbing information.  One in three Irish rivers is now polluted.  In the most favourable scenario, Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gases would exceed the proposed reduction target for 2020 by 7 million tonnes.  It is an excellent report that should be debated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very interesting to note where we find ourselves with the decisions of central banks around the world to reduce interest rates.  The ordinary people of this country are discussing the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald, namely, whether the banks will pass on the benefit of the interest rate cut.  It would be interesting to contextualise the debate in terms of the comments made over the years in this House about giving more power to regulators and allowing the regulators to regulate.  The fact is we as a Legislature have never given adequate powers to regulators.  Any time the subject comes up we talk about &ldquo;State interference&rdquo;, &ldquo;big government&rdquo;, &ldquo;the nanny state&rdquo; and say &ldquo;let the market perform&rdquo; etc.</P>
        <P>We could have given the Financial Regulator the power to insist that the banks pass on the reduction in interest rates.  That could involve only one phone call from the Minister for Finance to the regulator.  I raise the matter in the context of my comments last week in the House.  We need to revisit such issues as directors&rsquo; compliance statements and the need to give regulators the proper authority to regulate for the common good.  We must not be afraid to examine and address this matter.  We must acknowledge that the system has not worked to date and move on.  Before making speeches saying that the banks should pass on the interest rate reduction, we should look into our souls and say that we did not give the authority to the regulator to do that.  If we had done so, we would not be having this discussion.  The matter would be delivered with one phone call this morning.  It is as simple as one line or paragraph of legislation.</P>
        <P>I previously raised the question of the future of the rescue service and Coast Guard stations at Malin and Valentia Island, as have other Senators, including Senator Coghlan.  The Leader, to his credit, responded very positively on both occasions.  We waited to see what developments took place.  We now face an extraordinary and possibly unprecedented situation which needs to be sorted out.  No one is taking responsibility for moving in the direction of closing down the stations at Malin and Valentia Island.  We hear from one side that this was a political decision and from the other that it was not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is hard to believe that, when serving as a Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, would have set about closing the station at Malin, in his county.  This is not something that politicians rush to do.  In his defence, there is no evidence that he did this.  It was <Col N="389"/>stated to a committee of the House and it has been inferred otherwise, that this was a decision of a Minister of the Government.  We are entitled to know the position.  Before arguing about the madness of the decision in the first place, about which I have previously spoken, let us decide who makes the decision.  Is it Government policy to close down, or to allow to fade away, the Coast Guard stations at Malin and Valentia Island?  I do not wish to hear that we are not doing anything at the moment.  Are these stations keeping the same level of authority, influence and importance as they have at present?  It is a simple question for the appropriate Minister, and we can proceed from there when we will know where we must fight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome yesterday&rsquo;s decision to lower interest rates worldwide.  For the average borrower this makes a difference of approximately &euro;100 per month, if one has a tracker mortgage.  However, for those on a variable mortgage the situation is different.  In such cases it is up to the banks and financial institutions to decide whether to pass the reduction on, as my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, said.  Some banks have said they will pass it on, however the three biggest mortgage lenders in the country have so far failed to do so.  They say they will review the situation.  This is not good enough and is exactly the type of carry on that we worried about last week.  I heard a spokesperson from the Financial Regulator on the radio this morning and I do not believe, even if it had the power, that it has the bottle to ensure these changes are passed on.  It is important we give a clear message to the Minister for Finance that he must examine the situation and, if possible, put some clauses in the scheme to ensure these financial institutions are obliged to pass on any savings.  Otherwise it is a windfall profit for them and represents excess charges.</P>
        <P>Last week we debated the Housing Bill 2008 in the House.  The Labour Party made the point that the debate failed to include the topic of homelessness.  This morning the Simon Community produced what I believe is a very sensible idea for tackling the problem of homelessness in Dublin, namely, to buy up apartments that are currently empty.  Estimates suggest up to 10,000 apartments built during the boom lie unoccupied in the current climate.  Many of these are one-bedroom apartments and are precisely the type of property we need to tackle homelessness.  Will the Leader impress upon the relevant Minister that the Government can tackle the homeless problem in Dublin by buying these apartments, meeting its target in the national development plan in the process and help to kick-start the Dublin housing market?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate two of our universities on achieving ranking among the top 108 universities in the world.  Many in the House will have attained too many points to go to Trinity College, but it deserves particular congratulations for achieving a place in the top 50.  This illustrates what can be achieved by investing money in education.  Let us ensure this investment is maintained not only at third level but across all the sectors of education.  Will the Leader impress upon the Minister for Education and Science the need to ensure that the level of money invested in education is maintained and, if possible, increased in next week's budget?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We should demand that the banks pass on the 0.5% reduction in interest rates, which is especially welcome for hard pressed house owners.  This will also help to reduce inflation.  The Minister of Finance must intervene and say that the banks must reduce interest rates when the European Central Bank has done so.  That is vital, because the householder has been hard pressed over the past year as interest rates have increased on a regular basis, sometimes every month, whether by 0.25%, 0.5%, or whatever.  The situation now is that the price of oil is falling, interest rates are moving in the right direction and inflation is reducing.  When the unions make up their minds on accepting the national wage agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us blame the unions for the recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="390"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will only hear questions for the Leader, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is a help to the unions when they decide on the national wage agreements, which they must do in the present climate.  The job of the Government is to ensure inflation is kept under control.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has not been doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one method of ensuring we do.  The Minister now has an opportunity to deal with this matter.</P>
        <P>I remind people that small and medium businesses must have credit available to them.  Interest rates affect small and medium businesses more than larger businesses.  They are the backbone of the economy and, whether we like it, there are approximately 1 million people employed by small businesses.  We must ensure the climate is right for these people to continue to keep their staff.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>We are trying to keep jobs in place at present.  There is an opportunity now to support our banking system.  I believe in a strong banking system.  We will not work our way out of economic problems without a strong banking system.  It is vital that the Leader impresses upon the Minister for Finance the importance of delivering on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note a draft of the bank guarantee scheme has been sent to Brussels for approval.  It is curious that it has been sent to Brussels for approval before it comes to the Oireachtas.  I appreciate this matter was debated in the other Chamber yesterday.  However, in last week&rsquo;s debate, Fine Gael pointed out some issues in the scheme and the legislation, concerning State aid rules, which were taken on board by the Government.  Were this draft scheme put to the Oireachtas for scrutiny there may have been further improvements.</P>
        <P>The reduction in interest rates by the European Central Bank is linked to the capitalisation of Irish banks and the discussion we have had in recent days.  Some days ago I said the banks had certain options for recapitalisation.  They can source new funds, reduce or not pay out dividends and can increase margins.  The statements made clearly show the banks are endeavouring to recapitalise by increasing their margins at the expense of Irish consumers, mortgage holders and taxpayers.</P>
        <P>In the context of the State giving a guarantee to the banks, that is unacceptable.  The Minister for Finance should make a statement on that and insist that these increases which, in normal times, would have been automatically passed on to consumers, are passed on.</P>
        <P>There is a wonderful photograph of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in <i>The Irish Times</i> today at the publication of the Environmental Protection Agency report to which Senator Fitzgerald referred.  I do not know what he is so happy about because this is a damning report on the state of the environment, from water quality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator said it first.  It is no news to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to whatever.  The only statement the Minister can make is that it is unacceptable that people do not have clean water.  Does the Minister not appreciate that he is responsible and that he must outline measures to tackle problems to do with the environment and water quality and not just complain about the condition of the environment?  He is the Minister.  He is responsible and we would like to see some action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader, Senator Cassidy, to invite the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House to bring us up to date on the strategy for child care in Ireland.  There is no doubt we have made great progress in that regard.  Our former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, appointed an Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  There is a commitment in Towards 2016 to make available 50,000 new child care places but last weekend in <i>The Irish Times</i> there was a report by Vladimir Spidla, the European Union Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on availability, costs and Government spending on child care and child care education in the 27 EU countries.  The stark findings about Ireland in the report are very serious.  It states that Irish parents pay more for child care than most Europeans.  The Irish Government spends less on child care and early education than other EU countries.</P>

	<P>In Germany, parents spend 8.4% of their net income on child care.  Sadly, the Irish Government spends only 0.2% of GDP on child care while the Governments in France, Finland and Denmark spend 2%.</P>

	<P>Nought to five years is the most critical in a human being&rsquo;s life.  These figures are very disturbing.  We spoke last week about competitiveness and getting our priorities right.  How can we compete internationally, socially and economically if we do not provide for high quality child care and the education of children in the nought to five age bracket?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Last July, the National Economic and Social Forum said it deeply regretted that the Government had not provided one year&rsquo;s pre-school for every child in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Very disappointing.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>That recommendation was in my document on a new approach to child care.  I asked the Government to indicate when it would provide one year&rsquo;s free pre-school for every child before he or she attends formal national school.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Mary White.  The cost of child care is a subject very close to my own heart as a mother of two children, one of whom is just over two years and the other under two years.

	<P>I was supporting Senator White&rsquo;s call for a debate on child care but I would also like to ask the Leader for a debate on third level education in the context of the report of the great achievements of our universities.  I echo Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s comments congratulating our universities on their achievement, in particular Trinity College Dublin on becoming the first Irish university to enter the top 50 third level institutions as ranked by <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>.  That is a wonderful and remarkable achievement, given <Col N="393"/>the levels of funding accorded to universities.  In the context of next week&rsquo;s budget it is important that we at least retain the level of funding third level institutions get.  It is also important that we do not see a return of fees.  We must fund our universities as we fund the other levels in our education system directly from central funds.  As other speakers on this side of the House have said, the problem is that we have not funded to adequate levels at any level of the education system.  The appalling state of our primary school buildings is just one example of that but so too is the shortfall in funding we are experiencing in the third level sector.  In next week&rsquo;s budget I hope we see resourcing for third level to enable these sort of rankings to be achieved, not just by Trinity College Dublin but by other universities too, and proper levels of research and teaching being continued in the third level sector.</P>
        <P>In the context of the budget, I welcome the comments this morning that the proposed merger of five equality and rights institutions may not now go ahead.  I see the deputy Leader indicating that he may have had something to do with this change of heart but before the banking crisis emerged, there were indications that the Equality Authority, the Irish Human Rights Commission and a number of other bodies would be merged.  Along with others I asked for a debate on that and called for that not to happen.  I am delighted to see the Minister has now indicated it may not happen.  Now that we are talking in hundreds of billions of losses, the tiny amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions to the Leader is what I am looking for from all Senators.  Please be brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Leader for clarification as to whether this merger will go ahead.  The money that would be saved would be minuscule in the context of the billions about which we are talking.  It would be a retrograde step should this merger go ahead.  I hope it will not, and I ask the Leader for clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to inquire as to the possibility of removing tobacco from the consumer price index.  I ask for that because, first, it is a health issue and, second, tobacco is not an essential item.  We had an excellent representation here yesterday from the Irish Cancer Society who requested that &euro;2 be added to the price of a packet of cigarettes, and it gave very sound health reasons for that.  The number of people smoking in this country has increased from 27% to 29%, with all the added health risks.  If we were to put a figure on it, the cost of smoking on the health service is &euro;1 billion and that must be addressed as a health issue.  It should not be included in the consumer price index because it is not an essential item.</P>
      
        <P>Regarding water quality throughout the country, the recent reports in Thurles and Galway have to do with lead pipes rather than lead in the water.  Will the Leader agree to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make available a means-tested grant to assist people who are not in a position to pay for the piping in their houses to be changed?  We need to ensure people receive water of the highest quality.  There is no problem with the water going into their homes.  It is the lead piping that is causing the health risks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The banks clearly have a moral, if not a legal, duty to pass yesterday&rsquo;s interest rate cut on to their hard-pressed customers, the country&rsquo;s taxpayers about whom I presume the other House, like this House, is concerned and whom we want to protect.  We have given a commitment to introduce a scheme to assist such people but it is not yet in place.  The Government has agreed to allow the EU to tweak the proposed scheme.

	<P>I am coming to that.  I am concerned about the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; approach that is being taken in respect of Valentia and Malin Head coastguard stations, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred.  As I understand it, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who was mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, had responsibility for this matter, they gave a clear indication that they were prepared to implement the recommendations of the 2003 Deloitte &amp; Touche report.  I know that no decision has been taken yet.  Is the Government continuing to row back on the indication that was given previously?  It seems to me that it is being gradually eroded as a result of pressure from within the Civil Service.  That is why I fear that the &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; approach will prevail.  Now that certain elections are imminent, no decision is being announced.  I suggest that no responsibility is being taken.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, and his Garda team on their response to a botched robbery near my constituency office in Killester last night.  A man in his 20s who was involved in a stabbing incident at the scene died later in hospital, sadly.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has arrested a man in his 30s.  I understand good progress is being made with the investigation.  It will be intriguing to learn how events unfolded during the incident.  I congratulate the Garda team involved.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the many Irish missionaries, non-governmental organisations and volunteers who work tirelessly to deliver much-needed services in difficult and dangerous conditions.  Can the Leader arrange for Senators to be briefed on general security activity along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and what preventative measures can be taken to combat terrorism and militant operations in the area?  I express my solidarity with the Irish Presentation Sisters, who were attacked by Taliban-like militants recently.  Their educational facility in Sengota, which is in the Swat district of Pakistan, was destroyed in the incident.</P>
        <P>The Leader is aware that I have raised certain issues relating to the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive in recent times.  In particular, I have monitored the dispute that has resulted from the decision of the HSE to cut payments to pharmacists for certain services.  It is expected that later today, Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan will release her decision on costs, and her quantification of the liability of the HSE arising from the Hickey&rsquo;s Pharmacy case.  Ms Justice Finlay Geoghegan has already ruled in favour of Hickey&rsquo;s Pharmacy.  She found the HSE and the Department to be breach of contract on existing arrangements.  Will the HSE reverse its decision to cut payments to pharmacists, which has been implemented since 1 March last?  Will all moneys owed to pharmacists be repaid?  Can the Leader arrange for clarification and a statement on the matter from the Department and the HSE?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Leader did not get a chance to respond yesterday to an issue I had raised on the Order of Business, so I will mention it briefly again today.  I asked him to impress on the relevant Minister the need to introduce a national insulation scheme as a matter of urgency.  Such a scheme would be useful and would have a number of benefits as part of an overall economic strategy.  It would create a number of jobs in the construction sector, it would remove people from the social welfare system and it would make our homes more energy efficient.</P>
        <P>Similarly, it is important for the Leader to impress on the Minister for Finance the absolute need for the banks to pass on the interest rate cut to this country&rsquo;s hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders.  It would be the height of cheek if they were not to do so, especially in light of the manner in which this State guaranteed such institutions last week.  We can give the Financial Regulator some powers in this regard if needs be.  In the absence of such a system, we need to ensure the Government can lead the charge by reducing the level of arrogance that exists in the banking sector.  It should ensure the interest rate reduction is passed on to customers.</P>
        <P>We had a good debate last night on a Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; motion on educational issues.  If the debate had continued for a week, it would not have been difficult to get speakers. <Col N="396"/> I wished to make a good suggestion to the Minister for Education and Science, but by the time I got to speak he had left the Chamber.  I thank Senator Boyle for his ecumenical gesture in sharing time with me.  The proposal in question involves allowing schools to get mortgages.  The State should guarantee mortgages for schools, thereby enabling them to pursue construction projects.  A gaelscoil in my constituency is paying &euro;300,000 a year in rent.  Surely better value for money could be secured if the State were to guarantee a mortgage for the school in question.  When such a scheme was first suggested to the Minister, Deputy Martin, in 1997, he said it was eminently sensible.  I urge the Leader to arrange an open-ended debate on education, if there is time, at some stage in the near future.  We need to be able to make proposals as we see fit to ensure this country benefits from a better educational infrastructure.</P>

	<P>People power must come into play if the 0.5% reduction in interest rates is to be implemented.  Mr. Joe Duffy and his colleagues on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; have been quite active in relation to banking over recent times.  I hope they will focus on the 0.5% reduction in interest rates today.  I ask the Leader of the House to convey to the banks, the Government and the Minister the belief of this House that the 0.5% reduction in interest rates should be implemented immediately.  I think that can be done unanimously.  I do not think any Member of the House would dissent.  The same message could be sent from the Oireachtas to Mr. Hurley and his colleagues in the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  Having bankrolled the financial institutions to the tune of &euro;400 billion, I think we have some influence in this regard.  Those institutions cannot set the views of this House aside.  They cannot ignore the opinions expressed by the Leader of the House.  This cut should be implemented forthwith and without delay.  It is imperative for hard pressed householders who are facing the increased costs of energy as we approach winter.</P>
        <P>The cost of the barrel of oil has dropped, but this has not been passed on at filling stations.  The owners are saying that they must wait a long time before the price comes down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but as soon as the price of crude goes up, the price at the pumps also increases.  The groceries order should be revisited, as its removal has not helped the consumer.  The Leader was Chairman of the committee involved at the time and he fought against its removal.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White has played a great role in producing a new document on child care.  I regret that people are criticising her approach, as she has worked on these issues and brought them before the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is calling for questions and I have one for the Leader.  What is happening with the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008?  We on this side have been seeking information on it for many months.  We have had debates on the proper provision for the care of the elderly.  The Bill was flagged and it has been published, but we are now getting indications that it may not be taken in the other House until well into the spring.  I presume we have a parliamentary mechanism that would allow for the Bill to be republished and taken in this House.  We have a duty of care to the elderly in the community.  Even though the contents of this Bill will be the cause of much debate, at least it will be the start of a debate.  Is it possible to take this Bill in the House before Christmas?  The Minister for Health and Children indicated that the Bill was almost ready over 12 months ago.  We then heard of parliamentary and legal difficulties.  At least it has been published.  The publication of the Bill is of no use to tens of thousands of people until such time as it enacted.  We have the time in this House before Christmas to deal with the Bill.</P>
        <P>A colleague of the deputy Leader believes that this House is almost redundant and that we should all be taking pay cuts.  That is a bit rich coming from somebody who has a full Oireachtas salary and chairs an Oireachtas committee as well.  As we demonstrated last week, we in this House can do our job very effectively.  Could we take charge of this nursing homes Bill and put a scheme in place for the tens of thousands of people who are urgently awaiting it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in welcoming the possibility of a debate on the banks.  What we are essentially seeing is the nationalisation of the banking system, and I strongly welcome this.  There will be a requirement for a further inflow of public funds, and so the taxpayer should be entitled to equity for that investment.  I heard somebody on the radio yesterday saying that we needed a return to the values of public service, and I agree completely.  Where did they go?  Many of us have been calling for that for a long time.  This is a public utility and should be treated as such.  We all use the banking system and we cannot live our lives without it.  It must be protected by the State and I do not mind the word &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo;.  In fact, I welcome it.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleague, Senator Hannigan, for his generous remarks about Trinity College, while his own university is also in the first 200 colleges.  Trinity College has managed to get into the first 50 colleges.  These are very significant achievements for both universities, especially if one looks at the top 20.  They are almost all from America, although there are a few British universities.  The difference is the massive funding that both states put into third level education.  I have a slight difference with my colleague, Senator Bacik, as I believe the question of fees is still open.  I know this could damage my constituency and that I could lose votes, but I do not care.  One must look at these matters in a detached light and I believe that the scarce resources <Col N="398"/>of the State are directed in the most meaningful way towards the most vulnerable people.  I am not going to stand against fees until that question has been examined, because we must, as a matter of principle, protect the most vulnerable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My final point is on the proposed metro.  I welcome very much the fact that this continues to be discussed on the transport committee, and I ask the Leader for a full debate on this matter.  It started in the House as the framework legislation was passed in here following a vote.  It is important to note that the Chairman of the transport committee, Deputy Fahey, said yesterday that it was vitally important that the metro project continue.  He was supported by the Fine Gael representative, Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd, who said that it was an essential piece of infrastructure.  Nonetheless, <i>The Irish Times</i>, under the leadership of its former environment correspondent Frank McDonald, has been engaging continually over the last ten years in an almost ideologically committed campaign against the metro.  This is similar to the campaign the <i>Sunday Independent</i> waged against Mary Robinson when she was President, when we would see her in the fashion pages.  One would expect to find her in the weather column, because every possible device was used to be critical of her.</P>

	<P>It is the same in <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the metro.  This project was delayed 20 years ago, even though it was known to be the best solution, because we hit a rock in finance terms.  We cannot afford to do it again, and we need to discuss it openly in the House.</P>

The Minister for Health and Children has once again abdicated responsibility in her provision of care to the people.  I am calling on the Leader to facilitate a debate on the health cutbacks that have affected people.  Senator Bradford rightly made reference to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008, which is probably one of the most important Bills that we will have before us in this House.  It behoves the Leader, and as the representative of the Government in the House, to do what Senator Bradford has requested.  We owe a duty of care to our elderly.  This Government had neglected that responsibility until now.  The Bill could be fast-tracked into this House.</P>
        <P>As legislators, we have an obligation to the people who put us here.  They are the ordinary people of Ireland who are now being asked to bail out the banks.  We have given them a dig-out, and the banks must now pass on the interest rate cut to their customers immediately.  For once I agree with Senator Butler.  He is correct in saying it is the small holders who are being affected.  Small businesses and tenants in shopping centres are doing no business at the moment and they are being forced to pay penal costs in rent.  There is an obligation on the Government side to act with us on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that Senator Leyden castigate us on this side of the House.  We are not criticising Senator White at all.  We are criticising Government policy, which Senator Leyden has supported for the past 11 years.</P>

It was important that the Members of this House, virtually unanimously, came out to say that the banks should pass on the interest rate cuts to consumers.  The great mass of the people were fulsome in their support for the guarantees to the banks.  There is a necessary <i>quid pro quo</i> now and the consumers of this country need a response from the banks.  I urge the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Finance the wish of this House that he approach the banking sector to convey that the democratically elected assemblies of this country want this done and that there is a moral and overall imperative on the banks to act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At this time of financial constraints we should be looking at imaginative ways of bringing forward socially humane legislation and at the same time try to be as cost neutral as possible.  I have been putting it to the Leader over the previous year &mdash; the Leader responded positively on a few occasions but there has not yet been an outcome &mdash; that were the means test to be removed from the carer&rsquo;s allowance then, in the context of unemployment and bearing in mind the cost of nursing homes and the cost of subvention, the number of people who would take up caring at home, which is much more efficacious for the individual being cared for and makes them much happier, would make it a cost effective and cost neutral proposition.  The cost of nursing homes and institutional care would go down.  This proposal is worthy of examination.  I ask the Leader that at least a feasibility study be undertaken and that it be considered as a serious proposition.</P>
        <P>The Carers Association of Ireland is asking that only carers be means tested.  I would go so far as to say that the means test should be removed.  Many people will stay at home because in the current employment context this will be an option.  It will allow people to be cared for at home where they are happiest and it will save money to the State.  This should be carried out at a minimum on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>I have been putting it to the Leader over the past year and I would commend it to him again that the means test of the non-contributory old age pension should be removed.  Only a small number of the population are on the non-contributory old age pension and these are mainly housewives who were put out of work by the marriage bar in the past and subsistence farmers; virtually everyone else has PRSI contributions.  The cost of administering the means test is greater than any savings effective in it.  The means test is inhumane and it is terrorising old people.  I appeal to the Leader again &mdash; he responded positively to me before &mdash; that some action be taken to effect this change.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence but these are important issues in the context of the times in which we are living.  I want to support the call of my colleague, Senator McCarthy, for insulation grants.  A grant of &euro;1,000 per house would make it viable to insulate.  The cost of insulating an average house is approximately &euro;2,200.  This grant could be a national scheme and the outcome would allow for one third saving of energy costs and there would also be a carbon saving which would have an ultimate impact on fines incurred under the Kyoto Protocol.  It would be financially viable.  I appeal to the Leader to consider this request.  We need to think outside the box and to think humanely and with an eye to being cost neutral.</P>

	<P>Those of us in the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland have done our bit last week and we are continuing to do it.  Our commitment is to a strong banking system in our country.  The banks have an obligation and a responsibility.  Without putting a tooth in it, we expect them to do this.  I congratulate the Halifax and the AIB banks who came out straight away and announced they would reduce their interest rates.  This is not a time when the banks can consider making profits in any shape or form; we are concerned with the survival of the economy of our country and they too must play a part.  Whatever happened in the past, the Oireachtas came to the rescue last week.  As has been said here this morning, the national media have a duty and a responsibility to announce, on an hourly basis, the names of the banks who are not going to implement the reduction.  The AIB and the Halifax banks have given the lead and example.  </P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is consulting with the European Union.  I understand that the foreign banks with substantial and significant business in Ireland are included in the scheme and this is welcome.  Yesterday morning I highlighted to the House the significant number of account holders in the Ulster Bank, the ACC bank and National Irish Bank.  Other substantial foreign banks are doing huge business here.  We want competition in the market place because it keeps the competitive edge going among our hard pressed business people who have been providing employment over many generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Leader of the House and on behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann I echo the unanimous call of Senators that the Financial Regulator and the banks implement the 0.5% interest rate reduction immediately.  I call on the national media, which I know will play their part, in the national interest and along with us as parliamentarians, to monitor on an hourly basis and say who in the banking world is not paying their part.</P>

I realise that there has been a substantial decrease in the incidence of MRSA in our hospitals over the past 12 months and this is welcome.  However, the work is ongoing and we must keep up the pressure on the HSE to ensure that the infection is completely eliminated if at all possible.  </P>

There is no doubt about the views of all Senators and I will ascertain the Government&rsquo;s position from the Minister later today to ensure that Valentia Island and Malin radio stations will fulfil their important and responsible role which covers decades.

Senators Hannigan, Bacik, McCarthy and Norris called for a debate on third level education and funding for school buildings which I hope will be considered and perhaps included by the Government in the near future.</P>
<Col N="401"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mary White, supported by Senator Bacik and many Members such as Senator Buttimer, called on the Minister of State with responsibility for children, to come to the House to discuss the child care strategy and the future of child care.  Senator White quoted from statistics on the subject.  She has done trojan work in this area.  It shows that when a Member of the House rolls up the sleeves, much can be achieved by way of information which is of benefit to both the Department and the Government and to the Members of the House in general.  I will have no difficulty in arranging this at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin outlined his proposal for the Minister and the Government to consider the removal of tobacco from the consumer price index.  He also referred to a recent visit by representatives of the Irish Cancer Society.  It is alarming that, as the Senator said, smoking is on the increase, from 27% to 29% of the population.  It could possibly cost the Health Service Executive &euro;1 billion a year for the treatment of smoking related diseases.  I will have no difficulty in arranging for a debate on this matter also.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan and Hanafin also drew my attention to the lead content in water in certain areas.  A survey should be carried out by all local authorities because 50 years ago, most water schemes installed lead piping.  Much work can be done in this area.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford, Buttimer and Reilly all made known their views on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill.  I am pleased to inform the House that this Bill is being published today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a D&aacute;il Bill but must go through both Houses and I know it will have the support of both sides of this House for a speedy passage when it comes to us.</P>
        <P>Senator Reilly made a proposal regarding the means test for the old age non-contributory pension, which I fully support.  I wish to inform the House that Fianna F&aacute;il will forfeit its Private Members&rsquo; time on Wednesday next.  I will seek the permission of the House to have an extended three-hour time slot for Private Members&rsquo; business so that we can have statements on the budget.  Senator Reilly&rsquo;s proposal is a good one and can be brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  It could also be considered for the Finance Bill which will be published later and it is hoped will be passed by both Houses before the Christmas recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely outlined the horrific incident that took place near his constituency office in Killester.  He congratulated the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, on the matter.  I wish to convey the condolences of the House to the family of the man who lost his life, so tragically and so young, in that incident.  It is something that should never have happened.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely also referred to briefing issues on Pakistan and I wish to convey our good wishes to the Presentation Sisters in that country.  I will pass on to the Minister for Health and Children his concerns and inquiry about the pharmacies issue and especially the court case concerning pharmacists that were involved with the HSE.  I will revert to the Senator on that at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senators McCarthy and Reilly inquired about the insulation scheme.  My understanding is that it will be included in the budget next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris expressed his strong support for the continuation of the metro project.  Many people wish to see it continue as it would advance the requirements of our capital city in the 21st century.  I support the call for its continuation.</P>

    <Title>Money Advice and Budgeting Service: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and call on her to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm bheith anseo sa Seanad ar maidin chun labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</P>
        <P>In recent times we have all become conscious of the fact that many people are in need of guidance and assistance on financial matters.  They include people who have been unfortunate enough to lose their jobs recently and who may have mortgages or rent to pay as well as difficulties in paying bills generally.  They also include people who are still in employment but have been overstretched in credit and accounts and do not know where to turn.  We have been fortunate in recent years to have the facility of the money advice and budgeting service throughout the country.  MABS can offer advice, guidance and support in helping people to reorganise their finances sympathetically and confidentially.  I recently visited some of the MABS centres to get an idea of the type of client availing of that service.  Whereas traditionally it has been a social welfare client base, and that continues to be the majority, one now finds people using MABS who may not be dependent on social welfare but who have found themselves caught in the credit squeeze.  Such people need particular support and advice.</P>
        <P>MABS is the main Government-funded service, which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with their debt problems.  The 1992 budget provided for a special allocation of &euro;330,000 for the establishment of five MABS pilot projects throughout the country.  Since then the number of MABS offices delivering money advice has grown to 52 and the annual allocation this year is &euro;18 million.  That is a substantial sum of money and we are fortunate to have it at a time when so many people require it.</P>
        <P>A national company, MABS National Development Limited, was established in 2004 to support and develop the service.  Some 246 staff are employed by MABS companies throughout the country.  In addition to the staff&rsquo;s expertise, we also have management committees drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups to run each local project.  The commitment and expertise of all these voluntary groups, together with the time given and training received, constitutes a major contribution to social capital in this country.  This wide-ranging voluntary activity involves people who understand the circumstances in which clients find themselves.  The efforts of voluntary staff who are so willing to give of their time is greatly appreciated.</P>
        <P>Local MABS operate as partnerships of all relevant agencies.  They give advice and assistance but do not pay debts or provide any funds to clients.  The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception.  I know Members of this House and others are strong supporters of the credit union movement which helps communities throughout the country.  In this particular respect, their involvement and support is central to the development and success of the service.  Other voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the community welfare service, citizens information centres, centres for the unemployed and local authorities, work closely with the programme.</P>
        <P>The MABS provides a high-quality personal service to the public and makes a significant difference to peoples lives.  The key features of MABS may be summarised as follows: an emphasis on practical, budget-based measures to assist people with debt difficulties; an approach that targets families identified as having problems with debt and money-lending; a prominent role for local voluntary and statutory agencies, as I mentioned; the provision of education on budgeting and money management in the local community; and the sharing of experiences and information to combat moneylending.</P>
<Col N="403"/>
        <P>When the late Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, our great colleague, was Minister, there was much talk about moneylending and he was particularly active in ensuring that new regulations were introduced to counteract the level of illegal moneylending in the country.</P>
        <P>Last year 12,400 new clients approached MABS.  Already this year, 12,400 new clients have been seen by MABS.  That is an indication, not just of their own personal circumstances, but of the way the credit crunch is squeezing people and that with more people losing their jobs, unfortunately, they, too, are feeling particularly vulnerable.  They are also people who know now that they have somewhere to turn.  In addition, the MABS helpline launched in October 2007 has dealt with over 9,000 calls.</P>
        <P>I was interested by the profile of some of the people concerned.  In Thurles, only last week staff were telling me about the different types of groups, young and old, that were coming in to them.  Equally, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, those in my local MABS office spoke of the different profiles.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In one case a young woman of 23 came in with debts of &euro;61,000.  She did not have a house.  She had nothing to show for the &euro;61,000, but the bank continued to give her credit for holidays and for incidentals.  She now finds herself in a situation with no way of repaying the debt.  There was obviously some lack of responsibility, both in the lending and in the woman herself in overstretching, but at least she turned to MABS for help.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the other end of the spectrum MABS is finding that men in their 40s, who at the height of the Celtic tiger were the ones taking out big loans and investing, suddenly find that they are not able to meet their repayments.  MABS was not established to support that type of person initially, but it is available to such persons and they are welcome.  If such persons now find themselves in serious difficulty with financing, MABS might not solve their problem but can guide them on where to go and can help them.  It might be a way of protecting, not just a young investor but, more particularly, the houses that he was going to build in social housing and the jobs that he was going to provide for young people and others in a community.  MABS is broadening its remit within the guidelines for its operation, but it is welcoming a range of different people through its doors.</P>
        <P>The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  Research shows that lack of information about money management can be a contributory factor in many cases.  A key function of the MABS, therefore, is to promote greater awareness about household budgeting.</P>
        <P>For example, MABS and the Financial Regulator have developed an education programme on money management for transition year students, which I launched a couple of weeks ago.  It is a useful project.  It is allowing young people at a good age to be able to make the decisions about what they want and what they need, and asking them to focus on the real issues on which they should be spending their money and on what their priorities should be.  It is done in a good, fun way.  The programme includes good student packs and a good workbook diary that allows students to record each day what they spend their money on, whether it be on their mobile phone or on food, and helps them budget at a young age.  This allows a long-term approach to be taken as well as the short-term one.</P>
        <P>MABS is growing throughout the country.  It is a service that is particularly welcomed by the many people who, unfortunately, find themselves having to avail of it.</P>
        <P>The key message that needs to be put across is that MABS is there to help, to advise and to guide.  It is there to support people who find themselves unemployed, caught in a credit squeeze or in financial difficulties.  Rather than such people continuing to bear that problem alone, perhaps leading to other social problems for them, it is key that they would know that the service is there for them.  We can see that in the numbers of people who are applying all of the time.</P>
<Col N="404"/>
        <P>The individual debt for any one person might to some of us appear very small, but to them it can be considerable, and MABS can help them to overcome that.  The average debt owed by new clients was &euro;11,600, but by being able to sit down with people working with the creditors, they were able to see how the payments could be phased and how they can work through the credit union.</P>
        <P>MABS is a tremendous service.  I am delighted to see that it is in place to support people coming from a range of different backgrounds.  The majority of clients continue to be those on social welfare payments, who make up 59%.  The highest number of those are one-parent families, at 18%.  Some 17% are in receipt of job-seeker&rsquo;s payments.  Approximately 28% are in receipt of wages.  Many of them have no second income coming in.</P>
        <P>The profiles of people using the service are different.  Many of them live in their own homes, many are in rented local authority accommodation, others are renting and some are even living with their parents.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a key message.  I am delighted that the Seanad has taken the opportunity to discuss this issue so that we can advise people that, no matter what their circumstances or how difficult they find the current credit and financial situation, if it is impacting on them personally, the money advice and budgeting service is there throughout the country to support them.  I am delighted to be the Minister who is responsible for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for being here.  I, too, welcome the opportunity to discuss MABS.</P>
        <P>The most common reasons that people experience difficulties, according to MABS, are changes in life circumstances &mdash; illness, unemployment, relationship breakdown, a drop in income and, of course, increased expenditure when there is not enough money to go around.</P>
        <P>The Minister outlined the types of people who use the services, but in my experience it is not just people on low income who have difficulties.  People who earned a great deal of money are also now affected by serious money problems.</P>
        <P>When people have serious financial difficulties it can have significant effects on their health, especially their mental health, and a knock-on effect on the family.  MABS provides an excellent tried and trusted service and acts on behalf of the person who is in financial difficulty by making arrangements with banking institutions that are attainable.</P>
        <P>A new legislative structure was promised in 2002 for MABS and I ask the Minister to comment on that.  The new legislative structure would streamline the organisation while at the same time maintain the valuable local input to which she referred.  There would be cost savings in advertising and utility bills, etc.</P>
        <P>When preparing for this debate I spoke to my local MABS office, which does incredible work in Athlone.  The staff told me that the people who come in to them have nowhere else to turn.  Often they come in with piles of unopened letters and bills and place them on the desk in front of the money adviser.  I am aware of the excellent rapport that is in existence between the various NGOs and MABS, however MABS alone provides the service of negotiating on behalf of the debtors with the banks.</P>
        <P>We must not lose track of the people about whom we are talking.  These are unfortunate individuals who have been targeted by the banks.  They are victims of sub-prime lenders who have overstretched themselves with serious credit card debt, and who have unsecured debts for car loans, holidays, home improvements, etc.  It has been brought to my attention that because <Col N="405"/>these people have got into bad debt, banking services and facilities have been withdrawn from them altogether.  That is scandalous.</P>
        <P>One of the most positive things people in these lonely and desperate situations can do is recognise the fact that they have a problem and contact MABS.  It is a tried and trusted service.  If one is on a low income or social welfare payment, a death in the family or a serious illness can cause severe financial insecurity.  In fact, people often have to go without food or heat in an effort to pay their bills.  Sometimes people who go from welfare to part-time work discover they do not have as much money as they expected to have.  They still need to be able to plan how to pay their bills.  One of the positive aspects of MABS is that it can help people in such difficulty and find affordable situations and solutions for people who owe money.</P>
        <P>The statistics are startling.  They show that in the last eight months there has been a 33% increase in the number of people using MABS.  Of the total amount of debt, 62% is owed to banks and financial institutions, 17% is owed to credit unions, 3% is owed for gas and ESB and 2% is owed to moneylenders.  As the Minister mentioned, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan did much to deal with the problem of moneylending.  I looked at the website last night and saw the lovely photographs of him which were taken when he launched that campaign.  Unfortunately, the increase in unemployment means the statistics relating to MABS will probably increase further.</P>
        <P>We must not exclude the self employed from the service.  They are also at high risk but MABS is not mandated to help people who are self employed and still trading.  They can only get help if their business fails.  Perhaps the Minister would review this.  It would be most helpful if self employed people could get help when their business is running down.  If they got help with book-keeping and so forth, they might find a way for their business to survive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Lone parents are also getting into financial trouble.  If single parents work part-time, they do not qualify for medical cards or the back-to-school allowance.  They lose their benefits if they work up to 20 hours per week.  These people should be financially better off when they go back to work but they are being penalised for doing so.  They then get into huge debt and must resort to the MABS.  I met a lady last week whose income is &euro;26 over the limit to qualify for the back-to-school allowance.  She has one child doing the leaving certificate and another in first communion class.  Both children cost a fortune.  She is unable to pay her television licence fee and went into debt to pay for the books, uniforms and so forth for the children.  It is morally wrong.  This lady has wanted to work for years but she cannot get out of the poverty trap.  She eventually borrowed to pay her television licence fee.</P>
        <P>The people counting the cost of a carton of milk and a bale of briquettes, whom I represent in my constituency, are honest to goodness, ordinary Irish people.  They are the most marginalised in society and cannot be subject to budget cuts.  I am appalled that the global downturn will be blamed for all our economic troubles.  Fuel allowances, pensions and social welfare must be increased to meet the commitments we have agreed under social partnership.  If those benefits are not increased, many more people are likely to turn to MABS.</P>
        <P>There are plenty of high earners who should bear the brunt of this downturn, particularly the banking CEOs.  We found out last week how much they earn.  The scaremongering and warning about how difficult this budget will be should stop.  It is frightening people to the core.  The people who have run this country into the ground should bear the brunt of it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Combat Poverty Agency recently made a presentation to the social and family affairs committee.  That agency should be retained and not subsumed into the office for social inclusion.  There will be little monetary saving from subsuming the agency into that office and we would lose a strong, independent voice.  The service the Combat Poverty Agency provides <Col N="406"/>in terms of research and so forth is second to none.  I urge the Minister to review that proposal and not subsume the agency into the office for social inclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and her officials.  Money advice centres are similar to some citizens information centres.  They offer advice and direction and help people in preparing a household budget.  Advisers assist and support people who are trying to cope with debt problems.  It is important to note that MABS does not provide financial help, although some members of the public think it does.  We must rectify that perception.  The service will direct people to their credit union or their local branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The main task of MABS is to enable people to regain control of their finances and to educate them on essential and practical budgeting and money management skills.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The MABS does a good job and I have supported it from its start.  However, we should examine some aspects of the service.  A call centre was established in Nangor Road Business Park and was opened by the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  The centre received 7,000 telephone calls in one year.  I am informed that the type of calls received in the centre tend to be from people asking where they should go to get advice.  They are told by the call centre to ring their local advice centre.  This is a duplication of service and is not good value for money.  In the first place people must find out about the helpline, but the helpline then directs them to ring another centre.  We should review the value for money we are getting from this system.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden mentioned that clients might call into a centre with a pile of bills.  They come to constituency clinics with piles of bills as well.  A constituent called to my clinic with an ESB bill, telephone bill and a number of other bills and told me to sort them out.  We must be careful that we do not spoon-feed people to the extent that word will go around that if people throw a heap of bills on the table, they will be sorted out.  That is not the idea behind the service.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator McFadden said the Combat Poverty Agency should not be subsumed into the office for social inclusion.  I believe it should and agree with that approach.  There are various reasons but I will not discuss them now.  With regard to MABS, the Department should appoint an inspector of services who could call to offices and have the authority to examine staffing levels, case loads, opening hours and so forth.  I notice from the list of offices that many of them are open from 9.30 a.m. to 12 p.m. for administration and other business.  Is there a problem with staffing levels?  Is an adequate service being provided?  Somebody should be appointed to oversee and inspect the service.</P>
        <P>There are many agencies under the aegis of the Department.  In Coolock, for example, there is a citizens advice centre, which provides information and advice to citizens, an unemployment centre, which provides information about budgeting and so forth, a MABS, a law centre, a resource centre and a family mediation centre. There is considerable duplication of activity in these centres and their operations should all be under one roof.  There is a good example in the civic offices in Coolock, which house MABS, the law centre and the family mediation centre.</P>
      
        <P>Some agencies, including resource centres, advertise in the newspapers for community employment co-ordinators and other types of co-ordinators.  If one tracks these, one will find the jobs are usually obtained by friends of those already working in the centres.  I queried this with a member of staff in a centre not too long ago and was told those employed were the best people for the job because they had been doing the work voluntarily and were known on the basis of their having been in and out of the centre.  This is occurring wholesale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are not obtaining value for money in many of the centres.  I met a woman in a centre on one occasion and asked her what she was doing and she replied the only job she did was to get a bingo hall ready for every Tuesday night.  She stated she had nothing else to do.  There is <Col N="407"/>another centre in which the head honcho has three of his family on the payroll.  He had the audacity to write to the Government stating the centre was not receiving adequate funding.  This is occurring wholesale and there is no accountability.  There are no inspections or audits of the centres; there is shag-all.  No one checks the organisations and those running them believe in many cases that they are running their own little business and are entitled to do what they like.  They say, &ldquo;How dare you touch me, how dare you ask me what I am doing and how dare you ask about the hours I open. Please just get me funding as that is all I want to know about.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>We have a responsibility to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent wisely and that value for money is achieved.  With regard to the organisations with which I am familiar, I can say honestly on oath that we are not getting value for money.  We are throwing money down the drain that could be put to better use.</P>
        <P>An inventory should be produced by the Department in each constituency to establish the services being provided.  It should determine whether the services are essential or needed at all.  The Department should ask whether the public would be better or worse off if the services were not in place and, ultimately, whether value for money is being achieved on foot of the money invested.</P>
        <P>Every time one meets the director of a centre, he or she asks for funding and asks that representations be made to the Minister.  If an organisation is entitled to funding, one should not have to make representations to anyone.  A director should simply make a submission for the funding.  It is a load of codology that politicians from all parties state they got this or that for an organisation.  This should be stopped as it is a bloody nonsense.  It is old-hat politics and make-believe stuff and the public do not believe in it any more.  This sort of old cute hoor practice, so to speak, has been generated in politics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whereby politicians tell constituents to come to them as they are the best and know the Minister.

They might ask a constituent not to approach a certain politician as he is a member of the Opposition and therefore can do nothing for him or her.</P>

	<P>We should all work together to achieve what is best for our constituents.</P>
        <P>MABS is doing a good job and perhaps is necessary.  However, we should not get carried away with it.  Many agencies &mdash; I am not referring to MABS &mdash; put on a great show for a Minister if he or she visits, but if one arrives unannounced, one will not be received in the same way.  I visited a certain forum associated with community employment schemes with a former Minister and we asked where all the staff were.  The person to whom we were talking said they were on outreach.  We asked whether we could meet them and the person said he did not know.  We asked whether they had a mobile telephone but the person stated he did not know the number.  This gives one some idea of what is going on.  There were two people in the centre in question drinking mugs of tea.  I would prefer to pay them to stay at home and make their own tea.</P>
<Col N="408"/>
        <P>We should be more careful about how we pick MABS directors and should get them to sign a contract to accept the responsibility attached to their post.  This is not the case at present.  We should employ the best people.  Directors are engaged on a voluntary basis and are picked out of a hat.  We should consider addressing this because it is very important.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister has taken note of the fact that a person should be appointed, without creating an extra layer of bureaucracy, to check on the level of output, input and service.  It is very easy to get the wrong picture when one attends a launch.  Of course the staff present will tell one the centre is receiving thousands of calls and they will give an example of the kinds of people who attended on the preceding day.  They may state they were three hours dealing with one person the day before.</P>
        <P>I remember working in the post office when there was an organisational management study to establish what services were required.  We used to get other people in other buildings to bombard us with telephone calls when the study was being conducted.  I am just making the point that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to the House.  I congratulate her on her appointment and wish her well in her role.  Now, more than ever, we are very aware of the economic climate and the difficulties faced by people, not least by Ministers, who must try this week to agree on the budget for next year.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs, more than any Department, reaches out to an audience that is by and large more vulnerable and more in need of State support than any other.  The task ahead is quite difficult and my party will make proposals that it believes are beneficial and worthwhile.</P>
        <P>No one will disagree with the fact that MABS provides a very important service.  There was a different political era and economic climate in 1992 when the economy was just turning the corner and taking off.  Given the downturn in the economy in 2008, it is ironic that people are returning to services such as MABS for guidance and advice.  It is very important that MABS be advice-based and emphasise budgetary measures.</P>
        <P>MABS deals with children and adults in a number of different areas.  With regard to adults, it is not appropriate simply to pay off debts.  There are obviously cases of extreme hardship where the only possible action entails doing so but, in general, the mission statement and objective of the organisation is quite good.  To write a cheque to someone to pay a bill is completely missing the point.  What people require is training in financial management and household economics.  Budget-based advice is essential because it gets one out of one&rsquo;s current position and also provides one with the necessary skills to deal with financial problems when they present themselves.  I am reminded of the old adage that if one gives a man a fish, one will feed him for a day but that if one teaches him how to fish, he will be fed for life.  This very much reflects the ethos of MABS.</P>
        <P>It is very important that a person can go to a MABS office in a certain town or village at any given time and receive one-to-one service from a member of staff.  It must be shattering for someone not to have money in his pocket and be faced with bills.  Very few families have not experienced this, especially the bigger ones.  Down through the generations, such families had to make do on very small budgets, particularly the female members of the households.  These women were accountants, bookkeepers, purchasers, mothers, cooks, chefs and cleaners.  Their role was multifaceted.  Down through the years, there was very little support for such <Col N="409"/>household leaders.  I thank God we now have the wherewithal to put in place structures to ensure families will not fall into the poverty trap and that, if they do, the State will be able to provide them with the skills, confidence and dignity to get out of it.</P>
        <P>It must be quite daunting for a person to receive two or three additional bills in any given week and realise there is no money to pay them.  It is great that an adviser can go to that person&rsquo;s door, listen and advise on what needs to be done to get out of financial difficulty.  We must not forget the local impetus in terms of running the service and the local connection which means somebody does not have to go to a larger urban centre.  In many ways, this is reflective of a decentralisation in that the service is at somebody&rsquo;s doorstep, which is important.  It does not involve great use of public transport or great difficulty to get to one of these centres.  The most difficult thing for people is deciding they need to seek help and then going about seeking it.</P>
        <P>We need to be mindful of the proliferation of money lenders and loan sharks in this country, particularly during the 1980s when it was not easy for any Government to take charge because money was so scarce.  It is unthinkable that some were involved in this type of activity, which still goes on, although thankfully not to the same degree.  Bullies who would do a disservice to Mafia dons went into working class estates to families who had no money, lent them money at extortionate interest rates and then bullied them into paying that money back.  Who can ever forget the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, the precursor of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, which focused on the scum who operated in this country throughout the 1980s?  They went to people&rsquo;s houses to meet the female head of the household on her way to the post office to collect children&rsquo;s allowance.  They then waited for her to come out of the post office before taking the cash from her.  It was unspeakably evil to perpetrate that kind of bullying and exploitation on those who were financially less well off and to take complete advantage of them.</P>
        <P>If anything, MABS highlights the other side of that coin in providing a decent and dignified State service that ensures the loan sharks do not have a clientele to bully and intimidate.  That MABS now has more than 12,000 clients is remarkable, as is the statistic that it has dealt with more than 9,000 calls since October 2007, particularly given the number of people who, in the absence of that service, would unfortunately fall into the clutches of money lenders and loan sharks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To return to the point on the household budget, it is very important to give people not just a skillset but the structure they need to run a household based on a budget.  I know there are those who cannot handle money, and to know this is necessary to deal with the problem.  It is most important to put in place a scheme whereby a person knows he or she has X amount and must pay A, B and C from that.  Giving that kind of advice is critical.</P>
        <P>I was very enthused by the fact MABS and the Financial Regulator, the man of the moment, have developed an educational programme for transition year students.  To go into the schools to educate young people about this issue is the key and there is no better Minister to deal with this area, given Deputy Hanafin&rsquo;s experience as a teacher and Minister for Education and Science.  This is a non-curriculum subject, if we could call it that &mdash; it is a bit like CSPE &mdash; which is taught one hour a week to junior cycle, but it is very important.  Students could get more out of this than some of the academic subjects taught at that stage in second level schools.</P>
        <P>It is like smoking at the garden shed.  We all did it, though thankfully I kicked the habit, and much credit in that area goes to the Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who introduced the smoking ban.  My point concerns the importance of teaching people at an early age.  While it is common sense to most of us that doing this kind of thing is wrong, getting in early is key to solving the problem.  We need early intervention not only to ensure the situation does not begin, but that if it does, it is not allowed to continue.</P>
<Col N="410"/>
        <P>I wish to raise another issue in this context.  Any time one opens a newspaper these days, several pieces of promotional literature fall out &mdash; at one time, they would have been put in the fire, but now they are put in the recycling bin.  Many of these give easy access to credit cards.  People jot down their details on an application form and, lo and behold, a week later a credit card and a PIN arrives in the post.  This is lethal.  It is dangerous in the sense it adds extortionately to the amount of credit available so that we all live in credit card debt.  To use credit cards for essential items such as fuel or groceries, or in restaurants or filling stations is fair enough &mdash; that is rudimentary use of a credit card.  However, there are those who are being exploited.  They are targeted by credit card companies and are given very easy access to cash which is very expensive to borrow.  This is worth considering in the context of the great service which MABS provides.</P>
        <P>Who would blame people who do not have money when they read these advertisements?  Who would look a gift horse in the mouth?  The newspaper arrives with such soft, easy access to cash which could take a person out of a hole.  It is difficult to blame somebody for following that particular course of action.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Government and the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, not to merge the Combat Poverty Agency.  They should consider the service it provides and its customer base.  There are people who depend on that excellent service, of which the Minister is aware.  It is critical the service is not diluted.  Given the current economic climate, would it not be good to examine the back to education allowance, for example, given that all of these issues are inevitably interlinked?  That scheme needs to be reconfigured to reflect the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>My final point takes in two areas of the Minister&rsquo;s vast expertise, education and social welfare.  I put forward a proposal on the Order of Business this morning and during the education debate yesterday.  A great idea has been put to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin.  I would be surprised if it has not been put to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  It relates to Gaelscoil Chloch na gCoillte in County Cork.  It would be good if the State could guarantee mortgages for schools in such situations.  The rent of this school costs &euro;300,000 a year.  If the mortgage was guaranteed, surely there would be a saving in rent.  There are 28 prefabs on the site, of which the Minister is aware.  This links into the work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs because to do this would reboot the economy in that local area, take people off social welfare and put them back into gainful employment where they are contributing to Revenue as taxpayers.  It would be worthwhile to consider this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The late Minister, Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan, was in this House on many occasions to deal with social affairs.  I found him to be a thorough gentleman to deal with, and somebody who cared about his Ministry.  He was very aware of the people he wished to represent.  On one occasion, I raised a general issue with the late Minister in regard to a constituent who could not get a disability payment and I did so without divulging personal details.  When I left the Chamber, Mr. Brennan followed me to get the details, gave them to his officials and the matter was followed up.  It was a beautiful gesture.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak.  Given the times in which we find ourselves, this is a very useful debate.  There is no doubt we live in a global economy where the issue of debt is affecting nations and large institutions and we know that within our own society the level of personal debt is at an historical high.  The value of the service provided by the money advice and budgeting service is one we must acknowledge and work towards <Col N="411"/>collectively enhancing.  I welcome the intention of the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement in providing such an acknowledgement and giving some indication as to how MABS will progress in these difficult times.</P>
        <P>We should also acknowledge that while MABS has become an established statutory service, it finds its roots in a voluntary initiative, the Lough credit union in Cork and the work of the late Mr. Brendan Roche in establishing a special accounts service in a local credit union, which provided a template for MABS throughout the country.  At a time of national and international difficulty, we should also acknowledge the work of individuals such as this and look forward to encouraging the type of social entrepreneurism which we need now more than at any other time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The establishment of that initiative was born of something the Minister also referred to, namely, the prevalence at the time of money lenders and the extortionate rate of interest they charged.  This has been ameliorated through the work of the late Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan and subsequent legislation but still exists as a pernicious threat in many societies, and may become a more open threat as we face difficult economic times.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite this, as the Minister has indicated, the work of MABS has diversified as it has become a statutory service.  On those grounds, we should use this debate to discuss the lack of social responsibility in the established financial institutions that the State had a right to think would behave far more responsibly than they have.  One of the reasons we have an historically high level of personal debt is the ethically corrupt practices we have seen in our financial institutions, which encouraged people to take easy credit for purposes that did not have an immediate economic benefit for those who took it, the communities they lived in or nationally.  It was easy credit to fund a consumer binge on non-essentials.  If there is anything an economy should be directed from in the future, that is the type of lesson we need to take.  As we seek to restructure the work of the financial institutions and the economy they seek to service, they are the points the Government and the political system in general need to get across.  What has happened cannot happen again.</P>
        <P>I hope one of the future roles of MABS will be to point out when we are heading into these dangerous waters again.  To be fair, those in the service did that, and were not listened to effectively in the recent past.  MABS should be given particular functions, if not powers, that would highlight the risks of easy credit being given and, where possible, to communicate with other regulatory agencies in the State to stop it.  The role of MABS and the goodwill it has built up as a service will enable it to do that in the future.</P>
        <P>Other contributions have discussed how MABS can be best administered.  MABS is not an organisation; it is a service.  It is right to question how that service can be most effectively delivered.  We have complementary organisations and structures that can be looked at in terms of delivering that service.  The Minister and the Department are looking constantly at how that might best be done.  I look forward to seeing how the role of MABS can be enhanced as a service delivery within other institutions that are citizen-directed.</P>
        <P>This debate gives us the opportunity to give thanks for the existence of MABS, to congratulate it on the work it is doing and wish it well for the difficult times ahead.  If we did not have an organisation like MABS, we could not invent it in the times we find ourselves in.  The work and voluntary initiatives of individuals and organisations helped bring this about.  I look forward to decisions that are likely to be made in the near future which will help MABS.</P>
        <P>I would also like to be associated with the comments made about the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  When I was a Member of the D&aacute;il, I had the dubious privilege of shadowing him.  There was an analogy made about another politician to the effect that it was like playing handball against a haystack.  S&eacute;amus Brennan was a similar type of politician as he engaged regularly with other <Col N="412"/>Members of both Houses and took on board suggestions from all quarters.  That informed much of the social welfare legislation we have seen in place over recent years, and it is a good base for the current Minister to build on.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s suggestions in the times ahead that will make use of the asset that is MABS.</P>

        <P>There is one startling statistic that stands out and is the backdrop to much of the discussion today, namely, the 33% increase in the use of MABS this year.  While it is a startling statistic, it is not a surprising one because it underscores not only the gravity of our economic situation but also its impact on real people.</P>
        <P>It behoves us to urge the Minister and behoves the Minister to urge the Cabinet to ensure we will not attempt to correct the economic ills of the country on the backs of the weak, the poor and the less vocal and powerful in our society.  I said consistently on the Order of Business over the year, and the<b> </b>Leas-Chathaoirleach will be aware of this, that we should never attempt to solve on the backs of the weak the problems created by other people.  It is a point well made by my colleague, Senator McFadden, when she said we must not make budgetary corrections.  It must be done at the expense of those who were more complicit than the weak and vulnerable in society in creating the problems of today.  How we address this will be the ultimate moral test of this Government and Parliament.  It is not only a moral imperative but might be also something more fundamental if we want to prevent social revolution and trouble in society.  We must be seen to do this justly and equitably and not damage the weak.</P>
        <P>I am a great believer in MABS.  It was well put by Senator Boyle when he stated that one could not have designed a better service for the time.  It is fortuitous that it is in place.  It is a great and necessary service.  God help the people who need it.  We should be sensitive about it.</P>
        <P>I wish to pay tribute to Ms Anne McKernan.  She was the public face of MABS in my county for many years and remains a major player there.  She did tremendous work in Cavan and was a great human face for the service.  She was a pioneer in this area and I acknowledge and commend her work in the presence of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Money management is a major issue.  It brings the issue of interest rates into focus.  There is an imperative on the banks to bring forward to consumers the recent 0.5% interest rate cut.</P>
        <P>I also pay tribute to the credit union movement.  The Minister mentioned it was closely linked to MABS.  The credit union movement has done huge work through the years in my town of Bailieborough and throughout the country.  We have tremendous examples of credit unions working very well.</P>
        <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has also worked closely with MABS.  No one could ever pay proper tribute to it.  We often mention heroes and celebrate the heroes of the War of Independence but the silent living patriots of our country have been the great army of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
        <P>Points were well made on illegal moneylending.  It is right to acknowledge what has been achieved in that area.  Illegal moneylenders have been huge abusers of people, especially women and those on social welfare.  It was dreadful on children&rsquo;s allowance day.</P>
        <P>In that context, I read alarming reports in the Sunday newspapers of the elimination of children&rsquo;s allowance or the means-testing of it for the better-off.  On the face of it, that may seem equitable and we must do equitable things in the budget.  That said and while it may not be politically correct to say, where there is a difficult home, a negligent father or problems in <Col N="413"/>the home, the children&rsquo;s allowance has traditionally been the great standby for a woman.  In most instances, it is the woman in the house who has come to the fore, has had to go into the breach, hold the home together and try to feed the children.  The children&rsquo;s allowance has been of huge significance and remains so.  It has been the money that has gone to the children.  For that reason, we should not tamper with it.  It has been sacrosanct and has been left to the carer.  There have been cases where it has been the male in the family who has been the carer &mdash; we know of such cases although, unfortunately, the opposite is generally the case &mdash; and again the children&rsquo;s allowance has provided a source of income to ensure children at least get food and basic clothing.  We can talk about new-found wealth but there are many homes where this remains an issue.</P>
        <P>I commend to the Minister the view, to which she referred, that we look at public education to teach budgeting.  The Minister, as a former Minister for Education and Science and teacher, is <i>au fait</i> with social, personal and health education.  The SPHE programme in schools should be used as a vehicle to prepare people for budgeting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Brady made an interesting contribution in that he made a critical analysis of how the services are being delivered.  That is worthwhile because it is something we want to keep improving.  He referred to the one-stop-shop for services such as family law.  There is great merit in that approach and, tragically, the services are all linked, as many of the people who have recourse to citizens&rsquo; advice also require family legal aid and possibly budgetary services, although that is not always the case.  We should be careful not to have all the services on the one corridor because there are issues of sensitivity involved.  One might have a person going into MABS who might not want other people seeing them and, likewise, a person accessing legal aid services because of a family dispute might not want to be seen there.  While there is merit in having a one-stop-shop approach those issues must be sensitively handled.  There are great distinctions between the various services and they would have to be maintained.</P>
        <P>MABS does an excellent job.  It is a necessary service and we commend it on its work.  I support the idea of a national supervisor to examine opening times, availability and to carry out an ongoing critical appraisal.  It behoves us to say that next week this country should not attempt to correct the sins of the past on the backs of those who had no part in creating the problem and who, tragically, have only a marginal say in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  I have always been a great supporter of MABS and have recommended the service to constituents from whom I received excellent feedback on the help offered on all occasions.  Unfortunately, the demand has risen lately.  The service should be commended, as it has been today.</P>
        <P>MABS provides advice on practical budgets and how to manage budgets.  It helps people to move permanently from a dependence on moneylenders, which was the original idea behind the service, and to access alternative sources of low-cost credit.  It is a hands-on service that offers more than just advice.  MABS staff make telephone calls to the ESB, banks, financial institutions or moneylenders to try to come up with some form of payment arrangement to provide a light at the end of the tunnel for its customers.  It is a hugely valuable service that is often accessed by people who do not have the communications skills or objective financial expertise to navigate through the hard times.</P>
        <P>The service has the full support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I add my voice to the plaudits to the former Minister, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan.  He allocated &euro;13.62 million to MABS last year, which was a substantial increase on the previous allocation.  He also made an additional &euro;700,000 available to MABS companies to help them develop more innovative ways of tackling indebtedness.  I have great confidence that MABS has focused the special funding to help its clients.  The service knows how to help people better than the State and I am <Col N="414"/>confident it will spend the money wisely.  MABS provides a solid service and it has helped thousands of people to extract themselves from debt.  We have been told 12,000 people have received assistance, which is a sizeable amount, but, unfortunately, there are probably more people who could avail of the service.</P>
        <P>In recent days it was brought to my attention that many loan sharks and moneylenders operate in areas of my constituency.  They operate in cities in particular and prey on people&rsquo;s worries about their future in this uncertain economic climate.  I do not know whether the time of year is a factor but this is a matter of major concern.  I have only anecdotal evidence but perhaps the Minister can keep an eye on the situation to see whether there is anything she can do about it.  Last year the Government ran a two-week radio advertising campaign from 21 January.  Perhaps this year a leaflet or media campaign could be undertaken in the pre-Christmas period to allow people to seek advice rather than get themselves into debt because, historically, it has always been a difficult time of year.  We must ensure we do not drive people into the hands of moneylenders and do all we can to encourage people to avoid them because they will only end up getting into more debt.  It is important to get that point across to people.</P>
        <P>I note with concern that approximately two thirds of the 12,000 people assisted by MABS are women.  Poverty affects women disproportionately and I would like to see research conducted to gain an understanding of the reasons behind the statistic in order that we can consider possible solutions in the future.  We are all aware of people in financial vicious circles who have availed of the service and they are grateful for the help they received from MABS, which operates on a nationwide basis.  Generally, those who use the service are on low incomes or social welfare and there is also an education gap.  People need advice on how to make ends meet in terms of clothes, fuel, food etc.  Often when those essentials are paid for, very little remains.</P>
        <P>We should acknowledge the role of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charities.  The former spent approximately &euro;50 million last year helping people on inadequate incomes.  If we did not have such voluntary organisations around the country we would be in a worse situation.  Their constant work needs to be acknowledged and welcomed.</P>
        <P>I believe approximately 46 moneylenders are licensed by the Financial Regulator.  They are allowed to charge an annual percentage rate of up to 188% for loans, payments for which are collected each week by an individual who calls door-to-door.  I am aware of leaflets produced by some credit unions encouraging people to turn to them rather than to moneylenders.  Such promotions have been run by Waterford credit union, Newry credit union, St. Francis credit union in Ennis and Finglas credit union in a bid to wean people away from moneylenders.  It is an admission that a problem exists when responsible institutions such as credit unions take an active and positive step in this regard.  In this difficult climate I urge the Minister to take steps to bring forward a promotional campaign to ensure that people are diverted away from moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates, especially as we approach Christmas when there are so many demands on low-income households in particular.  People are pressurised by the strength of advertising for gadgets, toys, etc.  Parents in such households often feel under enormous pressure and it is surely an opportune time to intervene.  I would like to see such a measure prioritised by the Government.  As we face a tough budgetary climate next year the Minister&rsquo;s resources will be under pressure but I am confident she will endeavour to deal with this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on this important issue, which I presume will affect many more people in the future.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.  I am not sure whether it is her first occasion to attend in her capacity as Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  I appreciate that she will face many challenges, budgetary and other, in the next 12 <Col N="415"/>months.  I look forward to hearing more from her about her departmental brief.  She has started positively.  The Department is large from a budgetary perspective and the Minister has a lot of money to spend but most of it is committed in advance and there is not much discretion in regard to it.  However, I hope the Minister will bring new thinking and a fresh approach to some schemes and her policies in general.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is more aware than I that streamlining of programmes needs to be carried out.  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessors did an excellent job in various ways.  The former Minister, Deputy Michael Woods, did much to streamline systems and expedite payments with computerisation.  Such former Ministers as Mr. Proinsias de Rossa, MEP, and the late Mr. S&eacute;amus Brennan brought fresh thinking to the Department as well.  However, further policy initiatives are required and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s help to see progress in that regard.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the excellent work the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, does.  I listened with interest to the remarks of the previous speaker on moneylending.  We have heard much comment on this matter in recent months.  Moneylenders see an ideal opportunity now to take more people under their destructive wings and extract significant financial penalties through high interest rates from vulnerable people.  The issue of legal moneylenders and the sizeable interest rates they can charge needs to be addressed from a legislative perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Last week the Oireachtas was transfixed by the banking crisis.  We will come back again and again to the need for further regulations in commercial banking.  The Government must examine the issue of moneylending and loan sharks and question not just their morality but their legality.  It should be illegal to allow people charge interest rates of 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 100% which is happening legally at present.  Tackling this and making it illegal gets to the core of the problem.</P>
        <P>These people fill a void or vacuum.  We must respond to that and put schemes and assistance in place.  MABS and the local community welfare officer, along with his or her office, has a very constructive role to play in this regard.  However, efforts must be more hands on.</P>
        <P>From the State&rsquo;s perspective the community welfare officer is the person of last resort.  A person who fails to get a social welfare payment and who needs money urgently is, on many occasions, helped out by the community welfare officer.  This scheme must be expanded even to the extent of allowing the State, through the community welfare officer, make modest, short-term loans available to people who need, for example, &euro;500 or &euro;1,000.  The possibility should be examined.  I would rather such a scheme were operated and financed by the State than by illegal moneylenders.  I hope the Minister will consider this suggestion.</P>
        <P>The Minister made a statement during the summer or early autumn about using education services to assist people to learn more about and take more responsibility for their personal finances, which is important.  The reasons for the existence of MABS and the necessity of its service stem from the failure of all of us to take full responsibility for our financial affairs.  The place to start addressing this failure is the schooling system.  The Minister spoke of the possibility of using transition year or the junior certificate cycle in schools to instruct pupils on matters relating to their financial affairs and responsibilities.  Such initiatives are positive in the long run.  The community welfare officer, MABS and the credit unions are available to solve problems that have already reached a degree of seriousness.  We must ensure we assist and help people in future to take care to put their finances on a more solid footing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is never too early to start this process.  When most Members of the House were children there were such schemes as the post office savings stamp scheme, which was encouraged in every national school in the country.  Such thinking seems to have disappeared somewhat and for this reason I was impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that she would examine assist<Col N="416"/>ing and advising school pupils on financial responsibility, which is important from a long-term perspective.</P>
        <P>We all acknowledge the success of MABS.  Its work is excellent, its services are needed and it operates effectively on a modest budget.  The volunteerism behind MABS and its interaction with the credit unions and community welfare officers are helpful.  The service is probably not marketed as fully as possible.  Many people come to constituency politicians to discuss financial difficulties and when MABS is mentioned, such people may not have heard of the service.  Therefore, more work is required in that regard.  A balance is required between large-scale advertising <i>&agrave;</i><b><i> </i></b><i>la</i> F&Aacute;S and what the Minister can afford within the departmental budget.  More profiling of the service would be helpful.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, should examine the issue of the legality of moneylending and try to put some restrictions on what may be charged.  Will she consider my suggestion and not deem it entirely off the wall of making it possible for community welfare officers to make short-term, refundable finance available to people for school books and such events as first holy communions and confirmations?  This would help people who do not have access to the more streamlined system.  Will the Minister continue to consider and realise the proposal to advise, instruct and teach people responsibility for their finances in second level schools?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As the Senator mentioned, the organisation operates slightly under the radar.  Part of the reason is that, as the Minister mentioned, financial difficulty is something which people often do not want to face up to and something of an embarrassment or a slight source of shame.  This is why people get into debt.  However, this is one of the reasons the service is so good.</P>
        <P>Consider the testimony of people on the service&rsquo;s website.  It outlines how they interacted with the service and the confidence and empathy that customers and clients received.  Such people were confident that the service was there to help and believed the service&rsquo;s appeal not to be afraid and to be honest about the situation.  It is similar to the story of an alcoholic.  The first step on the road to recovery is coming through the door and acknowledging there is a problem.  The next step is learning to plan and organise refinancing, which is where the service does tremendous work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I imagine the service prompts many people to look at its website before going through the door.  If a person then needs to come through the door of one of the service centres, the response is very helpful.  Consider the model letters used to write to financial institutions.  This suggests the service is used more than the figures indicate on the books which state the numbers coming through the door and clients with appointments and so on.  This is also part of the tremendous service.  When one is in a difficult situation it is possible to help oneself in the quiet of one&rsquo;s home at the computer or in a library or wherever.  This is where the recovery process can start and one can come to terms with indebtedness.  It is a sterling service that is provided.</P>
<Col N="417"/>
        <P>I listened to the contributions from Senators earlier, some of whom said that the MABS should be extended.  I would not necessarily agree with that.  The reason the service is so good is because the staff are focused on what they need to do.  They follow a clear remit and if the service is extended and complicated, it might not be as good as it is now.</P>
        <P>Previous contributors also made reference to money lending and money lending practices.  That is a horrific situation.  People who have no access to credit for whatever reasons find that these money lenders, who charge extortionate rates, are their only source of income to get them over a particular event in the family&rsquo;s calendar.  That is shocking.  Work must be done on that aspect.  Somebody who is in a vulnerable situation might think the only place they can go is to a money lender because they are in their community.  They know where the money can be got, even if they do not think about how they will be able to afford to repay it.  People who are considering going to a money lender for money should consider discussing their financial problem with the MABS.  We must consider how we can increase the level of awareness among those in vulnerable communities, particularly as it is becoming much more difficult for people in the current economic climate.  Undoubtedly, the services of MABS will be needed now more than ever because there are people who never saw themselves falling victim to money problems.  This is an opportune time for us to embark on some kind of advertising campaign, as Senator Bradford mentioned, to make people aware of the excellent service being provided by MABS.  Long may it continue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; a thug an m&eacute;id sin taca&iacute;ochta do MABS agus a d'aithnigh c&eacute; ch&oacute;mh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an tseirbh&iacute;s sna hamanna at&aacute; againn anois.</P>
        <P>The increased numbers calling into MABS looking for advice is a sign of its success but it is also a sign of the difficult times for individuals and their families.  As all Senators said, we are fortunate to have such a service, not just in terms of those who are employed in MABS but also those who voluntarily give of their time.</P>
        <P>Some valuable points were raised by the Senators, all of whom expressed their support for MABS but raised other issues that are of use as well.  Any of the 53 MABS companies throughout the country would say they would like some sort of an over-arching structure.  We are working on that and hope to be in a position very shortly to be able to announce where that will be.</P>
        <P>I fully appreciate what Senator Brady said about the co-ordination of services because in most towns one will find the MABS office and the citizens information office almost side by side, and sometimes in the same building, yet they are under different structures.  Perhaps it is time to make sure we do not have duplication while at the same time ensuring we can give the service to people as well.</P>
        <P>The Senator also raised questions about the value for money aspect.  We constantly review the staffing levels, the contracts given to the companies and their future plans.  Any director has huge responsibilities and therefore we ensure training is given to boards about their responsibilities as directors and as employers.  Each of the boards is established as an independent legal partner, which brings responsibilities with it also, and it is important that people would be aware of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator McFadden spoke about trying to broaden the remit of MABS.  That does not conflict with what Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, that we should not broaden it too much, but if a business person comes in who is self-employed, MABS cannot help them with their business but it can help them with a personal debt they might have accrued as part of the business difficulties. <Col N="418"/> The door is not closed on anybody, and the appropriate way to proceed is that they are able to advise them, even in regard to their personal difficulties, and recommend where they can go.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A number of Senators spoke about money lenders.  In the past this was a very serious issue.  I spoke recently with the Financial Regulator about this matter because it comes under its remit.  There are 47 licensed money lenders in the country.  The regulator and the banking sector have taken a strong view on this but a draft code of practice for money lenders was published in March 2008 and it comprises the elements of a consumer protection code for the money lending industry and other provisions to give protection to the consumer and promote responsible lending practices on the part of money lenders.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What often happens, as Senators said, is that people look for a small amount of money at a particular time but banks and other institutions do not give small amounts of money.  MABS has a loan guarantee fund which means that if somebody who had built up a relationship with MABS is looking for that small amount, they can go to their credit union and access a loan of up to approximately &euro;500, which is the amount people here spoke about for a first holy communion or the other life events and MABS can guarantee that loan from the loan guarantee fund.  That is useful because a person can draw down the money and, even more useful, the person does not know that MABS has guaranteed the loan.  It is not as if they can become reckless about it.  They are still taking responsibility for it but they have that extra security.  That is a very useful service for the small amounts we are talking about here.</P>
        <P>Many useful comments were made about information, including negative information on the number of fliers people get in their letter-boxes asking them to take out a credit card.  That is something we should examine.  I do not know whether it comes under my remit in terms of finance.  I had not focused on the number of fliers put through our letter-boxes that offer us credit cards.  Equally, advertising the facility MABS offers is important.  There has rightly been a huge reduction in the amount of advertising and campaigning we are doing and it might be useful for us to find another way.</P>
        <P>I would suggest that Senators and public representatives have a key role to play in this area through constituency offices, people they meet, on local radio and in local newspapers.  The best way of getting a message across is through the local radio stations and people taking the opportunity to go on their programmes to highlight this service.  I am aware some of the radio stations are anxious to get some of the MABS staff on their programmes to discuss budgetary matters and managing finances.  It would be in the best interests of vulnerable people if we, as public representatives, took it upon ourselves to promote the work they do.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle and other Senators asked how can the role of MABS be enhanced.  That is something we are examining.  The involvement of the credit unions and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned, is a key aspect.  They have been partners of MABS from the outset and are represented on all of the boards of management, therefore, people are getting that direct input from them.</P>
        <P>Public education, the transition year programme and the money advice services available in local communities to give talks to different groups were mentioned.  I am aware that they find that very useful.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford spoke also about encouraging children to save.  He is right in saying there was a time when everybody put the few pence into the piggy bank but I realise people find it difficult to save.  In terms of my own job, on the one hand we recognise how difficult it is for people to save but on the other, we are asking them to make provision for their pensions in the future.  We need to change society&rsquo;s attitude to money.  Too many people think they might as well spend it while they have it without providing for the future.  I accept that those who <Col N="419"/>have recently lost their jobs are encountering difficulties in this regard.  We should not lose sight of the long term.  At the end of the day, it affects each of us individually.</P>
      
        <P>The wider impact of MABS in society was one of the other issues that was raised.  Senators referred to the number of people being supported by MABS.  As Senator McDonald said, it is interesting that many women, including lone parents, avail of the services of MABS.  Most of those who contact the service are women.  Many of them are very young and are on social welfare.  Women tend to be responsible for the household budget.  We should not be surprised.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The credit unions, which are key partners in this regard, also offer help to people with financial management difficulties.  Advice is given to those who struggle with the management of their accounts and those who are unable to decide how much of each bill to pay off and what to do.  A special credit union account can be set up for such people.  If one is struggling, one can lodge one&rsquo;s money into a special account, from which one&rsquo;s money adviser pays one&rsquo;s utility bills.  Significant assistance is available from various companies at 65 locations throughout the country.  People can avail of a helpline and a one-to-one service.  I can inform Senators who asked about the helpline that the officials who staff the helpline are able to give assistance and guidance to 90% of those who call it.  The staff do not always advise callers to go somewhere else.  In many cases, those who use the helpline need to be guided towards self-help.  The helpline is useful in bridging the gap between the point at which the problem develops and the point at which a one-to-one appointment can be made.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I thank all Senators who took the time to contribute to this debate.  I assure them I will take on board the points they made.  The Government and the management of MABS are working with the Financial Regulator to ensure vulnerable people are not made even more vulnerable to moneylenders.  Such people need to be assisted when they encounter difficulties.  As public representatives, each of us needs to play a part in promoting the role of MABS to those who need the service most.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House.  I am glad to see him and I thank him for being here.  I have raised this matter to call on the Government to top up the grants provided to Westmeath County Council for the essential repairs scheme for people with a disability.  The local authority&rsquo;s budget needs to be topped up so it can help people with a disability.  Funding needs to be provided so that essential repairs can be carried out in the homes of disabled people.  Simple adjustments can help such people to life lives that are as normal as possible.</P>
        <P>The disabled persons grant scheme and the essential repairs grant scheme have come to a virtual standstill in County Westmeath because no money is available.  I acknowledge that in previous years, funding has been made available at this time of the year.  I ask that the &euro;1 million that is usually provided be made available again this October.  It is necessary if the grant schemes I have mentioned are to be administered.  The schemes in question assist people <Col N="420"/>who have illnesses like arthritis and angina as well as those who, unfortunately, are terminally ill.</P>
        <P>In June of this year, Westmeath County Council wrote to people with disabilities and terminal illnesses.  Some of the people in question have been on the waiting lists for these schemes for more than two years.  The letter said their applications had been provisionally approved &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;provisionally&rdquo; &mdash; pending the provision of funds from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I tried to put myself in their position.  If one has just a limited amount of time to live, one would prefer to be able to stay in the comfort of one&rsquo;s own home with one&rsquo;s loved ones.  Certain facilities are needed if one is to be able to do that, however.  One might need a downstairs toilet or a downstairs bedroom.  It does not cost much to provide these facilities, which contribute greatly to the dignity of the lives of the people in question.  If one is suffering from angina, one might be physically incapable of walking up the stairs.  In such circumstances, the provision of a downstairs bathroom would add significantly to one&rsquo;s quality of life.</P>
        <P>I would like to mention a case I encountered recently.  I refer to a lady in her early 50s who had to spend six weeks in an acute hospital after she suffered a stroke which paralysed her on one side.  She was transferred to the National Rehabilitation Centre in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where she received excellent care.  Her condition improved significantly as a result of the rehabilitative treatment she was given.  She was asked to choose between going home and moving to a nursing home, at 50 years of age.  She chose to go home and her husband took on the job of caring for her.  Her house, which is in a rural area, badly needs to be modified and adjusted in line with her needs.  She received a letter last June informing her that her grant application had been provisionally sanctioned.  There is no doubt the woman in question would benefit greatly from getting a grant.  It would help her to manage and maintain her life.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the allocation of more funds to Westmeath County Council and the other local authorities in the same situation.  We need to ensure we do not withdraw support from those who are most needy and vulnerable.  It is much better for people to be able to live in their own homes.  If we provide for them to be able to live with dignity at home, rather than having to stay in a hospital or nursing home, it will represent a saving to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I have serious concerns about certain grant schemes which used to be administered by the HSE.  Responsibility for the schemes in question has been transferred to the local authority sector.  I hate to say it, but schemes seem to be less efficient and more prone to difficulty when they are administered by local authorities.  Under the old system, when a patient was being discharged, HSE staff were in a position to go to his or her house to conduct on-the-spot repairs.  Hand rails, toilets and ramps could be installed, for example.  It seemed that great value for money was achieved in that manner.  Most importantly, patients were able to live with dignity in their own homes.  I am concerned about the huge waiting list for the disabled persons grant in County Westmeath.  The local authorities are being asked to undertake the home improvements for which the HSE was responsible before now.  I worry about whether such works will ever be carried out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator McFadden for giving me an opportunity to speak about the operation of the housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability.  The Government is aware of the critical role the adaptation grant schemes play in the context of an overall continuum of care for older people and people with a disability. <Col N="421"/> Following a comprehensive review undertaken by my Department, a revised framework of adaptation grant schemes to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs was implemented in November 2007.  The aim of the framework is to facilitate continued independent living at home.  The revised grant framework streamlines the administrative and operational procedures governing the schemes.  It provides a more targeted and integrated response to the housing needs of the target groups.  It ensures the most efficient and cost-effective outcomes from the funding available.  It focuses available resources on those in most need.  The administration of the schemes is a matter for individual local authorities within a regulatory framework which is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level.</P>
        <P>The housing adaptation grant schemes are funded by 80% recoupment from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of local authorities. A combined capital allocation of &euro;71.4 million was initially made available to local authorities for the operation of the schemes in private houses in 2008.  That figure has increased from about &euro;10 million since 2000.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes from within the combined allocation notified to it, and to manage the operation of the schemes in its area from within this allocation.</P>
        <P>Individual allocations were made to local authorities based on their estimated requirements, as notified to my Department, and expenditure trends in previous years.  A combined capital allocation of &euro;1.46 million was made to Westmeath County Council, in line with the allocation of &euro;1.43 million in 2007.  In response to the particularly high levels of activity under the revised schemes, which certain local authorities are currently experiencing, my Department recently made supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling &euro;3.6 million towards the operation of these schemes by those authorities this year.  As I explained to a deputation of elected representatives and officials from Westmeath when I met with them yesterday, while Westmeath County Council was not among those authorities, the issue of an additional allocation to the council will be considered in the event of further funding becoming available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme has been very successful nationally, because most of the local authorities had not put in their allocations which are needed locally to meet the scheme.  Local authorities may have been caught by surprise at the level of interest in the scheme, and the Department may have been surprised as well.  There was a tie-over from the old scheme to the new scheme this year.  That had to be cleared up.  Many of those schemes came back this year, as has been explained to me by housing officers around the country.  I am conscious of the difficulties involved.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious of the HSE issue, and that matter has not been fully resolved yet.  There is a question of staff transfer and agreement needs to be reached between the local authorities and the HSE.  Those discussions are ongoing and I hope they will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion soon.</P>

      <sTitle>Higher Education Grants.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this issue on behalf of a group of parents from the Connemara Gaeltacht in County Galway, who have been in correspondence with the Department of Education and Science for more than a year but who have received no response to their problem.  The parents are campaigning on behalf of their children who were offered third level scholarships to the value of &euro;6,110 per annum, based on their exceptional leaving certificate results.</P>
<Col N="422"/>
        <P>Recipients were given only three postal days to accept or reject the scholarship offers, and were therefore dependent on raising any queries they had by telephone with the Department.  The letters of offer, which were received on 31 August 2008, were in Irish and signed by the acting principal officer of the Department in Tullamore.  When the parents or children contacted the office, they were told the person who signed the letters did not understand or speak Irish.   There was a then a delay in getting the English version sent out.  Why does the Department of Education and Science allow such maladministration which results in gross confusion and misinformation to students?</P>
        <P>Recipients of the Gaeltacht scholarships in 2007 have to date received payments well short of the &euro;6,110 per annum mentioned in the letters of offer.  Six of the recipients have received total amounts of &euro;1,370 for the 2007-08 college year, while the remaining two recipients have received total amounts of &euro;3,420.  What has happened to the balance of the scholarship which remains unpaid?  In 2007, the parents&rsquo; group was informed by the Department that the Gaeltacht scholarship schemes were administered in accordance with the criteria and rates payable under the scheme of student supports, as administered by the local authority, which is paid to third level students based on a means test.  However, this is not outlined anywhere in the guidelines regarding the terms of the Gaeltacht scholarship schemes, nor was this mentioned in the letter of offer to the scholarship recipients.  This anomaly must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Gaeltacht scholarships are paid at two rates, namely, a lower rate paid in the case of Gaeltacht scholarship holders residing 24 km or less from the college and a higher rate being paid in all other cases.  The lower rate was abandoned in the 2005-06 college year and the higher rate was paid to all recipients in that year and in subsequent years.  In 2007-08, however, the two different Gaeltacht scholarship rates were reintroduced with a lower and a higher rate.  This resulted in scholarship holders from the same catchment areas, including siblings living in the same households, receiving different amounts for the same scholarship.  Why are such anomalies and inequalities allowed in the administration of this scheme, resulting in distress and disappointment for the young persons concerned?</P>
        <P>The scholarship rates, which were payable at a higher and lower rate in the case of the Easter week scholarships up until 2007, were abandoned in that year and a common higher rate of &euro;6,750 was introduced, thereby avoiding the anomalies that exist with the Gaeltacht scholarship scheme.  The Donagh O&rsquo;Malley scholarship, which was introduced for the first time last year, has a common maintenance rate of &euro;6,750 regardless of place of residence.  The new JP McManus third level scholarships, which will be introduced for the 2008-09 college year, will also have a common maintenance rate of &euro;6,750, regardless of place of residence. This leaves the Gaeltacht scholarship recipients in an unfair and unequal position in comparison to all other third level scholarships.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These are concerns raised by the parents and students of the Connemara Gaeltacht, and they have informed me that such concerns are causing great distress and disappointment to all involved.  They are yet to have a positive response from the Department and Minister.  I hope that Minister of State&rsquo;s response will shed some light on the matter.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science on the third level Gaeltacht scholarship scheme.</P>
<Col N="423"/>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science funds three Irish scholarship schemes which provide support for students progressing to third level education.  These scholarships are designed specifically to recognise achievement through Irish and one of the them is exclusively for students from the Gaeltacht areas, namely, an sc&eacute;im scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al do Scol&aacute;ir&iacute; on nGaeltacht.  Fifteen scholarships are awarded annually under this scheme to students from the Gaeltacht who sit their leaving certificate through Irish, who have attended an all-Irish second level school and reached a certain minimum standard in the leaving certificate.</P>
        <P>The rate of scholarship is equivalent to the maximum standard rate of grant payable under the Department&rsquo;s maintenance grant schemes, although no means test applies in the case of these scholarships.  Grants are paid at either of two rates.  The non-adjacent rate is paid where the grant-holder&rsquo;s normal residence is more than 24 kilometres from the college attended.  The adjacent rate is paid where the grant-holder&rsquo;s normal residence is 24 kilometres or less from the college attended.  For the 2008-09 academic year, the non-adjacent rate of grant payable is &euro;3,420, while the adjacent rate of grant payable is &euro;1,370.  All scholarships holders have received their full grant entitlement.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science operates a number of other third level scholarship schemes.  These schemes have different criteria, requirements and objectives and, therefore, it is appropriate that there should be different terms and conditions pertaining to each.  In addition to the Gaeltacht scholarship scheme, the Department of Education and Science provides other financial assistance to disadvantaged students, such as the student assistance fund and the millennium partnership fund.  These two funds provide financial assistance for full-time higher education students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college.  Students can apply for funding to help them with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties.  Each year, the State allocates a certain amount of student assistance funding to all publicly funded higher education colleges based on the size of the college&rsquo;s full-time student population. Students in need of financial support can then make application in the college for assistance under the fund.</P>
        <P>The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was launched in 2000 and its objective is to support students from disadvantaged areas with regard to the retention and participation in higher education courses.  Area partnership companies and community partnerships manage the fund locally.  Students in need of financial support in these areas can apply directly to their local community group for assistance from the fund.  These funds are administered, on behalf of the Department, by the national office for equity of access to third level education.  The schemes are funded by the Department of Education and Science under the National Development Plan 2007-2013, with assistance from the European Social Fund.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to carry out a review of the three existing third level Irish scholarship schemes in the course of the current academic year to determine their continuing effectiveness in meeting their objectives.  A range of issues, including the terms and conditions of the schemes, will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
