	<P>I have received notice from Senator Mary White that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to provide a report on the progress of the implementation of the Flood report on Irish prisoners abroad.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the lack of specialist register training in maxillofacial surgery in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to meet with his Northern counterpart to deal with the lack of access to student supports available in the form of bursaries and other financial sources for students from the Republic which is causing serious hardship for many.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to provide residents affected by the construction of metro north with funding for effective legal representation during the planning process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mary White, Ross and Keaveney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

	<P>I have just come from a meeting that was held in a church that was attended by hundreds of elderly people.  They were not there for prayer or mass, they were there to defend their entitlement to a medical card, their basic right to universality, a right the nation gave them seven years ago but that has been taken away from them.  It was one of the most uplifting meetings I have attended, in terms of seeing the power of the elderly people there and their willingness to come along and to fight for what they feel is right.  It was also one of the saddest meetings I have ever attended because people were driven to go along to it to defend their rights.  That raises enormous questions about what we value in society and what are the values we want to underpin by our legislation and our approach to health policy.</P>
        <P>What was announced this morning does not restore the peace of mind that has been taken away from elderly people.  The attack on the over 70s remains in place.  There has been no discussion about the problems of means testing, the huge attrition rate from it, the number of people who do not apply, and the humiliation people feel.  The scheme outlined this morning will create a number of problems, but above all it will create a two-tier system for the elderly, namely, those who were eligible before the budget and those eligible after the budget.  It has taken peace of mind away from the elderly.</P>
        <P>Fiscal policy could have been used instead of taking that approach.  When the elderly consider what has happened to many high rollers and the tax reliefs they got over many years, they are entitled to ask where is the equity in the recent proposal from the Government.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House today.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the withdrawal of the medical card from the over 70s.  We should be discussing the matter in the Seanad.  The whole country is talking about it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Anybody who was at the meeting this morning would be appalled at the situation in which elderly people find themselves, and the fact that they have to congregate outside the gates of Leinster House tomorrow to get their point across to a blunt Government that is not listening and is not responding to what the Irish people want.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not just the elderly that will be affected, but their families and young people also.  The attack on universality is being done without any debate or discussion.  It was not part of the election manifesto.  Universal health cover for the over 70s was introduced in 2002 to buy an election but it was not part of the election manifesto last year.  It was introduced without any discussion or mandate and because of a lazy approach to the budget.  The Government could have targeted many other areas.  We all know about the areas where there has been extensive waste.</P>
        <P>The Government is playing around with the figures at the moment.  It was going to save &euro;100 million when the medical card was to be withdrawn from 120,000 people and now it is going to save &euro;100 million when it will be withdrawn from only 20,000 people.  It is not 5% of 120,000 people that are involved, it is 14% of them, and eligibility will be based on gross income rather than net income.  When the fine details of the scheme emerge people will not be happy.</P>
        <P>Who knows what will be the outcome of the negotiations the Government will enter into with the Irish Medical Organisation or anyone else?  It is all uncertain.  The principle of universal health care for the elderly as a value, which the elderly now expect, has been taken away.  What the Government has announced this morning has gone no way near restoring the peace of mind the elderly want.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  How many times have we discussed the importance of the Upper House and that it should be relevant, topical, responsible, caring and retain a connection with ordinary people?  That is what this is about.  If it is being discussed on every radio talk show, in every lounge in every pub and at every dinner table in every house, it is daft not to discuss it here.  If everybody in the whole country is debating the issue, we should debate it too.  I have tabled the following motion:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann strongly recommends that the Government:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />excludes the minimum wage from the proposed 1% income levy;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />reinstates in full the universal entitlement of the over 70s to a medical card; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />reverses the budget proposal to worsen class sizes in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I recognise that it is not possible to take the motion at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest that the Order of Business be amended so that we can take statements on the three issues mentioned in my motion &mdash; the need to exclude the minimum wage from the income levy, to restore the universal entitlement of people over the age of 70 to the medical card and to reverse the proposal to reduce class sizes.  I ask the Leader to provide for such a debate immediately.  We need to examine the fact that we are being misled, rightly or wrongly.  I do not believe that just 20,000 people over the age of 70 earn more than &euro;36,000 a year.  That is what is suggested in a document I downloaded from the website of the Department of Finance an hour ago.  I deeply resent the manner in which members of the Government have referred to people who earn &euro;36,000 a year as &ldquo;well-off&rdquo; or &ldquo;highly paid&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how anybody in this House would live on &euro;36,000 a year.  There seems to be a suggestion that elderly people can live at a cheaper rate.  It is not on.  I would like to mention another thing that has been done in a sneaky way.  The budget proposal in respect of medical cards was based on one&rsquo;s net salary &mdash; one&rsquo;s salary after the costs associated with housing and various other things were deducted.  The new proposal in based on one&rsquo;s gross income, however.  Would Senators believe that this change has apparently been made &mdash; I ask my colleagues on the other side of the House to listen &mdash; because it has been decided that it is easier for people to know what their gross income is?  Come on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of pension income, rather than occupational income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suggest that Senators on this side of the House are any better than our colleagues on the other side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.  The Leader may well agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senators on the Government side to go back to their parliamentary parties and lift out of it those who are making proposals of this nature.  Certain facts need to be checked.  There are arguments against the universal approach to the over 70s.  I was prepared to listen to some of those arguments last week.  However, I heard over the weekend that the Government is reconsidering the principle of universality in many other areas.  It is just a step away from taking away the travel pass, the television licence or the telephone allowance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader indicate how many more changes, reversals or climbdowns are likely to result from the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance made in the other House last week?  Does he agree that our community and society is a laughing stock, internationally and domestically, because the budget, which is the major economic statement of the year, has degenerated into such a shambles over recent days?  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that this is a question of candour, honesty and clarity.  When will the Taoiseach look the Irish people straight in the eyes and tell them, in a clear, honest and candid manner, what precisely is happening to this country&rsquo;s economy?  Why are we getting a drip feed of information, for example in the statements which are made in this House?</P>
        <P>I would like to mention the most shocking &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; experience I have had since I was elected to this House.  Last week, the Leader, reasonably, ordered a debate on unemployment in this Chamber.  When the Minister of State came in to the House, his so-called statement did not contain a single new proposal to deal with what looks like the greatest crisis this country has faced for many years.  I do not mean that there were very few new proposals in it, but that there was not even one.  The point has been made previously that the budget contained no proposals on how to deal with the scandal of unemployment that is about to return to this country.  If we are to have serious debate in this House, that kind of treatment of the Seanad is disgraceful and should never be repeated.</P>
        <P>There is an issue of confidence in the Government and especially the Taoiseach.  He is an able and experienced man, but is not levelling with the public.  Scrappy interviews in the second part of the 9 o&rsquo;clock news on television, early morning press conferences and rushes out to RTE are not the way to engage with the people in this sort of situation.  We need serious engagement and while I accept that we in the Opposition also have a responsibility, the principal responsibility rests with the Government and particularly with the Taoiseach.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P>There will have to be a political reckoning down the road for what has happened in recent months regarding when the Taoiseach and his predecessor knew what was coming down the line, what he knew and when he knew it.  All those issues will have to be reckoned with in due course.  For now, we urgently need leadership, honesty and candour from the Government regarding the banks and the economic situation, and we are not getting it.  We need Goodbody Stockbrokers to tell us there will have to be a second budget some time early in 2009.  We are not being told what the situation is.  It is the same approach that unfortunately was taken by the Government on the Lisbon treaty referendum.  One cannot treat the people in this way.  They are angry, frustrated and concerned and have a right to be so.  They demand, and are entitled to, a straightforward approach and account for itself by the Government, and they are not getting it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted to have this debate and would welcome the Minister here for a full debate so all these problems can be teased out.  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision and statement this morning that 95% of over 70s holding a medical card will keep it.  People in the 5% will be able to apply to the Health Service Executive for concessions in certain areas.  These people are in the higher echelon of our society.  I see nothing wrong with that.  We have come a long way.  There was an information deficit and a full debate is necessary so we can tease it out in this House.</P>

	<P>Following what Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White have said, we have had an extraordinary situation today.  People who were almost defenceless came out fighting.  People we would not expect to be were driven to speak out, defend themselves and fight for their rights as they see them.  What is the Government doing about our mega-<Col N="636"/>wealthy tax exiles?  These people are as Irish as the rest of us, many are very good in their societies, but they are outside the scope of Irish tax law.  While there is no levy for them, we expect some of our poorest citizens and relatively poor people to pay this levy.  In these straitened times it is time for the Government to ask these wealthy people to play their part and I hope many will.</P>

	<P>In light of past decisions of the High Court and Supreme Court, it is time for the Government to examine urgently how these people can be brought within the scope of tax law, especially regarding the levy.</P>
        <P>The Property Services (Regulatory) Bill has been promised for some years now and mentioned in this House a number of times.  We are all aware that we have in Navan a still-born authority or rather, a body functioning without any legal framework because no Bill has appeared before either House of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Leader what the staff employed in Navan are doing, how many are in place and what has been achieved to date.  In these difficult times, it is disgraceful that such a situation is being allowed to continue.  I ask the Leader to determine whether the Government intends to bring forward a Bill or drop the matter entirely.</P>

	<P>We need a debate on universality as the Government has clearly placed the principle under attack.  The Minister for Finance declared last week that he was reviewing the universality of child benefit payment.  He has already tried to change the universal provision of medical cards for the over 70s in a botched and haphazard way.  The European principle is that we supply public services to people on the basis of their ability to pay, through income tax, and we then supply these services on the basis of universal access.  People pay higher taxes and this funds national primary schooling which is accessible to all, in the same way that medical cards should be accessible to all and child benefit should be payable to all children, irrespective of their parents&rsquo; income.  This important principle should be defended.  It is disgraceful that the Minister for Finance has placed it under attack.</P>

	<P>The principle of equity of taxation is important and should be examined.  If the Government asks for our suggestion, why not take those on the minimum wage out of the 1% levy and instead place a higher levy on those earning more than &euro;150,000 or &euro;200,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I support the amendment and it is very important that we have this debate and we should closely examine what the Government is really about, which is attacking the poorest and the most vulnerable in society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The solution means that 95% of the over-70s will be covered by the medical card scheme.  Last week, I asked the Opposition did it support the principle that those who can pay, should pay.  The answer I received was, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I would also like the debate to focus on a matter raised by Senator Alex White.  He claimed An Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, came out in a shoddy way and ran out for the last half of last Friday night&rsquo;s news.

	<P>I also hope the debate will cover the amount of savings that will be taken into account without affecting medical card eligibility.  The thresholds given are &euro;36,000 for a single person and &euro;72,000 for a couple.  It is only the interest on any sum over that which will be brought into question.</P>
        <P>I was rather surprised, but interested, to hear Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole claim &euro;36,000 was not much of a pension.  Is he confusing a pension with an occupational income?  A teacher retiring after 40 years of service will have a pension of &euro;36,000.  It was Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole who would have negotiated that.  I look forward to debating that.</P>

        <P>The introduction of the free medical card for the over-70s has allowed elderly people to continue living in their own homes with dignity, their health has been restored and a large amount saved for the State.  Through this, they also have not been exposed to contracting MRSA in hospitals and have had the use of facilities such as public health nurses, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  The unpleasant jobs which must be done for elderly persons with dementia or who cannot look after themselves have also been covered.  However, for those over-70s who may lose the medical card, the facility of incontinence pads for free, for example, will no longer be available to them.  Many of these people came to my clinic in recent days, terrified they will lose their medical cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of them have lain awake every night terrified since the budget was introduced.  I am glad the Taoiseach listened to his backbenchers and to my colleagues on the other side of the House.  However, universality of services must be continued for people who are sick.  The relatives of many people who suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease have been in contact with us in recent days.  People have died prematurely because they have not been able to access health services as they do not have medical cards.  In this day and age in a First World country like ours, we must care for the people who have put us where we are today and who have built this State.  I ask us in this Chamber to have a level-headed debate about this.  It is not about personalities or us individually or politics.  It is about the Minister coming to the House and talking in a straight manner to Members about caring for our elderly.</P>

        <P>I honestly do not think we are helping the situation by trying to demonise any side.  It is quite clear we have a very difficult economic situation with which to contend.

        <P>Some of these were anxious, and that is quite true.  Senator Fitzgerald is quite correct.  It must have been a sad situation this morning to have met 300 or 400 people who were genuinely worried.</P>

	<P>I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business.  I also support my colleague, Senator Alex White, in asking how many changes there will be to the budget.  How many more climbdowns will there be?</P>
        <P>Contrary to the previous speaker for whom I have great respect, I do not believe this medical cards issue has been sorted.  It simply has not.  Frankly, I do not believe the statistics I heard this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>If it were only 5% who would be affected by this and who would lose their medical cards, from an administrative point of view it would be hardly worth doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>The calculations that have been done suggest approximately 14% will lose their medical cards.  I would not like to accuse the Taoiseach of misleading the people, but in the next few weeks we will certainly find that out.  We may have to come back into the House and say so.</P>
        <P>The other aspect is that there is a fundamental change in that the Minister can use a ministerial order to change the thresholds.  This is a principle.  We are talking about the principle of universality and perhaps we should debate that at some stage, but that is a massive change in the principle.  The Minister can decide next year that the thresholds will be changed again.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this issue is solved.  The discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation still must be undertaken.  Until they are, we will not know how far they have proceeded and how much they have succeeded in dealing with this issue.  This is just one issue; there is a plethora of others.  Undoubtedly, within the next couple of weeks there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of teachers and parents outside the gates of Leinster Houses protesting at the scandalous way schools, particularly secondary schools, have been treated in this budget in terms of class sizes, the changes in funding for resource teaching and the transport costs being imposed on parents throughout the country.  It is ridiculous.  I guarantee that in the next couple of weeks there will be massive debate on this issue and that it will be the subject of serious debate on the floor of this House.</P>
        <P>Another sector that has been very badly treated, although this point might not yet have been raised, is the group of children between the ages of 16 and 18 who have disabilities.  The threshold for the disability allowance, which amounts to approximately &euro;204, has been moved from 16 to 18 years while the domiciliary care allowance has increased to &euro;299 and been moved from 18 down to 16 year olds.  However, in reality, families with children or young adults in this situation are losing up to &euro;7,000 per year.  That is huge.  It must be highlighted and reversed.  These people are using this money to bypass the long waiting lists for services such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue in the near future.  This sector must be examined carefully, particularly in view of how the Minister has treated it in the budget.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="645"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the call to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate these matters.  I support that call.  I have participated in debates with the Minister in this House on a couple of occasions and I have found her interaction with Members of the House and her frankness on issues most helpful.  Of course, there is the issue of whether she is available today, if one can add a little realism to this debate.  I presume Members are realistic that there will be some negotiation between the Leaders to agree a suitable date and time when the Minister will be available to participate in such a debate.</P>
        <P>A number of speakers have put questions to the Leader.  I listened intently to Senator Alex White but I am not sure whether it is that he does not have political support for the Taoiseach and Minister or there is something more deep-rooted or he has simply not asked people the right question, but he indicated that there is a certain amount of untruth circulating.  If that is what he means, and he appears to be nodding in agreement, I urge him, in the interests of everybody&rsquo;s good name, to spell this out so we can ascertain whether he is correct or incorrect.  In fairness to the Taoiseach and the Minister, if Senator Alex White has an issue, he should state it clearly and let us await the answer to it.  I invite the Senator to take me up on that offer or go directly to the people with whom he has a problem and discover the answers for himself.</P>
        <P>I have heard his colleague, Senator Alan Kelly, state previously in the House that the Minister should have responsibility for different aspects of the health issue.  Today, he is contradicting himself.  What the Minister has done is a welcome move with regard to the guidelines for medical cards.  She has taken back power and ensured she has control over the establishment of thresholds.  Heretofore, it was the responsibility of an authority outside the Houses.  All Members of the House should welcome that.  Indeed, I have heard the Senator&rsquo;s party ask for such a move in the past.  There are some contradictions in what is being said on this issue.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, Senator McFadden referred to the elderly at home.  I have some experience with this issue and it is wonderful that over the years Fianna F&aacute;il has delivered a tremendous package of home supports, be they care assistants, home helps, meals on wheels, day care services, residential services, the home adaptation grant and the home improvement grant.</P>

        <P>Some Senators might see where I am coming from in asking the Leader my next question, which is related to what I have heard today.  It concerns the fact that there is some confusion over waste waiver charges.  It is rubbish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be accepted as a principle that we no longer set about solving budgetary difficulties on the backs of the weak and poor, which was attempted last week.  Happily, the public outcry has reversed this.  It is incumbent on the Leader to seek clarity from the Government on the 1% levy and announce that the many employees on the minimum wage <Col N="646"/>and those engaged in home help, baby-sitting and such jobs will no longer be subject to it.  It is absolutely inequitable and it is important that the money be found elsewhere.</P>
        <P>My colleague Senator Healy Eames would agree that the position on class sizes needs to be reversed.</P>
        <P>On a happy note, I beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence to allow me refer to the fact that the Irish Business Against Litter league has, in its most recent tranche of results, placed Cavan town first among the towns with more than 6,000 inhabitants.  I ask the Leader to acknowledge this in his response, as I know he will.  This tremendous result is a testament to the work of the town clerk, town engineer, county manager, executive of the council and, in particular, the outdoor staff.  We are very proud of the result in Cavan and it would be nice to have it acknowledged unanimously by the House and to have it conveyed to the relevant authority.</P>

	<P>I will be very brief in the knowledge that the Cathaoirleach is under pressure.  I, too, support the call for a discussion on the medical card for people over 70.  We need clarity and, as Senator McFadden stated, should not play politics with this issue.  However, this is exactly what is being done.  In a calm environment, when tempers have cooled somewhat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it is very important that we discuss the real details of what is now available to the over 70s.  Many were very surprised to learn the annual sum of money per medical card being paid to general practitioners under the gold card scheme.  It amounts to &euro;640 rather than &euro;130 and this is not sustainable.</P>
        <P>We also need to recognise other realities in the longer term, irrespective of whether we agree with the principle of universality.  The Opposition politicians will be taking a hostage to fortune, and certainly did so when I was at the meeting in the church this morning, in arguing the case for the recipients who have signed up to the scheme.  Believing in universality is fine when one is in Opposition and the money is rolling in, but when one must face hard choices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Frances Fitzgerald, Joe O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Ann Ormonde, Paul Coghlan, Eoghan Harris, Ivana Bacik, Geraldine Feeney, Nicky McFadden, Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Alan Kelly, Ivor Callely, Joe O&rsquo;Reilly and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley all expressed their serious concerns and views regarding the various items in the budget.  There were statements on the budget in this House last Wednesday, and Fianna F&aacute;il gave Private Members&rsquo; time, and added time to it by leave of the House, which I very much appreciated.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend there was much concern and alarm, and many of our senior citizens were deeply hurt and concerned about their plight regarding the medical card.  To put everything in context, as Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, there is a massive economic downturn worldwide and we, as Senators, have a serious challenge and considerable obligation to deal with the facts and challenges as they arise for the Government.  The assistance of the Opposition has always been appreciated, regardless of who has been in Government.  The difficulty and challenge are not just our own; they are universal.  They are being faced by strong nations &mdash; I do not have to name them &mdash; from the United States of America down.</P>
        <P>On returning from the summer recess, the Government had to call an early budget.  We were also faced with the challenge of the banking dilemma which was occurring worldwide.  On the Order of Business, I stated as one of the three longest serving in the House that Senators met and excelled in that challenge in an extraordinary way.  The people acknowledged that, as did the media, and I respect that.</P>
        <P>The time allocated for Government deliberations on budget matters may not have been the longest or fullest.  That said, I am trying to reassure the people, especially those over 70 years of age because I know dozens of such citizens who were very annoyed and hurt and had many sleepless nights since the budget was announced last Tuesday.  This must be acknowledged because we are the representatives of these honest people who have placed their trust in us to come to Parliament to see what we can do to assist them and their families for the future.</P>
        <P>The Government has worked hard over the past two days, as was stated by Senator Feeney.  The Taoiseach was in Brussels for two days, came back and met the leaders from the North of Ireland to see how he could assist with their challenges and difficulties.  The earliest opportunity he had to address the matters of concern to all Senators was on Friday.  He has been giving every minute of his time until the Order of Business and Question Time in the D&aacute;il today.</P><Col N="648"/>
        <P>The statement made by the Taoiseach this morning, which allows 95% of all those over 70 to retain their medical card, will be of great assistance.  A statistic that has come out from the deliberations since the budget is that discretionary medical cards are held by 70,000 people.  This is an area where discretion has been left with area representatives of the Health Service Executive and general practitioners.  Speaking as a person who was a member of a health board for more than 18 years, and the Cathaoirleach and Senator Glynn will have considerable experience of this as former chairpersons, when we went as public representatives to a representative of what is now known as the Health Service Executive with a genuine case for a discretionary medical card, we were always listened to, and long may that continue.  I will do my utmost to accede to the request for a full debate in the Seanad at the earliest opportunity I can get a date in the diary of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  That is a commitment to the House.  I have always found the Minister very forthcoming in giving us a date in her diary and giving us all the time we needed to deliberate on the challenges that faced us then in terms of the HSE, including the medical card issue and all other issues pertaining to the health services that are of concern to Members in regard to the budget.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the House that the Taoiseach has announced that the 1% levy will not apply to the minimum wage.  I welcome that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I had the great opportunity of being on the last trade mission led by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  There are very many companies whose brand name products, and I include the town of Mullingar, are able to survive in the world of competition because of joint ventures in China.  I wish the Taoiseach well.  </P>
        <P>I remind the House that while the unemployment figures are increasing, Ireland still has 2 million people employed compared to 1987 when the figure was only 1.1 million.  That is an advantage in this difficult time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the budget for 2009.  I thank Senators for requesting a debate on this matter at this time, especially as major changes are taking place in the Irish economy and on a global scale.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Finance outlined in his budget speech, and as reiterated by all of my colleagues in Cabinet, there is no doubt that the economy is facing major challenges.  However, the Government is rising to these challenges through the package of targeted interventions and corrective actions unveiled in the budget for 2009.  These actions are necessary for the responsible management of our public finances and to safeguard our economy for the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to outline to the House those key aspects of the budget that impact on the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in particular subheads A and B which contain the main funding allocations and which are most affected by the budgetary changes.  I look forward to exchanges with Senators and to hearing what suggestions they might have to improve child care services in general and on the operation of the services provided by the city and county child care committees.  Their ideas will be useful to me in planning strategy for 2009.  There is no question but we will have to make changes and think laterally and strategically.  That applies to every sector of the economy.  I believe everybody shares the common objective of having better outcomes in child care.  How we achieve that is a matter for consultation with the national Parliament, which is why I welcome the opportunity to hear the valuable and timely views of Senators.</P>
        <P>A key area of Government policy, which is implemented by my office, is the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010, NCIP.  The NCIP has a total allocation of &euro;575 million between 2006 and 2010, of which &euro;358 million was in respect of capital funding and &euro;217 million for current funding.  The programme was launched in December 2005 as a successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, EOCP, which was introduced in 2000 and continued to operate until the end of 2007.  The introduction of the NCIP at that time, and its inclusion in the national development plan demonstrated a clear and ongoing commitment by the Government to meeting the needs of parents and their children for quality child care services.</P>
        <P>The proposed allocation for the NCIP in 2009 consists of both capital and current funding and I would like to outline the position regarding the current funding allocation first.  I am pleased the Government has recognised the importance of sustaining our commitment to quality child care services and has maintained the 2009 current funding allocation under the NCIP at its full 2008 level of &euro;73.578 million.  That will enable my office to continue to support child <Col N="651"/>care across the State as well as to provide sufficient funding for the community child care subvention scheme, CCSS.</P>
        <P>Due to administrative savings that will be made in 2009, the funding level for the CCSS will increase by &euro;1.4 million.  The CCSS was introduced in January of this year and supports community-based child care services to enable them to provide reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.  While &euro;37 million was spent in 2007 on the previous support scheme for community child care, more than &euro;50 million is being spent on the CCSS in 2008.  The proposed current allocation to my Vote in 2009 of &euro;73.578 million confirms the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting community child care services and to assisting disadvantaged and low income parents.</P>
        <P>As more than 100 new services have entered or are in the process of entering the scheme, that will mean approximately 900 community services will be supported with significant levels of grant funding in 2009.  Members will be aware that in different parts of the country community child care facilities face challenges and different circumstances.  Equally, private child care facilities face challenges.  I am interested to hear what points Senators will make in their contributions.  There is no doubt we planned for increased investment in improved child care facilities in the context of the expansion of the economy, and the increased demand on services given the greater number of people at work.  We need to plan for a different situation in the coming years, and new thinking is required.  I welcome today&rsquo;s debate and look forward to what Senators have to say.</P>
        <P>The current allocation will also enable my office to continue to support the network of 33 city and county child care committees, CCCs, which were established in 2001.  With the introduction of the national childcare investment programme in 2006, the child care committees have worked more closely with my office to deliver the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s major investment programme in child care and they now play a key role in assisting grant applicants to avail of both capital and CCSS grant funding.  They also continue to provide essential local supports to both child care providers and parents, including organising training and other quality raising measures.  The committees work closely with childminders who continue to be significant providers of child care in Ireland.  As with all bodies in receipt of State funding, they will be subject to a 3% cut in their administrative budgets in 2009.  However, I am pleased that their funding in 2009, which is expected to amount to &euro;13.8 million, will still be at a level which, on average, is 60% more than was the case in 2005 prior to the introduction of the NCIP.</P>
        <P>The current allocation will also continue to support the work of eight major child care organisations, including Barnardos, the IPPA, the NCNA and Childminding Ireland.  Those organisations have contributed greatly in the past to the development of quality child care in Ireland and I hope to strengthen those links in the coming months with the location of expertise from the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, the CECDE, into the early years policy unit of the Department of Education and Science, which is co-located in my office.  I believe this development will provide a clear starting point for a new focus on early years care and development at central level.</P>
        <P>I have already asked officials in my office to draw up proposals that will ensure a more effective use of our existing framework and resources, taking account of the deployment of the expertise and of the supports given to child care organisations.  The eight organisations that are funded by my office are expected to receive &euro;3.2 million in 2009, which is 23% more than was the case in 2005 in advance of the NCIP.  The current funding allocation will be accompanied in 2009 by a capital allocation to the NCIP of &euro;60 million.  That capital allocation will meet the capital funding requirement, which is expected to arise in 2009.  In 2008, the capital expenditure is expected to amount to less than &euro;80 million.</P><Col N="652"/>
        <P>The commitment to the NCIP and to funding commitments until 2010, will continue to be met.  However, in the context of a reduction in public expenditure during 2009-10 it is considered appropriate to target the programme&rsquo;s resources in a way that ensures the continued delivery of quality child care services as well as to ensure sufficient resources to meet existing capital commitments.  In effect, the capital allocation available to the programme will be extended over a longer timeframe, beyond 2010.  That approach was adopted under the previous EOCP child care programme, which was extended by an additional year to 2007.  That provided additional flexibility to child care projects, in particular those in the community-based, not-for-profit sector who qualify for large-scale grants of up to &euro;1.2 million.</P>
        <P>Applications for capital grant funding for child care projects, particularly large-scale projects in the community sector, generally require a significant period of time to bring proposals for grant funding through to the point at which they are in a position to draw down funding.  That process can take up to two years, or longer in some cases.  Extending the timeframe for expenditure is expected to bring each year&rsquo;s allocation of funding more closely in line with the actual demand for grant drawdown each year.  That will help to ensure that all of the capital allocation for each year is fully utilised.  I wish to make it clear, therefore, that capital grant applications under the NCIP will continue to be accepted and processed by my office.  I understand that applications amounting to over &euro;200 million in grant aid have been approved to date and a further round, with a value of over &euro;80 million, is expected to complete the assessment process before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In the context of the longer timeframe which is now envisaged for the NCIP, the review process that was expected to take place with a view to considering any successor programme, will now be undertaken at a later point.  The NCIP is already well on the way to achieving its target of creating 50,000 additional child care places and the funding approved to date will result in the creation of approximately 30,000 additional child care places as well as supporting a further 44,000 existing places.</P>
        <P>A further important area of direct support that my office oversees for parents with young children, is the early child care supplement, ECS.  The ECS was introduced in 2006 as an additional, direct quarterly payment, in arrears, of &euro;250 per quarter, or &euro;1,000 per annum, to parents of children aged under six years.  The payment was increased in January of this year by 10%, bringing it to a total of &euro;275 per quarter, or &euro;1,100 per annum.  I am pleased that payment will continue to be made to assist parents with the high costs associated with caring for young children in their pre-school years.</P>
        <P>The 2009 allocation for the ECS within my Vote will amount to &euro;397 million.  In 2008, expenditure on the ECS is expected to amount to approximately &euro;480 million and that would have been expected to increase in 2009, to &euro;490 million.  However, arising from the budgetary changes introduced, the administrative arrangements for the ECS will be revised with effect from January 2009.  The revised administrative arrangements are expected to result in savings of &euro;93 million in 2009 and savings of &euro;54 million in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>From January 2009, the ECS will be paid on a monthly basis, which should assist parents in managing their ongoing costs, many of which are monthly, in providing for the care of their children.  As a result of this change, parents will receive an ECS payment for January 2009 in February, a payment for February in March and a payment for March in April, rather than having to wait for the three payments to be made as one single payment in April.  As the monthly ECS payment will be rounded up to &euro;92, the annual payment will increase to &euro;1,104 at a cost of &euro;2 million.  It is proposed to have the ECS payments made to parents on the second Monday of each month.</P><Col N="653"/>
        <P>Given that the ECS was implemented as a quarterly payment, it was decided the quarterly payment in respect of the final quarter of each year, October-December, would be paid in December rather than January.  Arising from the fact that the ECS will from January 2009 be paid on a monthly basis, the question of making an advance payment for the final quarter will not arise.  As a result, a once-off saving to the Exchequer amounting to &euro;39 million is expected to arise in 2009.</P>
      
        <P>In addition, as a quarterly payment, despite being a payment made in arrears, the decision was taken to assist parents during the first quarter of their child&rsquo;s life.  As a result, parents receive the payment in respect of the first quarter of their child&rsquo;s life and the quarter in which their child ceased to qualify.  This issue will not arise when the change to a monthly payment, as in the case of child benefit, takes place.  This is expected to result in an annual saving to the Exchequer of &euro;20 million.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have mentioned that savings will arise from paying the early child care supplement on a monthly basis.  A separate budgetary change to the scheme is expected to yield a further saving of &euro;36 million in a full year.  The age at which children cease to qualify for the payment will be reduced from six to five and a half.  The early child care supplement was originally introduced as an additional, targeted measure to support parents as they care for young children who have not yet started school.  Children generally start primary school at the age of four or five.  Their parents will continue to receive early child care supplement payments in respect of them during this period.  As the compulsory age to commence primary school is six, virtually all children who are aged more than five and a half in September of each year go to school.  Therefore, this measure is not expected to impact significantly on the parents of pre-school children.</P>
        <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me an opportunity to speak on this important subject.  I hope we can have a frank exchange of views in the course of this discussion.  I am keen to hear Senators&rsquo; opinions on the shortfalls that continue to exist in the child care sector.  I apologise because I will have to leave before the conclusion of the debate.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, will take my place.  I will review the comments which are made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank him for attending this debate.  As Minister of State with responsibility for children, he has an important job.  It is accepted that last week&rsquo;s budget was a difficult and disappointing one for the elderly.  Equally, it was not sufficiently supportive of children and their families.  The Minister of State mentioned some of the cutbacks which are to be made in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The periods of eligibility for early child care supplement and child benefit are to be reduced.  Parents who try to support their children as they go through college will have to pay certain fees.  A number of other decisions were made which were not supportive of children.  The question of values that has arisen in respect of the elderly is also relevant in this instance.  We need to consider how we value different groups in society.  What sort of funding do we want to put in place to support our children?  Parents are concerned about critical issues like child care, which I will focus on in my contribution to this debate.  I will also mention two other matters which I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to comment on when he brings this debate to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>The issue of trafficking was highlighted yesterday in a report on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;.  Society needs to reflect on the disappearance of over 400 young people who had been taken into the care of the HSE.  Other countries provide &ldquo;safe sanctuaries&rdquo; to protect children who are at risk of traffickers.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, will agree that the story outlined in the RTE report was horrific.  The young woman who was interviewed spoke about the horrific experiences she had endured in this country.  From the age of 12, she was <Col N="654"/>subjected to appalling sexual abuse in the towns of this country.  As she was involved in prostitution, paedophiles had access to her.  We need to examine the sanctuary we give to young people in such circumstances.  I have visited hostels to see for myself the conditions many children are in.  I will send the Minister of State a copy of the report I have produced on unaccompanied children.  The case highlighted by RTE yesterday illustrates that many young people are not secure in hostels.</P>
        <P>The second matter I would like to comment on was the subject of an article in last Saturday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I am sure the Minister of State read the article in question, &ldquo;Life and a Death on the Streets&rdquo;, which was written by Carl O&rsquo;Brien.  It recounted the case of a young person who had an horrific time after he was taken into care.  He died after he failed to get the kind of supports he needed.  A separate debate in this House, on the question of what happens to children after they go into care, is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Children who are taken from their families, for all sorts of reasons, often end up in care.  If proper supports were available in the community, they would not end up in care.  I know from my own experience that the assertion in <i>The Irish Times</i> article that care placements &ldquo;can cost in excess of &euro;500,000 a year&rdquo; is true.  If we were to invest the same amount of money in family support services, up to 40 children could be supported.  We need to reflect on the kind of supports we offer to children in care and vulnerable families.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight the pressures which are being faced by community care teams at present.  As jobs are not being filled, community care teams are not in a position to react to the most serious cases.  The Seanad has previously discussed the plight of children in vulnerable families who are at risk.  I know the Minister of State is well aware of the huge pressure that is on these services.</P>
        <P>Many people were concerned when the community child care subvention scheme was introduced last year.  At the time, the then Minister responded to some of those concerns by making some changes.  However, a day of action and protest is being organised by incensed child care workers, stressed providers and pressurised parents who are not pleased.  The flaws and difficulties in the scheme are evident to employees, service providers and parents.  I have spoken to child care providers in Clondalkin who are concerned about the many problems associated with this scheme.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the new report that has been produced by the Lourdes centre.  Those who worked on the report interviewed service providers and highlighted key difficulties.</P>
        <P>After ten years of the Celtic tiger, it is sad that this country does not have the sort of child care services it should have.  I do not doubt that many parents are spending the equivalent of a second mortgage to meet their huge child care costs.  I recently read a newspaper interview with a young couple who have two children.  When the reporter asked them how they can get high-quality child care at a reasonable cost &mdash; &euro;300 a month &mdash; they said they managed to do it by emigrating to Spain.</P>
        <P>A recent OECD report highlighted this country&rsquo;s failure to provide affordable and accessible child care of a high quality.  Those of us who have been arguing over many years for high-quality child care are disappointed that matters have not improved after ten years of prosperity.  I recognise that significant amounts of money are being invested in child care.  There is no doubt about that.  I welcome the increase that has been provided for in some areas this year.  The manner in which child care has been planned has led to the provision of services which <Col N="655"/>are expensive and difficult to access.  Child care is not available to some parents.  For those who can access it, child care is very expensive.</P>
        <P>This House debated the issue of universality earlier.  If we had taken a universal approach to the provision of child care, for example by guaranteeing three and four year olds a year of high-quality pre-schooling, I wonder if we would be in a better position on foot of all of the money that has been spent.  As things stand, access to child care is uneven.  That is why workers in this area are preparing a day of action.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the new report, which I mentioned a moment ago.  I am sure his office has examined it.  Those who compiled the report have told me that the feeling on the ground is that the community child care subvention scheme is misjudged.  It is not working as well as it should be.  It is creating a set of new problems.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the problems in question.</P>
        <P>I wonder whether an extraordinary point that emerged recently can be correct.  A recent meeting in Dublin, involving Pobal and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, revealed that just one child care provider was consulted during the early stages of the formulation of the community child care subvention scheme.  As there are 161 community child care providers in the greater Dublin area, there should have been more consultation.  Further consultation is necessary at this stage.  The scheme needs to be reviewed again.  Many of the problems associated with it need to be resolved.  The Minister of State needs to consider whether some aspects of the scheme are helping people as it was thought they would.  The scheme is based on uneven foundations.  The Minister of State has misread the situation.</P>
        <P>The report I have mentioned, A Study of the Effects of the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme, illustrates some of the negative consequences of the scheme.  I wish to highlight some of the consequences in question.  Those who compiled the report consulted widely within the sector.  They argue that the entire scheme is inequitable.  They suggest that it has deprived many low and middle-income families of child care.  Such people can no longer afford the massive increases in the payments sought under the scheme.  It has been estimated that the increase in child care fees for working parents since 2007 has been between 50% and 166%.  In real terms, those who were paying &euro;80 last year may be paying as much as &euro;200 this year.  The Minister will agree that in the current economic situation the scale of increase in child care fees is unsustainable for people who were just about holding onto their jobs and are getting no increases, where job security is threatened, especially since if they go on social welfare they can get full-time child care.  There is something very problematic about that.  It needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>The fundamental problem with the scheme is that it is based on a per-child subvention and is means tested in a way that penalises low-income and single parent families.  Given that their children receive a smaller subvention, they are charged more than parents on social welfare.  The scheme penalises parents who work and makes it seem more beneficial for a parent to be on social welfare and avail of the scheme than to work full time in a relatively low-paid job.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This pushes the disadvantaged into the poverty trap and encourages the black economy.  There is no logic because there is a poverty trap for hard-working families trying to make ends meet.  The State should not support a scheme that does that.</P>
        <P>The other aspects of the problem are that community child care providers experience a continuing decrease in direct funding.  This makes it extremely difficult or impossible to maintain services.  A number of services have closed.  One cannot definitively say this is because of the subvention scheme but I would ask what reports the Minister&rsquo;s Department is receiving about services closing.</P><Col N="656"/>
        <P>We have been told that many services will have no alternative but to shut their doors on communities which depend on the provision of child care.  The number of children with whom community child care providers work will be vastly reduced if this happens.  Jobs will be lost in the sector and the quality will be compromised.  This is a real problem.  One child care provider in Dublin&rsquo;s north west inner city has estimated a total loss of income as a result of the scheme of &euro;151,000.  That is enormous.  These are services being provided to the most disadvantaged areas and it is a serious loss of revenue to pay staff and build up child care places.  There will be job losses.</P>
        <P>Providers cannot assess their annual budget because funding depends on the number of children availing of the service and working parents cannot afford the large increases in child care costs.  Forward planning is very difficult for those child care providers.  This will affect families but will have a disproportionate effect on women.  Women will leave the workforce if they do not get the kind of support they need from child care.  The number of women entering the workforce is increasing.  The recent OECD report, Babies and Bosses, revealed that 51% of women in the workforce have a child aged between zero and three years and 52% between three and six years of age, yet we continue to lag behind many other countries.  The OECD report also found that in 2006, 30% of disposable income was spent on early child care.  That compares with an 8% average in the rest of Europe.  Despite all the money going in, the expense of and lack of access to child care is still extremely problematic.  It impacts on families and quality of life for women and men.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s rating for publicly funded child care facilities is very low.  We are still failing to provide the sort of early child care services that we should and that would be good for children and families.  The Minister of State is doing his best to watch over his funding and ensure he can change the situation.  I ask him to radically overhaul the community child care subvention scheme.  All sorts of segregation will arise in the community child care facilities for them to get their funding.  There will not be the kind of mix of families on different incomes &mdash; families on social welfare and working families &mdash; in the community child care services.  The mix worked well; it was good for children, families and services.  There is serious pressure on the community child care services and I ask the Minister of State to radically overhaul it, to liaise and consult further with the providers, parents and community.  The early research on the subvention scheme suggests that it does not work.</P>

	<P>I was only joking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  Many times in this Chamber I have said we have free national school, secondary school and third level education, however we continue to neglect the education and development of our youngest citizens in the zero to five age group.  There is clear evidence from the literature around the globe that while all investment in education yields a rich dividend for the economic and social well-being of society, the highest returns accrue from investment in early life education.  The benefits of investment in early-life education are proved to be more pronounced in the poorer socioeconomic groups.</P><Col N="657"/>
        <P>In July, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, expressed disappointment that its recommendation to provide free high-quality child care in the year before a child goes to school has not been implemented.  In my White Report, A New Approach to Childcare, published in 2006, I did a class report and gave good marks to the child care supplement, the establishment of the new Minister of State with responsibility for children and the increase in paid maternity leave to 26 weeks, however I said I was disappointed no vision had been spelled out for a free pre-school education.  We have made no moves on that.  Pre-school education would enhance the all-round development of children, including their emotional, intellectual, social and behavioural development.  Disadvantaged children would benefit to a greater extent from such provision, especially where there is a mix of children from different backgrounds.</P>
        <P>I have had discussions with Professor Tom Collins, the dean of teaching and learning at NUI Maynooth, who has a vision for education on this island.  He and I are on the same wavelength regarding the benefits of pre-school education.  I was with Professor Collins yesterday and he pointed out that the benefit of pre-school education lasts until a person is 40 years old.  The advantage pushes through until middle age, particularly regarding issues such as crime-prevention, health, family and children.  Pre-school education is an effective mechanism for addressing child poverty.  Our children need to enter primary school with a pre-developed disposition to learn.  They do not need to be able to read before they go to school, but they need a passion to learn, discover and realise their potential.  If they do not have that in their little hearts and souls by the age of six it is too late.</P>
        <P>Considering the social and other benefits a pre-school year would generate, both immediately and in the longer term, the cost to the Exchequer of such a new approach would be relatively minor.  Two years ago the NESF published an estimated cost of &euro;136 million per year for a sessional period of 2.5 hours per day, five days per week.  When it launched the report this July I called the chairperson and asked if she stands over that figure.  I had that figure in my document but was told it could not be correct.  However, the chairperson of NESF stands over it.</P>
        <P>It is somewhat surprising that this issue has not been addressed by now because it is the last hurdle in the development of our mass education in Ireland.  It is all the more surprising when one considers the difficulties and costs associated with problems that might have been avoided by earlier pre-school intervention.  Experienced teachers say they can identify a future drop-out at the age of six.  If this is so, it is imperative that learning opportunities prior to this age are not missed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is no doubt there have been major improvements in recent years, including the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children, a commitment to providing 50,000 extra child care places by 2010, the early child care supplement and the increase in paid maternity leave to 26 weeks.  We must acknowledge also the tremendous work being carried out by the 33 child care committees throughout the country as well as the exemplary work being carried out by parents on the boards of such committees.  Roscommon child care committee estimated that the voluntary work done by parents on the board of that committee is worth approximately &euro;270,000 per year.</P>
        <P>I called for this debate when I read an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>on 4 October outlining the findings of a European Commission report on availability, costs and Government spending on child care services in the EU.  While the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Mr. Vladim&iacute;r Spidla, said that most countries are not reaching the targets set under the Barcelona agenda, Ireland&rsquo;s record is particularly bleak.  Next to the United Kingdom, Irish parents pay more for child care than parents in other European countries.  The Irish Government spends less on child care and early education than any other <Col N="658"/>country in the EU.  A typical Irish two-parent family with two children under three years of age spends 29.2% of net income on child care costs.  In contrast, parents in Finland spend only 7.2% of their income on child care.</P>
        <P>We have built almost all our economic hopes and aspirations on investment in education.  However, we are making a mistake as a society if we believe that by investing in fourth level we will sustain our economic and social well-being while neglecting the earlier levels.  We all know that the first five years are the most important in every person&rsquo;s life.</P>
        <P>The current recession affects everyone but some socioeconomic groups feel it more than others.  It can be reasonably argued that one of the biggest sources of the divide between social groups is education.  Now is the time for us to foster an equitable system of childhood development where all children, irrespective of circumstances, have the opportunity to develop to their full potential.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, to come up with an innovative response to this issue.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to make his mark.  We need a comprehensive child care development programme such as the one-year preschool measure outlined by the National Economic and Social Forum.  It is high time that early childhood care and education provision for all children became a political priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Feargal Quinn.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to debate this important issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to take up a theme rightly addressed by Senator Fitzgerald on the universal provision of child care services.  Before doing that, however, I wish to say how delighted I was to hear what Senator Mary White had to say.  She has spoken sensibly about the need to invest in early childhood education, with which we all would agree fully.  It is just a pity that the Government, which has been in power for more than 11 years, has not been listening to what Senator White has had to say on the issue.  Clearly, money should have been invested in preschool education, at a minimum.  This debate is not only about preschool education but also child care from an earlier stage in a child&rsquo;s or baby&rsquo;s life.  None the less, in terms of preschool education, the cost of rolling out a one-year, universal programme of preschool education for all preschool children, that is, children aged three and four, would not have been immense.  While I acknowledge the considerable sum of money that has been spent on various programmes, as outlined by the Minister of State, would the cost have been that much greater &mdash; certainly the benefits would have been immensely greater &mdash; had we invested in a more comprehensive programme of preschool education?</P>
        <P>Buried within the text of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is the economic context in which we are operating, where cutbacks and closures are a feature of life. In that context, the Minister of State referred to the early childhood education centre and the expertise built up there.  Unfortunately, as I understand it, the Government is closing that centre.  It is most unfortunate that we are seeing cuts in a programme that has never really achieved its full potential.</P>
        <P>There have been attacks in this budget on the idea of universal provision generally, and especially on the universal provision of medical cards for those over 70.  There was also a very sinister suggestion in the budget speech by the Minister for Finance last week that universal child benefit will be the next benefit to be targeted and means tested.  I wish to address this matter briefly before returning to the broader issue of child care provision.</P>
        <P>Attacks on universal provision have a superficial attraction.  We have heard numerous Ministers asking why millionaires&rsquo; children should have free fees or millionaires over 70 be given medical cards.  It is for the same reason that millionaires&rsquo; children have free access to primary education, which no one is challenging.  That is uncontroversial and we all would accept the <Col N="659"/>enormous benefit to society in having universal access to primary education at a national level.  That is a principle to which we have long adhered in this State.</P>
        <P>This point was expressed eloquently by Ms Maev-Ann Wren, a recognised expert on health care, when she wrote in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, that: &ldquo;Of course people on higher incomes should pay more for public services but the European way to achieve that is via tax or social insurance, so that we collectively fund services according to our ability to pay but, crucially, access them equally according to need.&rdquo;  An enormous public good is served if we allow that.</P>
        <P>That is the basis on which we pay for and fund our primary education system, so that millionaires&rsquo; children and the children of those on social welfare all attend the same national school.  That should also be the basis upon which we provide preschool education.  This is not a controversial view.  Segregation is not good for children or society.  Unfortunately, we do not adhere to that model in our health care because we have a two-tier health service.  Through the changes that have been made to the community child care subvention scheme, we are unfortunately seeing greater segregation creeping in to what was a very positive model of having child care available to children in a particular community on a subsidised basis, so that children of both working parents and parents on social welfare equally could access that child care.  However, changes to the scheme have meant that children with working parents are being priced out of the community child care sector and a creeping segregation is emerging.  Soon, community child care centres will only cater for children of parents on social welfare, which is most unfortunate.  It is regrettable to see that sort of segregation at such an early age.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we all accept the principle of universality at primary level, we should also accept it at preschool level and earlier.  Clearly, there is a need to provide child care as increasingly, both parents of children are working and there are also increasing numbers of single parent families.  It is important that parents have a choice of working outside the home that is not solely based on financial considerations.  The current system of child care and preschool provision, which is almost entirely left to individual parents and the private sector, means that most people are trying to juggle with enormous private costs, which can be &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200 per child per month in the greater Dublin area.  The Government has not seen fit to try to address this difficulty for parents of all income levels.  There should be equal access to quality child care and preschool education.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately we are seeing enormous encroachments on the rights of preschool children.  There are attacks on children&rsquo;s rights through the effectively abandoned referendum promised on children&rsquo;s rights.  Will the Minister of State clarify the matter?  I have heard from public pronouncements and from other quarters that the referendum will not proceed.  There has not been a clear announcement to that effect, but many of us understand it will not now proceed, which is a great shame.  Part of the reason we have fallen so far behind other EU countries, as other speakers stated, is that we do not really recognise the idea of children&rsquo;s rights or give the idea any teeth in Ireland.  We have been criticised internationally for our failure to provide at a constitutional level for children&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>The potential abandonment of the children&rsquo;s rights referendum, the signal that there could be an end to the payment of the universal child benefit and the swingeing attacks made on the education budget, admittedly the preserve of the Minister for Education and Science, clearly will affect young children and seem to be especially directed at the most disadvantaged, including Traveller children and children with special needs.  Given these developments, it is time to say clearly that the Government has fallen down badly.  I do not place all the blame with the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, but the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children has failed in protecting preschool and older children.  Brian&rsquo;s botched budget will be remembered for hurting not only the old, sick and handicapped, to use the Fianna F&aacute;il <Col N="660"/>slogan from many years ago, but also the young, poor and disadvantaged and it will certainly hurt children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for allowing me to share time.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and I was delighted to hear his comments.  I have found the debate so far very interesting, especially the passion of Senator Mary White in discussing a topic she knows so well, and the commitment of Senators Bacik and Fitzgerald shows how far behind I am on this issue.  I do not have such experience or knowledge, but I have five children and I remember what it was like when they grew up.  I have 11 grandchildren and I can see the joy this brings, but I can also see the needs in those early formative years.</P>
        <P>I examined how we compare with other countries in the area of child care.  Ireland lags substantially behind other European countries in the provision of child care facilities.  According to a new European Commission report on child care, published earlier this month, Irish families with two working parents and two children spend 29.2% of net income on child care &mdash; this was already mentioned &mdash; the second highest level in the EU.  Only the UK spends more at 32% of net income.  Similar families in Belgium, Portugal and Poland all spend less than 5% of net income on children.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that working parents of preschool children in the country can spend more than &euro;1,000 per month for every child in day care.  This puts into perspective the early child care supplement of &euro;1,100 given to parents.  It barely covers a single month&rsquo;s fees for most parents.  This supplement has been cut back in the budget and will only be given to parents with children up the age of five and a half years, whereas previously it was given for children up to six years of age.  This is a further hardship for pressurised families and seems like another step backwards.</P>
        <P>This is in marked contrast to what families pay on the Continent.  In Spain, for instance, a final monthly cr&egrave;che bill for two children is &euro;330 after the Government contributes &euro;100 per child.  A similar cr&egrave;che bill in Ireland is estimated to cost almost &euro;2,000 per month.  Other countries in Europe have better provision of child care.  In Denmark, for instance, parents pay a maximum of 30% of child care costs with the state subsidising the rest.  In France, parents with children in cr&egrave;ches are eligible for a subsidy of &euro;600 per month while the <i>&Eacute;coles Maternelles</i> open their doors to children aged between two and five years between the hours of 8.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m.  This is funded entirely by the state.  Some 99% of children attend these schools in France.  A comparable system is in place in Italy for children aged three to six years.  In Sweden parents pay no more than 3% of household income on cr&egrave;che fees for their first child, 2% for their second and 1% for their third child.  I apologise for providing all these figures but it seems we have much to learn from other countries.  In Norway parents pay between 28% and 45% of the cost of children&rsquo;s cr&egrave;che fees, depending on their income.</P>
        <P>In Ireland parents pay 90% of the cost themselves.  It is estimated that parents in Ireland with two children in private child care will spend at least &euro;60,000 in four years on cr&egrave;che fees alone.  Then there is the vulnerable end of the spectrum and other changes have come this summer.  The level of Government financial support for child care is means tested, as Senator Bacik stated.  As a result, many parents on lower or middle incomes are not eligible for any funding and must pay the full cost of community child care.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik made a good point.  While I am one of those who question why the State should subsidise the wealthy, the State insists on paying for national schools and primary schools and has done so for more than 200 years and we never question that.  It is certainly not a question of saying it is for the wealthy.  The Government argues that the changes means State <Col N="661"/>funds are targeted at children most in need of support and such children will receive greater levels of funding.  It states a majority of service providers will benefit under the new system.</P>
        <P>In discussing child care we must keep in mind families living on the bread-line.  The cost of child care services is increasing rapidly with increases of between 50% and 166% in 2007.  Because of the changes in the way the Government funds community child care facilities, which came into effect during the summer, the level of Government financial support for parents is now means tested.  This means child care services for some of the most vulnerable children are in danger.  If the Government does not ensure the most vulnerable children are looked after and that cr&egrave;ches are available at an affordable cost to disadvantaged families, it may result in greater problems down the line.  In looking to the future and when discussing the past, including the Celtic tiger and how well it performed in those years, we say the primary reason was education.  We have forgotten that education for those under five years of age is so important.  What if children cannot access quality preschool education and are, therefore, left behind even before they start school?</P>
        <P>The formative years are the most important in a child&rsquo;s life.  The children of parents who cannot afford child care should not suffer.  The Government must keep its promise to provide essential child care to the most vulnerable in society.  Remember when we discussed the success of the economy in recent years, which we hope will return again, we said we must invest in education.  If anything, we have fallen down in this area.  I have examined the figures which compare Ireland with the rest of Europe and it is those very formative years before they go to school which make the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House.  I believe he probably has the most important job in the country because he is dealing with our young children.  We must make a major investment in our young people for the future.  The Government takes its responsibility for young people very seriously and their futures depend on it.  We have been late starters in this regard.  I take on board the criticism, some of which we deserve, that in past years we did not invest in young people, children, cr&egrave;ches and so forth as we should have.</P>
        <P>The position of Minister of State with responsibility for children was created ten years ago.  When I worked in the health services, there were no services for children.  We have been developing this new service in past years.  It is an expensive service but I believe in the long term there is more value for money investing in services for young children.  We have made some gains.  I was a member of a local authority in the Dublin region and there were no playgrounds for children until a few years ago.  There has been significant investment in play areas for young children at local authority level.  There was also no provision by local authorities for cr&egrave;ches in new developments.  Local authorities insisted on the provision of child care facilities in new housing developments over a certain size.  This was an important contribution from local authorities in this area.</P>
        <P>A high standard of safety rightly has been created in all child care establishments and cr&egrave;ches.  Working mothers and fathers must feel comfortable that their children are being looked after by the best people and in the safest environment.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise the substantial allocation of &euro;575 million to child care services in the budget.  When we are dealing with scarce resources, as we are now, it is one area we should hone in on and ensure the Minister of State&rsquo;s office is looked at favourably for investment in the future.  In these difficult times, we are restricted by budgetary restraints.  However, like the old age pensioners and the health services, child care is a most important priority.  What we invest now in child care we will see a return on in the future.  The young people are the future of the country.</P><Col N="662"/>
        <P>It is important that the Minister of State ensures the resources he has available are spent wisely on behalf of the taxpayer and imaginatively.  Imagination in child care provision is necessary, especially with the current budget restraints.  We can all crib about being confined to budget but imagination and creativity could go a long way in child care provision.</P>
        <P>I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, will make a difference in his portfolio.  He is a young father and knows the importance of the safety of his children when he leaves them in someone else&rsquo;s care.  He must be ambitious for the future expansion of the child care programme.  Senator Mary White said we must invest in and expand the programme but also examine where we can get better value for money.  We also must look out for the less well-off in our communities.  I remember a time when areas such as Ballyogan had no cr&egrave;ches.  They do now.  The Minister of State is improving the services, something on which I commend him.  There is much work still to be done and he will have to fight his corner for moneys for his office.</P>

	<P>Senator Frances Fitzgerald already intimated her concerns about the protection of young people.  In August 2008, the Minister of State launched a review of reports on child protection services.

	<P>These are two separate issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State is a reasonable man and in my experience as a local representative I find the system is unsympathetic.  Social workers involved in child protection are worn out from being both understaffed and under-resourced.  No social worker is available after 5 p.m. or at the weekend.  While I accept the service has improved under the Minister of State&rsquo;s leadership, the system is still failing our young people.  Victims of domestic violence find it difficult to have their concerns taken seriously by the system.  That is an outrage.  The Government and the Department need to support families in crisis.  People should not<?oasys _jy ?>have to wait until they are in absolute crisis to go to social services.  Early intervention is necessary.</P>
        <P>One child, with a heart condition, in my area roams the streets at night, even as late as 11 p.m. in the pouring rain.  His mother is inadequate and not able to cope.  I have tried to contact social services about the case but there is no support for the mother because the services are understaffed and stretched.</P>
        <P>We all saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme showing stacks of files on social workers&rsquo; desks.  It is an outrage that the report containing the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s figures for 2006 for services for children in welfare was only published yesterday.  How can the Minister of State put in place services for children who are suffering abuse and neglect when he does not know until two years later the figures for the number of children affected?</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister of State is in a new portfolio and it is difficult, but at the same time, we are failing our most vulnerable members in society.  As Senator Larry Butler said, they are also the most valuable, the largest asset to our society.  It is every child&rsquo;s constitutional right to be protected and cared for.</P>
        <P>I applaud the Minister of State for taking time out of his schedule to visit the Longford-Westmeath constituency as often as he has.  We have fantastic capital projects with beautiful <Col N="663"/>cr&egrave;ches, both private and community-based, which he has visited.  I hate to be negative but through staffing and doing away with the subvention, as Senator Ivana Bacik stated, a two-tier system in child care has been created.  Many parents cannot afford to send their children to private cr&egrave;ches because of the prohibitive costs.  In turn, the staffing arrangements for the community cr&egrave;ches are under threat and they are not able to function.  Many single mothers who want to work but cannot afford child care costs or get a subvention have done the sums and decided to stay languishing at home.  This is an anomaly I know the Minister of State will address.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of ghettoisation also arises in this debate.  I attended school with children who were both well off and not so well off.  One nurtures a society by having children who have different experiences of life socialise, play and be educated together.  Those who have and those who have not should not be in different cr&egrave;ches or play groups, which is what is happening because of the community child care subvention scheme.  That is reported to me, both by parents and by the providers.</P>
        <P>Mothers who have gone to university and who want to contribute to society find that when they have their second baby they cannot afford the cost of child care and opt out of the workplace.  Society is at a loss that these intelligent women are not able to contribute in the workplace.  It is lovely for the children &mdash; do not get me wrong &mdash; but it is a shame that their mothers do not have the choice to be able to work because of the prohibitive cost of child care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House and the opportunity to make a statement on the provision of child care services.</P>
        <P>There is little disagreement in the House that a considerable challenge faces this country in terms of developing a quality child care infrastructure, but there is a clear need to establish a workable, flexible, equitable and affordable model of child care in Ireland.  There are a number of problems and difficulties facing us in this country, one of which is that Irish child care services are provided largely on an informal basis which does not meet the needs of parents.  CSO statistics show that child-minding or family home-based child care is still by far the largest sub-sector in Ireland, accounting for 80% of child care places for infants, pre-school and schoolgoing children.  The remaining 20% of parents access private and community child care services which can take many different forms, including sessional services, full-day services, employer-based child care, after-school care and the Early Start Programme.</P>
        <P>Despite clear improvements to the child care system, unfortunately, the current provision does not address the demand.  It would appear that the child care services have the capacity to support little more than 15% of the children aged up to three years, and we have the second lowest rate of coverage in Europe for those between the ages of three and six years, according to an OECD study of child care in Ireland of two years ago.</P>
        <P>The second problem in terms of developing an adequate model of child care is that traditionally we have viewed child care as an adjunct to employment policies rather than as a highly complex and important issue in its own right.  Much international research shows that the early years of a child&rsquo;s life are crucial to his or her cognitive, emotional and social development and that many of the benefits are transferred to the family and to the wider community.  Child care is not just about employment or even about educating children; it is an important social support mechanism and developmental service.  Research has demonstrated that the influence of the first few years of a child&rsquo;s life can determine whether he or she will remain in school, will access employment and-or proceed to third level education.  We need to take all of these factors into consideration when considering the development of child care services.</P><Col N="664"/>
        <P>On Saturday morning last I attended a SIPTU meeting which examined the organisation of people who work in the community child care sector, and these issues arose repeatedly.  I would welcome a proposal to organise workers in this sector because part of the difficulty is that the sector, because it is largely informal, has been relatively invisible and its workers have not pushed for issues such as proper training, better standards and, obviously, pay and conditions, which also would come into the equation.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that the sector organises itself to a greater extent, and I think the Government has been trying to do this.  It has been trying to put in place structures to help the child care sector organise itself in a way that will benefit the children who are in receipt of the services.</P>
        <P>In 2000, 33 city and county child care committees were established to deliver local child care strategies and these committees received funding under the Equality Opportunities Childcare Programme.  They also have strategic plans, employ staff and implement actions.  Will the Minister comment on whether the effectiveness of these child care committees has been evaluated, and whether the area is regularly evaluated to learn from best practice and from those who are succeeding in making good inroads into developing good child care structures and programmes in their areas?</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of my aims today, rather than focusing on the challenges and the negatives, is to point to one programme of which I became aware recently, which is funded by the Government and which is a positive model that I hope will be replicated around the country in years to come, namely, the Fledglings Childcare project.  The first of a number of sites opened in Fettercairn in Tallaght on 1 September last and the second site is due to open at Brookfield, probably at the beginning of January.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will outline the background to how this project arose.  The original project, the Shanty Educational Project, was founded 21 years ago by Ms Ann Louise Gilligan and Ms Katherine Zappone.  Their belief was that education was the key to eradicating poverty.  The Shanty programme has provided an extensive range of second-chance education and training opportunity for thousands of women in Tallaght West.</P>
        <P>In 1999, the Government provided a grant of &euro;1 million to help build An Cos&aacute;n and Rainbow House was established.  This is the organisation&rsquo;s in-house early childhood education and care centre and provides high quality education and care.  This enabled many parents in the locality to avail of education and training.  At a later stage, an innovative social enterprise project was developed and Fledglings Childcare was then registered and created. This centre was set up to provide child care training for local women.  By May 2007, it had more than 220 women on 11 different courses including FETAC level five child care, FETAC level six supervisory and management and other courses including child-minding and parenting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an innovative and radical new social enterprise which can be replicated.  The hope is that it will be replicated outside Tallaght west in the Dublin area and nationally in due course.  Economies of scale will apply and once the front-end set-up costs have been covered, the costs of the extended roll-out will be much lower.  The model is based on research into local community needs and responds to the real unmet need for affordable early childhood education and care, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  It is also a social franchise model that has been recognised by Social Entrepreneurs Ireland.</P>
        <P>Under its contract with the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Fledglings Childcare has committed to opening ten child care centres using this social franchise model.  When operating at full capacity, the first four of these locations will provide more than 115 additional child care places and more than 20 new child care jobs.</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>I congratulate the Government and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on having had the foresight to support a project like this, but also argue strongly for the replication of this type of project in the rest of the greater Dublin area and around the country.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the House.  He has been having a rather rocky day, I understand, but I welcome him to the House.  I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator de B&uacute;rca and I cannot go along with her congratulating the Minister or the Government on this issue. </P>
        <P>When at some time in the future we look back over the great achievements of the past ten to 15 years in the Irish economy and society and do the balance sheet, perhaps we will see that our greatest missed opportunity in the course of that time was not to put in place a reliable, well-funded and universally accessible system of child care.  We failed to do this and I do not personalise this failure around any individual Minister.  Members of the Government and parties who support the Government bear a political responsibility for failing in that task.  It is manifestly the case that the Government has failed in that regard.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I also attended the SIPTU organised meeting on Saturday last, to which Senator de B&uacute;rca referred earlier.  It was attended by representatives and workers from community child care centres throughout the country, but mainly from Dublin city.  When one attends meetings such as this one expects to see genuine anger, as the Minister of State experienced earlier today, but in a sense this was worse than anger.  At least when anger occurs there is a prospect or possibility that it can be focused and ultimately achieve something.  However, the feeling in this case was worse.  It was the frustration of people who believe they have been completely ignored by the State.</P>
        <P>They visited a Government office recently.  I cannot remember the exact office but they were due to meet some officials &mdash; I would not seek to personalise this matter around an individual official &mdash; who were responsible for the administration of the subvention scheme.  They outlined their genuine concerns regarding the pressures they are under in respect of the rates that are charged, the administrative work that is now associated with running the centres and other frustrations.  However, they were told, perhaps more in sorrow than in anger, that they were not even on the radar.  We know who has been on the Government&rsquo;s radar in recent weeks but, unfortunately, it has not been the people who run the community child care centres in our cities and towns.</P>
        <P>One of the best things about recent days has been the explosion in debate about universalism.  I have never previously seen debate at such a level.  People have become politicised and are asking questions.  I heard the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, say in recent days with regard to the medical card for people over 70 years of age that we should not give medical cards to people who can well afford to pay for care.  However, my position, and I understood it to be the position of the Green Party, as it was in the past, is that we should strive to provide the same excellent level of service to all members of the community, irrespective of whether they are high, middle or low earners.  The way to achieve equity and ensure we can fund the provision of those services and ensure that the people who have money actually pay their fair share is through our taxation system.  We are shirking this, and we have shirked it again in recent days on the other issue I mentioned.</P>
        <P>We are shirking it in particular in the area of child care provision.  As Senator Mary White correctly pointed out, the National Economic and Social Forum has made the point repeatedly, and as recently as last autumn, that the subvention scheme &mdash; our child care system is essentially a combination of the subvention scheme and the supplement &mdash; is not considered to be workable and may leave low income families at risk of not being able to continue in employment.  In other words, they might have to abandon the fledgling child care services.  There was little <Col N="666"/>or no consultation with those who are affected by the scheme.  The NESF went on to make the point, as other Senators have made in the course of this debate, that provision of early education for children in this country is one of the lowest in the OECD countries but that child care costs, relative to earnings, are the highest in the OECD, at nearly 30% of net family income.  That is more than double the OECD average.</P>
        <P>The NESF&rsquo;s principal recommendation is that the Government provide, free of charge, a high quality pre-school child care session of three and a half hours per day, five days per week, for all children.  The forum expressed its disappointment that the recommendation had not been accepted and implemented.  The Labour Party has supported this recommendation. As I understand it, and some journalists and commentators have commented on this recently, if the Government introduced the type of universal provision advocated by the NESF, the funding necessary to sustain it would be less than the current combination of what it pays in the subvention scheme and the supplement.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that.  It is a specific statement.  I understand it to be true but if it is not, I would welcome an elucidation of that point.  If the Minister of State can demonstrate that it is wrong, I would like to see the figures and to ascertain whether that is the case.</P>
        <P>Other Senators have spoken about the pressures and dilemmas faced by child care centres in respect of taking in children, the rates and trying to train and retain employees.  In any sector, be it child care, education or the health service, there must be trained professional staff.  Until we understand that we require properly trained people working in child care centres and that we must give them a stake in their own work and future, we will not hold onto excellent people in the way we must.  We have failed to do that.  People are paid very little.  Of course, the background to this is that so many of these centres grew from voluntary activity, where people, often young parents, got together to organise a centre.  This voluntary effort at the start evolved into a more long-term proposition.  They obtained a grant and then became employers.  They must now proceed as a business.</P>
        <P>However, they are incredibly frustrated, as they made clear at the meeting last Saturday.  The issues were raised in this House when we debated the subvention scheme last year.  I will offer one example, the administrative requirements on these centres whereby people who are employed to run a child care centre have to engage in lengthy form filling and are obliged to inquire into the means of parents proposing to send their children to the centre.  They are being diverted from the job they should be doing, that is, running and developing excellent child care centres.  The frustration is palpable.</P>
        <P>There is something lacking in this area.  The Minister has said previously that information and assistance are available but the people who run the centres say there is no information or support available.  Somebody is right and somebody is wrong.  Perhaps the information that is available is not made available in an accessible or digestible way.  Perhaps the Minister should consider holding a series of conferences or seminars, in Dublin and other cities, to train or assist these people with regard to what is expected should they be required to carry out these administrative duties into the future.  Perhaps a roadshow of some description should be organised.  There must be a way of addressing the information deficit for the people who run these centres.  One finds incredible frustration when one talks to them.  They are genuine people who are seeking to provide a service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the remarks of Senator Mary White, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children.  The Leader of the House often tells me I am only a new Member of the House and only learning, but it is extraordinary the extent to which Members on the other side of the House make contributions in debates with which one entirely agrees.  However, it is the delivery and action at the end that appears to be woefully inadequate or non-existent.  I agree with Senator <Col N="667"/>Mary White&rsquo;s emphasis on the NESF report.  She speaks as somebody who has taken a genuine interest in this issue, but I wonder to what extent the Minister of State listens to her.  He does not appear to have been able to convince the Minister for Finance to deliver what Senator Mary White and others have sought.</P>
        <P>I have a few queries about the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech because what he said is not entirely clear.  Can he confirm what the funding is for the subvention scheme and for the sector generally?  With regard to the allocation for 2009 under the national child care investment programme, the Minister of State said that he has sustained the 2009 current funding allocation at its full 2008 level.  I understand that if the funding for 2009 is the same as that for 2008, it denotes a drop in real terms because it does not take account of inflation and other factors that must be knitted in.  Is this correct?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred in his speech to the eight major child care organisations that are supported and how they have contributed greatly to the development of quality child care.  He was correct but proceeded to state, &ldquo;I hope to strengthen those links in the coming months with the location of expertise from the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, the CECDE, into the early years policy unit of the Department of Education and Science&rdquo;.  This should read that the Government has abolished the centre in recent weeks.  When I referred on the Order of Business to our not being given the full story, this is the kind of action I mean.  The centre is gone and the notion that it has been integrated into another is incorrect; it has been abolished.  If we just used plain English, we might be able to make more progress in our discussion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on child care and its provision.  Before doing so, in addition to welcoming the visiting delegation, I welcome my colleagues, the Ministers of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputies Barry Andrews and John Moloney.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intend to examine briefly the various issues surrounding the provision of child care services.  These include the funding and regulation of services and the provision of these services for children with disabilities.  Since coming to office in 1997, the Government has steadily and progressively increased the provision for child care services.  It has taken a two-pronged approach to funding.  In the first instance, there are increased direct payments to families through the use of the child benefit scheme and the early child care supplement.  In tandem, the Government has dramatically increased capital funding through the equal opportunities child care programme and the national child care investment programme.  Child benefit has been increased from &euro;38 per child in 1997, when the rainbow coalition Government was in power, to &euro;166 per child in 2008.  This represents an increase in excess of 300%, which is far greater than cumulative inflation over the same period.  The increase in funding has contributed to easing the burden on families as the cost of living has increased.  It has contributed to the ability of a parent to stay at home and look after the needs of his or her children.  It has enabled other parents to meet some of the costs associated with child care, which gives them an opportunity to seek work outside the home.</P><Col N="668"/>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>While the children&rsquo;s allowance provides some finance to meet the costs of child care, which is an acknowledgement of the increasing costs associated with very young children, in the 2006 budget the Government initiated the early child care supplement scheme.  The purpose of the supplement is to support parents in meeting the higher costs associated with caring for pre-school children.  Initially a payment of &euro;1,000 per annum was allocated but this was increased to &euro;1,100 in the 2008 budget.  In light of the economic circumstances the State is facing in the months ahead, the 2009 buget provides for this payment to be paid in monthly instalments, in line with child benefit.</P>
        <P>In recognition that the vast majority of children start school well in advance of their sixth birthday, the 2009 budget has made changes to the scheme.  Children will now only be eligible for the payment until they reach the age of five and a half.  This minor, but significant, change will result in savings of &euro;35 million in a full year.  Such savings have made possible the decision in the 2009 budget to extend the national child care investment programme to beyond 2010.  This programme was established in January 2006, with a total allocation of &euro;575 million over five years, of which &euro;358 million and &euro;217 million have been in respect of capital expenditure and current expenditure, respectively.  The main intention of the programme is the creation of an additional 50,000 child care places, including 10,000 for children between three and four and 5,000 for after-school care.  At its heart is a commitment to seek a majority of child care places through the community sector, with the remainder to be provided within the private sector.</P>
        <P>While significant sums have been allocated to groups nationally, more time is required to allow community-based providers to bring their proposals to a stage in which they are in a position to draw down the funding.  I welcome the decision in the 2009 budget to provide for that extension.</P>
        <P>The need to regulate those offering child care provision to our children to the highest levels must be central to any Government policy on child care.  Parents must have the peace of mind of knowing their son or daughter is in a safe place of the highest possible quality.  The Child Care Act 1991 stipulates that the HSE is charged with ensuring the health safety and welfare of pre-school children attending services.  All child care providers are required to notify the HSE that they are providing services and, consequently, they are required to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children attending their service.  The establishment of, and provision of additional resources to, the Garda Central Vetting Unit are valuable in ensuring the safest possible child care environment exists.  Overall, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for these regulations and for developing policy in this area.</P>
        <P>The HSE is required to inspect and regulate pre-school child care services and has published a  list of tips on choosing a pre-school.  I urge all parents who are choosing a child care facility to consider these guidelines and ensure the facilities they intend to use meet with them.</P>
        <P>In line with my role as the Government&rsquo;s Seanad spokesperson on disability and mental health, I will consider the provision of child care services for children with disabilities.  The Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency&rsquo;s recent report, Profile of Inclusion, 2007, contains research on the inclusion of children with disabilities in child care and play settings.  It notes that 57% of the services surveyed have included or include children with disabilities.  These providers should be commended on this.  However, the report has also shown us that of the providers surveyed, 21% said they had previously turned a child with a disability away.  The main reasons, as highlighted by those who specified, include accessibility issues, not being able to meet the child&rsquo;s needs and a lack of training.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>The benefits of including children with disabilities in mainstream child care facilities far outweigh any challenges that may arise from doing so.  Respondents in the aforementioned survey also believe this.  They believe inclusion would promote understanding and acceptance, allow all children to learn together and promote children&rsquo;s rights and equality.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to work in tandem with his ministerial colleague, Deputy Moloney, to provide the necessary supports to providers to make them feel more confident in providing care to children with disabilities.  I commend the Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency on its role in supporting operators of child care facilities to address these challenges.  I congratulate the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on maintaining the high level of child care provision in the 2009 budget, despite the economic downturn.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State over the coming months and years in developing child care facilities for all our children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy John Moloney.  It is extraordinary that we are debating child care again today.  I do not believe speaking on child care should be the preserve of female Senators.  I speak as an uncle and godfather of five children under six.  The formative years of children are vital and those of us in education understand this.</P>
        <P>Sometimes I wonder if Ministers lose sight of the fact that children are very important.  It is acknowledged that we are, and are becoming, more and more laid back in the provision of child care.  We are now, as Senator Quinn said, falling behind other European countries.  For many parents today child care has become a second mortgage.  Another important point is that children today may not see their parents from 7.30 or 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning until 6 or 7 o&rsquo;clock in the evening.  Under the Constitution the State has a duty to our children.  We are not fulfilling that duty.  As a consequence of community child care, are we going to make childcare the preserve of the private sector?  Is that what the new ideology of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and the few Progressive  Democrats is going to be?  Is that what we are trying to do?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have had 11 years of plenty, and of boom and bloom.<b>  </b>Senator de B&uacute;rca mentioned building child care infrastructure.  Why do we not do it?  We are discussing means testing and universality yet again today.  If we are serious about being child-centered in 21st century Ireland &mdash; and one can take Piaget, Erikson or Freud &mdash; early intervention through child care and preschool is very important.  As Senator Corrigan knows well, by the time children come to secondary school or even into bunscoil, it is too late in many cases, and they have lost the whole cognitive development period of their lives.</P>
        <P>The debate is welcome.  The cuts in funding community child care are imposing much restriction and hardship on people.  I ask the Minister of State, if he does nothing else today, to go back to the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance, and readdress the community childcare subvention scheme.  Senator Fitzgerald, in her remarks, made reference to the manner in which the 2009 budget has affected the elderly and children.  Child care support, child-based subvention for those over 18 and registration fees in colleges all affect young people.  I will return to a question I asked a moment ago.  I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, or Senator Corrigan believe that the value of Government is to impose cuts on young people and education for savings of several hundred million euro.  Is that the value we place on young people and young parents?</P>
        <P>Whether we like it or not, we are hitting the low paid and the vulnerable in community child care schemes.  We are forcing women in particular to make difficult choices.  A young mother was in my clinic on Friday and she had to make a choice between returning to work for a few <Col N="670"/>hours a week or putting her child into a scheme that would cost her several hundred euro, and would cause her to lose family income support.  Are we forcing people to make hard choices?  There is also a real risk that child care facilities will close.  We can discuss capital investment, but that will be no good when there is nobody to provide services.</P>
        <P>We are making people struggle.  The scheme is not working.  We are creating, as Senator Bacik stated, a type of segregation.  That is not good enough.  Access and provision are important.  Universality is the buzzword today in Irish politics.  Let us not force parents to make choices regarding their children.  Let us give our children every opportunity to have access to child care that is affordable and helps their development.  If we do not, we are failing in our duty.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment to this House to return with a review of the bands laid out in the current scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, welcome the Minister to this House for this important debate.  I glad to have an opportunity to make a contribution as a parent myself and on behalf of many parents of my generation, and younger, who are now faced with huge challenges in the present economic climate, not only to remain sustainable in their own family lives, but also to give their children an upbringing as good as, if not better than, we received from our parents.</P>
        <P>When discussing child care, we must acknowledge the role of grandparents.  There is not one family in Ireland who has not utilised or sought the help of grandparents when parents are working.  The grannies and granddads of the country have stepped into the breach, often after rearing large families of their own, and have helped to raise their grandchildren.  They have set an example for many of us now rearing our children.</P>
        <P>Prior to the introduction of community child care schemes, and fancy cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools, there were many individual childminders in communities all over the country, both urban and rural, who operated little childminding facilities.  They started them themselves, minding two or three children a day, without assistance or help from anyone.  They provided a beneficial role, allowed people to work and gave children the care they deserved.  They also need to be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>We all agree we have moved on from that.  The role of the county and city child care committees under the various boards must be acknowledged.  They have played an important role.  They are supported by the Department in achieving guidelines and standards, and the establishment of new facilities, all over the country.</P>
        <P>There are many areas where there are no childminding or cr&egrave;che facilities at all, and people are still relying on their families.  That is a pity in this day and age, and is an area I hope is addressed in the future, where county and city child care committees do engage with communities and identify areas where there are no facilities.  It is often the case that communities have the best capacity and organisation reap the rewards.  They are the people who have the capacity to apply for grants and organise themselves to get the facilities.  However, there are areas in the poverty trap.  They are the places that need help.  The Minister of State must bring this message back to the Department.  These are the areas that need direct assistance and engagement from officialdom, whether it is through local authorities, county child care committees or the Department itself.  We must give those communities the capacity to organise themselves to bring proper community childcare facilities into their areas.  They see them happening in more affluent areas, but they see vast housing estates around themselves that local authorities built, with the approval of Departments many years ago, with no child care facilities whatsoever.  That must be addressed.</P><Col N="671"/>
        <P>We have had a U-turn in the D&aacute;il today; the last U-turn I remember was last year when the child care subvention was due to be hit.  There was a revolt in the Government and a Senator said, &ldquo;We will sort that out in our parliamentary party&rdquo;. It went some way to addressing the issue because it adjusted the bands to keep community cr&egrave;ches open.  However, according to today&rsquo;s headlines there is a real threat to these cr&egrave;ches.  After all the good work and the progress they have made, there is now a threat of funds being pulled from them.</P>
        <P>The reality is that there are people who cannot afford these cr&egrave;ches unless they are subsidised.  If we weaken the support to people who are already trying their best to get into the workplace and put their children into proper child care facilities, the whole structure will take a step backwards.  We do not want that.  We want to see genuine progress and we must continue supporting community child care services.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Buttimer.  While there are excellent child care facilities available, we cannot leave it to the private sector alone.  That would be a dangerous road to go down.  We would be leaving whole sectors of our community without these facilities and badly exposed, and it is the children of those families who will suffer if we allow that to happen.  As an elected representative and a parent, that is something I would not like to see happen.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention children with special needs because child care extends to all children.  There are many children with conditions such as autism, dyslexia and other special needs on which we have had debates in this House.  Those children are not getting the response from the State they deserve.  These are innocent, vulnerable children with small voices but no powers.  I am aware of cases where there could be over 250 children in a school but only four children per year can go for assessment.  Even if four children are being assessed and their difficulties addressed, whether behavioural or otherwise, there are many more children in that school who need assessments and the services of the State but they are not getting it.  They are suffering for those reasons.</P>
        <P>I understand that in tough budgetary times we must be able to account for public expenditure but the last people who should suffer are our children.  I often hear economists talk about productive investment and that we should not invest unless there is a productive outcome for that investment.  I can think of no better investment than investing in our children and in their future, and helping those with special needs.  The outcomes from the assistance they will receive will help them in their future years when they will have to become sustainable and perhaps live alone in many cases.  As Senator Buttimer said, it is in their formative years that children need the most help.  It is an area that should not be neglected.  This is an issue for the Minister for children but he must consult with the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that proper resources are provided in our schools to children with behavioural difficulties or special needs.</P>
        <P>Children at risk and children in families that are in poverty traps need to be identified quickly and given the assistance of the State.  Despite the Celtic tiger boom we experienced, there are still families that are experiencing high levels of poverty and are socially excluded.  It is important we remember all of these children as we adopt policies in Government or otherwise going forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to respond.  I have taken into account the issues raised by Senators Buttimer and Coffey, and indeed Senator Alex White, and I hope to respond to as many of the issues as I can during the few minutes available to me.</P><Col N="672"/>
        <P>By way of explaining my presence here, the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, had a previous ministerial appointment and I was asked to step in for him.  In reference to the issues raised by Senators Buttimer and Coffey, I pledge to bring them back to the Department and I am sure they will have a response as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Regarding the budgetary changes that affect Vote 41, I listened to the concerns expressed, and I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, has listened to them also.  The issues raised by Senators Fitzgerald and McFadden refer to child welfare and protection.  Recent years have seen a period of major investment &mdash; &euro;240 million since 1997 &mdash; in child and family support services to enable an appropriate response to child welfare concerns.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the value of community child care.  In my own town of Mountmellick I am proud to say we have an excellent child care facility as a result of &euro;1.5 million in capital grants some time ago.  I would be the first to acknowledge also that there are certain concerns in that regard that I want to work toward but I see the value of community child care in a rural area.</P>
        <P>It is also important to make the point that the focus for development in recent and coming years is on preventative community based services which provide early intervention within the community care context.  The Health Service Executive has stated there has been an increase in funding of family support services of 79%, from &euro;45.7 million in 2003 to &euro;81.8 million in 2008.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to future policy issues raised by Senator White.  As regards future policy plans in the area, the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services is the overarching policy document of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The agenda, with its clear renewed emphasis on family support coupled with reflective questions to enable service providers&rsquo; self-evaluation, represents the fundamental change now under way as to how Government policy in regard to children is formulated and delivered.</P>
        <P>In response to the Agenda for Children&rsquo;s Services, the HSE is developing a policy dealing with child welfare and child and family support services.  The core principle of the policy is supporting the child within the family and within the community.  The office is working closely with the HSE in this regard and it is anticipated it will be published some time early in the new year.</P>
        <P>I would also like to make mention of the fact that continued work in areas like the child care information project, the knowledge management strategy and the review of the Children First guidelines is ensuring availability of far better information, improved communications, application of research findings to child welfare in protection provisions and management evaluation and policy analysis.</P>
        <P>With regard to the National Childcare Investment Programme, the NCIP, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, has specific responsibility, I understand that the precise details of the extended timeframe for delivery of the capital programme is not yet available.  However, I understand that the Minister&rsquo;s personal view is that the NCIP will benefit from an extension of two or possibly three years beyond 2010.  As the Minister of State made clear to the House, this approach will provide additional flexibility to child care projects, in particular those in the community based, not for profit sector which qualify for large-scale grants of up to &euro;1.2 million and which can often take two years to come to contract and draw down of funding.  An extended timeframe will, in turn, help to ensure that the amount of grant funding that becomes payable each year under the NCIP is more closely in line with the allocation provided for in Vote 41.  This will ensure that the take-up of the appropriate allocation is maximised.</P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>With regard to whether the NCIP&rsquo;s full capital allocation can continue to be available to the programme over the extended timeframe, I take this opportunity to confirm that the Minister&rsquo;s understanding is that subject to the normal rules of accounting, which reaffirms Vote allocation on an annual basis, this continues to be the case.  While the capital allocation in 2009 is &euro;60 million, at this point it is not possible to say for certain what will be the position in respect of 2010 in advance of the Estimates process for that year.  However, it is the clear understanding of the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, that the commitment to the provision of the NCIP&rsquo;s full capital allocation remains intact.</P>
        <P>The Community Child Care Subvention Scheme, CCSS, was introduced in January of this year to continue to support community based child care services and enable them to provide reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low income parents.  I also understand that the officials in the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs are not aware of any service participating in the CCSS which has closed as a result of its introduction.  It is fair to say that some 100 new child care services have either entered the scheme at this point or are due to enter it at the end of the year, bringing the total number of services participating to approximately 900.</P>
        <P>The CCSS has provided detailed and useful data to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and his office regarding the level of service provision in the community sector.  This is far more comprehensive than the study to which Senator Fitzgerald referred.  The latter considered 12 services, of which five have a reduced funding level of 5% in 2008.  I also understand that the data provided in 2007 from applications for 2008 funding will be updated shortly.  Processing of funding applications for 2009 has been completed.  The updated data will enable also a comprehensive exercise that will be of assistance in supporting the programme to be carried out.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the cost of child care for parents in general.  The CCSS targets funding to disadvantaged and low-income parents.  The family income ceiling in this regard is &euro;45,000.  Average costs in the private sector are in the region of &euro;200 per week.  In the community sector, such costs are &euro;150 per week and this means that parents earning &euro;50,000 who will not obtain a subvented rate will be able to access a more affordable child care place.  With a guaranteed minimum level of funding of 95% in 2008 and 85% in 2009, the loss of grant income of &euro;151,000 to which the Senator referred would mean they would have received &euro;3 million in 2007 under the previous scheme.  The latter represents 8% of the entire funding for the 780 centres funded.</P>
        <P>Under the CCSS, the average price parents pay for full-time day care is &euro;84 per week.  Some 80% of parents attending are subsidised and 50% of them are paying less than they did under the previous scheme.  The new scheme is far more targeted and effective and will not be reviewed while it remains in place until the end of 2010.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and McFadden referred to segregation in the support of agencies, especially in the context of a focus on parents receiving social welfare payments.  Most social welfare recipients benefit from affordable preschool services of three hours and do not require full day care services.  It is often middle to lower income parents who avail of the more affordable full and part-time child care services.</P>
        <P>The CCSS is a targeted scheme and is only available in community-based settings.  Any move to extend it to the broader child care sector would need to be considered in the wider policy context.  In developing Ireland&rsquo;s child care infrastructure, the achievements to date under the <Col N="674"/>NCIP in the context of child care places created will be built on in the future.  This will involve considering a range of policy objectives, including more broadly based preschool provision.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to child care costs in other EU states, citing lower costs and higher tax rates and stating that Ireland and the UK are low-tax economies.  At present, the NCIP and other initiatives undertaken by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, together with the universal supports provided for child care in early childhood, are the main provisions in this area.  However, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, indicated his intention to ensure more effective use of the framework and resources available to his office, including the co-located early years policy of the Department of Education and Science to provide a clear focus on early years care and development.</P>
        <P>Senator White raised a number of points.  In response to the first of these, I must state that the allocation of current funding is not automatically increased each year.  It can be increased by 0% to 3% or more.  While many Votes have seen a reduction in the current funding proposed for 2009, funding for Vote 41 has been sustained at the existing level, despite the need to make administrative savings of 3%.  This represents a real increase in the money available to services funded under the CCSS.</P>
        <P>Another issue raised relates to the preschool years.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to provide access to preschool years by 2012.  The Government is meeting this commitment through the NCIP and the creation of places, many of which are specifically for three to four year olds.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, is also committed to developing care and education as a single and best-practice approach.  This will begin to happen over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin.  According to current figures, between 800 and 1,000 Irish people are incarcerated in prisons overseas.  The majority of these prisoners are held in England and Wales, with others in Europe, South America, Central America and Africa.  The conditions in prisons in these countries vary greatly, with many decidedly below basic standards outlined by the United States.  It was stated in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last year that a disproportionate number of suicides occurred among Irish inmates at Brixton Prison in the early part of this decade.</P>
        <P>The Report on Irish Prisoners Abroad by Chris Flood provides a troubling depiction of the conditions faced by and concerns among Irish citizens incarcerated in other jurisdictions.  It is our responsibility as parliamentarians to try to ease the hardship of Irish prisoners abroad and their families by addressing and implementing the recommendations outlined in the Flood report.  The key recommendations in the report are to:</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P LI="1">Recognise there is a need to ensure best international practice is employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to the support it gives to Irish prisoners abroad; establish a new unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs . . . with the objective of overseeing prisoner welfare matters and keeping up to date with international developments in this area . . . establish a register of Irish prisoners abroad . . . [to] include information on family visits . . . establish that every prisoner overseas has a right to a consular visit at least once a year and twice in more difficult . . . countries [such as in Central America]; ensure that prisoners should be visited as soon as possible after arrest.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows as well as I that many people enjoy a great deal of international travel and more Irish people will end up in prisons abroad.  We need to ensure our citizens overseas have access to legal, consular and other support systems, including translation services.  The families of prisoners overseas are often forgotten about.  Some families cannot afford to visit them and are without any kind of support whatsoever.  Families bear much of the burden of their family member&rsquo;s imprisonment, providing money for clothes, food, toiletries and telephone calls.  We need to provide support for those families.  If the recommendations in the report compiled by Mr. Chris Flood were implemented, that would go a long way towards addressing the very real human rights issues concerning Irish citizens.  I make no judgment on why those people are in prison.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government welcomes the debate.  The motion has been tabled by Senator Mary White, who has been a strong advocate of the rights of Irish prisoners overseas.  The debate relates to the Flood report.  In 2005, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, asked former Minister of State, Mr. Chris Flood, to undertake the study.  That request arose out of a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to &ldquo;identify the number of Irish prisoners abroad and their needs for services in prison&rdquo;.  Mr. Chris Flood accepted the task and in August last year presented his report to the Minister who warmly welcomed it.  Since that date, the Department has begun to implement its main recommendations.  The Flood report is a seminal study into the needs of Irish prisoners overseas.  It is well thought out and will serve as the template for future action in this area for many years to come.</P>
        <P>I will outline some of the measures we have taken to implement its key recommendations.  The report recommended that the Department establish a register of Irish prisoners abroad to include personal details of the prisoner, including sentence, health status and the last visit by a consular official.  The Flood report also recommended that prisoners overseas should have a visit once a year, and more often than that if circumstances required.  Those recommendations have been accepted and the Department has recently appointed a Canadian software company, following a tendering process, to install the appropriate equipment in the Department&rsquo;s information technology system.  The new software system will allow the Department to compile an electronic register of Irish prisoners overseas.</P>
        <P>The Flood report also recommended the establishment of a hardship fund to assist prisoners and their families in cases of particular hardship.  Earlier this year, I agreed to provide &euro;30,000 to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas to operate such a hardship fund.  That sum is in addition to the &euro;220,000 provided in core funding for that organisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Flood report also recommended that Irish embassies and consulates have available lists of English speaking lawyers and provide advice on local legal systems to prisoners and their families.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that recommendation has already been implemented.</P><Col N="676"/>
        <P Just="Left">The report also recommended that the Government consider appointing additional honorary consuls in areas currently without permanent Government representation.  New appointments have recently been made in Agadir in Morocco, Tbilisi in Georgia and Cancun in Mexico, as well as the re-opening of honorary consulates in Jakarta in Indonesia and S&atilde;o Paolo in Brazil.  I pay tribute to our honorary consuls who, in difficult parts of the world, undertake countless visits to Irish prisoners on their own time and expense.  I recognise also the excellent work done in the area by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.</P>
        <P>Miscarriages of justice were examined in the report.  Chris Flood was mindful of the very high profile cases involving Irish people in Britain.  The report recommended the Government consider a financial contribution towards organisations working to overcome miscarriages of justice.  Earlier this year, I agreed to the provision of &euro;25,000 to the group founded by Paddy Hill, Miscarriages Of Justice Organisation, MOJO.  That funding is earmarked for cases concerning Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>The report also called on the Government &ldquo;to seek to block [forced] repatriation [to Ireland]&rdquo; of prisoners serving their sentences in Britain.  As Senator Mary White is aware, the Irish and British Governments subsequently concluded an agreement covering that point and removed the threat of forced expulsion which had caused considerable unease among Irish families settled in Britain.</P>
        <P>In discussing prisoners&rsquo; rights, we must be mindful also of the rights of victims.  At no stage do we seek to shield Irish people from the consequences of their crimes.  We believe our citizens should be fully amenable to the local justice system.  However, we have a duty to ensure Irish citizens are not discriminated against and are treated in a humane and decent manner.  The Flood report measured the Irish consular system in this regard against other comparable countries.  It concluded that we stood up well in any comparison but indicated areas where extra action should be considered.  I have outlined some of those areas today.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to Mr. Chris Flood who undertook this complex study and refused any remuneration for the task.  We all owe him a debt of gratitude.  I thank also the public servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs who have worked diligently to implement the recommendations of the report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Not yet; next year.  This matter relates to the need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the lack of specialist registrar training in maxillofacial surgery.  This specialist area includes treatment of afflictions relating to facial trauma and cancer of the head, neck and tongue.  It is a surgical specialty in which the lack of training is acute and disturbing.  To qualify for this specialist medical field candidates need two primary degrees, one in medicine and one in dentistry.  They also need a further five years&rsquo; training before practising.  That is an extraordinarily demanding apprenticeship, which results in candidates being particularly suited for this specialist field.  Unfortunately, training facilities in Ireland are non-existent.</P><Col N="677"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">Maxillofacial surgery is practised in four units, namely, Cork, Limerick, Galway and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  Each unit needs to be well staffed.  Currently, anyone wishing to train in this area is obliged to go overseas for that purpose.  I urge the Minister to consider the case of a constituent of mine who wishes to be trained in this specialty but who is unable to do so because training that was available through the Dublin Dental Hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital ceased in 2002.  The person in charge went overseas to continue his own training and, accordingly, the course collapsed.  It means that those who need to be treated must endure longer queues.  While those who work in this area are well qualified, they are getting older and are not being replaced.  There is nobody there to replace them.  One of the excuses often given is that there is little demand for this treatment.  However, the figures available to me suggest that each year, St. James&rsquo;s Hospital treats 1,000 facial fractures, 100 cases of mouth cancer and 200 facial deformities.  Those who are qualified to do such work are being assisted by people who have been trained in dentistry and medicine but cannot be certified because they have not done the necessary extra training in maxillofacial surgery as it is not available in Ireland.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>For the sake of those who wish to practice this form of medicine and those who wish to be treated, can we not make the necessary training available to ensure we have enough suitably qualified doctors to provide the treatment?  If we do not do so, people will have to go abroad or the facility in question will have to close.  As no training is available in Ireland, those who wish to practice this science need to go abroad to be trained.  I ask the Minister of State to consider providing the necessary funding, imposing the necessary pressure or offering the necessary incentives to the hospital to make this provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this important issue.  The aim of specialist and senior registrar training is to produce enough trained doctors in each specialty to satisfy future national requirements for consultant appointments.  To this end, the Medical Council recognises specific postgraduate training bodies which are responsible for the provision of a wide range of postgraduate training programmes.  The objective is to align the intake of trainees to the specialist senior registrar grade with the anticipated job opportunities for consultants.  It is important to avoid producing too many highly trained personnel for whom there might not be outlets in this country or abroad.  A flexible approach is taken, however, with regard to the recommendations of the 2003 report of the national task force on medical staffing and the commitment in the programme for Government to increase significantly the number of consultant posts.</P>
        <P>The specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery is the surgical discipline which deals with the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of pathological processes which affect the teeth, jaws, face, head and neck.  Training includes the operative, non-operative and intensive care management and rehabilitation of disorders of the teeth, jaws, face, head and neck.  As Senator Ross said, it is mandatory to be dually qualified as a doctor and as a dentist before one can begin training in oral and maxillofacial surgery.  Basic qualifications must be registered with the Medical Council and the Dental Council.  The dual qualification gives an understanding of the surgical anatomy and pathology of conditions affecting the face, mouth and jaws and associated structures.  The skills attained during the complex and lengthy training programme are best utilised by treating complex patient cases of facial deformity, trauma, cancer and cleft lip and palate.  Oral and maxillofacial surgery is one of the specialties listed in the Medical Council&rsquo;s register of medical specialists.</P>
        <P>There are nine consultant oral and maxillofacial surgeon posts in Ireland.  Four of the posts are based in the Dublin region, one is based in Cork, two are based in Galway and two are <Col N="678"/>based in Limerick.  The Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report on oral and maxillofacial surgery services was published in 2005, when there were six consultant posts in this specialty.  It recommended an interim total of 13 consultant posts and a long-term total of 24 consultant posts.  There is no higher specialist training programme in oral and maxillofacial surgery in Ireland.  A training programme was previously in place, but approval for training was withdrawn by a professional specialist advisory committee.  Reasons cited for withdrawal of approval included a lack of complexity in workload, limited supervised training due to the low number of consultants in the specialty for the large service workload and the lack of a formal national rotational training structure.</P>
        <P>The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has been working on the development of a new, formal, higher specialist training programme in the specialty.  A programme director, who is one of the existing consultants in the specialty, has been involved in drawing up a curriculum for the training programme with a view to seeking specialist advisory committee approval for a small number of specialist registrar posts in the specialty.  It is expected that the increase in the number of consultant posts in oral and maxillofacial surgery over the past three years will assist in securing training approval.  Considerations to be taken into account in the approval of new specialist registrar posts include the availability of funding, rotation of posts between at least two clinical sites and anticipated job opportunities for consultants in the specialty.  Any potential expansion in the number of specialist registrars by the Health Service Executive must be made in the context of the employment control framework, the availability of resources and Government policy on the reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors.  I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask two supplementary questions.  When can we expect a training programme to be made available?  Can the Minister of State explain what in the name of God she meant when she said &ldquo;reasons cited for withdrawal of approval included a lack of complexity in workload&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I admit that when I examined the response earlier, the phrase in question struck me as unusual.  That is what the specialist advisory committee said.  From the small knowledge I have of this area, I have to acknowledge that it seems to involve a hugely complex workload.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the phrase &ldquo;lack of complexity in workload&rdquo; mean?  I do not know what it means.  I do not understand it.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The phrase in question did not come from the Department of Health and Children.  It came from the specialist advisory committee.  In fairness, there were six consultant positions in Ireland when approval for the training programme was withdrawn.  As there are now nine such positions, we are in a different situation as we try to get specialist approval for a training programme.  The increase in the number of consultant posts over the past three years should help us to make that case.  We are moving to a model that involves more consultants and fewer non-consultant doctors.  We will examine the important points that are being made in the debate.  I assume that the increase in the number of consultant posts will make it possible to reconsider the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I appreciate that the Minister for Education and Science is abroad at present.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, needs to meet his Northern counterpart to discuss some students&rsquo; lack of access to certain supports.  Bursaries and other forms of financial assistance are not available to students from the Republic.  That is a cause of serious hardship for many of my constituents.  I am a three-time graduate of the University of Ulster, Jordanstown.  I was one of those students who availed of free fees in the North before a similar regime was brought into effect here.  It seems that questions are being asked about the reintroduction of fees in the Republic.</P>
        <P>It is traditional for people in my constituency to attend their local third level institution.  While Letterkenny Institute of Technology is very good, many people choose to study at the various University of Ulster campuses &mdash; Magee, Coleraine, Jordanstown and Belfast &mdash; or at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast.</P>
        <P>I recently received a letter from Sir Reg Empey stating that the significant difficulties which have developed since the new situation in the North started to evolve are to be examined.  I am concerned that the examination will focus solely on the students from that jurisdiction.  The difficulties being encountered by students from the Republic who attend colleges in the North need to be addressed too.  In his letter, Sir Reg Empey mentioned that variable tuition fees were introduced in Northern Ireland in September 2006 to provide higher education institutions with much-needed additional revenue.  The authorities in the North are trying to get more people to attend the colleges in question.</P>
        <P>Sir Reg Empey&rsquo;s letter goes on to say, &ldquo;At the same time, enhanced student support arrangements, including access bursaries, provided by higher education institutes were introduced to mitigate the impact of student fees on less well off students.&rdquo;  He has just completed the second academic year of the new arrangements and has made clear his commitment to review variable tuition fees and student finance, which is due to commence in the 2008-09 academic year.  Therefore, it is very opportune that our Minister for Education and Science would speak to the equivalent Minister, not necessarily the Minister for Education because it seems to be devolved to the Minister for Employment and Learning, to outline our concerns to address the deficit that appears to exist for our students and to clarify whether students going from the Republic of Ireland to the North qualify for these bursaries and extra supports within student hardship schemes.</P>
        <P>There are mixed messages.  I defy anyone to read some of the documentation on the web.  The University of Ulster website says one is classified as a &ldquo;home&rdquo; student for fee purposes if one meets all the following criteria: one is &ldquo;settled&rdquo; in the UK, has been ordinarily resident within the UK for the previous three years and while one was there one was not there just to receive full-time education.  It then goes on to say, &ldquo;Other groups of students who do not meet the immigration and residence conditions in the UK and Islands but who will be assessed as Home-EU students for fee purposes&rdquo; include students from the EU.  My problem is that students are getting the impression they are not eligible to apply for bursaries or hardship schemes because they come from the Republic.  I would like clarification on whether they are entitled to it, and if they are, I would be interested to know the numbers of students availing of this and whether there are difficulties with particular colleges.</P><Col N="680"/>
        <P>This is about trying to keep our graduates in our area.  I want Ulster graduates to remain in Ulster if they can.  I have no objection to their coming to the universities in the Republic, but we do not want them to fly to Scotland, which many of them do because Scotland has absorbed the fee issue.  Yesterday at Stormont I raised this issue with most of the political parties and I have had feedback already in that the chair of the education committee there wants to deal with this issue which they also see as important.  I will return to talk to them, not only as a person interested in the topic but also as a person on the education committee in this jurisdiction.  However, this must be driven at ministerial level.  There are new ideas about fees.  Much learning has taken place in the North and I would like to think we can learn from them.  We must also ensure our students are given as much support as possible.</P>
        <P>A student of whom I am aware must pay &pound;3,145 per year for three years.  She cannot get a grant because she is not more than 15 miles from the college.  Her parents are on illness benefit.  She is not entitled to the top-up grant because it is not a long-term benefit.  The loan is the only help she can get.  Another student has graduated from the University of London and has gone on to do a masters in the King&rsquo;s College because it is a specialised course and is not offered here.  She is one of a very small number of people qualifying and is a credit to her country, yet she can get no help.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State taking this matter.  I hope she can give me some enlightenment.  If not, I hope she can bring clarity to the issue and encourage the Minister to do as I ask and talk to his Northern colleague on this issue of most importance to our students.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the formal structures for co-operation in the education sphere between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  More specifically, it gives me the opportunity to outline existing arrangements under the Department&rsquo;s third level student support schemes relating to students from this State who undertake courses in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The general context is that the North-South co-operation unit in the Department of Education and Science manages the Department&rsquo;s funding and co-ordinates co-operation activities within the education sector with the Department of Education and the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland.  The Department of Education in Northern Ireland has responsibility for all school and youth-based education matters in Northern Ireland.  The Department formally engages with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland at ministerial level on co-operation issues under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council in four main areas: special education needs, educational underachievement, teacher mobility and school and youth exchanges.  The Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland has responsibility for further, vocational and higher education matters as well as employment matters in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe has asked me to clarify that the Department does not formally engage with the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland within the structures of the North-South Ministerial Council owing to the provisions of the Belfast and St. Andrew&rsquo;s agreements which designate the specific sectoral areas for North-South co-operation. However, the Department engages in co-operative activities with the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland at official level on a number of issues.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland co-funded and collaborated on a series of conferences <Col N="681"/>dealing with higher education issues.  The themes of those conferences were Ireland as a centre of excellence in third level education; international education, a capacity builder for the island of Ireland; widening access to higher education on the island of Ireland; cross-Border higher education co-operation in Ireland and Europe; higher education and business, beyond mutual incomprehension; and what role for higher education in the development of the 21st century workplace.</P>
        <P>Regarding student supports, the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe would like to indicate that within the parameters of existing liaison mechanisms with Northern Ireland counterparts, he will do all he can to raise awareness of the concerns raised by Senator Keaveney.  Under the Department&rsquo;s third level free fees initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students, including those from Northern Ireland and other EU member states, who attend approved undergraduate courses in the State.  The main eligibility conditions of the initiative are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</P>
        <P>Regarding eligibility for financial assistance under the student maintenance grant schemes which are administered by the vocational education committees, VECs, students entering approved full-time courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  An approved course for the purpose of the third level maintenance grant schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years&rsquo; duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year&rsquo;s duration pursued in an approved third level institution.  Further information on grants and the schemes can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The third level student support schemes extend to undergraduate study in Ireland and the EU and postgraduate study in Ireland, including Northern Ireland.  Any extension of the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside of the island of Ireland could only be considered in the light of available resources and other competing demands within the education sector.  There are no plans to expand the provisions in the grant schemes in relation to study abroad.</P>
        <P>Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and postgraduate courses in non-EU countries.  Tax relief at undergraduate level extends to approved full or part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level colleges in the State and any other EU member state and approved full or part-time courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
        <P>Tax relief on tuition fees is claimed directly from the tax office using an IT31 form and the details of approved colleges and courses are also available on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s website.  Approved undergraduate courses must be of at least two years&rsquo; duration, and both the college and the course must satisfy the codes of standards as laid down by the Minister for Education and Science with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Again, I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position here.  We will bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister&rsquo;s attention on his return.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the very lengthy answer.  Does the Minister of State agree that bursaries offered by universities should be open to all students?  That is where I am coming from.  Where a university support is called a bursary, the best student should get it.  I know the danger of opening up schemes to everybody.  In Stormont we were able to move on the concept of the North-South parliamentary forum.  Two working groups will now be set up to put terms of reference in place.  We are hoping that these types of issues, that are so pertinent to real politicians and real constituents, can be addressed in an easier way.</P>
        <P>I emphasise one point again, namely, that bursaries should be open to all students.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that message back to the Department and use it as a starting point for the discussion.</P>
