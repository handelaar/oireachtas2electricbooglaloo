	<P>I have notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline how he intends to fund Collinstown Sports Complex, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, and other community-based sports centres, given the withdrawal of dormant account funding and the imminent closure of this facility currently used by 1,200 children a week.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Education and Science to cease over-reliance on old prefabricated buildings at Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review the current procedures for the employment of substitute teachers by schools and the formalisation of such websites used to source teachers to ensure that only candidates with the required teaching qualifications and up-to-date Garda clearance are given positions in Irish schools.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry Leyden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain the circumstances leading to the lack of ambulance cover at Roscommon County Hospital, specifically on the night of Friday, 14 November, and again on the night of Wednesday, 26 November, and the lack of ambulance cover in Boyle on the evenings of 25, 26 and 27 November from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., and to ensure that this does not occur again; to prepare a report on the management and timetabling of ambulance services in Roscommon and to confirm if the situation has required the hire of a private ambulance service when the service should be provided by the HSE.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to advance urgently the issue of consumable labelling and, where necessary, the legislation to ban dangerous substances being consumed, and where there is evidence of breaches of safety that consumers are immediately made aware of the companies involved.</P><Col N="542"/>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Reilly and Corrigan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Leyden and Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re Regional Fisheries Boards (Postponement of Elections) Order 2008, referral to committee, without debate; and No. 2. motion re statements on F&Aacute;S.  It is proposed that No. 1 will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business.  No. 2 will be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and will conclude not later than 6.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes, and Senators may share time by agreement of the House.  The Minister will be called upon ten minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments and questions from spokespersons and leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Friday the Government launched a new report on public sector reform, which I read.  It is almost as if this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government woke up after ten years and found itself in office, because there is a whole range of recommendations in the report which should have been in place before now.  Why have these recommendations not been in place for the past ten years?  This question arises when one reads the report, especially the section on monitoring of agencies set up by the Government.  The implications have been most clearly apparent in recent days and weeks with F&Aacute;S, and we have an opportunity to discuss that agency later today.  Where has this report been for the past ten years?  Where was the monitoring for the past ten years?  I ask the Leader to provide the House with an opportunity to discuss that report.  It is essential that reforms take place urgently given what has come to light in the context of F&Aacute;S in recent days.  </P>
        <P>The lack of reform of the public sector and the lack of oversight has undermined our Civil Service.  The Government&rsquo;s responsibility has been passed on to other agencies like the HSE.  The Fitzgerald report published a number of months ago indicated that people in that organisation were unclear as to their role.  All of this has undermined the public sector.  It is very clear that the sector needs reform, although that should not mean cutting frontline services.  Such reform is outlined in the aforementioned report and should have been happening over the past ten years.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs be invited to the House to discuss pensions.  Yesterday she rather strangely said, in her response to people&rsquo;s concerns about pensions, that people could rely on the State pension.  Now is probably a good time to discuss the regulatory regime for pensions that is currently in place.  It is likely that the regime needs to be altered to ensure the survival of a range of pension funds.  Many people are very concerned about personal and private sector pensions.  The Government must act in this area but the Minister was not very reassuring in what she said yesterday.  A debate on the issue in this House would be appropriate in order that we can hear the Government&rsquo;s plans regarding pensions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that the Leader has once again funked having a debate on education this week.  It is clear that the Government is seriously embarrassed by the fact that it is the only area where frontline staff are being removed from service provision.  Having a debate on the issue would be the honest thing to do so that we can examine the potential impact and hear the arguments from both sides.  I will be proposing a change to the Order of Business tomorrow or on other days this week to facilitate such a debate.  I appeal to the <Col N="543"/>Minister for Education and Science to participate in a debate in the House and ask the Leader to invite him to do so.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Having been reared, as many others were, on stories of Irish people being abused, misused and exploited abroad, I was never more ashamed to be an Irish citizen than I was last night while watching the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  It showed how newcomers and immigrants to this country were being treated by Irish industry.  I never thought I would see anything as bad as people actually being forced to work for nothing.  As a trade union official I often dealt with cases of people being poorly paid or working in poor conditions but that programme showed instances of people being forced to work for months on end, on the mere promise of being paid.  They never got paid and were kept in slavish conditions.  I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Billy Kelleher, give his views on the matter, although I am not for one moment blaming him for the situation.  It is likely that he would share my views on the matter but he must go on the record on the issue.</P>
        <P>The question of the privatisation and capitalisation of the banks is a recurring theme.  As I have said every time the issue is brought up, I believe the Government is right not to rush into anything.  It was right not to have invested taxpayers&rsquo; money in the banks.  The issue must be discussed seriously.  While capitalising the banks may be important it will not guarantee that money will flow to small businesses and others.  Capitalising the banks improves the share price.  That is all it does.  Once the banks get the money in, they use it to improve their own asset base and there is no requirement on them to make more money available for loans.  The Government is doing the right thing in not rushing into anything at this stage.  Having said that, I would like the Government to explain what it is doing.  The Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance should come to the House and say, &ldquo;This is what the plan is; this is what we are trying to do; here is how we are going to do it; we want everyone to get in behind us; these are our objectives; and this is how we will know when we have won&rdquo;.  At the moment, we are just wandering along from one crisis to another.  There is no confidence and there will be no improvement in sentiment and no movement in terms of getting a more optimistic view on the economy while we are wondering where the Government is going.  It is not enough for the Government to take the right decisions if it is not sharing with us what those decisions are and telling us how we need to get behind them so that we can at least have a national approach.  This is something in which the social partners and other groups should be involved.  It has been raised on the Government side as well.  We need to address these issues rapidly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I entirely agree there should be a debate on the issue raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole about the banks.  However, on its own capitalisation of the banks would not achieve what Senator O&rsquo;Toole says we need to achieve.  There must be conditions associated with capitalisation of the banks by the State if that is what is to occur.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right in stating that it cannot be done on its own.  The whole point of the argument made by my party and others is that we cannot just dump money in but that we should make it conditional.  We should take an equity stake in the banks so that the Government does not just have the type of arms-length, supervisory control that has been canvassed in the context of the guarantee, but part ownership.  Ownership would give it control, and then it could get on with achieving the outcomes that Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly says need to occur if recapitalisation takes place.  The Senator is right in stating that there should be a plan, and it is amazing that we do not yet have one.  We have called umpteen times for the kind of discussion that we all feel needs to occur.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in what he said about last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House involving the Minister with <Col N="544"/>responsibility for labour affairs and possibly the Minister for Transport.  One aspect of the programme was that, notwithstanding that the Department of Transport appears to be aware of many breaches of employment law in the road haulage sector, it has never revoked a single haulage licence, which is extraordinary in circumstances in which it knows about these abuses.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs to come to the House.</P>
        <P>I agree it is not a question of blaming the Minister of State for a particular state of affairs in his area, but there is an issue with regard to where we look for responsibility, including political responsibility.  I heard one of the people last night on the programme &mdash; I think it was Mr. Quinn, whose issues we will not go into here &mdash; make an extraordinary statement in view of his former responsibilities as a spokesperson for the haulage industry.  He stated that there is plenty of legislation and there are lots of agencies and quangos so if workers did not understand their rights it was not his fault.  This type of hand-washing is also problematic in so far as it applies to Ministers.  We need to introduce the legislation we were promised nine months ago, the Employment Law Compliance Bill, which was published last March but which has not been advanced.  We need to consider this legislation.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Fitzgerald said about the public sector, but it is amazing that some people &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;some&rdquo; &mdash; a small number of people in the private sector constantly seek to dump everything on the public sector.  They say the public sector is a burden we are carrying around.  However, if some of those people &mdash; I emphasise again that I am talking about a small number of people &mdash; in the haulage industry and, as was pointed out on last night&rsquo;s programme, the hospitality industry and among those employing domestic workers spent less time complaining about the public sector and regulations and more time honouring their own responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in terms of paying their workers properly, treating them properly and paying their own tax and PRSI to the State, perhaps then we could talk about slimming down the public sector, because those in the public sector would not need to chase these people to ensure they discharge their basic responsibilities as employers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise something that was brought to my attention in Kerry at the weekend, which I hope the Leader will bring to the attention of the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs.  It relates to nefarious activities by individuals who are passing themselves off as migration agents &ldquo;assisting&rdquo; Irish citizens who wish to move to Australia.  Members will be aware that the Australian Government has a target of attracting 200,000 additional workers between now and June 2009.  Because of the current economic difficulties, it is becoming quite attractive for young professionals in particular to go to Australia.  There is a myriad of documentation and a great deal of red tape associated with that because of visa requirements and so on.  These individuals are setting themselves up as so-called Australian migration agents.  There are only six such agents licensed by the Australian Government, yet these people are taking advantage of Irish nationals who wish to cut through the red tape.</P>
        <P>I have one case involving an Irish nurse who paid in excess of &euro;4,000, had two years of frustration but has still not obtained her Australian visa.  No system is in place in this country for licensing such agents, unlike in the UK where it is stringently enforced.  I ask the Leader of the House to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>The Gate Theatre celebrates its 80th anniversary this week.  It would be important for this House to convey, through the Leader, our best wishes to that wonderful hallowed institution which has provided high class entertainment and the best of drama for those 80 years, from the works of Oscar Wilde to Harold Pinter to my own neighbour, John B. Keane.  This is a wonderful occasion for the theatre and I ask that our best wishes be conveyed to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Paper on pensions was published recently.  However, in recent days, we heard about the memo leaked to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the worry and concerns of people who are retired or who are about to retire that there may be insufficient funds to meet the liabilities.  We all know the public sector pensions are very safe and that is proper order.  However, it is so unfair that the people who actually pay the pensions for the public service are the people who are going to be expected to live on &euro;230 a week.  It is very cold comfort from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to say that they can rely on &euro;230 a week when these are the people who have been working all their lives to pay our pensions and those of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, teachers and all the fat cat public servants who are earning masses of money.  We saw one such public servant resign last week.  His pension will be intact and he will have no worries.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Fitzgerald I ask that the Leader make representations to the Minister on the issue of pensions.  There is a proposal that people would be able to extend or postpone drawing down their pensions until the market stabilises and pensions would go up again.  This is the best way to deal with it and it would be some reassurance for people who are so worried.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to have said that the Minister will talk to the pensions industry.  This is a very limp reply to the anxiety and worry that exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling about the Adjournment debate but having tabled an Adjournment matter, it certainly concentrated the minds of those in the Health Service Executive on the issues I was going to raise tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A very similar motion was raised by the Senator last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why I fully accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying it concentrated the minds of those in the HSE and the matter has now been resolved and we will have 24-7 cover for the ambulance services of Roscommon County Hospital.  That is thanks to having this forum, which the councillors do not have, to raise issues about the HSE and the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator thanking the Leader for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter ten days ago.  It is so important to have that type of service.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader of the House to allow a debate on health issues.  For example, it would have taken one hour for an ambulance to come to a young lady, a mother of three children, who was haemorrhaging.  Fortunately, a neighbour collected her and brought her to Roscommon County Hospital where surgeon Michael Relihan came on duty and saved her life.  This is what it means to have a local hospital.  The HSE and other policymakers do not realise people&rsquo;s lives will be affected and lost unless these good quality services are provided and maintained.  Having surgeons and physicians on duty 24 hours a day is vital.  It is the most important service in the country.  I want the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to attend the House so I can explain to her again what would have happened if the hospital had not been <Col N="546"/>on call and Michael Rennan was not there to give emergency surgery on 23 November.  I compliment the hospital and staff involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If this had not happened the woman in question would have died.  The woman, Mrs. H, has asked me to raise this matter in the House.  She is quite prepared to go public and explain what occurred in her situation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appeal to FBD Insurance to reconsider its decision to close 13 of its offices and lay off 153 staff who now face a dim future.  FBD is a wonderful insurance company.  I must declare an interest in that I have all my insurance policies with it.  It is an Irish company established by the then National Farmers Association.  It has provided great employment but is making cutbacks.  I request that the company keeps as many staff in place.  The closure of 13 offices is a big blow to the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I was very concerned on reading the Sunday newspapers about the potential deficit in private pension funds.  The figure referred to of &euro;30 billion dwarves those for the banks.  On Sunday I was at a Christmas party for 150 elderly people in Kells.  The sense of concern was evident.  Many there were concerned as to what this means to their potential income.  As people get older, they need certainty and clarity on this matter.  Will the Leader arrange a debate to flush out the issues surrounding private pensions?</P>
        <P>I was upset watching last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  Many of the issues have been  raised already by other Senators.  The issue relating to road safety, however, is very concerning particularly if people are driving these great lengths.  A Chathaoirligh, could you bear with me for a minute.  Someone&rsquo;s mobile telephone is going off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a mobile telephone going off in the Chamber.  I have said on a number of occasions that mobile telephones must be left outside the Chamber or turned off completely.  Please, Members, be fair to the staff of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very worried to learn from last night&rsquo;s programme that people were driving such journey lengths on our national roads.  There is a clear need for the Garda and the enforcement agencies to take action in this regard.  We should not be looking at trucks running into cars at this time of the year.  There are real concerns about road safety that need to be tackled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Likewise, I support the calls for debates on private pension schemes.  Many close to retirement are concerned as to what their entitlements will be and I would welcome a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>The call for the debate on education is important to clear up the suggestions in the public on pupil-teacher ratio, substitute teachers and so forth.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, would love to attend the House and have a long discussion on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>He has been hiding since the budget on 14 October.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be no interruptions when a Member is speaking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; on its excellent broadcast last night.  It highlighted what is happening to those being exploited in the workforce.  It is important that the public acknowledges this.  It is horrific to think of the kind of road traffic <Col N="547"/>accidents that could result because of a haulage service exploiting its drivers and overworking them.</P>
        <P>Last week the Sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in Europe launched its report on the Lisbon treaty.  It is important that the Seanad examines the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side to the treaty.  There is no better Chamber than the Seanad for discussing this issue and bringing it out in the open.  I congratulate the sub-committee on its work and its Chairman on his detailed coverage of each point of view on the treaty.  I do not know if it is possible to include it on the agenda before Christmas, but it is important that we keep it on the agenda, now more than ever after the launch of the report last Thursday.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the schedule for the week and the motion re the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, back from committee, to be taken without debate.  We had a discussion on this last Tuesday in respect of a framework decision on terrorism.  I pointed out the unsatisfactory nature of introducing a matter concerning EU legislation without debate in this House, referring to a committee and it coming back without debate.  This House has no opportunity to discuss, debate or raise any issue about these items of legislation.  The framework decision on terrorism, introduced last week, will require change in our legislation.  When that legislation is introduced, we will be told that we cannot have a debate on it because we passed the framework decision, the EU directive.  It means that in respect of scrutiny of EU legislation, which has been highlighted as an issue in every debate on every treaty and referendum campaign, these Houses are failing to scrutinise EU decision making and to take ownership of the decisions made by our Ministers in Brussels.  I am surprised the Leader has included this item without debate.  I ask him to desist from introducing these issues without debate and to allow us to deal with EU legislation in this important area of criminal law and combatting crime measures.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senators Fitzgerald and McFadden raised the matter of pensions.  Reference was made to the statement of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, to the effect that if push comes to shove, people can rely on the State pension.  This is a most insensitive, cavalier and arrogant statement.  The reality is that many people have invested in private pensions or they have had to rely on their employment&rsquo;s investment in private pensions.  They have a reasonable expectation of having a pension they can live on.  As someone with a number of pensions, as teacher, Deputy and Minister, Deputy Hanafin simply made the statement when people are feeling the pain of the problems that have arisen in the equity markets which have affected the value of pensions.  A debate on this issue is important.  If that is all the Minister has to offer in terms of providing conditions under which some of the difficulties can be ameliorated, it is very sad.</P>
        <P>I refer to one particular insurance company, Equitable Life, in the United Kingdom, which was in the news last week.  This would not cost the Government anything.  There are 6,500 Irish policyholders with Equitable Life.  It has been the subject of a European Parliament report and a parliamentary ombudsman report in the United Kingdom, where there was a call for a fund to compensate Equitable Life policyholders.  Given that there are so many Irish Equitable Life policyholders, I ask the Leader if the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs could clarify if any representations have been made to the UK Government or the Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect of this compensation fund and whether Irish policyholders would be included in such a package.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague Senator Leyden in his call to bring the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss the Health Service Executive and waste therein.  This is prevalent in my county of Kerry where we have had numerous reports on the Kenmare hospital.  Thousands of euro were spent and plans were drawn up more than 33 years <Col N="548"/>ago.  Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae got a deal in 1997.  He got another deal in 2007 that the hospital would be built and extended.</P>

	<P>There is no completion date for the hospital in Kenmare and, indeed, no start date.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss that issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Daly, the Government has forgotten and neglected the situation in Kenmare.  Years ago I raised that matter in this House on the Adjournment and received what I believed was a commitment, but, as everybody knows, nothing has happened since.</P>

	<P>Of course.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the public sector reform report which has been published.  It should be coupled with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call regarding education and the need for front-line staff to be protected.  Public sector reform must not be about removing the vital people of whom we have insufficient numbers in so many vital areas on the front line, it should be about removing the fat and the overly burdensome administration, much of which is needless, throughout the public service.  I support that call for a debate regarding all the people in the wonderful teaching profession who are under threat.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct, we will have to challenge tomorrow and on succeeding days if we are not allowed to debate that matter.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Alex White made very interesting points on the recapitalisation of the banks.  I accept that will not be enough in itself, but it would begin to rebuilt confidence.  We want to see Irish-owned and Irish-run institutions.  That will give us strong domestic banks that are more capable of and inclined to make proper lending available to Irish businesses, so many of which are being starved, as we know, of working capital.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I always respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling more than most in this House, but we want to keep choice and competition.  Will the Government consider some SSIA-type system to allow investors, through Irish-managed investment vehicles, to get involved?  I am sure many vehicles are waiting in the wings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on pensions, particularly the funding of many of our pension schemes.  It is a most important issue.  I disagree with Senator Regan&rsquo;s simplistic approach that in some way the Government should meet the losses accrued in pension funds.  One might as easily say this about people who have invested in the stock market.  People who have put their life savings into bank shares and others, and who depend on the dividends from those companies, have lost up to 90% of their wealth in the past year.  One can argue this, but the State cannot be the rescuer in that situation.</P>
        <P>There is a serious issue with defined benefit schemes because where there is underfunding they will breach their statutory requirements.  The Minister is correct and I welcome her more flexible approach in view of the current circumstances.  I compare that with the public service.  We have index-linked pensions and if one has, say, 40 years of service one receives 50% of one&rsquo;s final earnings.  There is no funding for that.  It is paid for out of current expenditure.  It will not be possible to continue that in circumstances where many more pension schemes may move from being defined benefit to defined contribution.</P>
        <P>In all the argument that has taken place in the past 24 or 48 hours little mention has been made of the people on defined contribution schemes who are in an equally bad position as those on defined benefit schemes because the pot of money they had accrued for their pensions has been seriously eroded.  That is a major issue and one on which I hope we will have a constructive debate.</P>
        <P>I concur with those Senators who remarked on the road safety aspects of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night.  As a former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, I recall being brought on to a television programme with Pat Kenny more than 20 years ago for a head-to-head debate with the chairman of the Independent Hauliers Association, a body that was illegally hauling at the time.  We argued from our side about the lack of enforcement of all the existing legislation, and that argument is continuing to this day.  It is all about enforcement.</P>
        <P>I recall some time later being in Germany where we spoke to people in the transport industry.  I asked about the problems they had with illegal haulage.  Even though the person I was speaking to had good English, he obviously did not understand what I was saying and had to get German translation.  When he heard the translation he just laughed.  The concept of illegal haulage was alien in Germany.  They simply did not get away with it because if they were stopped on the roads and they were in breach of the regulations, their vehicle was taken away.  That is what we need here.  We have too much regulation and too little enforcement.  That needs to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Members opposite to stop coming into the House and treating it with disrespect?  Day after day, week after week members of the Leader&rsquo;s party in particular come in here and decry Government policy.  They should come over to this side of the House and vote against their Government which is letting them down.  They should stop coming in here and playing politics with the Irish people.  They should come over to this <Col N="550"/>side and vote.  I ask the Leader to enforce that because I and the people are getting very tired of it and we are seeing the legacy of it now, with the economy in free-fall. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other speakers in paying tribute to the people involved in the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night.  It is an investigative programme which deserves accolades for what it has done.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs to the House for a discussion on the deplorable working conditions of many workers.  I am sure the Leader will join all of us who condemned the treatment of the workers depicted in the programme last night, in particular regarding the issue of road safety.  If that was an Irish diaspora community 30 years ago in London or America, we would be on our feet in outrage.  In today&rsquo;s new Ireland, all of us as legislators and public representatives have a duty to condemn outright the treatment of workers, regardless of who they are or from <Col N="551"/>where they come.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs to the House for an urgent debate on that issue.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Fitzgerald, I ask for a debate on reform of the public service.  As a society, we have lampooned public servants unfairly.  The Government has treated public servants badly.  All it has unveiled is a botched decentralisation programme and wrongly blamed workers in the public service.  They deserve to be respected and treated properly and they deserve leadership from Government, which they have not got.  That debate is long overdue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I partially agree with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments regarding FBD&rsquo;s unfortunate announcement about the closure of a number of offices around the country.  The company provides a service of which I avail, similar to the Senator.  It is unfortunate at this time that a company that has done well in recent years is seeking to reduce the number it employs.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others who have asked numerous times for a debate on education.  The failure of the Minister for Education and Science to appear in the House to deal directly with the budget cutbacks since the Budget Statement is shocking.  I asked the Leader about this last week and he said he was not having difficulty inviting Ministers to the House but I wonder whether he is because this is a particularly embarrassing subject for the Government and the Minister for Education and Science has not come into the House.  Something must be happening to say he has not appeared.  I do not accept it could not have been arranged at some stage, particularly in a week such as this when the House is sitting four days and, for example, business is due to adjourn this evening at 7 p.m.  There is time for an education debate later and given there are four Ministers of State in the Department, if the Minister cannot be present for the entire debate, I do not see why he could not be present for part of it at least.</P>
        <P>I join with Members who have referred to the announcements and pronouncements of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs about pensions over the weekend.  She did not reassure thousands of people who have invested in private pensions and who are facing an uncertain retirement.  Her performance to date has not been satisfactory and it would be useful if she attended the House to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>Before the House adjourns for the Christmas recess, will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to come to the House?  I acknowledged he attended recently for a fisheries debate.  However, the farm waste management scheme is scheduled to cease at the end of the year and many farmers are in the middle of completing work.  If the work is not completed by the end of the year, grants will not be payable and this potentially could have serious consequences for them.  The ewe premium being sought by farming organisations for a period is also an issue.  Mr. Liam Aylward, MEP, produced a report on this issue for the European Parliament.  Last week a protest took place and sheep were left outside the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is a few years since a similar but more famous IFA protest outside the Department but we could usefully have the Minister in to discuss both issues and I would like that to happen between now and the end of the session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The news relating to the private pension schemes is extraordinarily serious.  Many people have worked hard, put in a lifetime of effort and they are looking forward to their pensions.  It is their pride and joy and their future.  Many people boast about their pension schemes, which are important.  If there is a threat to their pensions, this is a very serious matter.  I call on the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on the issue, which would be an example of the House responding to a serious national issue.  The debate should be a priority no matter how schedules are arranged or how long it would take.</P><Col N="552"/>
        <P>The proposition that people whose pensions are about to mature should put them on hold and wait a few years must be negotiated and the Government must achieve agreement on that with private pension funds.  The financial services institutions and the banks are not prepared to take their fair share of the hit in a downturn and too many of their losses are being passed on to hapless and unfortunate consumers.  I would like more evidence of them sharing in the recent misfortune.  Every insurance company and financial services company should take a disproportionately large hit.  I call on the Leader for a debate on this issue and to ensure the Government also insists that the companies take the hit they should take.  They have large property portfolios, inordinate wealth and they have paid huge dividends over the years.  It is time the financial services sector came clean with the people in order that consumers are not hit anymore.  It is unthinkable that the pensions of hard working people in small businesses throughout the country, to some of whom I was talking yesterday, would be at risk.  The House has no greater business than an emergency debate on this very serious issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader call on whichever Minister is responsible, possibly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to regulate debt collectors as a matter of urgency?  The Cathaoirleach may have heard of the business that was named yesterday and today on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.  Its job is debt collection on behalf of small, good businesses throughout the country which have been defrauded once by their customers.  It appears now, however, they are being defrauded also by their debt collector.  It is a serious issue.  This company is charging thousands of euro on the promise it will collect and refund in total the fee it has taken in.  This is an example of white collar crime.  Urgent action is needed from the Minister in charge, who I trust is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in calling for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House.  I am fortunate that I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and I had the pleasure of hearing and speaking to the Minister at the committee two weeks ago.  He said something outrageous at the meeting, however, that parents were not at all upset with the education cuts and that it was just the teachers who were.  This is an outrageous remark given the number of people who have been coming out on the marches.  We certainly do not have 8,000 teachers in Galway and it is parents in the main who have been involved.  Last week, there were 150 parents in a school in Oranmore and they were outraged at how the cuts will affect the children.  The education cuts are about children.  They are not about teachers, although they will lose in terms of posts.  Ultimately, those posts will be lost to the children.</P>
        <P>I call on the Minister &mdash; excuse me, I meant the Leader.  I wish I could call him a Minister because then perhaps he could deliver on this matter for us.  We need a date for a debate.  I must be six weeks looking for a date for the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House.  It is time we had a response.</P>

We have prioritised this and will try to make time available so the debate can take place as a matter of urgency before the Christmas recess.  On the point made by one Senator about decentralisation, I understand that 60% of all decentralisation will have taken place by the end of the term of this Government, which means 6,000 staff will have been decentralised at that stage.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, McFadden, Hannigan, Ormonde, Regan, Coghlan, Walsh, John Paul Phelan and O&rsquo;Reilly expressed their serious concerns about pensions and that these should be conveyed to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  I urge all Senators with further concerns to make their contribution on the economy when the Minister for Finance is present in the <Col N="553"/>House on Friday.  As I informed the House last week, there is an all-day sitting on Friday to discuss matters pertaining to the economy and the finance portfolio.  It is an open-ended debate and every Senator will have an opportunity on Friday to speak on the issue of the economy.</P>

        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Coghlan, John Paul Phelan and Healy Eames called for a debate on education.  I have made a commitment on this matter and it is not fair to suggest otherwise.  I was successful in having the debate on agriculture take place, and the Minister for Finance will be in the House to debate the issue of the economy.  Any time anything has been asked of me I have done my utmost to facilitate the requests of Members.</P>
        <P>As was confirmed on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night, an extra 3% was allocated in the budget for education.  Perhaps it is not as much as we want to see but it is an extra 3% funding.  As the acting leader of Fine Gael, Senator Buttimer, knows, his party wants to cut the allocation by 3%.</P>

	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Hannigan, Walsh and Buttimer expressed their serious concerns regarding what last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme brought to our attention.  We are all extremely annoyed, disappointed and shocked by certain parts of the well put together programme.  The Road Safety Authority has a serious obligation in this regard, as was pointed out to the House by Senator Walsh who has a great deal of expertise in this area.  Why does the Road Safety Authority not include in its next report that tachographs should be introduced which disconnect the ignition from the engine when the driver has driven for a certain period of time?  That is simple technology which is available.</P>
        <P>The Road Safety Authority has done an excellent job in recent years and I worked closely with it on insurance reform when I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  I call on it to introduce a short report, as a matter of urgency, to inform the Government that this is what it proposes.  Last night we saw on our television screens someone having to drive for 100 hours almost continuously.  That is suicide in this occupation.  I used to drive 60,000 miles a year.  This is a serious difficulty and it is a menace to those who use our roads within the law.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White and Coghlan pointed out matters pertaining to the banks and the challenge that faces the country.  Last Friday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, asked the institutions covered by the Government&rsquo;s guarantee scheme to consider the contributions they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives with regard to small and medium-sized businesses and otherwise and to come back to him on this matter within the next ten working days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he asking or telling?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I applaud the Minister in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>There is too much asking and not enough telling.</P>

	<P>The Leader, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I applaud the Minister on his stance on this issue.  As I pointed out to the House last week, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole expressed the same view, the ICC Bank and the ACC Bank were there to assist the 800,000 people, or 40% of our workforce, employed by small and medium-sized businesses and small family businesses.  The Government agency banks no longer exist and any struggling business, small or large, presenting itself to banks is finding it difficult to obtain the facilities necessary to continue in business in these globally difficult times.</P>
        <P>This is a reasonable request and anyone providing employment in the country can see a ray of hope from this statement by the Minister last Friday to his colleagues with whom he is working closely in the banking world.  I look forward to seeing whether this can be addressed in a meaningful way.  The regulator should be obliged to monitor the situation on a bimonthly basis to ensure the banks are operating according to the letter of the law.  The maintenance of jobs will be of paramount importance in the next year or 18 months.  It is vital in this regard that small businesses are supported by the banks.</P><Col N="555"/>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan asked me to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the activities of persons in his county and elsewhere in southern parts of the State who are posing as Australian agents and providing misinformation to young men and women who wish to emigrate to that country.  I am happy to convey the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan also asked the House to join him in offering congratulations to Michael Colgan and everybody else associated with the Gate Theatre on the occasion of its 80th anniversary.  Neighbours of mine, the late Edward Longford and Mrs. Longford, used to organise street collections in Mullingar in the 1950s to keep the theatre open.  Those of us who are old enough will remember how difficult it was in this country at that time.</P>
        <P>Senators Leyden and Daly complimented FBD Insurance on its efforts to support people in paying their insurance premia and so on.  The Senators expressed alarm at the prospect of the possible closure of 13 offices.  I join in their call to the company to reconsider its decision in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on the Lisbon treaty with reference to the findings of the Sub-Committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union, which operated under the excellent chairmanship of Senator Donohoe.  Members of the sub-committee attended meetings on three days every week for the past four weeks.  I will certainly endeavour to have time set aside for that debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan expressed concern about motions being put before the House without debate.  I suggest that the Senator outline any such concerns to his party leader in the House in advance of our weekly Tuesday meeting.

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about our national training and employment authority, F&Aacute;S.  As well as talking about the recent publicly aired matters relating to the administration of F&Aacute;S, I will outline the important and valuable role it is playing in the context of the serious challenge facing the Irish labour market.</P>
        <P>The downturn in the economy has had a significant impact on the labour market and is likely to continue to do so into the future.  Forecasts for employment have been revised downwards for this year and 2009 by all commentators.  The recent CSO quarterly national household survey puts the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2008 at 6.3%.  The rise in unemployment is compounded by the international credit crisis and a general slowdown in employment in all sectors.  Ireland is not alone in finding itself in this position.  Many countries throughout Europe and elsewhere are experiencing similar difficulties in their labour markets.  Recent statistics from EUROSTAT reflect this, with the unemployment rate in the 27 member states rising to 7.1% in October 2008.</P>
        <P>The Government is putting in place measures to ensure that those who become unemployed are provided with effective employment services and training supports to help them return to employment.  Increased budget allocations have been provided to F&Aacute;S to deal with the increase in unemployment.  Specifically, an additional &euro;5 million has been provided for training the unemployed and an additional &euro;4 million to subsidise the employment of redundant apprentices in 2009.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S is working closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure a speedy response to the rising live register numbers.  F&Aacute;S has, in conjunction with the local employment services provided by area-based partnerships, geared up its employment services further to <Col N="557"/>provide greater capacity for the increased referrals from the live register.  There is active engagement with the unemployed after three months on the live register to assist them in progressing towards employment, training or active labour market programmes.  F&Aacute;S has also put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  These include allowing them to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.  F&Aacute;S has also established a register of redundant apprentices by trade in order to identify these people at the earliest possible point in time and has prioritised the need to locate employers to sponsor the completion of apprentices&rsquo; off-the-job training.</P>
        <P>As regards training for those who become unemployed, F&Aacute;S will provide, in 2009, a range of certified, short, flexible and modular programmes in construction sector related activities, which are expected to remain buoyant despite the slowdown in construction.  Several programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded in the coming months.  F&Aacute;S has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.  In 2009 F&Aacute;S will open evening classes without payment of a fee to people who are unemployed.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S will continue to work together to monitor trends and activities in the industry and will work with all relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and satisfactory responses to assist redundant construction workers and apprentices to secure alternative employment, whether in the construction sector or another area of the economy.  F&Aacute;S has a specific policy in place to deal with redundancies and company closures.  It offers a tailored approach as early as possible to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment.  This applies to workers in all sectors, including construction.  Each response is tailored on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As part of the consultation process in the case of company closures and major redundancies, F&Aacute;S establishes the scale of the redundancies, the skills profile of the employees affected, the number of years' experience of the employees, level of education and any other information deemed relevant to the particular case in question.  In addressing the issue of redundancies, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, city and county enterprise boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has recently been at the forefront of national media coverage in the context of matters relating to expenditure.  These matters are under examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The origins of this case go back to October 2004 when my colleague, the current Minister for Health and Children, received an anonymous letter containing allegations of impropriety within F&Aacute;S.  The letter was referred to F&Aacute;S and the then director general instructed the F&Aacute;S internal audit unit to conduct an investigation into the allegations.  As is normal practice, the F&Aacute;S internal audit report was sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General expressed concerns with matters arising in the report.  On 9 May this year, the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report which dealt with a number of issues that arose in recent audits of non-commercial State bodies, including F&Aacute;S.  In the case of F&Aacute;S it referred to the F&Aacute;S internal audit unit&rsquo;s investigation into allegations of impropriety in procurement activities undertaken by or on behalf of the corporate affairs division of F&Aacute;S.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s findings were based on irregularities discovered by the F&Aacute;S internal audit unit.</P>
        <P>On foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report the T&aacute;naiste discussed the matter with the former director general of F&Aacute;S and expressed her concerns about the need to secure <Col N="558"/>value for money in public expenditure.  The Department also followed up on this matter directly with F&Aacute;S to seek formal written assurances that the practices referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report had ceased and that adequate systems and controls were in place to prevent their recurrence.  To further allay concerns highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, in September 2008 the T&aacute;naiste requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to report on the effectiveness of management and control systems across the F&Aacute;S organisation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General acceded to this request and I understand he has said that he will determine the scope of his examination following the completion of the investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>In making this request of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the T&aacute;naiste was keenly committed to ensuring that F&Aacute;S makes the best use of scarce public resources in the current challenging economic climate.  The T&aacute;naiste last week met the chairman and some board members of F&Aacute;S and reiterated her disquiet at the recent revelations concerning activities in the public affairs division of F&Aacute;S.  However, the T&aacute;naiste welcomed the board&rsquo;s assurance that action had now been taken to deal with these matters.  The board stated that a full examination of past practices is required to ensure that the organisation can move forward with best practice corporate governance procedures in place.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste made it clear at that meeting that she wanted the F&Aacute;S organisation to remain focused on its core mission, given the employment and training challenges facing the country, and she expressed her support for the continuing work of the board in that regard.  In particular, she acknowledged the ongoing commitment of the staff of F&Aacute;S to meeting these challenges.  She placed particular emphasis on their work in addressing the situation affecting redundant apprentices, training for the unemployed, providing supports for people with disabilities, up-skilling the workforce and the continued operation of community employment schemes.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the board&rsquo;s statement of 29 November that it intends to strengthen the internal audit function within F&Aacute;S.  This will help accelerate the audit work already under way in the corporate affairs area and will also help the organisation interface with the Comptroller and Auditor General as soon as he begins his examination of the effectiveness of the management and control systems in F&Aacute;S.  As Senators are aware, the former director general of F&Aacute;S resigned last week and I look forward to the board&rsquo;s proposals on how the position can be filled as quickly and as effectively as possible so F&Aacute;S can continue to deliver on its core mandate.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also carrying out a review of the efficiency and effectiveness of labour market programmes delivered by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets.  This review was initiated prior to the current controversy coming to light.  The review will also draw conclusions about the adequacy and balance of resources in the context of current and future labour market policy challenges, including the national skills strategy.  The steering group conducting the review is chaired by a senior official from the Department and includes members from the Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs, and Education and Science.  F&Aacute;S and Skillnets are also represented on the group and it is supported by Forf&aacute;s.  The review, including its conclusions and recommendations for an effective future labour market strategy, is expected to be completed by the middle of next year.</P>
        <P>The current controversies over certain administrative practices within the agency clearly represent an unwanted distraction from its real purpose of providing national support to this country&rsquo;s labour market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to this timely discussion about the role and future direction of F&Aacute;S.  The agency has been in and out of the headlines for a number of months, although it is only in the past couple of weeks that some very disturbing <Col N="559"/>details have emerged about practices at the top management level in F&Aacute;S.  The Minister addressed some of those issues in his remarks.</P>
        <P>The second paragraph of the Minister&rsquo;s speech states that forecasts for both employment and unemployment have been revised downwards.  I did not realise that unemployment forecasts had been revised downwards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I omitted that piece.  I just said &ldquo;revised&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have a copy of the speech when the Minister was speaking.</P>
        <P>I am also interested in the review of labour market programmes in which F&Aacute;S is involved.  The Minister made the point that this review was initiated before the current controversy came to light.  I believe it has been initiated far too late, even if it was before the current controversy.  The country has been through approximately 15 years of unprecedented growth, but in that 15 year period I failed to see a commensurate change in the way F&Aacute;S operated.  For much of that time it was operating with virtual full employment in the country.  I am aware F&Aacute;S was involved in trying to attract foreign workers to this country but one cannot say the structures of the organisation have been reformed in any meaningful way during that period.</P>
        <P>Other speakers who have commented on the recent controversies in F&Aacute;S have correctly suggested that many people connected to the F&Aacute;S organisation always point to the good work F&Aacute;S does and use that as a barrier to answering questions about the recent announcements.  I acknowledge that F&Aacute;S does much valuable work.  I have not been particularly involved in F&Aacute;S operations in my local community but I am aware that through the community employment scheme it does tremendous work in local communities throughout the country.  However, I do not believe the community employment scheme should be lumped in with all the other activities in which F&Aacute;S is engaged.  It is not suitable.  There is a significant case for reform in how that service is provided in terms of whether it should be provided by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or the local authorities.  It does not fit in easily with other aspects of the work done by F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Speakers will refer, quite correctly, to the positive work by F&Aacute;S with regard to apprenticeships over the years.  However, the realisation that our construction industry would not continue as it was forever does not appear to have dawned on people in F&Aacute;S in terms of the structure of the apprenticeships that were delivered.  Nevertheless, the apprenticeship scheme has been, by and large, successful.  Many young people have acquired a trade through F&Aacute;S and the schemes it operates in that regard are very worthy.</P>
        <P>The two areas of community employment schemes and apprenticeships account for less than half the funding allocated to F&Aacute;S for the past 12 to 15 years.  Where has the rest of the funding gone?  There have been many stark revelations about wastage, particularly by top management in the organisation.  I will not go into the nitty-gritty details of personal spending by individuals, but major questions have not yet been answered as to the relevant audit conditions in the agency and, in particular, about the role of the board of F&Aacute;S.  It is a social partnership-style board and others, with whom I agree, have said that serious questions arise as to whether those people should remain in the positions they hold at present.  At board level there has been a serious failure to spot several inefficiencies and the sheer waste of money, news of which has emerged in recent weeks.  It is surely the function of the board of any company, especially a State company as the matter concerns taxpayers&rsquo; money, to ensure a level of scrutiny is in place.  Given what we have seen emanating from F&Aacute;S in the recent past, it is clear this was absent.  The entire board should consider their positions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, referred to the resignation of Mr. Molloy, but the board members have a duty to <Col N="560"/>consider their positions also and to consider whether they lived up to the roles to which they were appointed.</P>
        <P>I previously referred to the funding of F&Aacute;S.  For six or seven years there was virtually full employment in the country, yet we invested &euro;1.2 billion in the organisation, much of which was spent on very worthy schemes throughout the country.  However, nearly the majority of it was spent on some very questionable initiatives.  I refer especially to the initiative in Florida.  The extent of the material benefits which accrued to the taxpayer, the Government and the citizens of the country because of the initiative undertaken in Florida are not plain to see.  Rather, I have seen a scandalous waste of public money whereby it was used to ferry individual board members, management and Ministers, who were in a virtual relay for more than a year, to Florida to see the joint effort in which F&Aacute;S was involved.</P>
        <P>On 9 May the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into the internal audits of several State bodies was published.  F&Aacute;S was one of the bodies in question.  Arising from the report, Fine Gael noticed a particular anomaly in the advertising funding and a payment of &euro;100,000 to a local newspaper on which we sought further information through the Freedom of Information Act.  This opened a can of worms which was subsequently revealed in the media and the Oireachtas in recent weeks.  There has been a particular focus on the activities of Mr. Greg Craig, director of corporate affairs, who is now on suspension with full pay from his position in F&Aacute;S.  The report also contained several revelations about senior management, Ministers and bonuses paid to staff.  It contained conflicting statements given to committees of the Oireachtas based on information circulating internally within F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>We have all become familiar in the past two weeks with the level of opulence enjoyed by some of the senior management of the organisation in recent years, including luxury travel.  There was a sense of entitlement felt by some, an example of which was the car crash interview given by the former chief executive on the national radio channel the day before he was virtually forced to resign.  In that interview he expressed his belief that he was entitled to spend taxpayers&rsquo; money willy-nilly and on overly elaborate forms of transport and hotel accommodation.  I am glad he came to his senses the following day and realised he was wrong.  Unfortunately, the money was already spent and it is difficult to see how it can be recouped.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report also dealt with several specific issues related to advertising campaigns and private companies which had contracts with F&Aacute;S under several headings.  It seems to have been standard practice across the board that the regular tendering processes for State agencies and Departments was cast aside in many cases, whether for advertising, companies involved in the F&Aacute;S opportunities scheme or the <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i> initiative.</P>
        <P>It is also apparent that a cosy relationship existed between certain of the senior management in F&Aacute;S and several private institutions and businesses.  An especially cosy arrangement existed between the firm OSK Accountants and Mr. Craig.  It provided private advice to him related to his personal finances while also receiving contracts for business from F&Aacute;S.  In one case the firm received a contract and advised F&Aacute;S about which other organisations should receive tender invitations, which is remarkable.  We are also told that various advertising agencies were aware they would receive contracts before they were tendered.  I am referring specifically to the F&Aacute;S opportunities programme in this regard.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most glaring and obvious abuse of taxpayers&rsquo; money occurred with the <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i> initiative.  First, this website did not work.  It was only accessible for a short period and did not carry out the function for which it was created.  The cost of the website was &euro;1.7 million.  It would be hilarious were we not discussing taxpayers&rsquo; money spent by a State agency.  It is reckoned this project cost &euro;1 million more than necessary.  We also learned of the strange <Col N="561"/>situation whereby a private company, Ultimate Communications, was paid &euro;3.55 million over 12 months by F&Aacute;S for handling the <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i> contract, even though the same company had been in existence for less than ten days when it was awarded the contract.  This raises serious questions.  There were activities involving other marketing companies, namely, AFA O&rsquo;Mara and Kingram Studios Limited, which do not seem to have been subjected to what we would regard as the regular tendering processes applicable to all State agencies and bodies.</P>
        <P>As matters stand, there are several investigations under way into the activities of F&Aacute;S.  I realise the Committee of Public Accounts is meeting regularly to discuss the audit report of F&Aacute;S.  I have expressed on the Order of Business my outrage that when the committee requested particular documents from F&Aacute;S, the company believed it could get away with blacking out information rather than making it available to the elected members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It has since recanted that position, but that was a shocking example of how these people thought they were above questioning by the relevant committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Comptroller and Auditor General will begin his investigation after the Committee of Public Accounts finishes its deliberations.  I understand two Garda investigations related to F&Aacute;S are under way.  One involves a poster company which, it is alleged, defrauded F&Aacute;S and the other relates to F&Aacute;S personnel who, it is alleged, have defrauded the taxpayer.  This is an opportune time to discuss F&Aacute;S and we must consider seriously the structures of the organisation and how to reconcile its different roles.  I am concerned the Government might use this as an excuse to reduce radically funding for the important work of F&Aacute;S.  There is no question the F&Aacute;S budget allocation of &euro;1.2 billion needs to be examined seriously in light of the waste which has been revealed.  At a time when so many apprentices are finding it difficult to finish their apprenticeships and so many people are losing their jobs in construction in particular, the role of F&Aacute;S is more important now than it has been for the past 15 years.  We must ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent in a much more judicious manner in future but also that the important role of F&Aacute;S can be fulfilled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his speech.  There is great disquiet at recent revelations in the media, primarily through the investigations of Senator Shane Ross, concerning activities in the corporate affairs division of F&Aacute;S, especially relating to foreign travel where a massive &euro;643,000 was spent over a short number of years.</P>
        <P>I welcome the board&rsquo;s assurances that action has now been taken to deal with these matters.  F&Aacute;S has done tremendous work at local and community level for many years and it would be a shame to take away from that.  It is important that F&Aacute;S as an organisation remains focused on its core mission, given the current employment situation and the training and retraining challenges facing the country.</P>
        <P>While we can question the unorthodox events that occurred involving a small number of people in the organisation, it must not deflect from the important work F&Aacute;S has done in the past and needs to do now to help people who find themselves in trouble because of the global economic downturn.  The proactive work being done by F&Aacute;S at this time includes the establishment of a training fund to enable a speedy response to retraining needs for low-skilled workers.  F&Aacute;S has done a good job in the area of training and upskilling construction workers and tradesmen.  This must be commended as such workers have been hardest hit by the recent economic downturn.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together to respond quickly to the rising live register figures, which is to be welcomed.  Money must be given as quickly as possible to those who find themselves out of <Col N="562"/>work.  I commend the Minister of State, the Department and F&Aacute;S for working together on this issue.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has initiated a programme to help young apprentices who have been let go mid-apprenticeship to progress to the next level of their training.  Another example of the great work being carried out by F&Aacute;S is its science challenge research training programme for undergraduates at the prestigious Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, in the field of biomedicine.  That programme illustrates how F&Aacute;S is looking to invest and promote careers in Ireland&rsquo;s knowledge economy.  In recent years enormous investment has taken place, particularly in the west, in the biomedicine field.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has more than 2,000 staff and continues to be an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s education and training sector.  It has done much good work, a fact that has been recognised by Members on both sides of the House today.  I look forward to the Comptroller and Auditor General beginning his examination of the effectiveness of management and control systems in F&Aacute;S, once the Committee of Public Accounts has completed its current hearings.  I congratulate that committee on the work done to date.  Had that committee received the information it requested from F&Aacute;S on day one, the current unwarranted publicity might not have fallen so hard on heads in F&Aacute;S.  Had the organisation co-operated with the committee and produced the information requested at the beginning, it might not have featured so heavily in newspaper headlines in recent times.  The media is now examining where every single euro and dollar was spent.  Every day one sees new headlines and, indeed, today&rsquo;s <i>Evening Herald</i> headline refers to a missing car, if I am not mistaken.  If F&Aacute;S had co-operated with the Committee of Public Accounts, the affair would have been dealt with in a much more positive fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted a number of issues of concern relating to F&Aacute;S, including the non-observance of formal internal procurement guidelines, instances of a failure to achieve value for money from advertising and contracts for major events, as well as the need for a clear strategic focus on significant expenditure for new organisational developments.  I look forward to the investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General being completed as quickly as possible to clear up this affair.  As I have said already, F&Aacute;S has done excellent work over the years and it would be a shame to see its focus shifting from its primary function, especially in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State made many positive comments today and I know that both he the T&aacute;naiste are very much on top of the situation.  I am certain this whole affair will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It has taken a long time to get a debate on F&Aacute;S in this House, although it is not for want of trying.  It is an indication of an extraordinary reluctance to tackle this monster that those politicians and others who have sought to ask questions, probe, debate and challenge F&Aacute;S over a number of years have been frustrated by a lack of information and a lack of political interest or enthusiasm.  One must ask why that was so and why we are now debating the issue when admittedly sensational revelations have come out and why it was left not to politicians to ask questions or to answer them, nor for F&Aacute;S to do so.  It is an absolutely extraordinary situation that a State agency, with an extraordinarily high budget, has been sacrosanct, untouched, unchallenged and protected politically for many years.</P>
        <P>It has not been possible to get answers from F&Aacute;S.  Those in power in F&Aacute;S have always been people with close political connections and, therefore, disproportionate power.  I do not say that lightly, but I know it from experience.  It was the Freedom of Information Act which allowed, finally, the release of the information that started to put pressure on those in charge to answer questions they had previously refused to answer.</P><Col N="563"/>
        <P>We must remember that F&Aacute;S, however it may think of itself at the top, is not a Fianna F&aacute;il fiefdom or a political fiefdom of any sort.  It is a State agency dealing with taxpayers&rsquo; money which has refused to come clean on what has been happening to it or how it is being run.  It has been obstructive in providing information and now has to reveal things which should probably never have happened.  We had here a State agency which was completely and utterly out of control.  We now know that.</P>
        <P>I have listened to the points made by Senator Carty and the Minister of State.  I accept the Government must use the defence of the great work that F&Aacute;S does and say that therefore we should not touch it.  That is similar to saying &ldquo;I have the baby in my arms, do not touch me.&rdquo;  It did great work &mdash; it does great work &mdash; but it also has a budget that is impossible to explain and nobody knows what it does with it.  It does much good work, but it also has &euro;1 billion plus and nobody knows where it goes.  There is no point in pretending we do because we do not.  The most extraordinary thing about that budget, as mentioned by Senator John Paul Phelan, is that it was larger, not smaller, at a time of full employment.  It was more than &euro;1 billion in some of the years in which full employment existed in this country.  Nobody has been able to tell me what was happening to that money except under big block headings.</P>
        <P>There is a heading for travel and subsistence with an expenditure of &euro;5.7 million for last year, but there is no explanation of where that went.  One never got an answer to a question if one asked it, and now we know why.  One must ask what is behind all the other figures under these block headings.  We have had examples of a million euro being spent on a computer that does not work.  I came across a website about 18 months ago which was five years out of date.  This agency was a complete shambles &mdash; doing good work on the ground but completely chaotic at the top.  There may have been some good organisation when its members wanted to make their travel arrangements, but it does not appear it could organise anything else particularly well.</P>
        <P>I take no comfort from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  I had hoped that when Mr. Molloy resigned, as he did last week, it would start a process which others would follow.  I hoped the political establishment, which is Fianna F&aacute;il, would come in and say it is time for action; the genie is out of the bottle and we are going to do what needs to be done.  That is not happening.  Let us remember the first reaction to Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s statement, which was very simple.  The Taoiseach came in and tried to give him a leg up.  That was bad judgment, and the Taoiseach came in the next day and dropped him in it.</P>
        <P>However, the normal political reaction is taking over now.  I can see it in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  When stating that the T&aacute;naiste had met some members of the board of F&Aacute;S, he did not tell us which board members.  Perhaps he will elaborate on which ones were there and why they were there.  I suggest it is deliberately vague.  He said that when the T&aacute;naiste met these board members she &ldquo;reiterated her disquiet at the recent revelations concerning activities in the public affairs division of F&Aacute;S.&rdquo;  That statement is a meaningless piece of limp nonsense.  What did she do?  She whined a bit and said &ldquo;We do not like what is going on; off you go.&rdquo;  The Minister of State then stated that the T&aacute;naiste &ldquo;welcomed the board&rsquo;s assurance that action had now been taken to deal with these matters&rdquo;.  That is a pathetic response.  She has done nothing about it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State went on: &ldquo;The board stated that a full examination of past practices is required.&rdquo;  That is the usual trick.  The board is distancing itself by saying &ldquo;past practices&rdquo; as though it has no responsibilities in this area.  How long has that board been in existence?  I am not sure, but it is several years.  The speech continues: &ldquo;to ensure that the organisation can move forward with best practice corporate governance procedures in place&rdquo;.  There are no governance procedures in place as far as I can see.  Every corporate governance procedure in <Col N="564"/>the book has been broken and now they are saying they need to do something about it.  The T&aacute;naiste, at the meeting last week, made it clear that she wanted the F&Aacute;S organisation &ldquo;to remain focused on its core mission&rdquo;.  I have never in this House heard such clich&eacute;d nonsense.  It means nothing.  &ldquo;She expressed her support for the continuing work of the board in that regard.&rdquo;  That is exactly what the board has not been doing.</P>
        <P>What the Minister ought to have done was to make the board accountable.  There is only one question the board should have been asked.  Did its members know about the complete chaos that existed in spending at the top of F&Aacute;S?  These expenses are not the only thing.  There is lots more.  If they did know, they ought to resign on the spot because they should not have allowed it.  It was completely unacceptable and out of control, and the checks and balances were chaotic.  If they did not know about it, they ought to resign because they should have known.</P>

	<P>Instead of that the Minister has said &ldquo;Good lads, I see you are not going to let it happen again; I am pretty pleased with what you are doing, so off you go.&rdquo;  There are at least two members of that board &mdash; I do not want to be in any way vindictive &mdash; who are deeply compromised and have a lot of explaining to do about their travel.  Did the Minister ask them about that or did she just say, as is the normal political reaction, that the Government should let them go, protect them and hope for the best?</P>
        <P>These boards are fundamentally flawed.  Their members, who are all politically appointed, have a particular agenda.  If they do any work at all, they are well paid &mdash; salaries last year on the board of F&Aacute;S were &euro;14,000 for each member and &euro;25,000 for the chairman, and they probably gave themselves an increase this year.  The board is dominated by four trade union representatives and four employers&rsquo; representatives.  I would have thought that people who have risen to the top of trade unions such as ICTU and IBEC, most of the latter of whom have not done a day&rsquo;s work in industry in their lives as they have always been involved with IBEC, would be capable of examining practices at the top, taking a forensic look at what was going on and asking the right questions.  However, it is perfectly obvious they were not doing that.  It is obvious that these guys were sitting at the top doing one piece of work a month and taking their salaries.  They ought to have been dismissed.  They ought to have been asked to fall on their swords because they are responsible for this extravagance.  They are responsible for overseeing expenditure and they did not do so.</P>
        <P>It should also be pointed out that the chairman of the board rotates.  One session it is IBEC &mdash; I do not know how long it is for &mdash; and the next session it is ICTU.  What is going on?  Why in the name of God should the social partners be in charge of a State agency?</P>

	<P>Why can we not have people who know about this area and have a forensic or career interest in it, or a mixture of people with different skills?  These guys are members of one club, we all know that.  They go up to Government Buildings every few years, cook up some pay deal and then sit back, organising social partnership boards left, right and centre.  That is not the only board with the social partners on it.  These directorships are gigs, they are jobs for the boys, they are their rewards.  F&Aacute;S is not the only board &mdash; there are dozens of them &mdash; where they pick &euro;10,000, &euro;12,000 or &euro;14,000 a year.  If one is in the right place in ICTU and IBEC, one is given one of the gigs.  It is a wonderful set-up but it does not make for good board membership and it does not make for accountability.  </P><Col N="565"/>
        <P>There are some very strange ironies and some very sad aspects to this story.  That F&Aacute;S is a jobs creation agency and that it should be overspending money on luxuries is sad and ironic.  That it intended to move to Birr, County Offaly, begs questions, not so much about the Taoiseach but the coincidence of it moving to Birr, County Offaly, and the chief executive coming from Birr, County Offaly, is something which deserves to be challenged and questioned.</P>

Bh&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht maidir le F&Aacute;S ag teast&aacute;il uainn le tamall fada, sar a thosaigh an chonsp&oacute;id seo ar chor ar bith.

Gan F&Aacute;S, n&iacute;l aon amhras faoi ach nach mbeadh an seans c&eacute;anna ag daoine &aacute;irithe sa saol &mdash; bheid&iacute;s go m&oacute;r i gcruach&aacute;s.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  Senator Ross was not the only person who sought a debate in the House on F&Aacute;S.  On many occasions, I requested that debate, as did Senator Ormonde and, I am sure, many other Members.  Many of those requests preceded the present controversy.  The reason for such a debate is the importance of F&Aacute;S to the employment environment in this country, or perhaps, one should say, to the unemployment environment in this country.  We were also very much aware that a significant budget was provided for F&Aacute;S.  I think the organisation would be disappointed if a debate did not take place in the Oireachtas on a fairly regular basis.  Each morning on the Order of Business there are requests for as many as 20 debates on different issues and some materialise while others do not.  We are here in this House precisely to call for debates.</P>
        <P>The fact that the controversy has taken place and in many ways has taken over the whole issue of F&Aacute;S does not mean that in some way we should focus only on the controversy.  I do not accept that to talk about the basics of F&Aacute;S in some way is an attempt to create a barrier in terms of debating the main issue of the controversy.  I do not accept that the Minister of State was in any way out of line in asking that we would focus on the core mission of F&Aacute;S.  If we do not focus on the core mission of F&Aacute;S and we are talking of &euro;1 billion, what exactly are we aiming at in any debate that takes place?</P>
        <P>For instance, if one were on board a ship and it sprung a leak, of course one would endeavour to do something about the leak, but one would also have to consider all the other people on board.  One has a duty to give them confidence, to calm them, to direct them.  That is precisely the reason that on several occasions on the Order of Business since this controversy started, I have focused on the role, the success and the mission of F&Aacute;S down through the years.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to spend a lot of time speaking about the controversy because it has taken up miles and miles of column inches and has been predominant on much of the broadcasting services.  The issues in question are being dealt with in a professional manner.  This was one of my requests on the Order of Business, that any issues that come forward should be dealt with in an accountable and professional manner.  The Committee of Public Accounts will deal with the matter, as will the Comptroller and Auditor General, and I am confident the Department and the Cabinet will also deal with it.  In many ways we are prejudging the outcome of those examinations.  It is very easy to say this or that happened and we have information as a result of the Freedom of Information Act, and so be it, but the issues are much more implanted than that and they have to be dealt with comprehensively.</P><Col N="566"/>
        <P>The one danger I saw in all this was that if we did not focus on the mission, the role, the success and the potential of F&Aacute;S, we would do danger to the vehicle which we need at a time of rising unemployment, which is nearly 7%.  We are all aware of the international credit crisis, the global crisis.  We spent a whole night here in this Chamber discussing the guarantee to the banks and so far we have been proved right in the approach to that crisis, but that approach was not taken without a lot of thought and advice, much of it given very quietly but it was very focused.</P>
        <P>The people who will suffer if F&Aacute;S suffers in the current debate will not be the people at the top, it will be the people in every local community in this country.  Senator Ross has been praised for the good work he did but when I was discussing F&Aacute;S prior to the present controversy, I never saw Senator Ross standing up and focusing on the good work it did.  He has been doing that in the media and he did it today and recently, but in the early discussions on F&Aacute;S, he was totally focused on a different issue.</P>
        <P>I questioned who would speak about the vulnerable people on the ground.  I hope that I would be one of those.  Such young people needed help and F&Aacute;S provided it.  Thousands and thousands of people were placed in jobs as a result of training by F&Aacute;S.  Each time a local company or a local industry closed, the first call was always to F&Aacute;S to step in with fire brigade action and to show that something was being done.  It provided training and opportunities for new employment.  That was in the past and it is much more needed in the present.  It has been suggested that because the Minister of State comes into the House today and tells us what is being done for redundant apprentices and tells us what will be done when companies close down and about evening classes and retraining, in some way this is not relevant, simply because we are discussing the controversy only.  I am delighted the Minister of State came forward with practical information.  My hope is that when the dust settles, the structure of F&Aacute;S will be still intact.  There is not a region in this country where F&Aacute;S has not done outstanding work.</P>
        <P>The question was asked as to the reason F&Aacute;S had a bigger budget in a time of full employment.  The reason was that F&Aacute;S picked up all the work that had to be done at community level.  If F&Aacute;S is taken away from all those schemes, whether it is sports fields, community centres or whatever else, and is not allowed to continue its work, I assure the House that volunteerism will be dealt a deadly blow.  People who are not able to go into mainstream employment have been kept on through F&Aacute;S schemes.  What would happen to them otherwise?  They would be sent to the local labour exchange.  How much does keeping them on with F&Aacute;S save the State?  Up to &euro;30 a week per person.  The small people &mdash; I do not mean that in a derogatory sense &mdash; always get lost in this type of debate while the big people will be centre stage.  Those thousands of small people must be remembered in these debates.</P>
        <P>Even though we must have proper governance and accountability in semi-State agencies, the Minister of State pointed out that before there was ever any controversy, the Government had already worked with F&Aacute;S to initiate an analysis of its role.  This did not come lately.  I hope there will be further debates on F&Aacute;S and this is not just a one-off.  As well as examining the activities of a few, we must also praise the 98% of F&Aacute;S employees who have served this nation and State well.  They are the people working in the community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Acting Chairman.  In the course of those cases I never came across anybody senior in the organisation or in corporate affairs.  I am not familiar or have any knowledge in respect of any of those corporate matters that have been exercising us, and certainly Senator Shane Ross, in recent weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator always exercised the utmost care and caution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I will refer to the expenses controversy later.</P>
        <P>I am in considerable agreement with Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the general role of F&Aacute;S.  Aside from that, I do not agree with him that the decision on the banks has proved to be successful but that is for another day&rsquo;s debate.  The jury is very much out on this question and it has not been resolved as is evident with the grinding to a halt of any credit available for small businesses.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest to the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to learn about the real role of F&Aacute;S.  We are all aware we are in a serious economic crisis.  On 15 October the House had statements on unemployment.  When I rose to make my contribution then, I complained that the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech did not seek to address the jobs crisis and the growing problem of unemployment.  I invited my colleagues on the other side of the House, and the Minister of State, to show me anything that was new in that speech.  It was tacitly accepted there was nothing new.</P>
        <P>Today, I was listening with heightened interest to learn if there would be anything new in this speech.  I accept the Minister of State is dealing with the specific area of F&Aacute;S and the question of job creation and the Government&rsquo;s economic policy extends further than F&Aacute;S.  However, the Minister of State claimed &ldquo;the Government is putting measures in place to ensure those who become unemployed are provided with effective employment service and training supports.&rdquo;  He also referred to the increased budget allocations provided to F&Aacute;S, an additional &euro;5 million for training the unemployed and an additional &euro;4 million to subsidise redundant apprentices in 2009.  Whereas I am not suggesting these points were made in the debate in October, they seem not to include anything new in the past six weeks.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has said Ireland is in a dire crisis.  The people look to the Government to come forward with proposals as to how we can address this.  There is no sign of the Minister of State or the Government doing this.  From his speech today, there is no evidence, with all respect to the Minister of State, of anything new being presented to us regarding the deepening employment crisis, which all commentators agree will get worse in early 2009.  I accept the Minister of State can criticise me for not resisting the opportunity to make a political point.  The Government announced last week some initiative on research and development.  When can we expect a plan from the Government?  When can we expect direction and policies from the Government to address the unemployment crisis?  Will it be next week or in January?  Will it ever come?</P>
        <P>It is not just the case that unemployment is rising but the type of unemployment.  A few days ago David Begg of the ICTU pointed out that unemployment is biting at the new services industries, such as financial services, legal and architecture, that have located in Ireland in the past 12 years and account for much of the expansion in employment.  There are large numbers of young people in their 20s and 30s, highly trained and educated, who are losing their jobs.  I am not arguing that the Minister of State can employ them all but what I am looking for is some sense of initiative, urgency and concrete proposals from the Government.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is carrying out a review into the efficiency and effectiveness of labour market programmes delivered by F&Aacute;S and Skillnets from which a new labour market strategy will be completed by the middle of 2009.  That is too far away &mdash; up to six months.  It is not good enough.  This issue does <Col N="568"/>not appear to be treated with a sufficient level of urgency given the ferocity of the problem with unemployment.</P>
        <P>I am sure there will be a measure of political co-operation across the board in the event of a serious economic crisis.  However, we look to the Government in the first place to come forward with the proposals.  It is not happening.  I hope it will happen sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>The issue that has given rise to this debate being ordered by the Leader is the controversy over expenses.  I agree with Senator Shane Ross in criticising the Minister of State and the lead Minister, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Minister of State said, &ldquo;The T&aacute;naiste last week met the chairman and some board members of F&Aacute;S and reiterated her disquiet at the recent revelations concerning activities in the public affairs division of F&Aacute;S.&rdquo;  I presume that means the expenses controversy.  It would be nice if that had been said in the speech or if we could have clarity on what was meant by &ldquo;activities in the public affairs division of F&Aacute;S&rdquo;.  Unless corrected, I will assume that means the expenses controversy.  It would be great if we could call it as it is so that we know we are talking about the same issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also said: &ldquo;However, the T&aacute;naiste welcomed the board&rsquo;s assurance that action had now been taken to deal with these matters.&rdquo;  We must not forget that the question of expenses is not at a remove from the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  It is absurd that the Minister would go through expense claims for a State agency but there is a clear responsibility under the Labour Services Act, which states that the remuneration and expenses of staff in F&Aacute;S must be approved by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance.  This also applies to the board of F&Aacute;S, as made clear by section 7 of that Act and the Schedule to the Act.  The Minister has a direct role, not an arm&rsquo;s length role.  There is some dancing around this issue, including in the speech of the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>The figures published and the documentation Senator Ross so assiduously acquired through the freedom of information application demonstrate that more than &euro;642,000 had been spent on flights to North America in the period since 2003.  The details of this are well known so I will not relate them again.  Does the Minister of State think this is unacceptable?  It is a simple question.  Aside from references to having meetings with the chairman, getting reassurances and examining matters, will the Minister of State tell the House whether that level of expenditure to Orlando and other places is unacceptable?  There is a legal responsibility on the Minister of State to have a role.  What is his belief, given that his role is to have a view?</P>
        <P>Senator Ross rightly has been praised for his work.  It is meant as no criticism of him but he unearthed these figures in his capacity as an experienced and expert journalist.  It did not occur through these Houses.  Last week, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Dr. Brian Hunt referred to the limitations that exist in respect of scrutiny in these Houses.  The Committee of Public Accounts can operate only when a report is brought forward by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The committee cannot initiate its own investigations of these matters.  It is unfortunate that either we have the Comptroller and Auditor General publishing a report that the Committee of Public Accounts investigates or I, Senator Ross or someone else can complain about it on the Order of Business.  There is nothing in between.  We must examine this again but perhaps it is for another day.  There is a need for these Houses to examine the means by which these issues can be dealt with, exposed, identified and debated.  Otherwise we are not doing the job we were sent here to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have sought many times for this opportunity to debate the role of F&Aacute;S, although we have had debates on the role of the agency previously.  I compliment Senator Ross on bringing this to the forefront through his journalistic professionalism.  There were unaccountable practices in the administration of F&Aacute;S that were a <Col N="569"/>waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  It was deplorable that this should have happened and it has distracted from the real role and mission of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>I knew much about F&Aacute;S in another stage of my life when I was in the education world.  Its role and vision was to identify employment blackspots.  That was its core area.  Then it was to match the blackspots with training and to seek opportunities for job creation.  It was to identify skills to be used in other job areas.  They were the core areas, as I understood.  Fine work was done by many people at local level on those core areas.  I compliment the 90% of the workforce of F&Aacute;S that knew what it had to do and did it.</P>
        <P>I also believe that F&Aacute;S had not been involved in job creation in recent years, mainly because of the belief that there was full employment, and that the agency&rsquo;s role had changed to one of filling gaps.  I say that with knowledge.  It was holding courses and programmes that would not have been relevant at any time and were fillers to flesh out programmes.  This was often of concern to me in recent years.  Now that the construction industry has slowed down, I welcome the notion that F&Aacute;S would revisit its role and become involved with redundant apprentices, decide how to cope with them and lay on programmes for them.  That could be done simply and I hope F&Aacute;S does so through its training and education programmes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
        <P LI="1">In addressing the issue of redundancies, F&Aacute;S liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, city and county enterprise boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome that but it is extraordinary that in talking about a training agency, there is no mention of education.  I do not understand why city and county vocational education committees are not in a position to help out at a time like this.  Programmes should be co-ordinated.  I accept that F&Aacute;S organises apprenticeships and I welcome the new approach to off-the-job continuation of programmes and training.  This is desirable.  However, many of these young people left school at 15 years of age because they did not want to go further.  Perhaps that was five years ago and now that they are more mature, there may be opportunities for them to revisit the education world.  They may wish to revisit other upskilling areas rather than the crafts in which they have been trained.  We are here to discuss rethinking, restructuring and reforming F&Aacute;S because we want to see the vision for the future of the agency.  It must change.  We are into new information communications and other technologies and research and development.  The job will change and the future of work will change.  There will be more flexibility in the job scene.  Has F&Aacute;S thought of these elements?  The here and now is very important in terms of those who lost their jobs and those with low skills.  We must upskill and reskill them and examine the opportunities.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the consultation process, the scale of redundancies and the skills profile of employees.  He also talked about the number of years they have worked and the level of education.  He brought in the word &ldquo;education.&rdquo;  I would like to see the people who will do the consultation linking in with the guidance counsellors of the education system in the communities.  Wherever there is a F&Aacute;S centre those involved should liaise with the local community schools or vocational schools.  They will have a golden opportunity to link up programmes.  One module of the programme could be done in the school and one in the F&Aacute;S area.  Let us have more global thinking because that is where the future of work lies.  It is not just a matter of retraining or upskilling; there must be more to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a golden opportunity.  We have discovered what went wrong with F&Aacute;S.  We acknowledge great work is being done on the ground there.  We will get it right.  The Minister <Col N="570"/>acknowledges that.  Let us return to the core and the mission of F&Aacute;S, retrain, liaise with the educational system, bring rounded people into work and not just fulfil separate education and training roles.  We are talking about global thinking and a global concept.  We should be able to do this, ensure continuity of the training programme and bring it into the steadfast way of how we deal with the future of the world at work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister; we are glad he has taken the time to come here and have this debate.  I congratulate Senator Ross on his tenacity in continuing to pursue this issue along with Fine Gael.  Fine Gael consistently warned that the F&Aacute;S mismanagement and waste would lead to disaster.  Deputy Bruton was tireless in his warnings, which were arrogantly ignored.  It is more of the out-of-touch governance of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government.  Despite the strength of the economy and the near to full employment, when there was very little need to upskill or train unemployed people, F&Aacute;S spent more than it is spending this year.  It was ensuring there were enough plumbers and electricians to meet the needs of the construction industry and the developers.</P>
        <P>Thousands of people are unemployed and, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, unemployment has reached 7%, which is a very frightening figure.  Most of the lost jobs are in the construction and manufacturing industries.  Now more than ever it is vital that F&Aacute;S be on the ball and that the poor, unfortunate people who are losing their jobs will have the chance to upskill and get the training they need.  I have raised a matter on the Adjournment debate about a study that shows exactly how unskilled our workforce is.  There is a very serious, proven need for significant retraining and upskilling.</P>
        <P>The reason for this debate is the controversy, but many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have been raising the issue of F&Aacute;S for months.  What concerns me most is the deafening silence of the board members.  Their silence must mean they are guilty, because there is not a word from them.  Were they not on the ball?  I, like the Cathaoirleach, have been a member of many voluntary boards.  One receives financial statements annually, if not biannually.  As the responsible, accountable public representative I hope I am, I would be aware of what was going on and how money was being spent.  Like the other Senators, I question the make up of these boards and the political cronyism.  It is sickening.  The senior management and corporate affairs people of F&Aacute;S seem to have been hiving off the money and squandering it.  In my local community I am aware of the less salubrious offices of my wonderful friends, of whom I have many, in F&Aacute;S.  I am aware of how they work and fulfil their duties and they do not spend the amounts of money senior management has spent in the past.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that, as Senator Feeney said, the agency&rsquo;s IT department was bypassed in the setting up of the jobs website, to the cost of &euro;1.7 million.  We all have websites and know how little it costs to set one up.  The irony of it was that the website did not even work.  Why does F&Aacute;S, or any Government or public body, need to have its conferences and meetings in places such as the K Club or other very salubrious organisations and hotels?  Within a two week period F&Aacute;S spent &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000 on a banquet.  Who was invited to these banquets?  What was the need?  Last year 40,000 people went through F&Aacute;S retraining schemes.  That seems a very small number of people.</P>
        <P>The land for new decentralised headquarters in Birr cost &euro;1.5 million, and since the budget, decentralisation has been stalled.  F&Aacute;S has leased high-spec offices in a business centre in Birr as temporary headquarters, costing &euro;15,000 per month.  Fitting out of the offices cost &euro;1 million and a board room table cost &euro;11,000, yet the headquarters houses only one receptionist.  What will happen to the proposed headquarters in Birr?</P><Col N="571"/>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has been given a mandate to investigate what is going on and I hope that will happen.  I am pleased Mr. Molloy has taken up the invitation of the Chairman, Deputy Allen, to attend the Committee of Public Accounts, however the Comptroller and Auditor General needs a new mandate to carry out its duty to ensure no further money is misspent.  This begs the question about all the other public bodies that are chaired and managed by boards which are elected through political cronyism. I question how taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent in the other organisations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also question the Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coughlan.  The buck stops with her.  She has been very quiet and has said very little on the matter.  In his speech the Minister said he looks forward to the board&rsquo;s proposals on how Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s position can be filled.  I have no faith in a board which has been so silent for so long and which has neglected its responsibility.  It has a duty to the people it serves, the vulnerable and unemployed of this country.  The Minister said he has faith in the board.  He could not possibly have faith.  I ask him to re-jig his conscience and think about how he can have faith in a board that has been silent about so much money that has been spent so badly and wasted.  This is mismanagement, but not by the people on the ground.  F&Aacute;S offers a fantastic hairdressing programme, open door and IT upskilling.  F&Aacute;S is fantastic on the ground, and the staff work in less than salubrious surroundings.  It is not fair that we label all those hard-working people with this.  It is mismanagement and is down to political guidance.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, I have to make sure that money is spent properly.  I consider that is our responsibility and I hope that people will be held accountable.  I welcome the fact that Mr. Molloy will come before the committee but there must be answers and heads must roll.  People will have to be responsible and answer for this mismanagement.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to make statements on F&Aacute;S.  To put my statement in context, F&Aacute;S is an extremely important agency in this State and, given the economic downturn, its role will be all the more important for this State.  It is our national training and employment authority.  It has had an overseas budget of &euro;1 billion and an advertising budget of &euro;9 million to date.  It is charged with anticipating the needs of the 2 million strong labour force in Ireland.  It operates training and employment programmes, a recruitment service to jobseekers and employers and an advisory service for industry, and it supports community-based enterprises.  It is divided into eight regions.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have done, I pay tribute to the very good work F&Aacute;S does on the ground.  It runs some excellent courses and provides important services, both for jobseekers and employers, and it should be commended on that, but in view of the downturn, its role will become all the more important and critical, given some of the challenges we will face in the coming years, particularly in the area of retraining and upskilling unemployed workers.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the additional &euro;5 million allocated for the training of the unemployed and the additional &euro;4 million that will subsidise the employment of redundant apprentices in 2009.  I welcome also the fact that there is a clear policy in place to deal with redundancies and company closures.</P>
        <P>I suggest that an emerging green economy could provide an excellent opportunity for F&Aacute;S in terms of the types of programmes and retraining opportunities it would provide for people who find themselves unemployed.  For example, there will be a major emphasis on insulating buildings, energy efficiency and retrofitting old buildings.  Many individuals could be trained to carry out that important work.  There is a growing public demand for the installation of alternative energy heating systems and we need to train the required number of people to do that.  There are major opportunities in that area.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P>In the area of recycling, we are aware that recycling markets are collapsing around the world and we find, as a country that has been used to exporting many of our materials for recycling, we are having to store that material here.  We should examine the possibility of developing indigenous recycling industries where we can provide both training and employment opportunities in those emerging industries.  These are areas on which F&Aacute;S should concentrate in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I would not like to miss the opportunity, because the public expect it of us, of commenting on the recent controversy that has erupted regarding what one might call the expenses scandal in F&Aacute;S.  It is disappointing and concerning to see the information that has come into the public domain about spending practices in F&Aacute;S.  When we talk about spending practices we mean, as other speakers have pointed out, taxpayers&rsquo; money that has been spent in a way that can only be judged as extravagant and unacceptable.</P>
        <P>We hear of stories about first-class flights that on occasion were not cancelled when the Government jet was used instead.  We hear about golf trips to Florida, beauty salon treatments, fine dining and chauffeur driven cars.  That is a world away from the world of F&Aacute;S trainees and apprentices and it appears to suggest, particularly at the top level of F&Aacute;S, that there was a loss of focus on the management of F&Aacute;S.  There is a sense that people imagined they were working somewhere else and had these expense accounts that they could run up without any real thought about the implications for taxpayers of having their money spent in this way, rather than on what was supposed to be the organisation&rsquo;s core responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The details of that lavish spending have caused outrage among the public.  Senator Shane Ross must be congratulated on the investigative work he did to uncover the evidence of that inappropriate and extravagant spending.  It was pointed out that &euro;5.7 million of public money was spent in 2007 alone.  When that figure is broken down, that is the equivalent of more than &euro;2,500 on travel and subsistence claims for each of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s 2,200 staff.  A total of &euro;643,000 was spent on transatlantic travel in the past four years.  Questions must be asked about that.  The F&Aacute;S science Florida programme has attracted about 60 students a year since 2003.  Many of those programmes lasted for ten days, yet when we examine much of the transatlantic travel, we see it was to Florida.  We must question the value for money that was provided for the taxpayers of the country.</P>
        <P>Last week, the chief executive of F&Aacute;S resigned.  It is the view of the Green Party that that was right and proper action for the chief executive.  He had to take responsibility for the disclosures that were coming out on spending within the organisation.  I welcome the fact that Mr. Molloy will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is right and proper.  However, it is the view of the Green Party that the F&Aacute;S board should consider its position at this point.  Governance and oversight of the organisation has been very unsatisfactory and for that reason the board members should consider their positions.</P>
        <P>It is realistic to expect that the media and public focus will now move to other public bodies and there will be similar scrutiny of the spending practices in many semi-State agencies and bodies.  I hope those agencies and bodies will be willing to have their expense and spending practices subject to an open audit.  That will be necessary to bolster public confidence and I hope all information will be provided.  It should not be left to people to make expensive freedom of information requests to access that information.</P>
        <P>Our conduct as public representatives will also be under scrutiny in terms of our expenditure and expenses.  We need to be as fully transparent as possible and show that we are using taxpayers&rsquo; money in a responsible way, particularly in these difficult times when we are calling <Col N="573"/>on the public generally to tighten their belts, be much more frugal and accept the cutbacks that will be inevitable in the coming years.</P>
        <P>We should consider a major efficiencies and cost saving drive across the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we do that in a time when we are calling on the public to live with the cutbacks and the much tighter fiscal position in which we find ourselves, we will have much greater credibility.  All of us should be seen to tighten our belts and live up to the same standards we are asking of other people.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I may not need all that time, but then I frequently say that and find I have not quite finished within the time.</P>
        <P>This is an important debate.  My colleague and friend, Senator Ross, has called for this debate over a considerable period of years.  In some instances I have agreed with him, in particular some years ago when he proposed, and I seconded, a motion to examine the vexed question of political nominees to State boards.  That was an important element and it is one of the matters highlighted in this debate.  We also felt, when the Trinity Bill was being debated in the House, there was sometimes a danger in overloading important boards with State nominees.  However, on a previous occasion a number of years ago when Senator Ross raised the matter of F&Aacute;S I took a slightly different view because I felt it was important to frontload the important work the organisation was doing.  I did so at the time because I was living in a position of considerable privilege in the north inner city and I was aware the unemployment level in the area was 85%, which is staggering.  When I presented this statistic to members of the European Commission in Brussels during a visit sponsored by Mr. Brendan Halligan, they refused to believe it and they sent officials to discover whether this could be true.  Areas of Dublin some years ago had levels of unemployment higher than Naples.  I was involved in the work F&Aacute;S did through the James Joyce Centre, which could not have continued to operate without the organisation&rsquo;s assistance.  Every single penny was accounted for at that level and that casts into some relief the squandering of money but that needs to be nuanced as well.</P>
        <P>In the current climate, it is comparatively easy for radio programmes and popular newspapers to stir up partially justified outrage but moderation and accuracy are also needed.  For example, Fine Gael has made a meal out of this.  I often agree with the party but I was not terribly impressed by the performance of Deputy Varadkar on radio, except for his theatrical propensity, which I admire.  He got Deputy Harney&rsquo;s name wrong and he called for the resignation of Deputy Mary Hanafin several times.  That was not corrected but perhaps everybody knew who he was talking of, although that does not suggest the remorseless attention to detail he requires of other people.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> got the year wrong, which was corrected subsequently.  A radio reporter accused the Green Party, so ably represented in the House by Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca, of putting out a statement of support, which apparently did not happen.  These are three instances of inaccuracy, which one would not expect of people who had long prepared an attack on certain levels of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I mentioned the matter of representation on the F&Aacute;S board.  The chairman is Peter McLoone, former president of the ICTU.  Perhaps I should not name these people, even though this has been done widely.  The board also comprises representatives of the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science, Finance and Social and Family Affairs, the trade union sector and employers, including a representative of one of the largest and most successful builders in the country.  Is that appropriate?  Certain people have objected to the involvement of the social partners but the same people, mostly on this side of the House, object to the whole idea of social partnership.  I do not but I understand their reserve.  It is a highly <Col N="574"/>principled position to take because they refer to the short-circuiting of the parliamentary process.  However, they have a wide representative capacity and they have what Gerry Adams used to call their mandate and it would ill behove Members who were elected with a small number of votes on the basis of delegated universal suffrage to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What I say is accurate.</P>
        <P>As a result of a series of investigations, the Committee of Public Accounts is examining the issues.  The newspaper controversy has in a valuable way highlighted the inadequacies of the committee system, for example, the lack of compellability.  Unless there is a serious constitutional problem, the committee should have the power to compel witnesses.  It is absurd that a courageous journalist must spend such an amount on the information that could not be obtained by the PAC.  The previous Government through Mr. McCreevy introduced swingeing costs under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and a five-year moratorium on certain Government information.  This was criticised last weekend by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, who stated in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, &ldquo;Before the fees, a journalist could simply rattle a request off from his [I am surprised she did not say &lsquo;or her&rsquo;] desk, whereas now the additional red tape of getting the fee puts many of them off, as is proven in the drop-off in requests,&rdquo;.   The newspaper was charged &euro;2,500 for the requests.</P>
        <P>The net effect of the series of investigations was that Mr. Molloy was forced to resign.  That will cost the taxpayer &euro;500,000 in severance payments, &euro;35,000 a year and God knows how much else, including the cost of replacing him.  I have consistently spoken passionately about the destruction of the Combat Poverty Agency and the humiliation and neutering of the Irish Human Rights Commission but another damaging blow has been struck against F&Aacute;S during a period when unemployment is on the increase.  This also raises questions about the decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>There has not been a great saving.  Senator Ross has done the State some service.  He is courageous because he has trodden on a considerable number of important toes, which is a dangerous exercise.  He has become a whistleblower.  I am not bothered by the bill for hair, <Col N="575"/>which is rubbish.  People should read the letter written by the senior Irish diplomat, Mr. Michael Lillis, who indicated the significance of what was achieved in Florida and he also put on the record his considerable admiration for Mr. Molloy.  In the context of balance and fairness, during recent high level negotiations when Ireland had the Presidency of the European Union, Mr. Molloy engaged in a great deal of high-flown entertaining on behalf of the country, for which he paid out of his own pocket.  In fairness to this man, about whom I know very little, he committed suicide on radio by saying he was entitled to flights and by making two contradictory statements, which were that he needed to fly first class in order to arrive fresh and to be downgraded to bring his wife with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  How he takes this issue forward will be critical for the nation in the context of the message he sends to the public.  Not one of us would be present if we did not serve a public.  I am disgusted by the recent revelations concerning F&Aacute;S because, like everyone else, I am familiar with the work the organisation does in our communities, which I have admired, through CE schemes and so on.  What this has shown me is the sickness in the system, a sickness over which the Government is presiding.  Senator Ross has done the State a huge service, as has Fine Gael for standing on principled positions until this was outed.  I cannot justify &euro;640,000 being spent on travel junkets in the past four years and the Committee of Public Accounts must investigate whether this spending was valid.  I read in last weekend&rsquo;s <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that &euro;240 was spent by a senior executive in F&Aacute;S to travel from Terenure to Kildare Street.  My God.  Who is this person, what does he do and who does he think he is?  It is an outrage to spend &euro;240 for what is probably a &euro;20 taxi ride.</P>
        <P>With regard to the exorbitant spending on the trips to Florida, since when did we get into space travel?  I have not heard of the outputs in terms of missions or astronauts.  Do they exist?  If so, the Minister of State should tell us about them and what we got out of this.  Is it more than we put into it in terms of all this expensive travel, wining and dining at the K Club and all this rubbish that is not needed but is going on?</P>
        <P>The public outrage was only right and proper when Mr. Molloy went on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  Was there any apology by Mr. Molloy?  I have not heard it.  Does his resignation make everything right?  In my view, it does not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad he is coming before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I remember him saying that he broke no rules.  This is the worry.  If he broke no rules, the rules need to be changed.  It reminds me of the interview by the former Commissioner, Mr. P&aacute;draig Flynn, on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo;, when he spoke about how difficult it was for him to manage X number of houses and housekeepers.  It shows how out of touch these people are.  He went on to say he was right because he was not breaking the rules.</P>
        <P>This spending is morally wrong but it is part of a system &mdash; it is systemic.  What does it tell us about the system?  It tells us this is a culture that exists at senior management level in the public service.  How does this make good public servants, who this State badly needs, feel?  It is all wrong.  This behaviour needs to be cleaned up and, if necessary, cleaned out.  Nothing is more likely to grow cynicism among the public than the abuse of money intended for the training of those who are currently unemployed, who in many respects are those most at risk due to their skillset.</P>
        <P>I think of the drug rehabilitation project Senator Buttimer and I, with a number of other Senators, visited in the Liberties.  The people involved, who were unemployable anywhere else, were learning to recycle clothes and going back to school in this work-based learning project <Col N="576"/>supported by F&Aacute;S.  It was really good work at ground level but it has been demeaned by this behaviour at the top.  I learned in history that there were plebs and patricians &mdash; that was the caste system.  It looks like we have a caste system in Ireland, of which we must get rid.  We in Fine Gael will stick with this until we get rid of it.</P>
        <P>I have some personal admiration for the Minister of State, particularly because he stays in the House for the entire debate.  I expect to see him stand over this until the matter is finished for the good of the nation.  If we do not act to change this culture, we further grow dishonesty and the view that this sick culture is the only way to get things done.  It is a very poor example for young people.  I have young people in my family and know this makes it very difficult for families to rear young people with any sense of morality and civic contribution.  I just brought a tour of young people into the D&aacute;il bar for soft drinks.  One of those 15-year olds said to me, &ldquo;Is the taxpayer paying for all this?&rdquo;  I was paying but this is the message they are getting, which sickens me.  Why do young people go out and do wrong?  It is because this is the example that is being passed on.</P>
        <P>The other difficulty is that these actions are tarring everyone with the one brush, which is not fair.  Actions like this do a disservice to good public servants, who are so needed.  Such actions demean the valuable work done at ground level by F&Aacute;S in the community employment schemes.  We are at the point where this brings into question the very existence of F&Aacute;S itself, and begs the question of whether this work should be done by other agencies such as regional institutes of technology, a suggestion which has also been put to me by the public.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  It is clear things need to change.  This type of behaviour would strongly suggest that State boards are flawed and have to be cleaned up and cleaned out.  It is clear the way appointments are made is questionable and needs to change.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The only questions that should be asked when a person is being appointed are what can each member of a board contribute to the organisation and will they add value.  Does the Minister of State realise people are willing to be voluntary appointees of boards without any allowance or expenses?  I was a director of the Galway Airport board, where I was glad to contribute.  There are many more like me.  If they do not want to do it without an allowance or expenses, perhaps they are not needed.</P>
        <P>On a broader note, no public service senior management role should be automatically rewarded with annual bonuses.  All bonuses should be earned and only paid retrospectively based on outputs and outcomes achieved.  It is for that reason I want to know what the taxpayer has got in return for all the money expended on the space expedition.  It is true there are many in the public service who are enterprising but sometimes the permanent, pensionable job acts as a de-motivator for them.  I have no difficulty with them getting a bonus as long as their work <Col N="577"/>is serving the nation and of value to it.  The Minister of State needs to act.  What he must do is not rocket science.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for a fine contribution.  This debate is necessary and welcome.  It is not about personalities, hair cuts and washes, foreign travel or the appointees of Government to State boards; it is about leadership.  In this case, it is about lack of leadership, bad management and lack of accountability and transparency.</P>
        <P>As Senator Healy Eames asked, have we heard an apology to the Irish people for the abuse of taxpayers&rsquo; money and the lack of accountability?  Have we drawn a line in the proverbial sand because Mr. Molloy has resigned and, as Senator Healy Eames said, it is over?  It is not over.  It is not just about Mr. Molloy and should not be.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris in his remarks spoke about inaccuracies.  I will defend the Fine Gael party&rsquo;s right to question and advocate on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  I will defend the right of Fine Gael to look for value for money and accountability.  All we have seen thus far is obfuscation and evasion.  The Senator speaks about inaccuracies.  Let us put it on the record.  We have seen lavish expenditure and bad use of resources, and we see a glaring need for accountability and reform of the way in which appointments to State boards and agencies are made.  I do not accept the view that all those on State boards and agencies are in the wrong.  Some of them do a good job and more of them are there because they are political appointees, filling the vacuum and fulfilling the need of a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister in particular to put cronies on the board.  These are the facts.  Let us be real about it.</P>
        <P>I have good regard for the Minister of State.  I mean this honestly.  However, his speech today lacked punch and direction.  Fundamental questions remain regarding F&Aacute;S and its composition in this sorry saga.  Perhaps it is because F&Aacute;S is seen as an extended Fianna F&aacute;il cumann in many parts of Ireland that it has been tarred by this brush.  The Minister of State may laugh but it is the truth.  F&Aacute;S has become a juggernaut that is out of control.  That is the fundamental point and I take no comfort or solace in stating that.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S must be cleansed by itself and its political masters, the Government.  There is a fundamental need for accountability and transparency.  Where have we heard that before?  However, it still has not happened.  Now, in an economic downturn and recession, F&Aacute;S is needed more than ever and this must be at its core.  Its need has never been greater than in this new Ireland where a generation of young people have never encountered hardship, had to make sacrifices, been on a training programme or on a dole queue, been forced to make a decision on travelling abroad to work or had to walk into a labour exchange and queue to sign on the register.</P>
        <P>Let us have a restoration of trust and faith in F&Aacute;S.  I want to differentiate clearly between the board of F&Aacute;S and in some cases the management and the excellent work done in the training centres by dedicated staff who lecture, provide training and do a decent, honourable day&rsquo;s work but have their resources cut and must borrow and beg management for resources which they do not receive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People and supervisors on community employment schemes do wonderful work in building Ireland and communities, which the Government has not done.  They are filling the vacuum created by the Government&rsquo;s neglect.  Let us not put everybody in the one category.  Let us differentiate between the board and management of F&Aacute;S and community employment schemes and the good work done by F&Aacute;S workers.  Events have clouded the judgment of ordinary people.  The ordinary people working in F&Aacute;S, such as lecturers, clerical officers and apprentices, have been maligned by inference by this sorry debacle.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Enda Kenny stated in June, long before this happened, we need a zero tolerance approach to waste by the Government and its agencies.  We have not seen this and we have no <Col N="578"/>hint of it.  Unemployment has increased and, as the State training and employment agency, F&Aacute;S has a duty and obligation to step forward.  This fundamental point is as pertinent today as it was when Manpower and AnCO existed.  The years of mismanagement which came to light in the past month must be put on the political compass, as must the fact that the duty of F&Aacute;S is to train, retrain and upskill.  We can discuss waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money but I will not go into a litany of what happened in F&Aacute;S.  However, I will repeat my core and fundamental point, made as a former director of adult education, that retraining, upskilling and training are what we should be about.</P>
        <P>Linked to this is the wider debate about public services and public sector reform.  The Government&rsquo;s greatest banner of public sector reform was decentralisation.  It made a botched job of it and in the budget this year we saw it was cancelled, postponed and put on ice.  It is more money gone wrong.  The public servants of Ireland are honourable, decent professional people who do an excellent job and who require dynamic Government leadership to motivate, reform and bring in efficiencies.  However, that has not happened.</P>
        <P>I feel strongly that public sector employees are maligned and lampooned by commentators and some in politics but they have received no leadership from Government.  We need better public services for our citizens.  We need a smaller Government which takes on board the new Ireland of this economic downturn.  Our public servants do a good job, be they teachers, nurses, garda&iacute;, firemen or people working in the Oireachtas, county councils or the health services.  However, they need leadership and they are not getting it.  Similarly with F&Aacute;S, we do not have it.</P>
        <P>Lavish spending must end and the restructuring of agencies must be put on the front burner of politics.  In his thoughtful contribution, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the role of F&Aacute;S and I agree with what he said.  However, he missed out on the fundamental point that it is the job of this House, the D&aacute;il and the Committee of Public Accounts to hold F&Aacute;S accountable for the expenditure of money on behalf of the Irish taxpayer.  That is what leadership is about.  It is not about coming here, passing it off and stating that we are misaligning ourselves on the issue of community employment schemes.  It is about competency to govern and manage and that is what has been missing in this entire sorry saga.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with fixing F&Aacute;S.  Its fundamentals need restoration and urgent attention.  The board of F&Aacute;S should do the honourable thing and consider its position.  The Minister of State and his colleagues in government would be best served by telling the Irish people that they have made a mess of it, calling an election and letting the people decide who best to govern and provide leadership for our country.  The Government&rsquo;s 11 years in power are epitomised by the arrogance of the past two weeks.  It is not good enough.  Ordinary Irish citizens, as the Minister of State knows from his constituency and his responsibility for labour affairs, are in the unemployment line queuing for benefits.  We are discussing people, not commodities, figures or statistics.  People are affected by this and shame on those who brought it upon them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his role.  Any Minister or Minister of State whose portfolio includes F&Aacute;S is in a difficult berth.  I look forward to hearing his response to the debate &mdash; I heard his opening statement.</P>
        <P>I welcome many of the wonderful initiatives which F&Aacute;S introduced and I pay due credit to it for everything it has done with regard to community employment schemes.  Over the years I have championed them in this House.  I tabled motions to have them extended and expanded and age limits altered.  All of us are at one with regard to this.  We have seen wonderful work throughout the country and in our communities.</P><Col N="579"/>
        <P>We are concerned about the bigger picture in F&Aacute;S and, as a number of Senators stated, for a period of time calls were made in this House for a debate on F&Aacute;S.  The Minister of State will agree that the board of F&Aacute;S has serious questions to answer.  Under law and corporate governance procedures it is answerable.  It is where the buck stops.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Minister of State on this without rehashing everything stated already about the board.  It is a serious matter to have two Garda fraud squad investigations under way in a State agency of its former standing and with the workload it is expected to carry.  This was already touched on by numerous speakers and I will not go into it.</P>
        <P>It is never satisfactory to have a cosy relationship as exists between F&Aacute;S and its auditors or accountants &mdash; another speaker referred to that point.  This firm of accountants and business consultants has done a considerable amount of work for F&Aacute;S, mostly with regard to corporate affairs, over a number of years.  OSK was consistently successful, as we now know, in applying for work at F&Aacute;S, and the corporate affairs section mainly dealt with a single contact within OSK.  This is something that should not be allowed within any agency.  I am not aware of the competitive tendering arrangements in place at F&Aacute;S for that type of work, but it is something that should come up for review as a matter of course, preferably on a biannual basis.  As I said in this House before, it is outrageous that in answering to the most senior public watchdog for the expenditure of taxpayers&rsquo; funds throughout Departments and agencies, members of F&Aacute;S management had the audacity to provide documentation with large chunks blacked out.  Who the blazes do they think they are?  It is an absolute scandal.</P>
        <P>I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on the question of there being no comprehensive explanation for the expenditure of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s budget of more than &euro;1 billion.  Senator Ross and others expressed serious concern in this regard.  There have been numerous examples of financial waste within F&Aacute;S for which we still have no satisfactory explanation.  The advertising contract of &euro;100,000 given to a local publication when all other advertising was national is one such unexplained item of expenditure.</P>
        <P>Alarm bells should have rung in 2003 when a reputable individual, Mr. Anthony Spollen, conducted an inquiry into F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s construction skills and safe pass schemes.  He identified 30 serious problems in the agency&rsquo;s training and assessment procedures for the construction sector.  We now know this was merely the tip of the iceberg.  What was done after this report was received and presumably examined?  It is incredible to consider that it might have been brushed aside.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation in this regard.</P>
        <P>The members of the board of F&Aacute;S have questions to answer in the first instance.  They must accept their accountability in these matters.  Ultimately, the buck stops with them.  The Minister has a duty of oversight, to be fulfilled on a regular basis, but it is the board which has questions to answer in the first instance on what actions it will take to address this situation.  After that, it is for the Minister to take action if it fails to do so.  I contend that the position of the board is untenable.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this important matter.  As many Members pointed out, there is great public disquiet at recent revelations regarding funding and procurement procedures at F&Aacute;S.  Several investigations into these issues are ongoing and it is important that we place these matters in context.</P>
        <P>On Thursday, 20 November 2008, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, was asked in a parliamentary question when she expected to receive the report commissioned from the Comptroller and Auditor General into the effectiveness of F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s financial management and control systems and whether, pending the receipt of <Col N="580"/>that report, she would take action arising from allegations of financial irregularities.  The Minister responded thus in the D&aacute;il:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report on non-commercial semi-State bodies, published in May 2008, reviewed the issues raised in one specific F&Aacute;S internal audit report.  I discussed this matter with the director general of F&Aacute;S and have expressed my concerns about the issues raised by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the internal audit report, and in particular, the need to secure value for money in public expenditure.  On my instruction, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to F&Aacute;S on 30 June 2008 seeking the formal assurance of the director general that the practices outlined in the audit reports of F&Aacute;S and the Comptroller and Auditor General had ceased and that adequate systems and controls were in place to prevent any recurrence and requesting details of the remedial actions taken by F&Aacute;S in respect of the issues raised by the audit reports, with quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the audit reports&rsquo; recommendations.  The director general replied on 1 July confirming that the unacceptable practices referred to in the audit reports had ceased.  A further response was received at the end of October, which set out the progress being made on the issue of controls on procurement and the observance of the procurement policy of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P LI="1">Following discussions with the chairman and director general, I decided that there should be an external investigation into the effectiveness of the financial management and control systems generally in place in F&Aacute;S, rather than be limited to aspects raised in the internal audit report that gave rise to the special report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has acceded to my request to consider doing such a review.  My intention in requesting this review is to ensure that appropriate public procurement procedures exist to prevent or detect irregularities or wrongdoing and to examine and report on the activities of the F&Aacute;S corporate affairs area since 2000 to achieve reasonable assurance as to whether there were any occasions of potential fraud or irregularity in that area other than those already brought to light by the F&Aacute;S internal audit unit.</P>
        <P LI="1">It is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General to determine the scope of his investigation.  He has indicated that, in doing so, he will take into account the deliberations at the Committee of Public Accounts hearings on the F&Aacute;S element of his special report.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important to reiterate the points made by the Minister in view of the general perception that no action was taken.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, who occupies a constitutionally independent position, acceded to the Minister&rsquo;s request to conduct an investigation.  In the meantime, the Committee of Public Accounts had also initiated an investigation into these matters, and out of respect for the work of that important committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General undertook to finalise his terms of reference on foot of its investigation.  That investigation is ongoing, with members of F&Aacute;S management appearing before meetings of the committee and co-operating with its work.  Certain issues were raised by the committee in regard to correspondence and they have been clarified in the context of data protection and so on.</P>
        <P>I urge all staff involved in all agencies to ensure that they receive value for money and that proper procurement procedures are in place.  On foot of recent report findings, the Government has asked that all agencies ensure they receive value for money in the context of travel and other procurement procedures.  These issues are being addressed.</P>
        <P>Several Members raised concerns about aspects of my opening speech.  My statement was presented to the Seanad on foot of issues raised not only by media reports but also, and just <Col N="581"/>as importantly, by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I tried to respond as best I could to those issues.  However, it would be irresponsible of me to comment on specific details of matters being investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will await the findings of the committee, after which the Comptroller and Auditor General will specify terms of reference for his investigation of all relevant issues.</P>
        <P>The core mission of F&Aacute;S was raised.  It is important I emphasise its core mission.  It is to provide training for people who are unemployed and for people who are employed at lower skill levels.  The national skills strategy is clear that we wish to ensure everyone is brought up one rung in the ladder in the context of skills and training.  In fairness, F&Aacute;S has been delivering in that regard.  It is of fundamental importance, given the challenges in the labour market and the rise in unemployment, that we do not make the mistakes that were made in the 1980s when there was a drift into long-term unemployment.  F&Aacute;S has been proactive in ensuring courses are put in place.  For example, it provides short modular courses for construction workers to train in energy conservation, insulation and installing energy conservation units in houses.  F&Aacute;S is trying to provide more such programmes.</P>
        <P>The agency responded to the problem of redundant apprentices quite quickly in allowing apprentices to proceed to their next off-the-job training programme.  We must continue to ensure the construction industry assists in placing apprentices in on-the-job training.  Without the co-operation of those who can provide training in the apprenticeship scheme, it will be difficult for apprentices to complete their courses.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S was established under the Labour Services Act.  That statute clearly lays out the membership of the board.  This was voted on by the Oireachtas so it is established in law who should be appointed to the board.  The statute clearly provides that there should be union and employer representatives.  I support social partnership.  It works at all levels of society and our economy.  There were suggestions that there is something untoward in how this board is appointed.  It is appointed under a statute passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is not about cronyism but about complying with legislation that clearly states the composition of the board.</P>
        <P>The science challenge programme was referred to.  This programme is not just about space shuttles and rockets, as one Senator mentioned.  It is primarily about providing high quality courses.  It was pointed out in the skills strategy and in the review of the labour market that there would be a shortage of high-end fourth level graduates in the years ahead.  The science challenge programme is about bio-medicine, biotechnology and nanotechnology.  Approximately 90% of participants in the science challenge programme have gone on to complete doctorates, masters and other high degree courses.  We should not dismiss this programme without knowing what it involves.</P>
        <P>The F&Aacute;S accounts are published every year.  There are also Estimates and Revised Estimates.  There are 22,500 participants in community employment schemes run by F&Aacute;S.  It also funds the job initiative programme.  The schemes do remarkable work.  I doubt there is a Senator or Deputy, be they on the Government or Opposition side of the Houses, who has not made representations to F&Aacute;S.  Despite casual remarks made in the debate, I am definite that most representatives, regardless of their political party, are treated with the utmost respect and courtesy by F&Aacute;S personnel when representations are made.  We all make representations.  People approach me quite often, given my responsibilities, to make representations to F&Aacute;S on their behalf.  When we make our representations, F&Aacute;S adjudicates on them and a decision is made.  My experience of dealing with F&Aacute;S, especially in recent times, is that it provides wonderful training and courses across all sectors.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>The community employment schemes are vital.  Until quite recently, due to the low unemployment rate of 4.3%, there probably was not great movement of people through the schemes, but that will change as unemployment rises.  Now the schemes are even more important in providing a buffer for people who find themselves drifting into long-term unemployment.  They can participate in these schemes and make a valuable contribution to society.  I visited St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation in Charleville recently where F&Aacute;S, working with the foundation and the vocational education committee, has set up a course for rehabilitative training for the workplace.  It is a pilot project but it is a wonderful scheme.  The people who work in F&Aacute;S are dedicated to ensuring people with disabilities can find a path into the workplace.</P>
        <P>I know it is not intentional on the part of Senators but there appears to be a view that we should throw the lot out because of concerns raised about public procurement and travelling expenses.  Fundamentally, F&Aacute;S is an effective organisation and it is needed now more than ever.  As a Minister of State with responsibility for F&Aacute;S, training and so forth, I am aware of the concerns expressed by Senators, the Committee of Public Accounts and the public that there should be proper procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure we get value for money.  With a tightening Exchequer, value for money is an essential prerequisite for spending.  It is a fact, however, that this Government acted promptly when the issues in F&Aacute;S were brought to its attention.  The answer to the parliamentary question on 20 November, to which I referred previously, clearly shows that, as did my opening speech.</P>
        <P>I always listen to the views of Senators but we should not malign the work being done locally because of concerns raised in another area of F&Aacute;S.  It is not intentional but there appears to be an attitude that we should get rid of the agency and move the people out because they are not doing good work.  They are doing wonderful work across all parts of the labour market.  We are carrying out a review of the programmes which will report in mid-2009.  It is timely to carry out such a review to ensure the proper programmes are in place to deal with a changed labour market.  There is little point in carrying out reviews, publishing them and implementing them when the unemployment rate is falling.  We must carry out the review knowing where we stand in the context of unemployment to ensure we have the proper courses, training mechanisms and support services for people who find themselves unemployed.</P>
        <P>I will convey the Senators&rsquo; remarks to the Minister.  The Committee of Public Accounts will continue its investigation over the next few weeks and report, while the Comptroller and Auditor General will also go into the matter with his defined terms of reference.  When they report, we will do whatever is necessary to ensure there are procedures in place, not only in F&Aacute;S but across all State agencies, to yield value for money.  No one on the Government side of the House could condone waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, but we must deal with the matter through the investigation initiated by the Minister earlier this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify that no one on this side of the House has maligned the work of F&Aacute;S staff or the work of community employment schemes.

	<P>I have.  We need answers to our questions so I hope this debate will not be jettisoned for the sake of time and brevity.  This is important; we are talking about taxpayers&rsquo; money.  The Minister of State referred to the board of F&Aacute;S.  What mechanism has it put in place for reporting to the Government?  What action is the Government taking about the role of F&Aacute;S and its reporting mechanism?  What assurances did the Minister of State or <Col N="583"/>the Minister receive from the board of F&Aacute;S, as the Minister of State mentioned in his speech?  This issue involves people spending taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State also referred to the review of the efficiency and effectiveness of labour market programmes.  When will that report be ready?  Why are we only getting this now?  Why is it only now that we are getting to the bottom of this?  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, spoke of the action being taken by the Minister.  What has been happening for the past ten years?  Why is it only happening now?  Where has the oversight been for the past ten years?  The problems at F&Aacute;S did not happen in the space of one week or one night.  Where were the reporting mechanisms and procedures?  Where was the accountability?  There was none.  The Minister of State should not blame the Opposition.  We did not create this problem.</P>

However, she welcomed the board&rsquo;s assurances that action was taken to deal with these matters.  This matter is ongoing.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General will report on the matter.  The board must take into account the findings and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report.  As matters stand, the board has provided assurances that action has been taken.</P>
        <P>I refer to the broader issue of the labour market review.  It will report in June or July 2009.  I may have missed one or two questions because of the interruptions.  However, I will answer them if the Senator reminds me of them.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the funding available for sports facilities at Collinstown, Clondalkin and Palmerstown.  There are four other community facilities affected by the developments of recent weeks and months.  I welcome the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House.  Will he outline how these facilities and community-based centres will be funded?  It appears the dormant accounts funding which was financing these centres effectively has run out.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is aware, these facilities are used by thousands of young children who attend various groups and sports in the halls.  These facilities are vital for the community and very much part of community life.  The recent developments are of great concern and there have been many meetings to discuss what will happen.  The sports facilities at Collinstown and Palmerstown are excellent and widely used community facilities that have been of significant benefit to the community.  There is great concern that they may not be able to continue in the present format because the funding has dried up with no alternative funding mechanism in place.</P>
        <P>I understand there have been some discussions between the local council, the vocational education committee and the Department.  The community, the staff involved in running the centres and the users wish to know the breakdown between those three groups if there is to be agreement on funding.  Will the funding be the same as before?  Will the same number of staff be employed in these centres?  Will the same number of community groups be able to use the facilities?  Those in the community do not mind from where the funding comes so long as there is funding for these excellent community facilities which have developed and grown significantly since they were established.  People wish to continue using them.</P>
        <P>The north Clondalkin community service has held several public meetings attended by hundreds of people.  These are lively facilities used by everyone in the communities involved.  I hope the Minister can clarify what will happen in respect of the funding, whether the sports facilities can continue to be used, whether the staff will continue to be employed, if the funding is secure, and if there has been agreement between the various bodies which can provide funding so that the centres may remain open given that the dormant accounts funding has ended.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposal my Department is developing along with the Department of Education and Science, County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and South Dublin County Council. <Col N="585"/> I was made aware several years ago that my Department made money available through the dormant accounts fund.  I was approached recently by the Department of Education and Science and it explained the money was running out.  We were aware of this.  The Department of Education and Science indicated it did not have the resources to keep the facilities open at night.  I assure the Senator this development was of immediate concern to me and I decided to make appropriate arrangements to keep these places open.  It would be a scandal if these fine facilities were not available to the public for the longest number of hours possible.  I share the concerns of people regarding these facilities.</P>
        <P>The matter raised affects four combined community and school operated sports halls in Killinarden and Firhouse in south Dublin and schools in Palmerstown and Collinstown in west Dublin.  These four facilities were built or upgraded as part of a programme to develop combined community and school sports halls in drugs task force areas in Dublin and Cork.  The objective was that each facility would serve a dual purpose.  They would put state-of-the-art sporting and recreational facilities at the disposal of the school-going population of the areas of south and west Dublin and the facilities would be accessible to the wider community to utilise.</P>
        <P>Senators may wish to note that the Department of Education and Science provided funding in excess of &euro;34 million to cover the capital cost of constructing nine halls attached to post-primary schools.  Eight of these halls are located in Dublin, including the halls referred to earlier.  Four are located within the boundary of Dublin city at Pearse College, Crumlin, the College of Further Education, Inchicore, Senior College, Ballyfermot, and St. Michael&rsquo;s secondary school in Finglas.  The facility at St. Vincent&rsquo;s convent secondary school is based in Cork city.</P>
        <P>The Government approved operational funding in respect of six halls in 2007 to make the facilities available for community usage.  These funds were provided from the dormant accounts fund.  The allocated dormant accounts funding will finish at the end of 2008.  The Senator will be aware that dormant accounts funding has a limited life and cannot continue forever because funding is finite.  With the downturn in the economy, more people will remember where their money is hidden.  As the Department of Education and Science does not normally fund community facilities, the matter was raised with me to examine the opportunities that might exist under the programmes operated by my Department.  In developing a suitable approach, I am keen to ensure we provide a more sustainable and long-term means of funding the community services in these centres.</P>
        <P>Having considered the matter with my officials, my Department has in recent days reached agreement with County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and South Dublin County Council on the broad principles of an arrangement to secure the community use of these facilities in the long term.  While the details of the proposals are yet to be finalised, I am satisfied that the facilities will remain available to the community without any interruption of services and that their longer-term use will be secured.  I am hopeful the necessary support will be forthcoming from the schools and the people of the areas served.</P>
        <P>Our proposals have yet to be finalised but having looked at the instruments available, my Department has decided to offer funding under the community services programme, formerly the social economy programme run by F&Aacute;S which was transferred to my Department in 2006.  There are 370 projects in contract nationwide to provide a very broad range of services.  The programme offers a contribution towards the employment cost of an agreed number of workers for contract periods of up to three years.  The contracts are renewable and are not subject to any time limit.  Funding is also normally provided for the employment of managers.  The project is then in a position to offer its services, charge a reasonable fee and develop a sustainable business plan that will reduce its dependence on State support over the longer term.  However, <Col N="586"/>I recognise that some State support will always be needed.  Having said that, we encourage people to charge reasonable fees for the use of facilities and so forth.</P>
        <P>The Senator asked about payment for employees.  My Department gives a certain amount for full-time employee equivalents, although organisations can employ people on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on their needs.  We pay the minimum wage so if there are four full-time equivalents in employment and a manager, my Department gives four times the minimum wage.  The organisation can top up that funding if it so chooses.  It is important to stress that given the nature of the funding scheme, the staff employed, except for the manager, must come from the target groups, namely, unemployed people, lone parents, people with disabilities and so forth.  In that context, not everything that is in place will fit in under the new arrangements but this is a sustainable model for the future.</P>
        <P>I want to ensure these excellent facilities are open and at the disposal of the communities at a reasonable cost.  We must also secure their longer-term sustainability.  I ask the Senator to support these efforts and thank her for affording me the opportunity to outline what is being planned and, with goodwill, we can make this work.  I hope this will give us a permanent solution which will allow the continued use of such facilities while providing gainful employment for people who might otherwise be unemployed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect agreement to be reached on the funding arrangement with the three groups involved?  If current staff do not meet the criteria which must be met under the community services programme, are there any transitional arrangements that could be put in place to ensure continuity of staff in the facilities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>My intention is to ensure a smooth transition and, as I said in my reply, we are working towards continuity.  If everything is not finalised by 1 January, we will have to make some interim arrangement because there is no point in closing the facilities only to reopen them at a later date.  I will try to avoid that situation if at all possible.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that what is involved here is a cocktail of funding.  The CDVEC and South Dublin County Council will provide some funding.  The funding being given by the Department would not cover all the staff requirements and overheads of the facilities.  The best thing for all parties to do is to determine where to go from here in the context of the constraints of the programme under which the Department is operating because we must live within those agreed constraints.  The parties must take account of the total resources that will be available through charges for use of the facilities, contributions from other statutory agencies and local authorities and the contribution from my Department.  My hope is that once the management has a clear picture of the shape of the funding package available, it can work out satisfactory interim arrangements in consultation with all stakeholders.  That level of final detail has yet to be worked out but with good will, it is possible to get the scheme to work to everyone&rsquo;s benefit.</P>
        <P>Transition is always difficult.  My Department has examined a suite of possible solutions to this problem.  It is somewhat constrained, however, in that it must work within the parameters of agreed programmes.  We cannot simply decide a project is a great cause and create a programme to fund it.  If we can get from where we are to where we want to go, we will have a very sustainable model and in three years&rsquo; time we will not face this problem.  I hope people can work together to resolve any transitional difficulties that arise.</P>

        <P>Laragh national school is a five-teacher school with 130 children on its roll book.  Four out of five of the classrooms are prefabricated buildings, with 80% of the children being educated in these rooms, which is an extraordinary statistic.  A full 75% of the prefabricated buildings are 36 years old.  These temporary buildings were put in place with an intended life span of ten years, which means that they are 26 years beyond their sell-by date.  There are various health and safety concerns and very high maintenance bills associated with these inadequate buildings.</P>
        <P>The school has an excellent teaching staff and an excellent principal leading them.  It is a wonderful school community but morale is greatly damaged by the current state of affairs.  The board of management has been campaigning for the past ten years for improved facilities, with no success.  Problems faced daily include inadequate heating, no hot water in toilets and classrooms, an inadequate sewerage system that is continually blocking, a leaking roof which is in danger of collapsing, slippery and dangerous tiles in hallways and toilets, no cloakrooms or facilities for storing coats, bags, footballs, etc., classroom windows that will not open or close without force, dampness causing foul smells in many classrooms, dangerous steps in the yard, leaking gutters, and major traffic problems outside the school gates.</P>
        <P>A reputable builder visited the school recently and carried out an assessment of the state of the prefabricated buildings.  He asserted that he does not believe the buildings will survive another winter.  They are at the end of their lifespan which begs the question what we replace them with.  The school has experienced a serious problem with mice in recent weeks.  Teachers have been trying to set traps and kill mice before children arrive in the mornings, which is an horrendous state of affairs.</P>
        <P>An application for a new school building was submitted ten years ago but nothing has happened since then.  The parish has purchased a site for a new school, yet nothing has happened.  In essence, we have drab, semi-derelict prefabs and a field upon which a new school can be built.  I submit that in the current economic climate, a reasonably cheap contract could be entered into to build a new school.  It would be cost-effective and would provide employment to people who might otherwise be unemployed.  The current situation is absurd in terms of social and educational policy.  Children are leaving comfortable and pleasant conditions at home and going into dreadful conditions at school which does not create the right signals for children.  It is demoralising in that regard.  We have an extraordinarily good teaching staff and a great school community.  It is a tribute to this excellent teaching staff that they have maintained morale and maintained a vibrant, happy school in the awful conditions in which they operate.  I appeal to the Minister to give a positive reply.  I say respectfully that I can see no logic in an alternative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House and thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly for allowing me a few moments of his time on this Adjournment matter.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 29 May this year, and unfortunately, nothing has moved on since that date.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, while he did not speak on the matter because he was away, was very much associated with it.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly pointed out, Laragh national school in Stradone, County Cavan, was built in 1963.  Originally designed as a three-teacher school, it now has 130 pupils, five mainstream teachers, one part-time resource teacher, one learning support teacher, three special needs assistants and one school secretary, which is a total of 11 staff.  Three prefabricated buildings were added to the structure in 1972 when Caulfield and Carrickallen national schools amalgamated with Laragh national school.  A further prefabricated building was provided in September 2001.  There are only two permanent classrooms, the rest of the accommodation being prefabricated.  The condition of the prefabricated accommodation is deplorable despite the best efforts of boards of management over the years.  Asbestos panels were removed from <Col N="588"/>the prefabricated buildings approximately six years ago and replaced with plywood, which is now rotting, and the roofs are leaking.</P>
        <P>The Department is well aware of this school as I and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, have continually brought it to the attention of the present Minister and previous Ministers.  The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, in his reply on 29 May, stated that the proposed extension and refurbishment of Laragh national school had been assigned a band rating of 2.1.  We want to know the up-to-date position from the Minister for Education and Science, through his colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is one of two or three schools within the county, but this school in particular is in a deplorable condition. Councillors Michael McCarey and Gerry Murray and Mr. Pat Smith of the school&rsquo;s board of management, along with the school principal, Donall O&rsquo;Donnchadha, have been writing to me and Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.  The morale of the staff is at an all-time low, not to mention the morale of the students who are expected to be educated in these deplorable conditions.</P>
        <P>Two options are available to the Department, as Senator O&rsquo;Reilly has pointed out: a total refurbishment of the existing school plus the construction of a permanent extension, or a new school on a greenfield site provided by the parish.  I urge the Minister of State to enlighten us and give us some positive news.  It will not take much money to get the school that these people in Laragh deserve.  I thank the Minister for being here and I thank Senator O&rsquo;Reilly again for allowing me time to speak on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the two Senators for raising this issue.  I will take the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects as well as the current position on Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan.</P>
        <P>At the outset, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, wishes to clarify that modernising facilities in our existing building stock while fulfilling the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  This Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme to almost &euro;600 million this year.  The completion in 2008 of 67 large-scale projects at primary level and 19 projects at post-primary level will benefit more than 18,000 students, and construction work on 150 devolved projects will provide an additional 8,000 permanent places in existing primary schools.  The Senators will be aware also that the Minister announced in September a further tranche of 24 large-scale projects to progress to tender and construction.  This year has seen also a particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas, with the construction of 26 new schools under the fast-track off-site construction programme.</P>
        <P>This is an enormous programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department of Education and Science will also deliver improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will continue to be on new schools and extensions to provide additional school places in rapidly developing areas.  The programme also will enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, again with the focus being on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>The project of particular concern for the Senators is Laragh national school.  This is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 127 pupils as of 30 September 2007.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly stated that the school had 130 pupils, and I will not argue with him.  The current staff at the <Col N="589"/>school consists of a principal, four mainstream assistants, and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.  The school authority submitted an application to the Department for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  The long-term staffing figure, on which accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  It has been agreed that accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal and five mainstream assistants, with appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>The proposed extension and refurbishment of Laragh national school has been assigned a band rating of 2.1 in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s published criteria for prioritising large-scale capital projects.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this one, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  This project will be considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s capital allocation for next year will amount to &euro;581 million.  This will allow it to continue to invest significantly in primary and post-primary school buildings throughout the country, provide additional school places and continue its programme of modernising existing schools.  Annual capital resources of this magnitude have allowed the Department to deliver more than 7,800 building projects under the previous national development plan alone, and we look forward to building on this unprecedented level of work with an allocation of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings under the current national development plan.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on Laragh national school, Stradone, County Cavan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is disappointing that in the six months since Senator Wilson spoke on this issue, the school&rsquo;s band rating of 2.1 has not changed.  Could the Minister clarify what exactly a band rating of 2.1 means?  There is great concern among parents, pupils and the teaching staff at the school as well as among local public representatives.  Senator Wilson correctly identified a number of public representatives who were in touch with him on this issue.  I must acknowledge also representations and strong approaches from Councillors McKiernan, Kettyle and Boyle, who have contacted me a number of times about this issue.  I will not be down the stairs from the Chamber when they will be phoning me to know what the Minister said.  I will tell them the school has a band rating of 2.1, and they will want to know what that means.  That is the level of frustration that exists.  The school rating system is Byzantine.  I appeal to the Minister to try to translate it or have it translated for the good people of Laragh who are anxious about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to get a translation, but I am sure it is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  However, I will ask the Department to clarify the band ratings.  My understanding is that it is 1, 2.1, 2.2 and so on.  I will obtain clarification for the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have any kind of time frame?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Senator a timeframe this evening.  Often with capital projects, timeframes depend on how the projects ahead in the queue are proceeding and if there is a delay in one of those, sometimes another project goes ahead.  It is not easy.  People are always asking me as a Minister for timeframes and I often say it is not that simple.  Sometimes a project which might have been expected to proceed does not proceed for one reason such as planning and that means another project can jump forward.  I will try to get answers from the Department of Education and Science and clarification as to the meaning of <Col N="590"/>the band rating of 2.1.  I presume the Department has given as much information in terms of timeframes as it can.</P>
        <P>There is a very substantial budget.  At the end of the day, there is &euro;580 million for schools next year.  We have been spending at an unprecedented rate and I am sure County Cavan is no different from all the other counties I have visited.  Many of the schools that needed work have had it done in the past four or five years.  I have seen school after school throughout the country, many of which I have had the privilege of opening.  It is fair to say that most of the rural primary schools with very poor accommodation have been dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I would be very grateful if he could send me in writing the explanation from the Department of what the band rating of 2.1 means because the people in my area will want to know.  I again appeal to the Minister to convey to the relevant Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe in this instance, that I cannot imagine a greater priority.  We are talking Dickensian stuff here.  We are talking mice in damp prefabs with roofs caving in.  That is the level we are at here.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Science to review the current procedures for the employment of substitute teachers by schools and the formalisation of such websites used to source teachers to ensure only candidates with the required teaching qualifications and up-to-date Garda clearance are given positions in Irish schools.</P>
        <P>A serious issue has come to our attention in recent times whereby websites being accessed by school principals to source substitute teachers may contain the details of candidates who do not hold appropriate qualifications and who do not have Garda clearance but who, if engaged by the principal teachers, who are usually under pressure to find a teacher quickly, would then be given access to classrooms of young children.  This is not in keeping with the standards for best practice which have been laid down for all contact with young children by personnel and it highlights that the time has come to review the procedures in place.</P>
        <P>It is very much in keeping with the times in which we live that school principals should be able to utilise on-line facilities to access such substitutes.  However, I ask the Minister to take this opportunity to formalise the procedures.  One suggestion I would make for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration is that these websites would be formalised and that principals would only access such authorised sites which in turn would be required to ensure only the details of candidates who had appropriate qualifications and only candidates who had Garda clearance would be posted.</P>
        <P>We are fortunate in having access to the very excellent services of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting unit.  It could be utilised by having it identify designated personnel who operate the websites as being the people to request Garda clearance for any candidate who wishes his or her details to be posted on the websites.  This would be of great assistance to school principals who are already under pressure and often only have very short notice in which to engage a substitute.  Most importantly, it would ensure we are in keeping with the standards we have set ourselves to enhance and maximise the protection of our children.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have this opportunity to update the House on the current procedures for the employment of substitute teachers by schools.  The recruitment and selection of staff, whether for teaching or other positions in a school, rests with boards of <Col N="591"/>management as the employer.  Good practice should involve the checking of recent employment records, qualifications, experience and names of referees.  While many substitute teachers have previous experience working in schools and may be known to schools, there is clearly a heightened requirement for vigilance in checking the prior employment record where the person seeking employment is not known to the school or is approaching the school for the first time.</P>
        <P>Good practices are warranted in any event, quite apart from the specific issue of safeguarding against any child protection risk.  In respect of child protection, the arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department circular 0094 of 2006 which issued to all schools in June 2006.  The circular is available on the website of the Department of Education and Science.  The vetting arrangements were introduced in September 2006 for vetting of new teachers at the time of their initial registration with the Teaching Council, regardless of whether they are likely to enter permanent employment or take up appointments as substitute or part-time teachers.  The procedures also apply to prospective employees for posts that involve working with children such as special needs assistants, SNAs, bus drivers, bus escorts to children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff in schools.</P>
        <P>As the expansion of service by the Garda vetting unit is rolled out, the Department of Education and Science will consult the relevant education stakeholders on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers working in any capacity &mdash; permanent, part-time or substitute &mdash; in the school system and other existing education staff working with children.  The circular requires the vetting of any person being appointed to a teaching position, whether permanent, part-time or substitute, who has not been employed in the school system in the previous three years.</P>
        <P>Irrespective of the position on vetting by the Garda vetting unit, where facts or information come to a board of management&rsquo;s attention calling into question a person&rsquo;s suitability to work with children, it is a matter for the board to be satisfied that the person is suitable to work in that capacity.  This naturally will have to be assessed case by case.  The board will have to consider all the circumstances of the case, give due weight to all relevant factors and afford fair procedures to the individual concerned before making a decision.</P>
        <P>It is the policy of the Department of Education and Science that unqualified personnel should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted.  It is probably inevitable in such situations that schools must be in a position to have recourse to unqualified personnel.  It is essential that reliance on such personnel be restricted and kept to the absolute minimum.  The previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, had indicated the intention to bring forward amending legislation which would set out the limitations upon a school&rsquo;s capacity to engage people other than qualified teachers.  The Department of Education and Science is working on the proposed legislation and it is the current Minister&rsquo;s intention to advance this amendment to the Teaching Council Act 2001 as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has no plans to formalise the use of websites for the sourcing of substitute teachers.  Schools, as employers, make their own arrangements for the employment of substitute teachers.  Many substitute teachers have previous experience of working in schools and generally would be known to schools.  Other schools use the text a sub service operated through the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network.  In all cases there is a need for schools to ensure they have good practices in place for the checking of recent employment records, qualifications, experience and names of referees where a new substitute teacher is not known to the school or is approaching the school for the first time.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to update the House on the position on the employment by schools of substitute teachers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="592"/>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the very detailed response.  Even with that, however, I am still concerned about the number of gaps that still exist.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could consider them in the context of the new legislation due to be brought forward.  Some of the gaps that come to mind immediately are in the case of unqualified personnel who clearly are not registered with the Teaching Council and therefore have not been subject to Garda vetting.  It is of great concern that anyone who has not been subject to Garda vetting would have access to a classroom of children.  In the appointment process for teachers, I accept, whether they are part-time or permanent, procedures are in place that will ensure Garda vetting.  Any teacher qualified since September 2006 has to be registered with the teaching council and would have to undergo Garda vetting.  In those instances, however, where it is necessary to employ a substitute teacher, he or she is not subject automatically to Garda vetting.  I have concerns about this, given our experiences to date and the times in which we live.  Formalising procedures and having authorised websites would make it much simpler for us to ensure people have been vetted.  Obviously, vetting only works where someone has had a prior conviction.  However, it at least allows us to take every possible step to ensure children&rsquo;s safety.  I do not feel we are doing that currently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary responsibility for employing people rests with the employer.  It is absolutely vital employers take due care and diligence in cases such as this.  I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science.  I am sure he will note them and take them into account.  I cannot over-stress the onus on an employer to be careful and ensure any decisions on employing substitute teachers, particularly in emergencies, are made with due care.</P>
