	<P>I have notice from Senator Paul Bradford that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide suitable accommodation at Rahan and Glenville national schools, County Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dan Boyle of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the situation regarding the future of the Freescale Semiconductors Ireland Ltd., based at Cork Airport Business Park, where a closure announcement pending confirmation within a month has been made.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maria Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the provision that is being made for September placements for those young people with disabilities leaving school in June 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to exert maximum influence to ensure the final round of the Zimbabwean presidential elections are free and fair.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the specific difficulties and solutions for acquiring a site for Monreagh national school, Carrigans, County Donegal, given that the school was sanctioned in 2001 but four sites later has not progressed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the tax incentives as promised and the Government&rsquo;s plans for the Cork docklands.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P><Col N="1020"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the plans he has to invest in and resource the fire services in County Waterford in the current year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline staffing arrangements for homeless shelters, including new buildings co-funded by the Health Service Executive and by other bodies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Paul Bradford, Dan Boyle and Maria Corrigan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The remaining Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The first matter I want to raise this morning is the rail strike which has greatly inconvenienced thousands of passengers over recent days.  The latest news is that it is still continuing.  The scale of the effect on passengers seems to be completely out of proportion to the issues involved, although there is some fault on both sides.  What is the point of social partnership if we cannot have a mechanism to resolve such a situation quickly?  I note that Luas drivers, for example, have a no-strike clause in their contracts.  It is time we considered essential public services.  The other day we talked about the effect on consumers of the sterling differential not being reflected in prices in Ireland.  The Government should get a grip on this.  It is appalling that it is still continuing.</P>
        <P>The new report by Davy stockbrokers makes for very disturbing reading.  It has dramatically reassessed the economic situation and states that housing completions are expected to drop from 40,000 to 25,000.  It is predicting a fall in house prices this year of 10.7% and one of 7.2% in 2009, along with an unemployment level of 7%.  I raise these figures not to create a picture of doom and gloom &mdash; I do not think we should talk ourselves into a recession &mdash; but to draw attention to the fact that the economic picture has changed completely.  I do not think it is good enough any more for the Government to talk about the programme for Government which is now out of touch with reality.</P>
        <P>If we take the example of housing alone, the affordable homes sector is at crisis point.  I heard an example the other day of a young couple who were offered an affordable home for &euro;315,000 by a council although the property received a market valuation of &euro;275,000.  What is the future of the affordable homes schemes?  How will the councils deal with this given that <Col N="1021"/>they have already paid amounts such as I quoted for the houses and apartments?  A debate is necessary in order that the Government can tell the House how it plans to tackle these issues.  The Minister for Finance must attend that discussion as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s attitude to the Lisbon treaty referendum is not helping the debate.  There must be co-operation and a change in attitude if the treaty is to be passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach and the Leader.  On today&rsquo;s Order Paper is an item to be taken tomorrow, namely, a motion re the new prison in north County Dublin.  I would like some help.  Paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (<i>e</i>) refer to markings A and B on the map left by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Oireachtas Library.  This sounds easy, but the map is in the middle of three large boxes of environmental impact assessments.  I need to see it, but I cannot get my hands on it.  No one is hiding it from me, but neither I nor the people in the library can find it.  If we are to discuss a matter that affects people &mdash; I have a conflict of interest, which I will explain tomorrow morning &mdash; we must have access to the map.  We have been trying to get it from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the past while, but have failed to do so.</P>
        <P>Three or four of the matters seeking the Adjournment of the House relate to schools.  Going from memory, at least two of them have been raised on the Adjournment previously and one may have been raised three times previously.  This reflects a significant level of frustration.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to let people know what is occurring in their areas?  We are tying up the time of the House with Adjournment matters simply to access information on behalf of ordinary people who are trying to build new schools or school extensions.  They are not criminals or terrorists and are not trying to undermine the system.  They are trying to get information.  This situation applies to Senators on both sides of the House, as we are all trying to get information.  Why can there not be transparency and access?</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on an issue raised by my colleague, Senator Coghlan, yesterday.  It was understandable that he asked about the strike in Cork and why union management could not show control.  Senator Fitzgerald raised the same issue this morning.  Their questions are reasonable.  I have tried to get to the bottom of the issue.  The problem has been created at Cork where there is a local interpretation by management and workers of a national agreement, which they have implemented in their own way without telling anyone else.  However, given that there is a row, no one knows what is the agreement.  If people must have their butts kicked, there are as many on the management side as there are on the union side involved.  They are at ground level rather than on the union side.</P>
        <P>I would be the first to state that this situation is unacceptable.  National agreements are designed to provide good, top of the scale public services for the people.  I would like to hear an answer as to which agreement was signed off on and who broke it, but it is because there will be no answer that the situation remains the same one week later.  I guarantee the House that no Senator could tell me what is causing the dispute in Cork.  When is the last time there was such a dispute?  Since it is a cover-up between management and the people on the ground, we are not being given the full information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the dispute in Cork, in respect of which there is a lack of public clarity.  A strike has been referred to, but it is my understanding that staff were recently asked to sign a pledge.  I am not making excuses for anyone, but there must be clarity around this issue in the Houses and publicly.  The loss of vital services to people in Cork and further afield is unacceptable.</P><Col N="1022"/>
        <P>With regard to the nonsesnsical sideshow skirmish that is the question of who is doing more in terms of the Lisbon treaty debate, I appeal to all sides of the House and elsewhere to move on from it.</P>

	<P>On the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate in respect of today&rsquo;s publication of the 2008 report of Amnesty International.  The other side of the House has become quieter.  The report is fair and balanced and deserves a debate.  It acknowledges many of this country&rsquo;s positive achievements, not least of which was the formation and operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, but it points out considerable deficiencies and difficulties in our human rights protection legislation and policy.  It would benefit the House to have the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appear before it.  As other matters must be dealt with, a debate need not be arranged for the next week or two, but I appeal to the Leader to arrange for a calm and reasoned debate on this important report before the end of the session.  The report deals with, for example, rendition, an issue raised by several Senators.  This morning, the Secretary General of Amnesty International was reported as stating that the guarantees given to the Government by the US were not worth the paper on which they were written.  This state of affairs is extraordinary.  Other issues covered by this valuable report would benefit from a debate in the House, which I ask the Leader to facilitate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1023"/>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the opinions of previous speakers and ask the Leader to consider an opportunity to discuss the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann industrial dispute in Cork if it continues during the coming days.  It is difficult to decipher the dispute&rsquo;s cause or to attribute blame.  The net effect is that a service that has been highly resourced in recent years and has become the country&rsquo;s best and increasingly used rail service is in danger of losing much of the public good will it has acquired.</P>
        <P>People have suffered in the short term.  I have heard horror stories of people missing hospital appointments, university examinations and job interviews.  While we discuss the warring factions in every industrial dispute, we forget the collateral damage among the ordinary people who depend on public services.  If there is no sign of an imminent breakthrough during the coming days, the House should discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>Regarding the points made about the Davy Stockbrokers report, the House should debate the economy before it rises for the summer recess.  Senators should avoid the politics of the latest flurry of economic consultants&rsquo; reports, which seem to state that economic activity will slow to a certain level and recover within a certain time and that we will retain our strong and resilient economy during the coming years.  The only debate should be on how long the slowdown will last, how deep it will go and how long the economy will take to recover.  The essential effects outlined in every consultant&rsquo;s report are the same.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Alex White&rsquo;s request for a debate on the Amnesty International report.  There were similar requests in respect of the recent and slightly controversial report of the EU&rsquo;s commissioner on human rights.  A discussion on political rights, both here and abroad, would be a good use of the time of the House before rising this summer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments made by Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Boyle on the continuing rail strike in the south west.  It is a frightful situation which is discommoding many people on a daily basis.  Yesterday, I wished those participating in the talks well.  Nobody understands why the situation was not resolved yesterday but I am glad the attempts to find a solution are ongoing.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole, as an acknowledged expert on these issues, got to the nub of the matter.  The dispute is about a local interpretation and a local rule.  Whatever about its rebel status, I am sure Cork does not want to be an independent republic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish those participating in the talks well.  I hope it is resolved today in order that Members can travel home tomorrow when they finish their work.</P>
        <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to amend local government law to afford recognition to plebiscites where they are provided for and have taken place.  In the case of Dingle Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, this provision will supersede any place names order under the Official Languages Act.  I hope this will offer a happy solution for all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1024"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the inclusion on the Order Paper of No. 22, a motion regarding a report published by the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny last week on the enhanced role for national parliaments under the Lisbon treaty.  In addition, No. 15 relates to the interim report of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the Lisbon treaty.  Its final report will be issued tomorrow.  Will the Leader provide time next week for a debate on these reports?  There is no point in having that debate after 12 June.</P>
        <P>We should designate next week for the discussion of all issues relating to the Lisbon treaty.  If that is not possible, we should at least meet next Friday week to thrash out all the issues and to highlight the benefits accruing to the Oireachtas and the public from the provisions of the treaty.  Under the enhanced role for national parliaments, it is recommended that this House meet on one day a month to deal specifically with EU business.  This would represent a major reform of the way we conduct our business and would offer many benefits.  We must discuss all these issues in advance of the referendum on 12 June.  It would be a waste of time to do so afterwards.</P>
        <P>I commend the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; team on last night&rsquo;s informative programme.  I refer not to the debate itself but to the presentation of the facts.  Leaving aside individual interpretations of those facts, it is important that the national broadcaster should provide factual information on what is included in the Lisbon treaty.  This morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme, featuring a Danish MEP, was of no help to the campaign, even though Mr. Alan Dukes spoke very well.  This person is a eurosceptic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to yesterday&rsquo;s proposal by the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, for a reduction in VAT on petrol.  I understand he spoke with particular reference to the usage of petrol for the distribution of goods.  Complaints about the cost of fuel have been heard throughout Europe.  There are problems in Britain, for example, and ports are being blocked in France.  The cost of distribution of food is giving rise to the complaints articulated by Senator Fitzgerald yesterday.   This is influenced to a large extent by the VAT payable by those using the road distribution system.  Mr. Sarkozy proposed an EU-wide reduction in VAT.  This is not the way to go, however, because it would be most unwise to encourage increased usage of private transport.  However, there is much to be said for a reduction in VAT in regard to the distribution of goods, particularly food.</P>
        <P>I understand the Cabinet yesterday approved the new intoxicating liquor Bill.  I must express an interest in this issue as someone who has been involved in the sale of alcohol most of my life.  I am concerned that the legislation is being rushed through.  I understand it may go to the Bills Office today and the intention is that it be passed quickly thereafter.  We should be always <Col N="1025"/>slow to rush Bills through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this case, the heads of the Bill were published only recently, there are questions and doubts about some of the terms used and no regulatory impact analysis has been done.  That analysis should be undertaken at this early stage rather than trying to rush through the Bill.  We should take our time in debating it, which is the latest incarnation of other similar Bills.  We must not rush it through without giving it serious consideration and without a regulatory impact analysis.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the concerns about the proposed location of the Central Mental Hospital.  However, I am concerned that we might lose sight of the need that exists for the development of a national framework for forensic mental health services.  Will the Leader agree, as a matter of urgency, to invite the Minister to the Chamber for a discussion on the State&rsquo;s forensic mental health needs and the development of an appropriate national framework to meet those needs, of which a new Central Mental Hospital facility would be just one component?  This debate should include a consideration of the inappropriate imprisonment of people with mental health needs and intellectual disabilities and the development of a prison diversion measure in appropriate cases.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I refer to last night&rsquo;s D&aacute;il debate on the 28 schools throughout the State which will lose a teacher for the school year beginning 1 September.  This is a stupid and outdated rule.  There is absolutely no need for these posts to be lost to the schools concerned.  The Government should keep the promise it made in regard to class sizes.  In some cases, schools are just one pupil short of the retention figures.  The new Minister has an opportunity to fix this broken promise.</P>

        <P>I welcome in advance the expected announcement of &euro;400,000 of funding for university research.  However, unless the interface between third level institutions and industry is improved, we will not see an adequate return for this investment.  By &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; I mean new opportunities and new jobs.  They were never more necessary than in a time of great economic challenge and restraint.  In the past ten years almost &euro;1 billion has been given to universities for research.  How successful has this investment been?  What targets have been achieved nationally and regionally?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I have previously sought a debate on this area of third level education.  We need a cost benefit analysis of the return on the investment.  The feedback I <Col N="1026"/>have received is that the relationship between institutes of technology, as opposed to universities, and industry is far more alive and vibrant, but that sector receives the least amount of money for research.  We have a challenge before us.  We are all seeking the best outcomes for this country.  They might be coming from the universities but we must have a debate on the issue to discover the exact position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange to provide an up-to-date report on the situation in Burma with regard to the aid agencies working there to combat the humanitarian crisis?  The people of Burma have been suffering for approximately four weeks.  Compare that with what was happening on the ground a month after the tsunami.  I am somewhat concerned at the contradictory reports from Burma and would appreciate a clear report on what is happening.  I also welcome the Amnesty International annual report and support the view that we should discuss it in the Seanad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the concerns of other Senators about the serious issues affecting the economy.  We all acknowledge that there has been a slow-down in growth.  This has had an impact on the public finances, although I am led to believe they remain sound.  We should be confident about our economy, and it is important that people acknowledge its positive aspects.  If there is to be a debate on the economy and housing, I ask participants to think outside the box when putting forward their suggested proposals and solutions to deal with the serious issues that affect the Irish and international economies.  I look forward to a meaningful debate.</P>
        <P>Long-term care for older people is a major issue in terms of the availability and location of beds, the quality of care and, most importantly, the cost of care.  Will the Leader indicate what application applies at present with regard to the asset value of the people seeking care?  What is the position with regard to the Minister&rsquo;s proposed fair deal?</P>

	<P>I wish to express my surprise at the Leader&rsquo;s outburst yesterday following an appeal from this side of the House that Members avoid criticising each other for what they are doing in the referendum campaign on the Lisbon treaty.  It was similar to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response when Deputy Enda Kenny made a similar appeal.  He remarked that Fine Gael and the Labour Party should crank up their campaigns, when they were the first to start work on the Lisbon campaign.  It is not fully appreciated how divisive and profound an effect this has had among the electorate.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks represent a defining moment in the campaign.  Even if he did not correct the situation in the D&aacute;il yesterday, I believe he must mend his hand.  If this is turned into a partisan and divisive campaign, we will have a difficulty.  When he was Minister for Foreign Affairs the Taoiseach was director of elections for the first referendum on the Nice Treaty and he is now responsible for the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  On present form, it is very likely that he will fluff both referenda.  I ask the Leader to reflect on this and his outburst yesterday, and to convey our views in this regard to the Taoiseach.  There is a national interest in ensuring the referendum succeeds.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader allocate time for a debate on eating disorders among young people?  The number of sufferers is increasing and a debate is necessary on this important issue.  Each week we hear or read disturbing news on obesity and how it affects our young people.  I ask the Leader to respond to this request with urgency and to invite the relevant Minister to the Seanad as soon as possible to debate the matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are hacking lumps out of each other over the European treaty because it gives an opportunity for me, as practically the lone voice in this House trying to present a reasoned argument against the Lisbon treaty, to be heard.  That is not particularly easy, especially since <i>The Irish Times</i> has dropped its <Col N="1027"/>neutral stance and committed itself to campaigning for the treaty.  It is not just Deputy Brian Cowen who has not read the treaty but also our European Commissioner, and he thinks anybody who tries to do so is an idiot.  He said as much.  People have tried to defend their positions by saying the treaty is like the Finance Bill, about which ordinary people do not know every detail because they have not read it.  That is true but the person who presents the Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance, certainly ought to have read it given that he wrote it.  The same applies to the Taoiseach and the European Commissioner.  If they have not read the treaty, they are not in a position to recommend it.</P>

There were no principles whatever behind it.  Fine Gael does not have a neutrality policy; it is against it.  Fine Gael would like to walk us into NATO at the first possible opportunity, but the people of Ireland will not have it.  That is the problem for the political parties.</P>

	<P>Having jumped the gun in mentioning Mr. P&ouml;ttering, I wish to return to my request regarding the Dalai Lama.  I ask the Leader for a response to my request.  I have gone through the correct etiquette in asking that an invitation issue to the Dalai Lama; I have been doing it for six weeks.  The foreign affairs committee has unanimously agreed it.  I wrote to Senator O&rsquo;Toole and he presented my request to Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The party leaders all agree with such a request, as far as I know, and the Department of Foreign Affairs has no difficulty with it, yet I still cannot get an answer, and the gun was <Col N="1028"/>jumped by one of my colleagues.  What are we to do?  Can I have an answer to my question about the Dalai Lama?</P>
        <P>Finally, it might be an impertinence on my part but, as the Leader knows, I am an impertinent young pup, and I wish to acknowledge the presence of a distinguished colleague from the Argentinian senate in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  He made a major and important contribution to the debate held by parliamentarians in Buswells Hotel on the issue of landmines.  The meeting was held under the auspices of the foreign affairs committee and involved representatives of the various parties.  We made a number of recommendations.  I hope that next week, after the passage of the treaty in Croke Park, we will have an opportunity to discuss its implications.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the composition of its board and some of its decisions.  I heard yesterday from the Irish Rural Dwellers Association which made presentations, both an oral and written, which were worrying.  An inspector, an employee of the board, is on record saying that as far as he is concerned there should be no rural houses at all.  I would like to know on what planet that man lives.  These comments are a disgrace given that we have a unique culture of rural living.  When the foot and mouth disease epidemic was here every person, whether in city, town or village, made an effort to ensure that the land and our livestock were protected.  That showed the love the Irish people have for the land and the countryside.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s remarks on psychiatry and the need for several special care units to be set up throughout the country on a regional basis.  There are several people in our psychiatric hospitals who, because of their very challenging behaviour, need these special units.  I ask that Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s request be facilitated as soon as possible.  I will participate in this debate too and I ask that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to address the concerns that Senator Corrigan and I have expressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on standards in the private rental accommodation sector.  Some months ago we became rightly agitated about footage shown by the  &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme about the state of accommodation in which many people in our cities live.  We must recognise the scale of this issue throughout the country.  There are too many tenants living in rental properties in conditions not fit for animals.  There are too many residents who must put up with havoc on a daily basis.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>There are several changes due in this area which have not happened yet.  Statistics on the success of local authorities in taking action against sub-standard landlords were due to be published last year.  The figures have still not been published.  There are regulations due dealing with the private rental sector designed to ensure the quality of accommodation is increased.  As we approach the end of this parliamentary session we still do not know the content of these regulations or when they will be published.</P><Col N="1029"/>
        <P>I support the remarks of Senator Fitzgerald on the industrial dispute in our rail services.  While there may be a lack of clarity about who is causing the difficulty, there is clarity about the fact that it is the taxpayer who suffers.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, along with other companies, have received nearly &euro;250 million in taxpayer&rsquo;s subvention over the past few years.  We must ensure that, whatever is resolved, the efficient investment of taxpayer&rsquo;s money is protected.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Boyle&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy.  He correctly pointed out there are human consequences resulting from events in Cork.  We need to be mindful too of the human consequences of whether the economy grows at one rate or another and how quickly it will recover, if at all, and whether that recovery takes place this year or next year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senators Donohoe and Boyle in their call for a debate on the economy.  We have listened, in the past few weeks, to Members on the Government side of the House breathlessly defend the Government&rsquo;s economic policy over the past 11 years.  It is fair to say that the boom and bloom is over and the champagne days have been wasted by the Government.  The human consequences are clear.  Senator Boyle will raise on the Adjournment the matter of the staff of the Freescale Semiconductors Ireland Ltd. in Cork.  Quality graduate jobs will be lost, but may hopefully be saved.  This is a visible human consequence when quality people are let go.  This is the legacy of the mismanagement of the golden period of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I raised the issue of the Irish rail dispute in counties Cork and Kerry.  I am an advocate of trade unionism.  However, there is an obligation on all sides to resolve the dispute, including the Minister for Transport, and especially on the board and management of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to manage its affairs properly.  The end result is that the people of Cork have been discommoded.  The economic outlook for the region is dependant on people being ferried in and out of Cork.  It behoves the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the economy, but I would like it to have a particular focus.  The advent of the Lisbon treaty indicates Europe will rightly take a leading role in energy matters.  The EU already takes this role in such sectors as agriculture.  I have mentioned previously, but it is worth repeating, that for the provision of clean, green energy there is no country in Europe better placed than Ireland.  We could avail of EU funds to install, off the west coast, clean, green energy to supply Europe.  This is a possibility at a time when we are all conscious of the price of energy and the carbon cost.  There could be significant benefits in employment and cheap electricity for the country that provides such energy for the rest of Europe.  I ask the leader for a debate on energy, including the cost and the possible benefits accruing to the nation from using the competence the EU will assume under the Lisbon treaty which, I trust, will be passed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald was correct to draw the attention of the House to the latest report and analysis from Davy Stockbrokers, a reputable organisation.  The content is frightening and it is clear the economic storm-clouds are gathering and that we did not exercise adequate prudence in recent years.  The level of inflation and the extent of price increases is serious.  There is frightening anecdotal evidence &mdash; which Senator Wilson, my colleague on the Government side of the House, may corroborate &mdash; in Border areas of people crossing into the North to such places as Enniskillen and buying food and other groceries for <Col N="1030"/>25% less than here.  That is scary and raises the question of price control in the country.  It is also worrying.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on this matter.  The euro is strong relative to sterling at present and imports from the UK worth billions of euro are not leading to price reductions for Irish consumers.    Prices are not reducing to reflect the change in currency values.  The issue of price control is critical and keeping inflation down should be a critical plank of economic policy.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy to discuss where cutbacks take place.  There should be no cutbacks in frontline services, nor should they affect weaker people in such areas as home-help, class size and a range of other issues.  We should make it an article of faith that the cutbacks are directed at the better off sectors of society and at tackling wastage in our economy.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>I endorse the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole on transparency in the schools building programme.  We are all frustrated with the system at present.  There should be a clear system of readily accessible information.  It would prevent a raft of public meetings and ridiculous activity throughout the country if people knew the position of their school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Reilly in his call for a debate on inflation.  As he correctly pointed out, a significant disparity exists between the sterling and euro prices quoted in shops.  Clearly, huge currency profits are being made, which should not be the case.  I wonder whether these shops would accept sterling if people put them to the test.  In the 1970s and 1980s, we had bodies which controlled prices during a period of economic stagnation and comparatively modest incomes.  If competition is no longer effective at achieving the prices we should be getting, perhaps those arrangements should be revisited.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I listened to a programme on which a number of people complained about the difficulties they are experiencing with marriage registrars.  In Dublin especially, it apparently takes up to three months to get an appointment.  That seems to be an unnecessary bureaucratic burden on people who have decided to get married.  In some instances, people had already booked hotels and were concerned they would be at a financial loss.  This issue should be investigated with a view either to increasing the number of marriage counsellors, if there is a shortage, or returning to the previous practice whereby couples made the necessary arrangements with their local priests.  This is an example of the State getting involved in an area but not delivering on its commitment.</P>

	<P>Senator Norris on a point of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, has suggested to me that the Cathaoirleach may have felt I impugned his impartiality.  The Senator also thought he heard the Cathaoirleach ask me to withdraw something.  I did not hear that but I would be more than happy to withdraw whatever it was that was offensive and I take this opportunity to say that the Cathaoirleach always treats me with leniency, as he does all Members.  He is totally scrupulous and fair, in the great tradition of Cathaoirligh of this House, and I would not like it to be understood that I intended anything else.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Coghlan, Donohoe and Boyle spoke about the train drivers&rsquo; strike and the difficulties being experienced by travellers <Col N="1031"/>in Cork and Kerry in particular.  I wish all parties well in their negotiations, which lasted until 2 a.m. today and will resume at 12 noon, and I hope the difficulties can be resolved.  At the end of the day, these issues have to be negotiated.  This type of unexpected strike is unfair to the customer who ultimately determines whether a service is a success.  Much good work has been done in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to provide this top class service so I look forward to a resolution.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Boyle, Donohoe, Buttimer, Hanafin and Reilly called for a debate on the economy.  Senator Fitzgerald referred in particular to the report produced by Davy stockbrokers on the difficulties being experienced due the high cost of energy.  The difference in the price of groceries such as tea, butter, bread and sugar are causing difficulties, particularly for those who are on the margins.</P>
        <P>I attended the start of this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment which heard a presentation by the National Consumer Agency on its pilot survey of a basket of goods bought from the main retailers.  The survey revealed minimal price differences among the multiples but significant price differences between larger outfits and symbol group stores and within symbol groups themselves.  The survey found minuscule differences among the branded goods sold by multiples.  It compared own brand products from Aldi and Lidl against the mid-range own brand products of major multiples and found significant price differences between discount stores and the multiples.  However, independent butchers and fruit and vegetable shops fared well against the multiples.  The symbol group retailers were more expensive, as was expected given their role as convenience stores.  There were, however, considerable price differences among the symbol groups.  I am sure the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment will make a copy of that report available to any Senator who requests it.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with allowing time for a wide-ranging debate on the economy.  However, the new Minister for Finance has an extensive brief, so I want to allow him the time to get a handle on his portfolio.  It is a considerable change to come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Finance.  I hope to arrange this debate before the summer recess, however.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the participation of Senators from all sides of the House in the debate on the Lisbon treaty over this weekend.  Let the facts speak for themselves.  I will endeavour to have the reports requested by Senator Leyden brought before Senators for their consideration by next week.  Senator Leyden correctly noted that time will have to be allocated by next week because it will be too late after that.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Corrigan and Glynn raised their concerns about mental health, the Thornton site and the level of investment needed for this area.  I listened attentively to those who have expertise in this field and I look forward to welcoming the new Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for equality and disability, Deputy John Moloney, to the House.  The Minister of State has 20 years of experience as a member of the former Midlands Health Board and is totally committed to doing what he can to alleviate the plight of those who are unfortunate enough to be affected by mental health problems.  I have no difficulty in arranging time for a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames and others highlighted the pressures faced by boards of management, students, teachers and everyone else involved in running schools.  I have no difficulty in arranging time for this matter but the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has only been in his new position for two weeks.  I will endeavour to have him attend the House at the earliest opportunity to discuss the educational issues raised this morning.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, Alex White and Boyle called for a debate on the 2008 Amnesty International report and requested the attendance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="1032"/>Reform.  I will endeavour to arrange for the Minister to come before the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the call made by President Sarkozy of France.  I will see what can be done in respect of the Senator&rsquo;s request and I will communicate further with him on the matter, either later today or early tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also referred to the forthcoming intoxicating liquor Bill.  I assure Members that this legislation will not be rushed through the House and that the time required for debating it will be allocated.  It is fair to say that some of the legislation that has come before both Houses has not always been the best.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator.  If the Bill is initiated in the House, we will devote to it the fullest amount of time possible in order that amendments can be prepared and not rushed.  I will allow a full week between Second Stage and Committee Stage in order that amendments may be tabled and a further week before Report Stage in order that further amendments can be put forward.</P>
        <P>The leaders of the various groups have been very accommodating with regard to the way the House deals with legislation and I thank them for that.  The Upper House did not obtain its name on foot of a one-line clich&eacute; put forward by the media.  It has worked hard to develop its reputation over many years.  We will continue the good work of our predecessors by maintaining the reputation the House has built in the context of considering legislation on a line-by-line basis.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely requested an update on Burma.  I will contact the Minister in respect of this matter and communicate further with the Senator on it.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to various issues relating to long-term care and older people.  We owe so much to the generation that helped to put us in the position we currently occupy.  The Senator might take up this point with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who will be present in the House for Private Members&rsquo; business later today.</P>
        <P>Senator Carty requested a debate on eating disorders and on how these affect young people.  This is a worthwhile request and I will ensure a debate on the matter takes place at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>On Senator Norris&rsquo;s request in respect of the Dalai Lama, matters are proceeding in accordance with Standing Orders at the CPP.  I had understood the leader of the Independent group, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, had been briefing the Senator on this matter.  I will discuss the matter further with Senator O&rsquo;Toole following the Order of Business and we will endeavour to continue to fully support Senator Norris&rsquo;s request.  I will inform Senator Norris of the current position when I take up the matter with the secretariat.  I look forward to the Senator&rsquo;s request being accepted and to the House being honoured by the presence of the Dalai Lama.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to review the terms of reference of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, particularly in the context of a submission made yesterday by the Irish Rural Dwellers Association to the relevant committee.  One of the points raised in the submission is that sons and daughters should not be prevented from building houses on their parents&rsquo; farms or small holdings.  As many people are aware, for many years my party has represented the interests of small businesses and small farmers and those who are obliged to make a go of things for themselves.</P>

        <P>I have no difficulty agreeing to Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s request.  I know he has quite an amount of experience regarding matters, such as the requirements involved and the unfortunate conditions in which some people have been obliged to live up to now, relating to the private rented sector.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Senator and I have no difficulty in arranging for the Minister to come before the House to discuss his proposals.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly requested a debate on inflation and matters relating to it.  He referred to those of us who live on the Border with Ulster.

The UK market, which encompasses 64 million or 65 million people, has much greater purchasing power than that which obtains in Ireland, to which the majority of products must be imported by air or sea and which has a population of only 4.5 million.  This was outlined in some detail to the committee to which I refer when it carried out its review of the groceries order.  Senator Coghlan was a member of that committee and made a great contribution to its work.  The reason to which I refer may indicate why there is a small difference as regards prices.</P>

    <Title>Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>On Thursday last, both Houses of the Oireachtas approved the draft Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 (Section 5) (Specified Period) Order, 2008.  Under the terms of section 5(5) of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, an order to extend the term of the commission must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As obliged under the Act, the Department consulted the commission on the timeframe for the extension of the current specified period.  The Commission, which is independent of the Department in its functions, had requested an extension by eight months to the end of January 2009 to allow for completion of the report and to make the necessary preparations for its publication.  The extension was required in order to allow the commission to fulfil its statutory mandate to publish its report during the specified period.  The previous period expired at midnight on 22 May 2008.</P>
        <P>Since the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology of 11 May 1999 to the victims of abuse in childhood a series of Government measures have been introduced for the redress of abuse.  These measures include the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the setting up of a financial redress scheme for victims of abuse and the establishment of a statutory redress board to administer such a scheme, the provision of counselling and the education finance board.</P>
        <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was formally established in May 2000.  The broad terms of reference are to afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum; to establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present; and to compile a report and publish it to the public on the activities and the findings of the commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
        <P>As one of its core functions, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse provides those who were previously silenced with an opportunity to relate their accounts of childhood abuse to an experienced and sympathetic forum.  For some people this therapeutic role is all they require of the commission, while for others their wish is that their allegations are inquired into.  To ensure that the two strands can be accommodated, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 provides for two committees, the confidential committee and the investigation committee.  This has ensured, on the one hand, the right to confidentiality of those who want only to access the therapeutic role of the commission and, on the other hand, rights to natural justice of persons accused of abuse.</P>
        <P>The confidential committee has provided a forum for 1,090 victims of abuse to recount their experiences on an entirely confidential basis.  The purpose of this committee is to meet the needs of those victims who want to speak of their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure.  The confidential committee is in the process of completing the final draft of the committee&rsquo;s report and the report and its conclusions will be presented to the board of the commission.</P><Col N="1035"/>
        <P>The investigation committee has been investigating complaints and allegations made to it.  It has the power to compel persons accused to attend before it and to produce any documents it requires.  Therefore, the investigation committee is facilitating victims who wish to recount their experiences and to have allegations of abuse fully inquired into.  To date, part of the investigation committee&rsquo;s activities have included full hearings for 252 people, with 545 people interviewed by documentary junior counsel and 41 had both an interview and a full hearing.</P>
        <P>The investigation committee has also held public hearings into a number of specific institutions.  Evidence has been submitted to the investigation committee at public hearings relating to the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  Currently most of the hearings and interviews have been completed but the investigation committee may hold further hearings if it deems it necessary to complete its work.  This committee is in the process of writing its report.  While no further hearings are planned, the commissioners are working hard to review a very large body of oral and documentary evidence which will form the basis for the report.  On completion, the commission will publish its report directly to the public.  This is an important feature of the independence of the commission.  The report of the commission will be based on the reports of its committees.</P>
        <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act provides that in its report the commission may identify institutions in which abuse occurred and the people responsible and make findings in regard to the role and responsibility of management and regulatory authorities.  The report, however, following the recommendation of the commission, will not make findings on any individual case.  The commission in its report may also make recommendations relating to measures to alleviate the effects of abuse on victims.</P>
        <P>The publication of the report will not represent the end of the commission&rsquo;s operations.  There are other functions to be performed, which statutorily can continue after the specified period has lapsed.  These include settlement of all third party legal representation costs, management of discovery documentation held by the commission, the carrying out of any work related to post-publication of reports and management of the commission&rsquo;s general shut-down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission, during the period of its existence, has been the recipient of a very large body of extremely confidential and sensitive material.  Consequently and in accordance with section 6 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, it will have to make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for the making of as complete a record as is practicable of the proceedings of the commission and the committees.  It will also be charged with making arrangements for the custody or disposal of the documents provided for the commission.  The time and complexity involved in the completion of these tasks should not be underestimated.</P>
        <P>Expenditure for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse from inception to the end of 2007 was &euro;43.7 million.  At this point, it is estimated that an additional provision in the region of &euro;45 million to &euro;55 million may be required to meet remaining overall costs of the commission to the end of 2009.  The 2008 allocation of &euro;18.1 million will meet part of this liability.  This is a tentative provision, given that the commission has yet to receive and assess a large volume of third party legal costs.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for approving this resolution by supporting the motion last week.  The benefits in supporting this motion are clear.  We have enabled the commission to finalise its statutory mandate, we have provided the legal basis through which the Government and this House have previously decided that the commission would report and we have provided the opportunity for a regrettable episode in Irish history to be recorded fully, accurately and fairly.  We have also allowed for the commission inquiry to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</P><Col N="1036"/>
        <P>The publication of the report, containing the findings and recommendations of the commission, is an essential part of the service which the Government can render to our society.  However, while Irish society as a whole can benefit from its work, let us not forget that this is primarily a commission for the victims of abuse.  The work of the commission and its public report is an opportunity for them to receive the type of respectful and sympathetic hearing to which it is entitled.  I thank Senators for recognising the significance in supporting this motion and their approval of it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  We in Fine Gael are delighted to be able to support the work of the commission and the extension of time required to complete the report.</P>
        <P>This episode of child abuse, which went on for years in the 20th century in our country, is regrettable.  It went on in our institutions and involved people in positions of authority.  My concern is that we would now examine what we have in place to safeguard children of the present and future.  We are concerned that the commission should report on the past &mdash; the report should be published as early as possible &mdash; but we must also think of today and tomorrow.</P>
        <P>We must protect and monitor children in institutions and schools working with those in positions of trust.  Vetting must be more comprehensive and we must not fail again.  In that regard I will focus in particular on the Children First guidelines.  As the Minister of State rightly said, the commission provides for two committees, which is a very good brief, namely, the confidential committee and the investigative committee.  The confidential committee has heard from 1,090 victims of child abuse.  We need to know from the report if those victims were satisfied with that process because that is the very least we owe them.  Society owes a debt to victims of child abuse.  They have been let down by the very institutions set up in the State to take care of them.</P>
        <P>Regarding the full hearings for 252 people, my hunch is that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I am sure many more people suffered from child abuse than those who had the courage to come forward.  We know from recent statistics that one in four were and are victims of child abuse.  That is a staggering figure.  A recent Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation report shows that 25% of all teachers in the Republic have made a complaint of concern about either neglect or sexual, physical or emotional abuse.  That is the range we are looking at with the Children First guidelines.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State said he needed a projected &euro;45 million to &euro;55 million to enable the commission complete its work by the end of 2009.  Will he clarify when responding if those moneys will be forthcoming from the Government?  I ask that question given the reneging on promises in other areas.  This commission is welcome, however, for the sake of truth and we must move on that.</P>
        <P>Last night I spoke to a teacher who was quite formidable in that she was one of the people involved in the rollout of the Children First guidelines.  She was charged with that responsibility on behalf of the State and the Department of Education and Science.  The national guidelines <Col N="1037"/>were written for all professionals involved with children &mdash; teachers, nurses, garda&iacute;, etc.  Teachers&rsquo; only duty is to report to what is called the designated liaison person or the deputy designated liaison person in their schools their concerns or suspicions that some form of child abuse may be taking place.  Generally, the liaison person is a senior member of staff; in many cases it is the principal but not necessarily so.  Each of those groups issued a further set of guidelines giving guidance to their staff in conjunction with the Children First national set of guidelines.</P>
        <P>I have a number of concerns, the first of which is that the guidelines are not mandatory.  That makes one think differently about one&rsquo;s work.  It would be a major decision for our nation to have mandatory guidelines and the next step would be to have a debate on whether to make the Children First guidelines mandatory.</P>
        <P>I did my Master&rsquo;s degree in education in Connecticut, in the United States.  At that time I was teaching in New York State.  I was trained in the area of child protection, as part of that Master&rsquo;s programme, in a way that the guidelines were mandatory.  I had a mandatory responsibility to report any suspicion or evidence I had of neglect.  When I returned to the school in New York where I was teaching &mdash; this was 15 years ago &mdash; that awareness and training made me view differently the children in my class.  I felt fearful that I might neglect some form of abuse, and cases of neglect were reported by me and other colleagues who did that course as a result of that heightened awareness.</P>
        <P>We do not have that type of training here yet but it must happen in a broader sense in terms of whether we should move down the mandatory route.  Last night I spoke to my colleague who was involved in the rollout of the Children First guidelines.  She believes schools are concerned because the school is the only group that would see the family every day they may have reported&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and be aware of the lack of staffing at Health Service Executive level to follow up on the problems.</P>
        <P>Last week, in another debate involving the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, I stated that 50 cases of neglect were reported by garda&iacute; to the HSE West.  The social worker there told me she did not have anybody to open those files.  Her words to me were, &ldquo;Children are suffering.  There is no doubt&rdquo;.  What do we intend to do to protect our children today and tomorrow?  Where will we take it from here?  Schools are concerned that they do not have the support from the HSE and the social workers.  It is not the fault of the social workers.  They are hard-pressed professionals.</P>
        <P>Another case that comes to mind is the 50% of reports made in Galway, for example.  There were more than 1,500 cases of neglect last year, more than 750 of which were from the non-national community.  We need a rollout of training and information to explain that certain types of behaviour, chastisement and abuses are not acceptable in this country.  That is of major concern.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commission&rsquo;s work but I put in the caveat that we must also look to the future.  There must be a full rollout of training on the Children First guidelines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>She is obviously an expert in this area and had far more to say than I had intended to say.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I want to make two points.  The fact that the work has not been done on time should not discourage us in the future from ensuring time limits are put in place.  There is a danger that if we do not impose time limits the period for the work will extend.  I support the measure but we should not be discouraged by that aspect.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">When Senator Healy Eames asked what was in place now my attention was drawn to the scandal of the non-availability of social services to children outside normal business hours.  I am aware of some cases where garda&iacute; found instances of abuse, took the children into care but had nowhere to place them after hours because the social services close at either 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. on week days and are not available at weekends.  The only place they can keep those children to protect them is in the local garda station.  That is not right.  I use this opportunity to encourage the Minister to determine what can be done to avoid the scandal of the non-availability of social services for children suffering abuse after business hours and at weekends.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Norris asked me to raise another point although I am not sure I understood it entirely.  He is of the impression that Church of Ireland institutions were not included in these areas.  I am not sure if that is the case, and I do not know if he was clear on it either, but he asked me to ask the Minister to ensure that Church of Ireland institutions are included in these areas.  I thank Senator Healy Eames for sharing her time and allowing me make those two points.  I appreciate the opportunity to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that any of us have to talk about a commission to inquire into child abuse.  None of us would have wanted to stand over any regime, particularly State institutions, that would have facilitated people to abuse children sexually, physically, psychologically or emotionally.  The key form of abuse that comes to mind is sexual abuse but that is not the only form of abuse.</P>
      
        <P>I have asked a number of times in this House for a debate on bullying and abuse in the workplace.  Bullying is not a behaviour perpetrated solely by children but if an innocent person is accused of bullying that is one of the worst things that can happen.  There have been situations where people have had their lives devastated by claims of abuse and, after years during which their lives were destroyed, those who made the claims withdrew them and revealed that they were invented.</P>
        <P>However, despite these caveats I believe that sexual abuse, in particular, is as bad as murder.  Those who commit sexual abuse on children damage those children for the rest of their lives.  An abused child is never the same child afterwards and will not become the adult that he or she would have been had it not been for the interference.  It may sound strange to say that <Col N="1039"/>murder is equal to abuse, but if the child were dead he or she would not have to endure the memories and the difficulties caused by the abuse.  Physical, psychological and emotional abuse have serious implications as well.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn about putting time limits in place.  I have never known a tribunal that had time limits, or one that finished its work on time, yet we should aspire to keep within such limits where possible.  I am not against the suggestion of an additional eight months in the present situation.  In 2000, the inquiry was to have been a two-year process.  In 2002, another three year extension brought it to 2005 and a further three have brought it to the present.  We would like to think that the eight month extension is the last.  I say this because the people involved are not as young as they were.  It is important for them to have taken their courage in their hands and to re-live their experiences.  While the process has been private, the recommendations and the publication of the report will once again open up a great deal of the past for them.  It has taken much bravery for people to come forward and over 1,090 have done so.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects to consider.  One is that there are people who wish to tell their story but do not want it to go further.  The other concerns those who come forward in order that issues be dealt with.  When we consider the numbers involved it is easy to understand why it has taken so long to get to where we are now.  The fact is that those people have had the opportunity to come forward, whether for the full hearings, as 252 people did, or the 545 who spoke to junior counsel or the 41 who presented by interview and full hearing.  It is an enormous volume of work and has involved different Departments.</P>
        <P>For some people, the sympathetic or empathetic ear has been important and it is what they sought.  I believe that the most important thing is the lessons we have learned.  We must understand that such abuse is potentially still going on, as go on it must, when we consider what life is like today.  People are working and must leave their children, who, as latchkey children must fend for themselves.  It is not necessarily the fault of parents who may be trying to pay their mortgage.  There is so much going on, including the pace of life, a new society, people coming from different cultural backgrounds who have different understandings of how to discipline children, some of which we do not accept.  We must show people from other locations that our forms of corporal punishment have disappeared.  I speak as somebody who was in Nigeria for a year, and I remember some cultural traits.  Certain groups of people there branded their children at birth, actually slit them, to show to which tribe they belonged.  Those are the kinds of issues to be addressed.  We do not have to go into the issue of female genital mutilation.  Multi-culturalism is fine, but as long as people from different cultures are living here we must put forward our views on how we expect children to be looked after and respected.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to some issues that were brought up in the D&aacute;il and I know they will be discussed in this House also.  One in four teachers in primary schools have made disclosures about or allegations of abuse to the HSE and we have heard how that organisation has been able to deal with that situation.  When people present as potential suicide risks I believe it must be borne in mind that in the past some suicides occurred because of previous abuse.  I do not put every such person in the same category.  When a teacher or a person in any responsible role comes forward and identifies an issue it is critically important there is someone available to take up the mantle and deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>My next comment may be considered a sexist one.  Deputy Alan Shatter, a member of the other House, observed that more than 150 social workers in the child care services of the HSE are currently on some form of leave, many on maternity leave.  Far be it for me, as a female, to raise this issue but it is important and pertinent to consider what occurs with numbers of people working in different sectors, whether they be garda&iacute;, health or any other professionals.  If a female garda is pregnant, she is on desk duty for the greater part of nine months and is then <Col N="1040"/>on maternity leave.  That amounts to a year, possibly 18 months, where the worker, statistically speaking, is present but in reality is not.  Some 150 social workers are on leave, though not necessarily on maternity leave.  We must look at the  statistics of people actually in work, not merely those who are paid for work.  We should continue to increase the numbers and take into consideration the issue of gender, because in any given profession a certain number of people will be off work for the most justifiable and normal reasons.</P>

	<P>Senator Keaveney, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of existing legislation was also raised.  That is related to the point I made.  We know, regardless of our walk of life, that the law is there.  The law must be amenable to implementation, however, and so it is important that people be there to enforce it.  </P>
        <P>Recently a young child in England was discovered to have starved to death.  It is incredible to think such a thing can happen in this part of the world in this day and age.  I do not wish to concentrate on teachers but I know that people who work with children are being vetted.  That is right but there was a time when it was difficult to get people vetted as speedily as they were needed in whichever service they worked.  That might have been an issue with the community organisations concerned, be it football or such like.  I understand that the Minister for State has introduced vetting for young teachers coming through college.  It is important that others coming back into the profession, perhaps after working abroad, would also undergo this process.</P>
        <P>We must try to find a way for people who have suffered abuse to come forward.  Why does it take 20, 30 or even 40 years before people have the confidence, or feel enabled to come forward and say that they have been abused?  If we could find the key to that I believe we would also find a key to understanding suicide.  The Council of Europe published a report some weeks ago in which one of the key statements made by the rapporteur was that adolescents tend to commit suicide because of a fear of failure or because of failure itself.  I said that I did not believe this and that my belief was that adolescents may commit suicide because of an inability to communicate, whatever the reason that may be.  Perhaps they could not communicate their fear of failure or their sense of perceived failure to someone who might have helped.  This is as applicable to the issue under consideration as it is in the issue of suicide.  There are many young people in the Visitors Gallery.  If any of them are in trouble how might we get them to talk to someone?  If they did do so, how can we be sure that the person they have talked to can operate on a level that will yield the required results?</P>
        <P>If we examine the role of the HSE as it works with the Department of Education and Science we find many instances where the two bodies are blaming each other.  They must come together and decide what is to be done.  A very simple example concerns the predicament of a music therapist in Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Buncrana.  The National Council for Special Education says the matter is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive and the HSE says the Department of Education and Science is responsible because the case arises in a school.</P>
        <P>Those who stand over rapists or abusers and say they know them better than the judge who has just convicted them, perhaps after the perpetrators have admitted guilt, are not being <Col N="1041"/>helpful.  Those who have been involved in abuse have been perceived as pillars of society.  Any other pillar of society who states he or she knows an abuser better than the judge, thereby seeking a lenient sentence, is not doing anyone a service.</P>
        <P>I wish the groups involved with the commission well.  I hope the process has offered some comfort to victims and I trust it will lead to the empathy, sympathy and action that are required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party supports this motion.  I accept that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse has requested an extension of eight months to the end of January 2009.  My party views this request favourably.</P>
        <P>In many ways, this matter concerns the extension of the commission&rsquo;s period of inquiry.  The substantive debate on the need for the inquiry into child abuse took place around the time of the enactment of the legislation in 2000, and also during its amendment in 2005.</P>
        <P>There are two aspects to the extension of the timeframe.  Will it lead to some victims not receiving justice?  I do not believe so.  The second aspect concerns the cost.  The Minister of State indicated a figure of &euro;45 million to &euro;55 million.  In the context of bringing the process to completion, it is worth spending that money.</P>
        <P>Through the commission&rsquo;s ongoing work, a great many people who had previously remained silent have had their cases heard and, when they wished, investigated by both the investigative committee and the confidential committee.  The Minister of State said the latter committee provided a space for over 1,000 victims to testify, in a fully confidential manner, to what they had undergone.  Given that the investigative committee is in the process of writing its report based on the large volume of oral and documentary evidence received, which will be presented to the public on completion, we are agreeable to allowing the extension requested by the commission.</P>
        <P>I hope and trust the commission&rsquo;s work can be completed in a timely and satisfactory manner.  Society will gain from the publication of the report and, most importantly, the victims of child abuse will have been given the chance to have a humane and respectful hearing.  Given the importance of the recommendations the report will disclose, it should be completed and published as a matter of urgency.  I hope the commission will not seek even more time.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, who must work with a new Minister and Taoiseach.  I wish him well in his role of dealing with problems associated with education.</P>
        <P>We are here today purely to sanction the extension of the period in which the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse can complete its work and fulfil its statutory mandate.  It has done a great job.  It was established purely to inquire into child abuse, be it physical or sexual, to set up the financial redress scheme for victims and to provide counselling.  The education finance board was set up to facilitate that process.</P>
        <P>The commission was established to help those who wanted to tell their stories and outline how and why their abuse occurred.  This was not easy for any victim and I compliment the commission in this regard.  From knowing some of the people who had to listen to the stories, I understand the importance of empathy and putting victims at ease.  This was not very easy and the staff have done so very successfully.  I know some of the victims who told their stories and understand they were very pleased after they had done so.  It made them feel good.  They wanted no more than the therapy that telling their stories afforded.  That is important and I am glad the commission got it right.</P>
        <P>I am glad the investigative committee allowed the commission to bring the accused to heel.  This is probably why there was a delay.  There was so much documentation to take on board. <Col N="1042"/> The investigative committee has the power to confront the accused with the details outlined by the victims, which is very important.</P>
        <P>It is well worth the cost of extending the commission&rsquo;s timeframe to allow it to produce its report.  When it is published in eight months, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that society at large understands what happened since the 1940s.  We must realise there was a different society in the 1940s, characterised by institutions.  There was a way of life that was protected and physical or sexual abuse was nearly the norm in those days.  The abuse was not condemned.  Society will not tolerate it ever again.  The commission will have to ensure it sends out signals to this effect.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Senators asked how we can ensure society will not tolerate abuse in the future.  As a counsellor I dealt with problems in the education system and learned the importance of creating the home-school links and understanding how families work.  It is a question of following through and putting in place appropriate infrastructure such that the gaps that exist after 4 p.m. are not left wide open.  The commission and Department will have a duty to ensure the existence of such infrastructure and a network.  The commission must take on board its documentation and publish its report, after which it will finalise its work on investigating the sexual and physical abuse of the past.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget that society and infrastructure have changed.  There are more dysfunctional backgrounds and dysfunctional families nowadays and there is human trafficking.  We must deal with these issues on a larger scale.  The problems are more visible than they used to be and it should therefore be easier to tackle them.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the former Taoiseach on establishing the commission and on apologising to the victims in respect of the atrocities perpetrated on them.  We must look to the future.  The commission, when it publishes its final report, should send out a very strong signal to the effect that abuse will not be tolerated by society and that the Department of Health and Children will put in place guidelines for educationalists and health officials to ensure the protection of our children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to approve the motion to extend for a further eight months the investigative period of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
        <P>This debate is taking place because it is necessary under the Act for both Houses of the Oireachtas to approve the order to extend the commission&rsquo;s term.  While the Green Party is happy to do so, the order provides Members with another welcome opportunity to discuss child protection.  A debate was held in the House recently, which was attended by the new Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, in respect of serious concerns regarding child protection that arose from a recent &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme.  It is fitting that Members should have another opportunity to discuss the issue today.</P>
        <P>In this debate I wish to touch on the lessons that have accrued from the experience of setting up the commission, allowing it to carry out its work and, as it enters its final phase, allowing it to complete its report and make the necessary preparations for its publication.  First, I refer to <Col N="1043"/>the expenditure on the commission.  No one questions whether the commission provided a highly valuable function in investigating the abuses that occurred in institutions in Ireland between the 1940s and the present day.  Moreover, it listened to the victims of childhood abuse who wished to recount their experiences, both for the therapeutic purposes of so doing and because it had the function of investigating fully all allegations made to it, except when a victim did not wish for an investigation.</P>
        <P>The final stage of the commission&rsquo;s work will be to publish a report on its findings.  The business of compiling such a report, to reflect accurately all the testimonies, documentation and so on that were made available to the commission during its existence, will constitute a significant body of work.  The report should make clear and adequate recommendations in respect of such institutional abuse and deficits in the State&rsquo;s child protection system that will enable safeguards to be put in place to ensure that such situations never recur within the State&rsquo;s institutions or within State bodies.</P>
        <P>As a result of the commission&rsquo;s findings, it is expected to make a number of recommendations on the issue of child protection.  One such recommendation should make clear the system that is required in respect of reporting allegations.  It has emerged from the commission&rsquo;s inquiries that there is an absolute need for a clear and statutory basis on which to report allegations of abuse.  This does not simply refer to the residential institutions at which, in the main, the commission directed its attention.  The issue must be broadened and, as other Members have mentioned, schools, for example, must be examined.  I refer in particular to primary schools for which clear and official guidelines are required on reporting abuse.  Moreover, sufficient training must be provided for staff members in such schools for so doing.  One should not simply consider that the appointment of a single individual within a school with responsibility for this area means the issue has been catered for.  Adequate training for staff is highly important in primary schools in particular, as well as in secondary schools.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has arisen regarding schools concerns the vetting of teachers.  This matter has been raised in the D&aacute;il with particular emphasis on substitute teachers.  While I understand that at present, more than 1,000 substitute teachers work in primary schools, the system to vet such teachers is non-existent.  Such issues must be examined because the work of the commission and the highlighting of other issues by the media have led to the realisation that there is an absolute need for a strict vetting system for those who work in close proximity to children in a number of different sectors.</P>
        <P>The Green Party hopes the commission&rsquo;s recommendations will help to put in place such a system and the Minister should act quickly on the basis of its recommendations.  It is expected that the recommendations, or at least the commission&rsquo;s report, will be available in early 2009.  The Minister should publish the report because of the work and expense that has gone into it.  Moreover, its contents and the commission&rsquo;s recommendations should be made publically available because they will contain many lessons for everyone.</P>
        <P>I also wish to comment on the model of the commission because it carried out highly important work and was structured in a manner that probably ensured that the functions and remit given to it were fulfilled properly.  One of the ways in which this was achieved should be replicated in other such commissions set up by the Oireachtas in future.  As the Minister of State noted, before the commission&rsquo;s formal establishment the Government set it up on an administrative basis in May 1999.  Its first objective was to consider the broad terms of reference provided to it to ascertain whether they required refinement.  Thereafter, the commission recommended to the Government the powers and protections it would require to do its work effectively.  This is a very good model for the establishment of any commission.  Moreover, the powers it was given enabled it to do its work.  It had the protection that a court would enjoy, <Col N="1044"/>including privilege for witnesses and their compellability, discovery of documents, taking evidence on oath and offences for failure to co-operate or for obstruction.</P>
        <P>While it is estimated that the expenditure on the commission up to the end of 2007 was &euro;43.7 million, it also is estimated that an additional provision of approximately &euro;45 million may be required to meet its remaining costs.  Although the commission&rsquo;s work is extremely important, this is a substantial amount of money to spend.  Therefore, I repeat it is important to get value for money.  Whatever recommendations may be produced in the commission&rsquo;s report should be published and the Minister should act speedily on them.  Lessons have been learned regarding the arrangement that was made with the religious institutions involved.  Were the Oireachtas to set up a similar body, it is unlikely that the circumstances in which it would be set up would be similar in future.  However, there have been learning opportunities for the State in this regard and in future, one should seek to make satisfactory arrangements to ensure the State is not writing a blank cheque when it establishes a body such as this.  On behalf of the Green Party, I support the extension of the commission&rsquo;s term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I welcome back to the Chamber the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.  I congratulate him on his re-appointment as Minister of State and on his retention of his previous brief.  This is not a surprise because he is doing an outstanding job there, particularly in respect of lifelong learning.</P>
        <P>I will be brief because much of what I had intended to say already has been covered and I will confine myself to one or two points.  I support the extension of time for the commission to complete its important work, which must be brought to fruition.  I commend the Opposition in both Houses on the positive approach it has taken to this issue.  While reading the Official Report on the D&aacute;il debate on this matter, I was struck by the compassion, humanity and practicality of all the contributions.  I include the contributions made in this House today by Senators Ryan and Healy Eames.  The horror of child abuse and the manner in which all decent people recoil from it unite people, who will work together to ensure they can afford the maximum protection to young people.</P>
        <P>I was delighted to learn today that the report will be published and made available to the public.  Clearly the report will inform the Government on whatever future steps it will take to minimise child abuse and afford maximum protection.  I may be repeating sentiments already expressed when I say the commission&rsquo;s work is retrospective and will teach us to deal with the problem in future.  The report will not solve all of the problems and, pending its publication, we still have no idea what goes on in society.  We do not know the individual horrors young people may be experiencing as we have this debate in Leinster House.  That defenceless young people should be subjected to attack and abuse will touch everyone to the core.</P>
        <P>This matter hits the headlines now and again when situations like the recent one involving that monster in Austria come to light.  It is difficult to understand how such humans exist but abuse goes on at a wider and more subtle level.  I am no expert in this area but I would say parental abuse of children is the most difficult to detect.  It takes place in the home, it involves family, it is secretive and one wonders how much ever comes to light.</P>
        <P>There is, of course, institutional abuse and schools are regularly mentioned in this regard because teachers work<i> in loco parentis</i>.  Teachers have huge responsibilities that, in the main, they discharge exceptionally well.  In this regard I compliment the teachers&rsquo; unions because they have been proactive on this issue and as recently as last week the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, held a conference on how teachers can detect and report abuse and manage complaints.  It has been stated that one in every four teachers has had an allegation of or has had to report child abuse.  I taught for 20 years and was not especially involved in such <Col N="1045"/>detection, though I was part of a team in a school with an effective mentoring process.  School chaplaincies have been very good in this regard, although bishops do not have as many priests at their disposal as they had and many chaplains are now lay people.  The area has been diluted.  These people have experience and my colleague, Senator Ormonde, as a counsellor, had the necessary conviction and passion to address this matter.  One cannot beat the human element provided by the caring professions.</P>
        <P>Teachers are vetted, except for untrained substitute teachers as Senator de B&uacute;rca mentioned.  I spoke to some friends of mine at the weekend, including two school principals, and they are the designated officers for this matter in their schools.  They feel inadequate and without proper training.  It is less a matter of resources and more a matter of experience and training in how to handle these situations.  They take these matters seriously.  What level of vetting is applied to other professions that interact with young people, including the medical and clerical areas?  I am aware of vetting in the teaching profession but I am not aware of it in other areas.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators asked a number of questions I would like to address.  I thank them for their constructive contributions, for agreeing to this motion by the deadline of 22 May and for postponing the discussion until today.  I have listened carefully to their points in this debate.  The commission&rsquo;s final report is expected to be finished in November 2008 and published by the end of January 2009.</P>
        <P>Many Senators rightly focused on what is happening today and procedures for the future of child protection, despite the fact that this motion deals with the past, and I welcome this focus.  The primary statutory responsibility for child protection lies with the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the role of the Department of Education and Science is to provide guidance and support to schools in implementing child protection policy, apply proper child protection procedures and refer any allegations received to the appropriate authorities for investigation.  The Department of Education and Science has issued child protection guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools.  In February 2007 the Department of Education and Science issued revised internal guidelines on procedures which have been circulated to all persons employed by the Department.  The guidelines were based on the Children First document, the national guidelines of the Department of Health and Children.  The purpose of these guidelines is to provide direction and guidance to staff in dealing with any allegations or complaints of abuse made to the Department.  It goes without saying that the Department of Education and Science will conduct a review of its procedures in light of the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the review of Children First &mdash; the national child protection guidelines, and in the event of the ratification of the children&rsquo;s referendum.  An ongoing review is under way in this regard.</P>
        <P>Child protection guidelines have issued to primary and post-primary schools on the handling and reporting of child abuse, in line with the Children First policy document.  The Department has provided training to designated liaison persons on the implementation of the guidelines.  Child protection issues have been examined as part of a range of measures that include the Stay Safe programme.</P>
        <P>Regarding making guidelines mandatory, on foot of the recent report known as the McElwee report an interdepartmental group has been established to consider its recommendations, including the recommendation to place the guidelines on a statutory basis.  It will report its <Col N="1046"/>findings to the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn and others mentioned out-of-hours services by social workers.  In this regard the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, has placed on the record his appreciation for work carried out by social work teams and management.  These individuals are hard working and dedicated and routinely deal with cases that are becoming ever more difficult, complex and intractable.  Regarding social work provision, I am aware that social work out-of-hours service proposals are under consideration by the Health Service Executive.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children will examine these in the context of the Department of Health and Children to see how the service can best be introduced nationwide.  Notwithstanding this move towards a national approach, there are a number of out-of-hours service arrangements in operation to partially cover the service around the country, for example, dealing with homelessness in Dublin.  I accept what Senators have said in this regard.</P>
        <P>Regarding the child welfare and protection policy unit, child protection is a key part of the agenda of the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children.  More than &euro;240 million in additional funding has been provided since 1997 in the areas of child welfare, family support and child protection.  An extensive programme of specialised residential provision for a small number of children and a range of other child welfare and family support services have been put in place in recent years.  The HSE informs me it has created more than 300 new social work posts since the start of 2005.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan and others mentioned vetting, and special arrangements for newly qualified teachers are co-ordinated through the Teaching Council.  Existing teachers are currently not vetted but the Department is working with the appropriate authorities to consider how best to put arrangements in place as the roll-out of the Garda vetting unit expands.  Irrespective of the position on vetting, where facts are brought to the attention of a school, it must be vigilant in checking references and probing any gaps in records.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn mentioned Church of Ireland institutions.  Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 sets out the criteria which must be met in order for an institution to be considered eligible for inclusion in the Schedule of the Act.  The religious ethos of an institution is not one of those criteria and has never been considered by the Department of Education and Science in deciding whether an institution should be included.  However, it does appear that 19 non-Catholic institutions are mentioned in the Schedule, five of which have a Protestant ethos.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and for their support of this motion.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister.  Everyone is of one mind here in that our overall aim is to protect the children of today and those of the future.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to hear that the interdepartmental group is considering the proposal to make the Children First guidelines mandatory.  Does the Minister of State plan a full roll-out, as he promised at the outset, of the Children First guidelines for all teachers and not just the designated liaison person or deputy designated liaison person at each school?  I do not know whether any of us mentioned sports clubs; I omitted to do so.  What type of training are we providing in this regard?  Such clubs take responsibility for children at later hours in the evening.  How will we reach the non-national community, particularly parents who have their own ways of chastising children that are not acceptable to us in this country?</P>

	<P>The Minister of State mentioned the interdepartmental aspect of this work and that the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform were involved.

Has that Department had any input into the guidelines on child protection?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the issue of the ability of children to communicate their difficulties, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that music and arts therapies are not professionally recognised in this country although they are in every other English-speaking country in the world.  Arts therapies, such as art, drama or music therapy, are recognised for their ability to facilitate communication by people at risk who may not be able to communicate through words.  Is the Minister familiar with music therapy and will he lend his support to increasing the use of these therapies?  These are not community music groups but clinical interventions which in most other countries involve multi-disciplinary teams.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Keaveney raised this issue on the Adjournment recently as I delivered the reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  That reply is on the record of the House.  I will contact the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to see what progress has been made.  The Senator made a good case for music therapy when I listened to her previously.  I will investigate the progress that has been made in this regard.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the Department will conduct a review of its procedures in light of the publication of the report we are debating today.  The review will include the Children First guidelines and any other issues arising from the possible ratification of the proposals in the children&rsquo;s referendum.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by Senator Healy Eames were considered in the McElwee report and are now being considered by the interdepartmental committee.  The Garda vetting unit is a relatively new operation.  In my previous role as Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs I had a lot of contact with that group, which is doing extremely good work.  The different categories of staff for the vetting unit are gradually being installed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my understanding of it, although the Teaching Council also has a role to play in this regard.  I can check this for the Senator to be absolutely clear.</P>

        <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  When I spoke previously, I referred to RTE and other broadcasters providing periods of children&rsquo;s programming free from advertising.  Advertising to children works and is considered lucrative within the business, with top advertising agencies introducing children&rsquo;s divisions.  Children of less than 12 years of age may not be able to recognise traditional advertising compared to normal programming or its sales promoting nature.  The influence of advertising on children&rsquo;s lives may include incidents of pester power, for example, repetitive requests for junk foods high in fat and salt, a matter referred to in the Bill, that force parents to buy what they might otherwise not, resulting in obesity.  The copying of behaviour is common, thereby affecting attitudes.  Television advertising in particular is believed to have a profound effect on children.</P>
        <P>In Austria, there is no advertising during children&rsquo;s programmes.  In Norway, there is no advertising in connection with children&rsquo;s programmes.  In Sweden, advertising targeted at children under 12 years of age is not allowed.  Those countries believe that it is not morally acceptable to use television, a powerful advertising medium, as a means of targeting children and that advertising on television is used to cheat young children who are unable to understand exactly what is occurring.  Ireland has no such ban, but should it?  It is inappropriate to target children with advertising, particularly in respect of fast food-type products where copied behaviour in an imperfectly controlled environment &mdash; for example, families in which both parents work &mdash; may result in obesity.</P>
        <P>However, the argument is not only concerned with obesity and junk food, which are referred to in the Bill.  It may be about toys, computers, clothes, etc.  Children, particularly those under the age of 12 years, should have commercial-free periods of television viewing in their homes.  A policy response that requires broadcasters to provide a number of hours per day of commercial-free children&rsquo;s television programming is a small fight against what Sweden refers to as the morally unacceptable.  Will the Minister of State consider my suggestions?  The Labour Party will consider whether it will table amendments to extend the ban into areas other than junk foods.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly stated, it is disappointing that no restriction will be placed on alcohol advertising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s publication.  As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources stated last week, it is detailed and comprehensive legislation that proposes to amend and repeal broadcasting legislation dating back more than 50 years.  It is a significant and unprecedented achievement and I congratulate the Minister and his officials <Col N="1049"/>on putting together in one Bill all of these initiatives and regulations in respect of the independent and public broadcasting sectors.</P>
        <P>I agree that the listener and the viewer should be central to the debate and our broadcasting regime, an aspect of the Bill that the Minister emphasised.  It must not be a matter of the promotion of individual interests, including those of public or private sector broadcasters.  I will revert to this issue when I address the sound and vision fund referred to in the Bill.  It is a question of putting the listener and the viewer centre stage in determining what type of broadcasting regime we desire.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains a number of welcome innovative provisions.  For example, section 8 proposes to involve the joint committee in the appointment of members of the authority&rsquo;s board and the RTE board.  The Minister stated that some Members &mdash; he seemed to refer to Fine Gael Members, but they can speak for themselves &mdash; may have favoured a procedure for vetting proposed board members as opposed to a formal proposing role.  He indicated his preference for the latter, in respect of which I support him.  The committee should have a more proactive role in the appointment of board members of the authority and RTE and its involvement should have substance.</P>
        <P>As well as addressing the broad sweep of requirements in a broadcasting regime, the legislation maintains RTE and TG4 but deals with them separately.  The relevant sections seem faithfully to repeat what has gone before while also seeking to modernise and streamline many of the provisions relating to public broadcasters.</P>
        <P>The legislation includes several significant and innovative changes.  The Minister referred to the introduction of an Oireachtas channel.  This is something we have raised in the House on previous occasions.  It is an important development and I hope it will be operational sooner rather than later.  There was a suggestion that it would be launched next year.  I urge the Minister to do what he can to expedite it.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that one of his objectives in bringing forward this legislation is to shift the legislative basis of the television licence regime from wireless telegraphy to broadcasting legislation.  One may wonder what that means.  For many years, we have had an anachronistic approach to broadcasting, although there has been some change in this regard in the last ten or 20 years.  For a long time, however, the attitude of the Government, Civil Service and of many politicians was proprietorial.  It is not so long ago that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s hero, Mr. Se&aacute;n Lemass, declared that RTE had been set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and, as such, was responsible to the Government.  He further stated that the Government rejected the view that &ldquo;RTE should be, either in general or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Mr. Lemass made that statement in the 1960s in reference to the 1960 legislation which will be repealed by this Bill.  There are echoes of this attitude from time to time in this Chamber when Members are upset by something they see on RTE.  However, in general, the view put forward by Mr. Lemass is no longer part of our culture.  It is important that we have put our view of broadcasting onto a new plane, one that is more intelligent and more faithful to the purpose of broadcasting.  Public service broadcasting should not be an instrument of public policy &mdash; and especially not of Government policy &mdash; but rather a vital aspect of our democratic system and culture in the broadest possible sense.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have referred to the provision which maintains the sound and vision fund, which was established under the 2003 legislation, whereby 5% of the proceeds of the licence fee is given over to independent productions.  While RTE itself can benefit from this fund, it has a broader application.  We must be cautious in terms of any proposal to change this.  There is no such proposal in the Bill.  Some of my colleagues expressed disappointment that this is so. <Col N="1050"/> Section 5 of the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003, which will be repealed by this legislation, provided that a review of the fund should be undertaken within three years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, may correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that this review has not taken place.  There was little public debate in 2003 on the implications of establishing this fund.  I recall reports, whether accurate or otherwise, that there was some resistance in the higher echelons of the Department in this regard.  Nevertheless, that legislation was enacted in late 2003.</P>
        <P>We can see the advantages that have accrued in recent years as a consequence of this provision.  One of the positives is the promotion and fostering of creative diversity.  Nobody can fairly argue that all creativity and knowledge repose in RTE in respect of what television and radio production ought to be.  On the other hand, there is an important debate to be had in regard to the protection of the public realm in broadcasting.  If we go down the road of dividing the licence fee among all the players, for which some have argued, it would have the inevitable consequence of eroding the funding base RTE requires in order to provide a comprehensive service.  Ultimately, this might seriously undermine the job we require RTE to do, which is to provide a public broadcasting service.</P>
        <P>It is strange, for example, that this fund can be availed of by independent broadcasters which are financed by private equity funding.  It is extraordinary that such entities do not have to match the funding they receive.  There must be a review of the fund before there is any suggestion of change.  The basis upon which independent companies can avail of it without having to match the funding should be one aspect of such a review.  How the fund is managed is important in terms of accountability.  The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has had problems to contend with in regard to accountability.  That should also be part of any review.</P>
        <P>I have heard the suggestion that this is about jobs and that the fund must be increased to favour job creation.  I respectfully suggest that it is not simply a question of jobs but is also of securing the best mix for broadcasting, both public and independent.  RTE already plays an important role in terms of support for the independent sector.  It is required to do so rather than doing so through any sense of charity.  That should continue.  However, RTE&rsquo;s position as the public service broadcaster should not be undermined through an erosion of its funding.  My party expressed reservations in 2003 about the establishment of this fund.  I have serious reservations about any suggestion of an increase in this fund beyond its current capacity without first undertaking the type of review we were promised in 2003 but which has not yet taken place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The production of such a detailed Bill, with 181 sections, is a testament to the work of the Minister and his officials.  All Members take seriously their responsibilities when a Bill is introduced in this House.  The Bill provides an opportunity to undertake an overview of broadcasting as it currently operates.  I do not consider myself as other than young middle aged but I recall a time, before I could vote, when broadcasting in this State consisted of no more than one radio station and one television station.  The radio station commenced broadcasting at 7.30 a.m. and the television station at 5.30 p.m., and both went off the air at 11 p.m.  In the decades since, we have seen the emergence of a panoply of new broadcast providers, as well as rapidly emerging new technologies.  This Bill is an attempt to address those changes.  No legislation, no matter how well drafted and how quickly provided, can keep pace with the speed of technological changes in the area of broadcasting.  It is an issue that the Department and we in this House will have to address again in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes several innovative measures.  The early sections relate to the introduction of a new body to replace both the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting <Col N="1051"/>Complaints Commission.  Given that the taskforce on public service reform has only begun its deliberations, as a useful first step, we should encourage the formation of new bodies composed of existing bodies that have complementary remits.  That is the first welcome reform in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White spoke about the second innovation, the selection procedures for board members of the new broadcasting authority and the RTE Authority and the role the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will play in that regard.  We should welcome this.  The system of public appointments has been a grey area in the past and we should work towards opening it up in so far as we can.  The greater involvement of elected representatives, particularly Oireachtas committees, in assessing the merits of and recommending people for appointment to public bodies on the basis of their experience and abilities should be given maximum encouragement.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill relates to duties, codes and rules and has been the subject of much comment during this debate.  Some Members believe that the explicit references to speech and news content might go too far in the context of allowing broadcasters the space to broadcast freely.  Unfortunately, however, we have seen, particularly with local radio stations and the commercial considerations that guide them, that we have created stations that are bland and devoid of personality.  The necessity for speech content and a particular local news feature helps those stations.  This is a general comment; I am aware there are some excellent local stations.  However, in the Dublin metropolitan area local radio is represented purely by music stations that are devoid of personality.  We must have, at least in legislation, a direction to encourage people down a different road.</P>
        <P>The opposite could be the case in terms of the regulations that might follow regarding codes, particularly in the area of advertising.  The Minister has already clearly stated that advertising directed at children must be strictly controlled.  I believe there is a large consensus in the House in support of that.  Other Members have mentioned that such a system already exists elsewhere in the world.  If we can convey that agreed consensus, I am satisfied that the regulations that will follow will be what is required.</P>
        <P>The area of public service broadcasting and the specific identification and enhancement of the roles of RTE and TG4 are welcome.  However, the debate on the Bill and its eventual passage should not indicate that commercial companies, both television and radio, are acceptable in terms of their current public service remit.  Public service broadcasting needs to be encouraged among those broadcasters.  In general, their public service content is poor.  The new radio station, Newstalk 106, is a welcome additional talk radio station but other radio broadcasters and, indeed, the new entrants into the television market have tended to opt for crass commercialism over public information.  It is a balance we must always get right in our broadcasting services and should not be an onus imposed solely on RTE and TG4, despite the excellence of TG4, in particular, in view of the short time it has been in existence.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to prepare the sector for the onset of digital broadcasting and the end of analogue broadcasting after 2012.  I am satisfied the Department has been doing the necessary fieldwork to ensure this happens, although we might be a year or two behind other jurisdictions in this regard.  In the UK, for example, digital channels have been up and running for up to five years and are becoming very popular.  When the stations are eventually on-stream, watching television using digital compatible televisions will change the experience and make it similar to the experience of listening to radio.  People already experience this with satellite television.  It means turning a dial and having hundreds of stations available rather than settling down to watch a particular programme on a particular station for a given length of time.  That will affect the way people watch television.</P><Col N="1052"/>
        <P>On satellite television the phenomenon of dedicated stations, sometimes to the most ridiculous subjects, has existed for many years.  There are stations dedicated to tarot card readings, for example, while football clubs have specialist stations.  While some people might sneer at the concept of a dedicated parliamentary station on digital television, there are far worse examples already on satellite television of how people&rsquo;s attention is being diverted.  There are also good examples of parliamentary broadcasting, such as the BBC Parliament channel and C-SPAN in the United States.  If we can achieve that level of excellence in our parliamentary broadcasting, we might encourage more people to take an interest in public affairs.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White made some comments about the fund for the independent sector.  I am not sure that I share his perspective.  The multiplicity of broadcasting stations, both television and radio, has been matched by an increase in the number of people in the independent sector who make programmes that can be sold to broadcasting outlets.  That should be encouraged.  I am not opposed to the existence of the fund but I am also not opposed to a review of the fund.  However, given that there have been inflationary pressures, an increase in the fund is justified.  The Bill is a little vague, and might be open to amendment, where it appears to give greater emphasis to independent producers in the television area and less to independent producers in radio.  The Minister should be encouraged to review this aspect of the Bill and accept necessary amendments.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The section relating to the television licence is one on which I am probably in disagreement with the Minister.  I accept that, given the economic situation, the type of changes we must put in place with the television licence probably cannot be done for several years.  The licence is a source of revenue and if the revenue is not provided through a direct licensing system, it would have to be provided from general taxation.  However, there is a difficulty in applying the concept of a television licence to advancing technology.  In this Bill we are changing the legislative aspect of the licence from a wireless licence to a broadcasting licence.  At the same time, however, the receipt of television programmes is possible on all types of technology that are not television set receivers.  It is possible to receive television programmes through the Internet and on mobile telephones, for example, and the likelihood is that people will increasingly receive television programmes in that manner rather than in the traditional way.  That raises the question of why a licensing system exists and why we have the associated administrative costs.  I accept the issue cannot be dealt with in this Bill but I believe that within the next decade, the existence of a television licence and how we administer the costs relating to public service broadcasting will have to be addressed.  I am confident the Minister is open to that type of thinking.</P>
        <P>I believe I have covered most aspects of the legislation.  This is an important, detailed Bill that covers most of the requirements in the sector.  Despite its size, I consider it a contribution to an ongoing debate on broadcasting.  I am aware the Minister would like to have the opportunity to introduce further legislation in this area, especially with regard to new technology, how we can check the revenue streams and the need to have codes that apply to that technology as they currently apply to terrestrial services.  When we have that wider debate we will be better informed as a result of having updated and amended this legislation and put better legislation in place.</P>
        
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and this debate on the Broadcasting Bill.  Like previous speakers, I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  It is a comprehensive and far-reaching measure, and its introduction is timely.  I am one of the Members old enough to remember when there was only one television channel in this country, Telef&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann.  In the south east &mdash; Senator Walsh will remember this too &mdash; we used to have fuzzy reception of <Col N="1053"/>some channels from the west coast of England and Wales.  That was back in the late 1970s.  Traditional broadcasting is experiencing new challenges which will remain in future, including the advent of broadband, Internet access and satellite channels.  Digital recording and playback technology is being introduced in many areas too.  These changes create revenue-raising challenges for broadcasters.  It seems users play what they want to see and fast forward through the advertisements.  The technology exists although many people may not realise this.  Advertising in general will be significantly affected with the advent of these new technologies.</P>
        <P>I spoke on the Order of Business last week about the advertisement of junk food, especially during children&rsquo;s programmes on television.  Speaking as the father of young children &mdash; and I know many others would agree &mdash; the advertising of junk food needs to be restricted.  We are storing up significant problems for the future with the promotion of such foodstuffs.  Significant pressure is coming on families to purchase goods that are marketed extensively on children&rsquo;s programmes.  I see a problem here.  I do not know what the remit of the broadcasting authority will be in this regard.  If we restrict advertising on the national airwaves and radio stations, how do we control the satellite channels that are received in almost every living room and bedroom throughout the country?  The Kid&rsquo;s Channel on the Sky network, for example, broadcasts almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with significant advertising time devoted to junk food, toys and so on.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify what the remit of the authority is and what control it will have on such advertising given that it can restrict the national broadcaster?  There is a circle to be squared and I am interested to hear how this can be done.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the broadcasting authority of Ireland is welcome.  It will take responsibility for the existing functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  Fine Gael welcomes the Bill but one criticism is that the political response to changes in the broadcasting sector has been too slow, while technology is moving so quickly.  This legislation will have to be reviewed, even before the end of the present Government term, owing to advances in technology.  It is something that will have to be constantly reviewed.  The Minister said in previous statements to the House on this matter that the national transmission roll-out would take place by September 2012.  I wish to see how this process can be tracked and how we can monitor its progress and costings.  This should be of interest to the House and the wider public.</P>
        <P>On the appointments of board members to the new authority &mdash; this may be an item of contention &mdash; Fine Gael is of the view that while we welcome the thrust of the new Bill which allows the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to have a role in the appointment of new members, the party considers that members of any board should have the proper qualifications and competencies.  We suggest that the relevant committee has a significant role to play in vetting &mdash; if that is the correct term &mdash; and ensuring all board appointees have the necessary competencies.  This will allow board members to play a proper role.  This is the only fair and transparent system of making Government appointees to boards and is something for which the public is crying out.  Government appointments to the boards of State organisations are sometimes used as a political football by both the Government and the media.  It is important the Oireachtas can stand over the appointments and ensure such people are competent and able for the job.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael also welcomes the broadcasting codes governing the standards and practices the authority will oversee.  All broadcasters have responsibilities and certain standards to maintain.  This legislation will ensure broadcasters keep to a high standard and that they are balanced, impartial and objective in reporting.  The legislation contains a fine system of sanctions that will ensure where a broadcaster is out of line or attacks a person&rsquo;s reputation unnecessarily, it will be fined or brought to book.</P><Col N="1054"/>
        <P>On licensing and the collection of licence fees, there is a good deal of evasion of payment of television licences.  An Post has done good work in the past but the rate of payment of licence fees leaves much to be desired.  We are told it costs &euro;12 million to collect &euro;200 million in fees.  We must examine this revenue collecting exercise to see where we can introduce efficiencies and a more systematic approach to collecting fees.  We hear advertisements threatening those who do not have a valid licence with a knock on the door from an inspector.  Such advertisements are fine but there should be a more systematic, efficient approach.  We need to examine the way An Post operates in this regard.  We could operate with other organisations such as the ESB, for example, which has a sizeable database, the meter point reference number database, with specific addresses for each dwelling place in the country.  There may be an opportunity for the Government and An Post to liaise with the ESB using that system and such a collaboration may result in a more systematic licence fee collection system.  Is it possible to collect licence fees in the way motor tax is collected, namely, on-line?  Many people would welcome this option as it would save time, prove accessible and be easier for people to renew their licences this way.</P>
        <P>I, along with Senator Boyle, have spoken previously about digital technologies.  Not only is there a satellite television channel broadcasting tarot cards and so on, there are also gaming, gambling and shopping channels.  These channels are broadcast into the living rooms of homes in the country.  Has the authority any remit in this sector?  The advent of these channels brings new challenges to the way we control what is broadcast.  Every broadcaster using satellite has direct access to every living room in the country.</P>
        <P>On the public broadcasting service, I compliment RTE on its tradition in promoting Irish film, documentaries, the Irish language and especially the development of TG4.  Since its introduction it has played a significant role in promoting the Irish language, heritage and culture.  The &ldquo;All-Ireland Gold&rdquo; series tapped into a niche in the market of viewers wishing to see the sporting archives.  RTE also deserves credit for the &ldquo;Reeling in the Years&rdquo; programme.  It is remarkable how the public broadcasting archives are of interest to citizens.</P>
        <P>I would welcome a public interest channel which would broadcast the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The citizens of the country need to know more about what happens in the Upper and Lower Houses and the local authorities, which are at the coalface of democracy.  Such a public service channel could broadcast much of what happens at local authority meetings throughout the country as well as EU meetings.  I wish to criticise RTE slightly for the &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; programme.  It broadcasts the programme very late; it was on at 12.45 a.m. last night.  Someone is quoted as saying the programme is for insomniacs or people starting the night shift and having breakfast.  The treatment of this House by RTE is very poor, with minimum coverage using only the sound bite or celebrity.  However, many important issues are discussed here and there is room for improvement in the present format of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and perhaps the new channel will address this.</P>
        <P>The Irish film channel will be beneficial to the production and promotion of Irish films.  In my constituency of Waterford, the Waterford Institute of Technology is offering a higher diploma in television production in a co-operative arrangement with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a private company called Nemeton Television.  The course will train young producers to make Irish films and documentaries.  These producers will be able to take advantage of the Irish film channel, so I compliment the Minister on providing for that in the Bill.  However, the question arises of how the channel will be funded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy Mansergh, go dt&iacute; an Teach.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar Bhall den Teach sa Seanad deireanach.  Gan amhras, d&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; a dh&iacute;cheall ar <Col N="1055"/>son an Rialtais, ar son an Teach seo agus ar son na D&aacute;la.  The Minister of State was an eminent Member of the last Seanad and I have no doubt that he will bring distinction to the high office he now holds.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Broadcasting Bill 2008 which, as several speakers have noted, is an important and comprehensive legislative development.  Credit is due to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and his officials for the hard work they have done on the Bill.  It is welcome that listeners and viewers will be central to this area.</P>
        <P>Broadcasting is a powerful medium for moulding public opinion and it often reflects the core values of our society.  The remit of the broadcasting authority of Ireland should be to ensure that it acts as a force for good because that is not always the case.  I welcome the amalgamation of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  Reference is frequently made in these Houses to the plethora of quangos that have been established, so it is sensible to rationalise their number.  The BAI will have a remit across a wide spectrum of issues.  Its compliance committee will prepare a set of rules for broadcasters and set a strategic direction for broadcasting.</P>
        <P>Section 33 provides for the collection of a levy to fund the BAI.  A levy of up to 3% of turnover, which was abolished in 2002, is being reintroduced.  It is imperative, however, that the levies imposed are fair and reasonable.  Where public bodies are involved, the accounting system for income and expenditure does not always ensure efficiency and cost effectiveness.  I hope the Minister will consider this issue.  I support the suggestion that the BAI should be required to submit three or five year business plans which clearly set out targets and annual budgets.  In the interest of transparency and accountability, the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources could play a role in scrutinising these business plans before a levy is approved.  If independent radio stations and broadcasters have to make a contribution, it would be reasonable to allow them representation on the BAI.  The phrase &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; should apply.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes an innovative proposal on involving the Parliament in making appointments to the BAI, RTE and TG4.  That may become a template for future legislation.  For some time, there has been a need for appointees to various bodies to be vetted by the appropriate Oireachtas committees to ensure they are both qualified and representative of public opinion.  That has not always been the case, particularly among socially focused bodies, which have a tremendous influence on policy formulation.</P>
        <P>In regard to restrictions on advertisements aimed at children, which probably emanated from an EU directive, while I concur with the Bill&rsquo;s aims a number of English and other foreign channels are received in this jurisdiction.  It is important that we do not put our industry at a disadvantage.  Members of the drinks industry have argued that if our unilateral decisions are not replicated by foreign channels, we will distort trade.  I would like to see restrictions on advertisements for drinks and betting, which may be an even greater problem than alcohol, but these should be introduced on a European basis.  The fact that the provisions in the Bill have their genesis in an EU directive may ensure action at a European level.</P>
        <P>The BAI will supervise the length of advertisement breaks.  There may be a need, however, for flexibility in this area.  I understand that radio stations have a cap of ten minutes of advertisements per hour.  An eminently sensible suggestion has been made to me that averaging the figure over a two hour period would allow for flexibility in programming.  I do not oppose a strict regulatory system but flexibility should be allowed in regard to commercial needs.</P>
        <P>The provisions on complaints and the right to reply are innovative.  We have held tortuous discussions over the past 12 months on the Defamation Bill 2006 and, while some of us were not particularly happy with aspects of that Bill, I welcomed its provision of a right to reply.  It <Col N="1056"/>is common sense that a radio station will be able to make statements of correction without prejudicing its defence in future court cases.  A similarly sensible approach is made in the application of sanctions of up to &euro;250,000, to which the broadcaster can agree without incurring court costs.</P>
        <P>Section 67 relates to licensing.  The making of an application is expensive.  Ten-year licences will be granted to successful applicants.  I welcome the new fast-track system that will operate in circumstances where there is one applicant.  If the renewal of a licence remains at the shorter period of five years, a type of bogus competition might emerge in order to trigger a ten-year licence.  Consideration should be given to that matter.  The role of the BAI in respect of ownership and licensing and the fact that a licence might become the main asset of a company should also be examined.  Those in the industry might not agree with me but I am of the view that instead of five or ten years, a licence should last for seven years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the Bill.  I wish to declare that I have an interest in that I have an investment in Channel 6.  It is not a very successful investment but I feel I should declare it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that one authority will assume responsibility for the various areas to which the Bill relates.  It deals concisely with that matter but it is, nevertheless, a lengthy item of legislation.  I was surprised with regard to the number of areas it covers.</P>
        <P>Of the nine members who will sit on the board, five &mdash; the majority &mdash; will be appointed by the Minister.  The latter will also appoint the other four while having regard to the advice of the joint Oireachtas committee.  I am delighted that the relevant committee will be involved.  Effectively, however, what is proposed will mean that the Minister of the day will exercise proxy control over an important part of what should be an independent, opinion-forming body.  Will it be possible to broaden the appointment system?  Why not allow the Arts Council, the IFA, the unions or whomever to have a say in who is appointed?  I accept that these bodies may be able to have their say through the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  However, I am of the view that what is proposed could be improved.  The making of appointments to boards is such a contentious issue and we need to give greater consideration to it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the concept of financial sanctions.  To date, if a broadcaster was seen to be in the wrong, the only course available was to take the draconian step of suspending its licence to broadcast.  What is proposed in the Bill is an excellent innovation.  It will allow sanctions of differing degrees of severity &mdash; depending on the seriousness of what was done &mdash; to be imposed and these will impact upon the financial resources and audience numbers of the transgressor.  I am delighted that this measure, which is similar to the sin bin that operates in rugby, is being introduced.  In the past, if a player misbehaved on the rugby field he was sent off and the match was thereby probably ruined as a contest.  The introduction of the sin bin, whereby players are sent off for ten minutes, improved matters no end because a referee is now able to impose a penalty on the offending team without ending the game as a contest.  From that point of view, the introduction of financial sanctions is a good move.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat concerned with regard to new technology.  We simply do not know what new technology will appear in the broadcasting field in the future.  Digital audio broadcasting seems to be the flavour of the moment.  However, people who live outside the main population centres can be offered a service via digital radio mondial, DRM.  Should we offer coverage only to those who live in larger centres or on the plains?  I do not believe so.  In addition, I do not know what is coming next.  I am not sure the Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow for rapid reaction to changing marketplace realities.</P><Col N="1057"/>
        <P>In 1910, Thomas Edison wrote to his son and stated that the latter would not believe how the world had changed in his lifetime.  The same words were used by King Frederick in 1640, by which time America had been discovered, the printing press had been invented and the Reformation had taken place.  The world changes so quickly.  In 1905, the head of the copyright office in America stated that there would be no need for that office to exist after 1910 because he believed that everything which could be invented was probably already in existence.  Technology changes rapidly and I am concerned as to whether we are giving ourselves room to adjust.  Finland and Sweden both turned down the opportunity to put in place digital audio broadcasting.  In that context, I hope we are going in the right direction in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh and others referred to advertising.  The legislation will effectively impose a ban on junk food advertising at times when younger people and children are most likely to comprise the audience.  I applaud this move.  I was involved, through my company, in introducing a ban on sweets being sold at checkouts.  This was hugely applauded by parents because they stated that it freed them from what they termed the &ldquo;whinge&rdquo; factor and gave them a greater say in their children&rsquo;s diets.  However, I would propose the introduction of a further advertising ban.  As with tobacco, why not introduce such a ban in respect of gambling, alcohol and other products?</P>
        <P>There is little or no difference as regards the arguments that can be put forward in respect of this matter but I do not know how we could do what I propose in a competitive marketplace.  Senator Walsh and others referred to this matter.  Broadcasting and media outlets are all in competition with interests we cannot control from outside the State.  The ban on tobacco advertising is almost Europe-wide.  However, I have seen posters advertising tobacco in certain European countries.  There must be a way to solve the problem to which I refer by either imposing a ban at European level or putting in place a tax that would relate to advertisements which come from outside the EU.  I accept that this would be a challenge.  However, it is too easy to say that we should impose a ban on certain types of advertising when we know full well that broadcasters are in competition with interests from abroad.</P>
        <P>The legislation offers a right of reply to those who feel they have been maligned by a broadcaster.  I am concerned that this could be used to hobble serious investigative journalism.  Our law is based on the premise that one is innocent until proven guilty.  This should surely apply to a broadcasting organisation as much as to an individual.  I accept that there is no easy answer in respect of this issue.  The Minister will not be aware that in the 1960s I was maligned by the <i>Irish News</i> in Belfast when I attempted to fly across the Irish Sea in a balloon in order to create publicity.  The newspaper referred to me as &ldquo;ex-IRA man Feargal Quinn&rdquo;.  I was upset by this and discovered that those at the <i>Irish News</i> had confused me with a distant relative from a previous generation.  I contacted the newspaper and asked if it might publish a correction.  The story was corrected but almost to the other extreme.  It was stated that not only was I not an ex-IRA man but also that I was extremely opposed to what that organisation was then doing.  The correction almost described me as a strong and staunch Unionist.  I refer to my experience because there is a definite need for a right to reply and I am sure the broadcasting authority of Ireland &mdash; even if the position is not strictly the same as that which applies in respect of the press &mdash; will find a way to establish it.</P>
        <P>Those involved in the area of broadcasting are increasingly in competition with broadcasting interests from outside the State.  The latter are not subject to our legislation in any meaningful way.  They are subject to European legislation but there is not much of this.  We must be careful not to deliver audiences to out-of-State organisations by imposing regulations in respect of minority groups.  It may make excellent moral or political sense to impose such regulations but they are not audience-attractive and could lead to viewers being lost.  There is a tightrope to be walked between the notions of what is populist and what is ethical.  This quandary will be <Col N="1058"/>redefined on a day-by-day and issue-by-issue basis.  It would be nice to believe that we might be able to legislate for good taste and common decency.  However, I would be satisfied to leave responsibility for such matters to the new body.</P>
        <P>I have been extremely impressed by the introduction of C-SPAN in the United States.  This system appears to work extremely well.  I am not sure about the level of audience participation with it but those who have the system pay attention to it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposed licensing fee, I made a proposal last year on a broadcasting Bill which, as a former chairman of An Post, I say with a little guilt.  There must be a better way to collect the licence fee.  I made the suggestion last year that it should be considered as part of the ESB bill, as better opportunities exist there.  That would present problems for An Post, which does its best in that area, but it should be considered.</P>
        <P>Section 177 deals with accounts.  Since I came into the House I have argued that every Bill establishing a new body should put forward deadlines for publication of accounts.  I do not see a date in that respect outlined in the Bill, although it refers to &ldquo;as soon as may be expected&rdquo;.  We should insert a deadline in that regard.</P>
        <P>Some years ago, when I looked for RTE accounts in January I was told they had not yet been published for the year before the previous year, in other words, for a period of 13 months from the time in question.  Accounts should be published within three months.  I know when I have put down amendments in this regard, Ministers have often accepted them.  The period in question does not have to be three months, it could be six months.  Every authority should have a report deadline.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and consider it an honour and privilege that it is printed in my name to present for the consideration and approval of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As someone who was a Member of the Seanad in 1988 and 1989, when the last Bill on broadcasting was considered, we have come a long way and achieved much with regard to licensed and unlicensed broadcasting, as it was at the time.</P>
        <P>The success of local radio has been incredible and I congratulate everyone associated with the creation and building up of local radio to what we all know today.  The strength of local radio is in the meaning of &ldquo;local&rdquo;.  These stations provide an interesting service to local areas and that is the reason they are so successful.  In terms of the down side of local radio, I can say honestly it was never our intention as legislators in 1988 and 1989 to make millionaires out of the many people who sold on licences given to them by the people and the Legislature.  Perhaps this Bill will stop that practice.  I like to see people and industry progressing, as local radio has, but the ethos of staying local is of the utmost importance, particularly with regard to news bulletins.</P>
        <P>Before the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, leaves us, I congratulate him on his appointment.  It was one of the most uplifting appointments in the new Cabinet and I know many people are looking forward to his stewardship and ministry for the next four years, and perhaps longer.  I wish him well for all he has done for Ireland until now and I know what he will do as a member of the new Cabinet.  I welcome our near neighbour and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, from County Kildare.  I also congratulate him on his appointment.  I had the great distinction and honour of serving with his father, a Minister, in the Houses many years ago.</P>
        <P>To return to local radio, our duty of meeting the need and creating the local radio experience has been an enormous success.  I wholeheartedly congratulate everybody associated with the issue.  Since we introduced that Bill, TG4 has been created.  That station is a credit to Cathal <Col N="1059"/>Goan, who has gone on to become Director General of RTE.  He played a major role in setting up TG4, as it formed part of his vision and commitment to Ireland.  He is a great Irishman with foresight that has given us the success of TG4.  It is an outstanding station and it is tremendous to watch an Irish station giving the Irish people what the majority wish to see on their televisions.</P>
        <P>The appointment of an authority must be welcomed, particularly with the input from a committee of the Houses.  I am a member of that committee and look forward to playing a further part in this area.  I was a vice chairman of the committee on broadcasting services.  As Senator Quinn has stated, we can take much from the success of the C-SPAN example in America.  I look forward to working with the new person with responsibility on this matter.</P>
        <P>Professionals who know the industry and know the wares to put in the shop window to sell to the public should be allowed become members of the board.  These would include members of the Irish Film Board and those who make their living in the film industry.  The great ambassadors for our country should be included on the board, as well as those involved in the Irish music industry.  I am thinking specifically of our great success stories, such as Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, U2 and the Cranberries.  We have had great ambassadors all over the world selling the new Ireland.  These people are leaders in their fields and should be members of this board.  I would like the Minister to consider what I have proposed.</P>
        <P>One issue I wish to emphasise is the setting up of a new Oireachtas channel.  I am convinced the spirit of the people would be uplifted if they were to see the good work and hear the uplifting contributions being made here &mdash; especially in Seanad &Eacute;ireann &mdash; by people who have enormous experience and who have given their life&rsquo;s blood to other industries before coming in here.  Members of the public would be delighted to hear debates on the merits of a Bill, statements on topical issues or other contributions made in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I look forward to the channel being set up and I know it will also show the proceedings of the D&aacute;il in the light it deserves.</P>
        <P>We are thankful for the snapshot every night provided to us by &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  Live broadcasting of the Order of Business in the Seanad, followed by the business of the D&aacute;il and the important issues discussed in depth by the committees would attract a large public audience, potentially 10% of the population.  Our young people, whether in primary school, second level or third level could watch the affairs of the Houses that would be of interest to them.  We should consider how to broaden the constituency viewership and the interest in politics in general by showing the deliberations of Members and the scrutiny of Parliament when legislation is processed on matters that impact on the daily lives of our people.  The good work being done by Members in the national interest would be then seen by the general public, hopefully in unedited form.  The Irish people can look forward to this service.  I assure the House that I will do anything I can as Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to ensure the Oireachtas channel is brought on-line. It is disheartening when Members spend two to three hours preparing 20 to 30 minute contributions for delivery in the D&aacute;il or Seanad and they do not get a mention on radio, television or in the print media.  Such work is generally done in consultation with Library assistants and the secretariat.</P>
        <P>We must encourage young people to become Members of the Oireachtas and we should show our appreciation to them.  Those of us who have been Members of the Oireachtas for some time and who  have experience in reviewing the challenges facing new and young Members must encourage the setting up of this channel as fast as possible.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a review of the 1988 legislation, which takes us into the new technological era of the 21st century.  This is certainly a great challenge and I appreciate the Minister taking it into the Seanad first in order that we can express our opinions on it.  I am pleased the Bill was <Col N="1060"/>printed in my name for presentation to the House.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its safe passage through the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his new responsibilities.  I saw him perform with distinction the other day in Killorglin in my home county where he chaired proceedings and gave his blessing to the joint venture involving Texaco and Bord G&aacute;is.  I also compliment the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on his initiative in bringing forward this comprehensive Bill containing 181 sections and running to 165 pages.</P>
        <P>Before proceeding I should declare a small interest, of which Senator Cassidy&rsquo;s contribution reminded me when he said that local radio should be local, a view to which I subscribe.  I am a founding member of and shareholder in Radio Kerry whose credo is that it is a local station.  It operates for every member of every community who wishes to avail of it, either by ringing in to offer a view or whatever.  It is not for me to be critical but the print media appear to be invading local radio, although I am sure I do not have to comment on that as the Members are aware of developments in that field.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Bill is the setting up of the broadcasting authority of Ireland.  It will have nine board members, five appointed by the Government and four to be recommended by the relevant Oireachtas committee, and two statutory committees: the contracts awards committee and the compliance committee.  I agree with my esteemed and learned colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, who spoke on the Bill at length last week, that these proposals are a welcome departure from normal Government practice heretofore in that the Minister has indicated he will consult the relevant Oireachtas committee and take on its view regarding four of the members of the board.  We are all in favour of broad consultation and I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and others have mentioned, the Bill may need further refinement, so to speak, and those of us on this side of the House would be keen that all the appointments would be open to a questioning and vetting procedure by the committee.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and others will have tabled amendments and if I am not anticipating the Minister inaccurately, he will have an open mind regarding some of those matters.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not legislate for any form of restrictive measures regarding alcohol advertising.  We believe that issue must be addressed and I am sure amendments will be tabled in that regard.  Members have spoken continually in the House of the dangers of alcohol advertising and the way it misleads so many of our young people.  They have outlined also some of the sad events we are witnessing in towns and villages throughout the country, especially at weekends.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for two new channels to be funded publicly, one of which will be a Houses of the Oireachtas channel to cover proceedings of the Oireachtas, local authorities, implementation bodies, European Union, United Nations and Council of Europe bodies, legislatures in other states and other bodies as the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas sees fit.  I take it the Houses of the Oireachtas will have discretion regarding the way the channel will be run.  Like other speakers I welcome the prospect of this development.  Some of us who are members of the joint administration committee were in London recently and saw how well the BBC parliament channel is run.  We also looked at Sky television but that is for further consideration on this side of the House.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a parliamentary television channel has been under discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas for some considerable time and there are differing views on the matter.  Murray Consultants, which was hired by the Houses, had doubts while Members believed that a parliamentary channel would do much to promote the Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1061"/>and generate greater interest in the work of public representatives and politics generally.  I hold that view, as I am sure do most Members on both sides.  There is some evidence to support that view.</P>
        <P>The three core issues regarding the development of a parliamentary channel are: who will run the channel, how will a signal be carried and how will the content and production be organised?  I gather the Taoiseach is of the view that RTE should run the parliamentary channel from its existing licence fee revenue as it has a public service broadcasting obligation.  That would mirror the situation in the United Kingdom where the BBC provides a dedicated digital parliamentary channel from its licence revenue.  In its discussions with the joint committee, however, RTE made no commitments in that regard.  An alternative to RTE would be to expand the Oireachtas broadcasting unit by buying in the required technology and production expertise.  Many of the facilities, such as the cameras and so on, are installed in both Houses and in the committee rooms.</P>
        <P>A key question is the way the content and production will be organised.  The content and production aspects are interesting because they raise the issue of editorial control, which clearly has major implications in a parliamentary context.  Content and production would need careful consideration and once decisions have been taken, clear operational guidelines would have to be devised.  There are two main options regarding content and production.  First is the transmission of live or pre-recorded items with no added value, and second is the production of value added programmes with commentary and captions.  In addition, some journalistic input via analysis and interviews could be considered.</P>
        <P>A further issue is getting sufficient content to fill the broadcasting time available.  Given the limited sitting hours and long recess periods, other forms of content would be required such as content from the Northern Ireland Assembly, which I am sure Members would welcome, or perhaps some from the UK House of Commons or House of Lords, the Forum on Europe and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The development of a parliamentary channel should be preceded by a comprehensive feasibility study that would examine the demand for a channel and assess the various delivery options having regard to financial, technical, policy and organisational considerations.  It would need to examine also the role of webcasting and the way the Houses of the Oireachtas can take advantage of the convergence of communications technologies to determine parliamentary proceedings.  I am aware from my work as a member of the joint administration committee, as are other Members, that test broadcasts up to the parliamentary recess and the digital platform are in being.  Tenders have been issued for a feasibility study.  Those are due in mid-June and the study should be completed by October.</P>
        <P>Money and resources are key issues if the channel is established, as is the way it is operated.  It will have to be operated very professionally because it will be compared with other channels.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will have to consider the way we do our business because we will have to have regard for issues such as the sos, recesses and committees going into private session.  That will necessitate some change, as I am sure Members can imagine.</P>
        <P>It is proposed also that the Irish Film Board set up and operate an Irish film channel to showcase and promote Irish films.  That is another welcome development.  I would like to hear from the Minister the long-term plans for this channel.  Is it envisaged that the number of films broadcast each day will eventually form just three?  How was that figure arrived at in the first place?  It is hoped that the broadcasting content under the remit of the new authority will reflect the increasing diversity of all aspects of Irish society and cater for a wide range of tastes.</P>
        <P>With regard to television licences, it is important the licence fee is affordable to all and takes into account any extra costs for the consumer that will arise from the introduction of digital <Col N="1062"/>terrestrial television.  The licence fee should also be realistic with respect to how it is applied to premises with more than one receiver.  It is also important that the current ratio of home-produced to bought-in programmes broadcast on RTE be maintained, with a view to increasing the number of home-produced material over time.  When he spoke to the Joint Committee on Communications in February, the director general of RTE, Mr. Cathal Goan, stated that RTE&rsquo;s broadcasts are currently 45% home-produced with 55% being bought-in programmes.</P>
        <P>In the matter of digital terrestrial television an exact date for analog switch-off should be set as soon as possible.  Coverage of 100% for DTT must be ensured so that nobody will be adversely affected by the switchover, particularly in the more rural areas of the country.  It is important that customers, especially older people, are educated about new technology of this kind that enters the home.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal last week in this House to bring forward provisions in the Bill that would tighten regulations in the area of premium rate services and bring Regtel under the remit of COMREG is welcome.  The legislative framework set out in the Broadcasting Bill should be flexible enough to cater for ongoing advances in technology rather than place us in a position where we are forced to play catch-up with other countries.</P>
        <P>The initiative for RTE to commission independently made radio programmes is also a very welcome development.  This has the potential to become one of the greatest success stories in Irish broadcasting.  There is a fear, however, that the Bill does not provide adequate funding for the growth of the independent radio production sector.  Section 116 requires RTE to commission specified levels of television and radio programming from the independent production sector.  Independent radio is guaranteed only 1.25% of the moneys while independent television has a fully guaranteed 95%.  The remaining 3.75% is at the discretion of RTE.  This equates to just &euro;500,000 for independent radio productions.  Leaving 3.75% at the discretion of RTE is a recipe for ongoing confusion and division.  The lion&rsquo;s share of that balance will be absorbed by the larger and more developed independent television sector.  A more realistic target for independent radio production should be set and, if necessary, be reached incrementally over a five-year period.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Boyle are among several who have spoken cogently and in a focused way on this matter.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will bear in mind their amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m leis de bharr a cheapach&aacute;in mar Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm bheith in ann labhairt ar an mBille seo inniu.  N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi n&aacute; gur reachta&iacute;ocht an-bhun&uacute;sach at&aacute; i gceist anseo.  Beidh b&eacute;im ag an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ar ghn&aacute;th-saol gach duine ar an oile&aacute;n.

Is d&oacute;cha nach bhfuil an reachta&iacute;ocht seo ag teacht r&oacute;-luath, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  Bh&iacute; g&eacute;argh&aacute; leis le tamall.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an Bille in ann an seirbh&iacute;s agus an strucht&uacute;r ceart a thabhairt d&uacute;inn maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; craolach&aacute;in ar an oile&aacute;n.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that this is exceptionally comprehensive legislation.  In many ways it responds to the fundamental changes which have taken place in Irish broadcasting since the days of 2RN.  Perhaps none of us in the House is old enough to remember 2RN but we certainly hear reference made to it by older people who tell us that they spoke on that station or played music on it.  They were very simple days and there was a unique partnership at that time between the public broadcasting service, limited though it was, and the general public or community at large.  That partnership was very important to the growth of Irish broadcasting and to its success.  As broadcasting develops and as competition grows it is important that we do not lose that rapport.  Loyalty to any particular service comes from that rapport.  In competition <Col N="1063"/>terms, the Irish broadcasting service will be competing with the global service.  There are perhaps two ways of ensuring that customer loyalty continues, one being to give people the feeling that they have ownership of that service.  I do not mean &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; in any statutory way but as a sense of belonging, so that people feel that their aspirations, beliefs and ambitions are being reflected by the service.</P>
        <P>I wish to reflect, briefly, on whence we have come.  It is only right that we should pay tribute to RTE.  We have seen it grow from a fledgling service to the very professional one it is now.  I remember talking to people from the BBC after the visit of Pope John Paul II to Ireland.  BBC technicians and cameramen came to support and complement the RTE service because of the multi-faceted nature of the visit and the number of locations that had to be covered.  The BBC representatives said they had seldom witnessed organisational ability such as they had seen from RTE on that occasion.  That comment came from a service outside the country.</P>
        <P>A good effort has been made to reflect the Irish ethos, even as it has become multi-cultural in recent times, particularly so on RTE Radio 1.  Those of us who listen regularly to that station as we drive have an affinity with what is broadcast.  I do not believe this is because we fit into any particular age group.  It is important that we do not think of everything in an empty, superficial or an instantaneous manner.  If future generations do not wish to engage in anything of depth, it will not be their fault, rather that of the diet on which they will have been raised, their broadcasting environment.  We must always guard against that.</P>
        <P>Local radio was a spin-off from RTE.  I can recall the early days of experimental community radio when RTE sent its outside broadcasting unit to many towns, including Cashel.  We were given an opportunity to dip a toe in the water and run a community radio station for a week, with RTE&rsquo;s assistance.  In Cashel, which has a population of 3,000 people, an archive was created during that week, a social, cultural and sporting archive which will be very important in years to come.  We produced one of the first soap operas on radio when we took Charles J. Kickham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Knocknagow&rdquo; and divided it into subsections as a serial over seven days.  Everybody was waiting for the conclusion.  Community radio would not have been there but for RTE.  At one stage I thought that as local radio developed there would be an interaction with RTE whereby we would have access to its archives, services and expertise, rather than having to put those structures together ourselves.  It did not happen in that way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To its credit we must point to TG4.  Mr. Cathal Goan was mentioned as its pioneer and he did an excellent job there.  Prior to that there was Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  Professionalism and the presence of young people were hallmarks of both stations.  People might have associated the Irish language with members of an older generation and they might also have had a perception that, of necessity, such a television station might have been amateurish.  It is neither amateurish nor is it monopolised by older people.  Even those who might have no interest in the language will readily admit that they tune into TG4 every so often.  Having tuned in for the sport initially, they are now viewing other programmes.  I am glad TG4 is being recognised as an entity in its own right in the legislation.  Given its actions alone, it deserves this.  We hope it will be always resourced properly so it can continue with its work.</P>
      
        <P>I have been concerned for some time over the development of monopolies in local radio.  In the print media, Scottish Radio Holdings has been mopping up one local newspaper after another.  In my area, I can point to the <i>Tipperary Star</i>, the <i>Clonmel Nationalist</i> and the <i>Kilkenny People</i>.  One can add to the list, which suggests there is a huge monopoly developing.  A similar one is developing in the world of local radio.  If this occurs, it will be totally at variance with what was intended for local radio.</P><Col N="1064"/>
        <P>Local radio was intended to reflect the local community, including its aspirations, talents and desire for knowledge.  In that regard, local radio has done magnificent work.  One need only look at the ratings to determine how successful some local stations have been.  The success very often attracts the investment vultures and we must be always on the alert.  We must ensure there is a legislative base to prevent a monopoly from developing.</P>
        <P>I cannot think of any phenomenon more potent in energising the local community than local radio.  Many of the hang-ups and agendas that have developed in the national broadcasting service, very often because of there being a limited number of people with total control of the service, must not arise in local radio.  We must, therefore, be particularly careful.</P>
        <P>I stated on a number of occasions in the House that I could never understand why religious broadcasting was not allowed on the national radio stations.  In the main, whatever group the advertising came from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>If one studies the phenomenon, one will note that those involved in religious groups and churches have a positive outlook and their advertising could serve as an antidote to some forms of anti-social behaviour.  Will the Minister of State consider seriously the question of why we cannot have religious advertising, particularly when one considers that some talk shows are very anti-religious in content?  I watched a comedian one night on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; making jokes about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  Will somebody tell me how this can be justified?  Can one imagine the hurt such totally unnecessary irreverence must have caused to so many people?  I complained and, in fairness to the then host, Gay Byrne, there was an apology on the show the following week.  It should not have been necessary to raise the matter in the House nor to seek an apology.  It is absolutely vital that what I propose form part and parcel of what we are.</P>
        <P>In the area of broadcasting, the system has been abused time and again.  I refer to the manner in which vulnerable people, incapable of replying, have been ridiculed and offended unnecessarily.  I hope the right of reply, which is contained in this legislation, is not a cosmetic exercise.  It must be strong and unequivocal.  Broadcasters &mdash; there are so many good ones &mdash; will have to understand that the one way in which they can prevent the right of reply from being required to be exercised is by ensuring complaints have no basis in fact.</P>
        <P>Can I make two more points?  Advertising constraints are required in respect of alcohol.  No longer are we considered to be old fogeys, as was the case in the past, when we raise this question.  Several times in this House we have decried the anti-social behaviour that has resulted not from alcohol but from its abuse.  It should be possible to establish constraints in this regard given that this can be achieved in respect of tobacco.  Alcohol is one of the foremost drugs in the country and has an impact on health.  This must be also considered.</P>
        <P>I notice my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Coghlan, was afforded a little flexibility and I therefore ask for 30 more seconds.  The concept of an Oireachtas channel is excellent for the simple reason that, if one looks in a daily newspaper for what is happening in the Houses of the Oireachtas, one will note that, in the main, legislation does not figure.  Oireachtas proceedings figure if somebody uses an unusual word or fires a reply across the <Col N="1065"/>House but the basic information and tenets of legislation do not come across.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that the public perception of politicians and parliamentarians is as it is?</P>
        <P>I give credit to RTE for &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  It does its very best but the programme is always based on the Order of Business in the morning, on the soundbites and topical issues.  It is seldom based on the meat of Oireachtas work.  Perhaps an Oireachtas channel would not have a great viewership in its early stages but, if presented in a creative way, it would train and focus the minds of the public.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State on bringing forward the legislation.  It is not easy to reconcile public and commercial broadcasting.  An excellent effort is being made in the Bill and it is right to aim at excellence, not just in the output but also among the people on boards.  Having listened to the other contributors, I believe there is a general welcome for the fact that there will be a vetting system.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A Leas-Chathaoirligh, caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; gur thug t&uacute; an-sheans ar fad do mo chomhghleacaithe ar an dtaobh eile den seomra.  Ba mhaith liom cur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite aige mar gheall ar an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  Bronnaim mo chomhghairdeas ar an tAire St&aacute;it as ucht an jab nua ata faighte aige.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh go bre&aacute; leis.  T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an-chuid oibre curtha isteach sa Bhille seo.  It really is comprehensive, very impressive and quite significant.  That there is so little criticism thereof is a tribute not only to the Department and Minister but also to the advisers and those who put it together.  Members are adding to it and using it as an opportunity to forward proposals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to take up the point made by an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Murch&uacute; mar gheall ar an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag RTE, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r &oacute; thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta&iacute; de agus &oacute; thaobh TG4 a bhun&uacute;.  That TG4 is moving off on its own is an important cultural point.  It is important that this be marked and dealt with legislatively.</P>
        <P>We often criticise RTE &mdash; I am a regular critic myself &mdash; but it is important that the State recognise that there are programmes made by RTE that no independent or commercial provider could make or afford to make.  I balance this statement by advocating the need for support structures for independent producers at other levels.  It is important to recognise the work done by RTE in providing programmes for children and for minorities and by keeping Lyric FM on the go all the time to keep us all sane from 1.40 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. in the afternoon and at various other times of day.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note the cultural work RTE has done and its support, stitched into this legislation, for choirs, orchestras, etc.  I wonder how many Members realise RTE has provided Sunday night drama unbroken for approximately 50 years.  There is no money in this and the audience is small but it must be recognised.  This is another field in which independent radio producers could have a greater input.  I acknowledge they have an input to aspects of documentaries and so on at present.  The &ldquo;Documentary on One&rdquo; is another superb piece of radio.  A programme such as &ldquo;Farm Week&rdquo;, to which I have referred in the House many times previously, provides an extraordinary focus on rural Ireland.  While it is well produced, it is costly because it covers an entire island for a small audience.  I also refer to one of my favourite programmes in which I have a vested interest, namely, &ldquo;Sunday Miscellany&rdquo;, which also captures a small but important audience.  In such matters, one depends on RTE.</P>
        <P>Where does the licence money go or where is it used?  When watching coverage of the American elections, I like to see an RTE correspondent speaking from the US.  That said, at one point I questioned the reason so many RTE staff were over there during the election campaign, which as an issue pertains to management.  However, I prefer to hear their views than to tune into other stations and to listen to different voices and perspectives.  While these <Col N="1066"/>also are important, I enjoy them all the more when I have access to an Irish view as well.  This is not to be racist, nationalist, insular or introspective in any way.  It simply pertains to getting coverage of breadth and comprehension, which is very important.  I refer to election coverage and the amount of money RTE puts into it.  It places people in every count centre in the country and no commercial station could afford to or would do this.  It is important to put on record that Members require RTE to do such things.  If it does not do them well, Members criticise it, etc.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; programme has been mentioned.  As I listened to the Leader of the House speak earlier about the extraordinary contributions made in this Chamber, I felt my chest go out and my back straighten and felt myself to be a person of significant importance.  However, I wish to put on record that what RTE does in this regard is recognised and valued.  It should be aware that when Members criticise it on particular issues, they do so from that context.  T&aacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.</P>
        <P>I am absolutely intrigued by section 113, which goes to the trouble of changing the name of Radio Telef&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann to Radio Teilf&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, that is, changing the spelling of &ldquo;Telef&iacute;s&rdquo; to &ldquo;Teilif&iacute;s&rdquo;.  Is this due to standardisation or to someone who has a clear view?  I do not complain, as I like attention to be given to names.  The same attention should be given to placenames in Ireland, some of which are absolutely appalling in their lack of connection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not refer to Dingle in this case.  I refer to cases in which names do not reflect what they were supposed to be.</P>
        <P>Section 114 pertains to the availability of programmes, which relates to another point about RTE, namely, the establishment or maintenance of an emigrants&rsquo; channel.  While I am in favour of such a measure, I have many questions in this regard.  Will it be free to air?  I have made this point in the House before but as no one listens, I will make it again and will repeat it <i>ad nauseam</i>.  In any part of Europe one can buy a dish and a decoder at no extra cost, with no cards and without a contract with anyone.  One can tune into BBC 1, BBC 2, BBC 3, BBC 4, ITV 1, ITV 2, ITV 3 or ITV 4, as well as Cypriot, Maltese and many other stations throughout Europe that are free to air at no cost.  However, one cannot tune into RTE.  The Minister of State should not reply by citing the cost of audiences.  I do not ask RTE to transmit anything that would cost additional money.  However, I would like to be able to see the &ldquo;RTE News&rdquo;, &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; current affairs and other programmes that are Irish and which would not cost us anything.  It seems extraordinary that people from Belmullet to Moscow can tune into those other stations but cannot tune into RTE 1 or RTE 2,  or to TV3 for that matter, without having a contract with Sky.</P>
        <P>There is something completely wrong with this, which goes back to the highly important section 74, which deals with electronic programme guides, EPGs.  I support that section.  Anyone who wishes to know what this means should try to tune in to something like BBC 4, which is a superb television station, through a Sky control.  Sky has made it so difficult it is like getting into heaven or like the rich man passing through the eye of a needle.  This is the reason electronic programme guides, which appears to be a highly technical issue, is of great importance.</P>
        <P>I welcome the establishment of the parliamentary channel, which is important.  It should be easy to implement now that a live web feed is available from both Houses and from the committee rooms.  I also welcome the announcement of a film channel although I am unsure how it will fit in.  In common with the Minister for Finance and my colleagues in respect of the Lisbon <Col N="1067"/>treaty, which people tend not to read from cover to cover, I have not read the Bill from cover to cover.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>For shame.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I know.  I apologise.  However, I could not find the magic words, to &ldquo;educate, inform and entertain&rdquo;, which used to appear on RTE&rsquo;s objectives.  Do they still remain extant somewhere or are they included in this fine legislation?  I have been unable to find them and the Minister of State should reassure me that it is still part of RTE&rsquo;s requirements to do exactly that.</P>
        <P>As for what I have said in RTE&rsquo;s favour, I now wish to balance it by making a point that has been made by a number of Members.  It is of great importance that independent radio production should be supported.  At present that sector receives &euro;500,000 and has asked for it to be increased to &euro;1 million.  This assistance should be increased to approximately 3%, which would be more than &euro;1 million.  The reason for this is that I love radio.  At this time of the afternoon on every week day, BBC Radio 4 broadcasts afternoon theatre.  While I do not suggest that we could afford to do so in Ireland, other British radio stations, such as BBC 7, use much independent production and even BBC Radio 4 now does so.  I also refer to Oneword Radio, which is a radio station owned by Channel 4 that appears to be off the air at present.  However, it is coming back with two new radio channels.  Radio is a growing part of the communications sector and  I ask the Minister of State and his advisers to take on board this issue.  Not enough money is available and I do not propose taking it from RTE.  Money is available and this simply is a distribution issue.  It could be for programmes that might be broadcast or re-broadcast on RTE.  However, independent radio production must be supported, cultivated and allowed to develop.  It should be a sector in which career option exist, rather than one in which the practitioners try to work from month to month while wondering how to survive in future.  These people are creative and are as important to us as are the RTE Players or RTE drama.  This measure should be taken.  Similarly, I also will insist that the 5% funding that RTE currently receives from the sound and vision schemes should be maintained as it is written at present in the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003.  I want this to be maintained and will argue the point again on Committee Stage because of the balance of the work that RTE performs.</P>
        <P>I stood up in this House and in three other places, namely in a committee, within the GAA and within the trade union movement, to support RTE&rsquo;s change from medium wave to long-wave broadcasts.  I supported the move in good faith because I used to be able to listen in my car to RTE long wave from Edinburgh to London.  The reception is better, it has a longer reach and is to be recommended.  However, I recently have discovered that RTE is not broadcasting at full power.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>RTE should be broadcasting at 500 MW but is broadcasting at 250 MW instead.  I regret that RTE did not inform Members of this.  I was in London recently and tried to pick up long wave but could only barely do so.  Moreover, the transmission of RTE long wave is being interfered with by Radio Algeria.  This tells one how weak is the Irish broadcast.  One can simply look at a map and work out the reason a station in north Africa could interfere with our reception in London.  While we are only 500 miles away, they are at least 2,000 miles away.  We are not broadcasting at the power that is allowed to us.</P>
        <P>I make this point in the knowledge that throughout Ireland at present, most local radio stations are broadcasting at a power far greater than they are meant to broadcast.  Fair dues to <Col N="1068"/>them and I do not object to it.  However, RTE should do the same.  As it is not doing so, I will table an amendment to ensure it broadcasts at the power it has been granted by the European regulators or the body that hands out station frequencies.</P>
        <P>I have a lot more to say but I will not be able to get through all of it on this occasion.  We will deal with these issues on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Department and the advisers on an extraordinary piece of work.  I look forward to debating some of the issues I raised at the next opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the fact that this Bill is commencing its passage through Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>The legislation proposed in the Broadcasting Bill 2008 is both regulatory and reforming.  I congratulate the Minister and his staff on the proposals in the Bill.  It is comprehensive and covers a large area, with every aspect of broadcasting included.  In section 8(2) the Minister has set the number of members of the authority as nine, five of whom will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister and four of whom will be appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister with the Minister having regard to the advice of the joint Oireachtas committee.  This is a new departure that will give the committee extra powers and extend its role.  It is good that the joint committee may establish a panel for a contract awards committee and I welcome the fact that there will be an equal balance of men and women on this committee.</P>
        <P>Section 9 clearly sets down who may be appointed to the authority or a statutory committee and the experience he or she must have in 12 areas including music and several other aspects of culture.  This is to be welcomed as is the period of five years a person may serve on the committee or authority.  A person may not serve more than two consecutive terms which is long enough because people with new ideas should be given a chance.</P>
        <P>The area of complaints is well covered in section 47.  It is only right that the public has a process to lodge a complaint, provided it is genuine, and in this section the onus is placed on the broadcaster to provide a proper code of practice.  The compliance committee will investigate the complaint.  The new right of reply proposed in the Bill allows that a person who feels his honour or reputation has been damaged by a factually incorrect assertion in a broadcast may be entitled to a right of reply.  A right of reply will be broadcast by the broadcaster concerned and will correct the facts that were previously stated incorrectly.  This will be beneficial to the complainant and the broadcaster as it will not be treated as an admission of liability in a defamation case and may help reduce damages in such a case.  I strongly support my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, who said he hopes this section will have teeth and will be honoured in the spirit it is presented in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Other Members have stated that &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is relayed too late at night and I agree.  Young people doing school exercises on the workings of Government could find such a programme of great benefit if it were relayed at a suitable time.  It would also give the wider public a good insight on what happens in both Houses.  Very few people stay up until between 11.30 p.m. and midnight to watch the programme and a more suitable time for it would be after the nine o&rsquo;clock news.  It seems that more time has been given to the American presidential primaries in the past six months than to our own political system.  Irish people know more of what is happening between Democrats and Republicans in every state of America than of their own country because the coverage is shown at the right time.  Broadcasts of our Houses or printed reports on local government meetings tend to be negative.  The Bill refers to a live programme and it should be available to the public.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; already said, this <Col N="1069"/>could allow viewers to see the legislative elements of what is done in both Houses rather than the soundbites and smart answers given during Question Time and the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Section 116, which has been addressed by other speakers, requires RTE to commission specified levels of television and radio programming from the independent production sector.  Only 1.25% of moneys are guaranteed in this regard while independent television is guaranteed<?oasys _jy ?>95%.  A great deal of good work is done by the independent production sector and I ask the Minister to re-examine this section.  Even over a five year period he could increase the level of moneys to 5% from 1.25%.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work done by TG4 over the years.  I wish that station well because we would not receive coverage of certain football matches and so on were it not for TG4.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on bringing forward this important piece of legislation.  This feels something like &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; because during my first term in the Seanad in 1988, when, due to renovations here, we sat in the ante room, a Broadcasting Bill was introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Ray Burke.  That Bill caused a political stir because it provided for the introduction of advanced forms of local and independent radio and even television.  At the time buzz words included Century Radio and Radio Ireland.  There has been a lot of change since then and broadcasting legislation must be updated, so I welcome this Bill.</P>
        <P>This is a substantial Bill, given the number of sections before us &mdash; it is a little like the Lisbon treaty in that, I concede, I have not read every page.  I hope my colleague and friend from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party does not ask me to stop speaking because I have not read the entire Bill.  There are some issues I would like to go into in the time available to me.</P>
        <P>The subtitling of programmes for the hard of hearing is an issue I have raised on many occasions through the years in both Houses.  We all know people who enjoy the subtitling service and who would not get value from television without it.  I understand this subject is covered in section 43 and I hope that as a result a stronger emphasis will be placed on this service with a stronger obligation attached to its provision.  Admittedly, the subtitling service for pre-recorded programmes is excellent but news, current affairs and live programmes need more investment.  The news service is very poor on subtitling.  Fortunately, all of the Members here have a good level of hearing but if they turn down the volume on their televisions and try to follow the news by reading the subtitles they will find the service inadequate.  I hope that the obligation under this legislation will be strongly enforced and that there will be additional investment made in the area, not only by the national broadcasting service but by independent channels, to ensure people who are hard of hearing enjoy a better quality of service and quality of life.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to dwell on this point too long but important programmes, such as the nine o&rsquo;clock news, are not necessarily entirely comprised of live broadcasts.  Many reports are pre-recorded and there is no excuse for such poor subtitling in those cases.  If Members do not believe what I say they should watch the six o&rsquo;clock news or nine o&rsquo;clock news tonight, turn down the volume and see whether they can follow it by using the subtitles.  The service is not as good as it should be and I would like to see an improvement.</P>
        <P>I welcome what many of my colleagues said about an Oireachtas channel.  Apparently we are all going to become TV stars over the course of the next few months and years.  A parliamentary channel would be beneficial, although it would not be &ldquo;Top of the Pops&rdquo; with regard to viewing figures initially.  There are continual complaints from all sides of the House <Col N="1070"/>about lack of coverage and biased or unrepresentative coverage of the business of the Oireachtas.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; rightly pointed out, 99% of all the excellent, thorough work done in this and the other House and, particularly, at the committees goes almost universally unreported and unregarded.  A parliamentary channel would be helpful in this regard.  Most of the business of politics practised in Leinster House is of enormous short-term and long-term value to the people of Ireland.  The possibility of spreading the worth of our work to a greater extent is something to which we can look forward with a degree of enthusiasm.  I am hopeful there will be early progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>I hope the parliamentary channel will not simply cover the D&aacute;il and Seanad but also the European Parliament and the politics of Europe.  RTE has a ten or 20 minute slot once a month on European politics, which is entirely insufficient.  I credit RTE for at least making the effort to provide some coverage, although it is not as instructive, informative or substantive as it should be.  The new parliamentary channel might give the Irish people an opportunity to see on a more regular basis and at close quarters the work of the European Parliament which, again, is a forum in which decisions of major importance to the people of this country are being taken on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to the coverage of politics &mdash; moving beyond the question of a parliamentary channel &mdash; my colleague Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke earlier of his pleasure at the national broadcaster&rsquo;s coverage of the US presidential primary elections.  This is a matter I have addressed in the House a few times in recent months, perhaps from a slightly different perspective.  I compared RTE&rsquo;s coverage of the primaries with its lack of coverage of an election in which the Irish people will have a say in a few weeks&rsquo; time, the Lisbon treaty referendum.  I am still bemused at our fixation with the US presidential elections.  I saw a figure last week for the cost to the national broadcaster and to the taxpayer of the Super Tuesday coverage.  The coverage, if one went through it in great detail, was far from super and was perhaps a little superficial.  Every time I hear a broadcast on the US elections or read a review it strikes me that we are absolutely fixated on one candidate.  That was the case until last Tuesday, when the results of the most recent primary election seemed to put paid to the campaign of that particular challenger.  On Wednesday&rsquo;s radio and television there were almost no reports of Tuesday&rsquo;s results.  We will soon be moving on to coverage of the real presidential election in November, which will be contested by two candidates neither of whom appears to be favoured by our national broadcaster, and perhaps the coverage will be a little less excited and a little more balanced.</P>
        <P>Rather than making up this as I go along, I will say that I am taking note of some of the interesting aspects of the Bill.  Section 114 covers the principal objects and associated powers of RTE.  I note here with interest a provision which is relevant to a point made earlier by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  Subsection (2) states that RTE shall &ldquo;uphold the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression&rdquo;.  This issue has been raised here a number of times in the past few years in the context of advertising for religious papers or with a religious message, which we were told was not appropriate.  I hope that under this section the issue of advertising of religious newspapers and so on, which we were not able to address previously, will come in for more positive consideration.</P>
        <P>On the question of advertising, I support the points made by a few of my colleagues concerning the advertising of alcohol.  There can be no doubt that there is currently a national alcohol crisis.  A culture of drinking surrounds almost every event not just to an unnecessary degree but to an almost dangerous degree.  Our fixation with drink is now becoming a serious national problem which requires attention.  This has been addressed here previously by the Minister for Health and Children and various other Government spokespersons.  Advertising is a powerful vehicle for sales and marketing and for influencing people&rsquo;s mindsets.  Therefore, alcohol adver<Col N="1071"/>tising is something about which we should be extremely concerned.  I hope that under this Bill we will be able to give serious consideration to the advertising of alcohol and restrict it to the maximum possible degree.  Our culture of obsession with alcohol is one that needs urgent attention.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that this interesting Bill is before Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the commencement of its passage through the Houses.  I hope that sufficient time will be allowed on Committee Stage for us to go through the sections, maybe not line by line but in some detail.  I welcome the legislation.</P>
        <P>I had hoped to have a chance to talk about local and independent radio, an area in which significant progress has been made.  We would like to see more of this.  I was critical of RTE in some small ways but overall, as a national broadcaster, it has been a very positive institution which has transformed lives and given people an opportunity to see and hear the world.  RTE must be congratulated on this.  Now, in the new Ireland and in a new century, we have to respond to new challenges.  I hope the Broadcasting Bill will assist us in this regard.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his reappointment to Government, which was well deserved, and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I also welcome the officials from the Department.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the Bill.  I have listened to the contributions in the House and, like other Senators, I am delighted it has been introduced in this House because it gives recognition to the expertise in this regard that exists among Senators.  This well-structured Bill is a indication that the Government members &mdash; the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; are working well together.  I am satisfied with the content of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill, which will enjoy broad support from broadcasters and interest groups.  I also welcome the repeal of other Broadcasting Acts and the consolidation of all relevant legislation in one Bill.  This approach is to be welcomed in all areas of legislation as it makes statutes much more accessible for all parties concerned.  I also welcome the fact that under section 8, four of the nine members of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will be appointed based on the advice of the relevant Oireachtas joint committee.  The involvement of elected members in appointments to regulatory bodies is to be welcomed wherever possible.  Many members would be very interested in joining the committee if they were aware they would have such responsibility.  It is an indication of future developments with regard to appointments to boards.  This is the first time in legislation that joint committees will have the responsibility of nominating members to a board.  This is welcome as it is a step in the right direction.  Other Departments will follow this lead.</P>
        <P>I particularly wish to address the provisions of the Bill which deal with radio broadcasting.  Even in the era of Internet communications and mobile telephones, the old technology of radio is more popular than ever and enjoys a particular place in the Irish psyche, as was evidenced by the huge public interest and concern when RTE decided to cease broadcasting on medium wave.  This was a retrograde step.</P>

	<P>I presume RTE is monitoring this debate.  I have difficulty in picking up its longwave broadcasts.  I tried to listen into a broadcast from the Sacred Heart Church in Roscommon last Sunday, but I could not pick it up.  If I could not do so, I do not know who could.  Will those monitoring the debate investigate the issue of frequencies and how to tune into the stations in question?</P>
        <P>In section 116 the Bill establishes a fund of &euro;40 million for RTE to commission independent television and radio programmes.  This is a welcome move and the success of independently produced television programmes is well recognised.  However, while 95%, or &euro;38 million, of the fund is specifically for independent television programmes, only 1.25%, some &euro;500,000, is for independent radio productions.  That amount would barely cover the costs of administering the allocation of the funds.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that 5% of the fund, a full &euro;2 million, be allocated for independent radio productions.  Independent radio producers can contribute worthwhile programming in important but often neglected areas such as the Irish language, children&rsquo;s radio and radio dramas.</P>
        <P>In recent years, local radio stations have been steadily acquired by large corporations.  The Bill should explicitly allow the State to impose a broad and extensive range of conditions on licences to such acquisitions or transfers in many different ways.  Section 69 of the Bill sets out the conditions that broadcasting licences may contain and makes provision for conditions prohibiting the assignment of the licence or a change in the material ownership of the licenceholder if the broadcasting authority sees fit.  I welcome this development, but the Bill could also empower the authority or the Minister to, if either sees fit, make provision for the State to be reimbursed or to take a fee from any subsequent financial transaction involving the resale of State-issued licences.  This is only relevant in situations where the authority chooses not to prohibit the transfer of the licence outright, addressing the concerns raised by the Leader about the vast wealth accumulated by some individuals, which was not anticipated or catered for in previous legislation.  I am a former Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench spokesperson on broadcasting and introduced such legislation, but it was not envisaged that local radio stations would be sold to large companies.</P>
        <P>The independent Ox report commissioned by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, was published in 2004 and noted that only cross-media ownership is monitored by regulators because of plurality controls.  It recommended that changes in organisational shareholding structures should be reported to the regulatory authority.  In light of the increasing acquisition of local radio stations by groups such as UTV Radio, Communicorp, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited and Radio Kerry, which was mentioned by a shareholding Senator &mdash; they have acquired FM 104, Dublin&rsquo;s Q102, Cork&rsquo;s 96FM, 103FM County Sound, Limerick&rsquo;s Live 95FM and LMFM, Today FM, Newstalk, Spin and Dublin&rsquo;s 98FM, WLR FM, Beat, Midwest Radio and Red FM, and Shannonside-Northern Sound, respectively &mdash; it is vital that procedures for monitoring ownership of broadcasting licences are continually developed and improved.</P>
        <P>I commend the quality of local radio stations, which do good work and have brought broadcasting to the people.  I also commend community stations.  RosFM is doing considerable work in bringing radio to the people and I compliment its managers and directors.  I have a vested interest because my wife, Mary, is a director of RosFM, a non-profit organisation.  The Minister of State would agree that there should be more news input in local radio and a greater proportion of Irish, ensuring a fair hearing for Irish-produced records.</P>
        <P>Another aspect of the Bill allows the children&rsquo;s advertising code to prohibit advertising of unhealthy food aimed at children.  This is to be particularly welcomed in light of concerns about the eating habits of younger people and eating disorders in general, which were raised in the House this morning.</P><Col N="1073"/>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister has not prohibited elected public representatives from being members of the authority&rsquo;s board.  Members of the Oireachtas made it clear that a prohibition on elected councillors being appointed to such boards was unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I commend our high standards of public broadcasting, particularly in terms of RTE 1.  I commend it on its &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night, which detailed the contents of the Lisbon reform treaty.  I hope RTE 1 continues broadcasting such expos&eacute;s, as people want to know the facts and television is the best medium through which to present them.  TV3 could do more in respect of the treaty.  There should be a dedicated Oireachtas channel.  Last night, &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; was aired at 12.40 a.m.  I nodded off, but I spotted my good friend, Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, speaking well.  He is the only person I remember.</P>

	<P>We are broadcast live on the worldwide web, but that channel can only be accessed by certain people.  A dedicated broadcasting channel would be worthwhile.</P>
        <P>I compliment everyone concerned.  RTE should be more adventurous, but I compliment TG4, a brilliant station that is doing good work.  It was established by a Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Government, which was a progressive period.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins was the Minister responsible for that matter at the time and we have much to be proud of in that regard.</P>
        <P>RTE should be actively involved in the establishment and management of television and radio stations throughout the EU.  It has the ability and capacity to compete with the best and to project the Irish image.  I cannot understand why, unlike the ESB, which created jobs for Irish people, RTE is not in the 26 other member states creating jobs for Irish broadcasters.  I would have welcomed an opportunity to discuss the Eurovision Song Contest, but I will do so at a later stage.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Doherty for allowing me this time and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill broadly and look forward to the various Stages during which this side of the House will be able to table amendments where the Bill requires improvement.  I wish to discuss the Oireachtas channel in particular.  Every Member has made the point that, for a long time, the broadcasting of events in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly those in the Seanad, has been somewhere between non-existent and poor.  There were recent examples of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; not being aired on RTE television if the D&aacute;il was not sitting despite the Seanad sitting.  It is an affront to this House and its Members.  How can we expect people to engage in hot political issues such as the Lisbon treaty, a significant debate, if there is a knowledge deficit?  How can we expect the ordinary Joe and Mary Public to be aware of what is transpiring in the Houses if RTE does not bother to cover our business when the D&aacute;il does not sit?  This is an important point.</P>
        <P>Regarding the film channel, we have made significant inroads in terms of Irish films in recent years thanks to a succession of Ministers.  I wish to single out Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments on Deputy Higgins, who invested considerable resources when he had the political opportunity to do so.  There has been significant growth in the film industry.  The designated film channel is welcome, as it will allow us to showcase the best of Irish talent, put together headline films and have a strong base from which to project them.</P><Col N="1074"/>
        <P>I welcome the proposed single content regulator.  It is timely and appropriate that a broadcasting authority of Ireland be created to take over from the BCI and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, BCC.  Regarding the right of reply mechanism, it is important that a provision be included in the legislation whereby those who believe their reputations have been damaged by a production have an efficient and timely mechanism through which to rectify the situation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the important code to control the advertising of food to children, as child obesity is a considerable issue.  The Bill does not go far enough in this regard, however, and we propose to table amendments to that effect.  I look forward to putting forward proposals on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Doherty for sharing time with me.</P>

Go ginear&aacute;lta, caithimid aithint go bhfuil caighde&aacute;n iontach ard ag an teilif&iacute;s agus an raidi&oacute; sa t&iacute;r seo.

        <P>The most important consideration in regard to this Bill must be the protection of standards in the broadcasting media.  While the standard of television and radio in this country is generally high, what has happened in other countries makes clear the need to exercise vigilance.  In particular, we must ensure that public broadcasting retains its central role.  This is especially important when we consider the so-called dumbing down that has occurred within many broadcast media, particularly television.  While there are those who argue that reality shows, sensationalised chat shows and so on are a reflection of popular culture, it is equally valid to state that they are formative of popular culture and not always in a beneficial way.</P>
        <P>Likewise, there are those who would argue that recent changes in RTE radio with regard to specific niche areas of the arts are a similar reflection of public demand.  This has been used as justification for reducing the amount of time devoted to blues and classical music or to the discussion of books.  In general, however, RTE radio is far superior to most of its competitors in this regard.  The role of public broadcasting ought to be the same as that of any other public utility or service, namely, to cater for all sections of society regardless of whether there is a massive demand for particular services or whether they are commercially viable.  If those  criteria were applied to museums, public parks, libraries, playgrounds or football pitches, they would also disappear.  It is vital that this legislation protects the central role of public broadcasting.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions which provide mechanisms to ensure that unsuitable individuals or companies are not licensed.  Section 66 sets stringent criteria in regard to content including, in subsection (2)(<i>d</i>), conditions regarding the Irish language and other aspects of Irish culture.  However, it would be preferable if the Bill spelt out in concrete terms how this will be implemented, by setting out, for example, the percentage of programming and air time devoted to Irish language broadcasts and the level of Irish produced content.</P>
        <P>The Association of Independent Radio Producers of Ireland has welcomed the provision in section 116 for RTE to commission independently produced radio programmes but expresses concern at the level of funding available to ensure the sector will be able to meet any such demand.  The association has proposed that 5% of the independent programme account, which <Col N="1075"/>equates to some &euro;2 million, should be set aside for the independent radio sector.  This seems a reasonable request and is something that could be addressed by way of amendment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Maidir le TG4, t&aacute; g&aacute; le c&uacute;pla rud a shoileiri&uacute;.  Molann gach &eacute;inne TG4 na laethanta seo, agus is ceart go dtarla&iacute;onn sin, mar t&aacute; seirbh&iacute;s den ch&eacute;ad scoth &aacute; chur ar f&aacute;il aige, agus &eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh sin faoi choinn&iacute;ollacha deacra.  T&aacute; dualgas ar an tAire maoini&uacute; ceart a shol&aacute;thar do TG4.  N&iacute; leor an cheist sin a fh&aacute;g&aacute;il ag eagras nua nach mbeidh bunaithe i gceart go ceann bliana ar a laghad, mar t&aacute; leagtha s&iacute;os sa Bhille seo.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Caithfear bonn ceart maoinithe a chur faoi TG4 l&aacute;ithreach m&aacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil an Taoiseach chun gn&iacute;omh&uacute; faoin teanga, seachas bheith ag caint f&uacute;ithi, agus m&aacute;s mian leis an Rialtas a chruth&uacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin gcur i bhfeidhm a bhfuil sa r&aacute;iteas faoin nGaeilge a fhoils&iacute;odh bliain go leith &oacute; shin.</P>
        <P>The Minister, like all his predecessors, agrees that TG4 is a huge success, not just in regard to the Irish language but also in terms of the innovation and energy it has brought to public service broadcasting.  The public also considers it a success.  However, the Minister must also agree that the channel is seriously underfunded.  Each of his predecessors acknowledged this to be the case.  He has an obligation to address this funding deficit before establishing any new regulatory structure that might take years to deal with it.  We have heard a lot from the new Taoiseach about his commitment to the Irish language.  The Minister must be grateful that he will have so many allies when he seeks the increased funding that TG4 so badly needs and deserves.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to express my sincere sympathies to the Barr family on the tragic death of Maggie Barr in a car crash in Gweedore yesterday.  Maggie was a frequent contributor to various programmes on TG4 and Radio na Gaeltachta.  She will be sadly missed by many listeners, not only in my own community of Gweedore but throughout the island.  Her son also works for TG4 and RTE.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposal for an Oireachtas channel.  There is a need for an increased connection between the public and its elected representatives.  I am not sure whether many will tune in to see what goes on in the Houses.  The coverage may be listed in the <i>RTE Guide</i> on different days as either comedy, documentary or informative content.  On some days it is all three.  The proposal for a film channel is also to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider also establishing an education channel?  Significant numbers of people throughout the State struggle with literacy and numeracy problems.  Dedicated education channels are available in other countries, including in less developed countries.  In some cases, work sheets are delivered to people&rsquo;s home, both in rural communities and urban areas.  They can then watch the education channel and fill out their work sheets.  Such a service would be just as important if not more important than a film channel or Oireachtas channel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, and congratulate him on his new office.  I would also have been pleased to welcome the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, and commend him on his elevation.  Unfortunately, that elevation reduces the potential for badinage between the two of us.  We used to have great sport across the floor of the House.  Now, alas, I shall have to treat him with the respect due to a Minister.  However, I will be pleased to do so.</P>
        <P>I should declare an interest in this issue.  Being something of a Jack of all trades, I am occasionally introduced as a politician, ex-academic and broadcaster.  I partake in a certain amount of broadcasting, both when I am invited to do so by RTE and in my regular Sunday morning slot on Newstalk, which I greatly enjoy.  Therefore, I have an insider&rsquo;s view of the <Col N="1076"/>broadcasting world.  The independent stations, even those such as Newstalk which now broadcast nationally, are operating on a shoestring.  They must be nourished.  Newstalk is seeking to grow its national audience from a localised Dublin base.  However, I do not wish to be too partisan about that station.  The growth of independent stations is a positive development.  I also welcome the fostering of community radio as provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>We all have our favourite radio presenters.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned several of his.  I have always enjoyed radio as a consumer and have derived pleasure from the distinctive voices of presenters such as Tommy O&rsquo;Brien.  His wonderful mellow Tipperary tones are part of what makes his programme, &ldquo;Your Choice and Mine&rdquo;, so enjoyable.  Val Joyce has provided some wonderful radio moments which one could not expect to encounter anywhere else in the world.  I recall one occasion when the programme&rsquo;s signature tune failed and Val asked the girl in the weather forecast office if she would sing the tune.  She agreed to do so if Val helped her out and the two of them proceeded to hum the tune.  One would not get that on the BBC.</P>
        <P>Examples such as these show how radio can reach out to people and communities in a very human way.  Sometimes one might feel uninspired by a particular programme but as one listens while doing the washing-up, it brings one alive.  Some programmes are geared towards a specific audience but can appeal to a wider one.  I am thinking in particular of &ldquo;Outside the Box&rdquo;, with Olan McGowan.  It is one of the great radio programmes and it reaches out to people described as disabled and so on.  However, that is enough about the programmes in which I am interested.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have just been speaking at the lunch and annual general meeting of MIST, an organisation for people with macular degeneration of the retina.  I have the problem in a small form.  Such people really depend on radio; television is not much use to them.  I will come back to this because we must ensure the radio signal is sufficiently strong.  I have put down some amendments on the matter.  It is important to recognise the spread of the independent radio service.  A total of 63% of the population, 2.25 million people, tune into independent radio stations daily.  That is an enormous section of the population and it must be serviced properly.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill.  It consolidates an enormous welter of broadcasting legislation in a single Bill.  That is a good approach.  I welcome the installation of the broadcasting regulator through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  I also welcome the fact that a significant proportion of the appointments to the board will be subject to the advice of the Oireachtas committee on broadcasting.  I believe that committee can be used to a greater extent but I will turn to that when I discuss the levy.  With regard to the limits that apply to advertising minutes, I have been lobbied to ease this provision.  However, I do not believe it should be eased.  We have the correct balance at present and an increase in advertising to American levels, for example, would be regrettable.</P>
        <P>I agree with the broadcasting codes.  RTE can really take credit for objectivity because its coverage of the Lisbon treaty has been excellent.  It is about the only place where there has been an attempt at balance.  It certainly has not existed in this House but it has existed on RTE radio, which is welcome.  It was a pleasure to hear an MEP from Denmark give a considered view of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; case today on RTE.  One would not hear it anywhere else.  Unlike Senator Bradford, I considered the coverage of the American election superb.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that RTE should maintain correspondents in America.  I am interested in &ldquo;Super Tuesday&rdquo;, even if Senator Bradford is not.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford also mentioned alcohol advertising.  I believe it should be banned, with some form of compensation for the drastic reduction in revenue.  If we are serious about this major problem, the advertising should be addressed.  However, it does not appear to be men<Col N="1077"/>tioned in the Bill.  There is reference to children and fatty, sugary foods and so forth but the most damaging issue is alcohol.  We have already dealt with the issue of cigarette advertising.</P>
        <P>It is important that we invoke the Oireachtas committee with regard to the levy.  Why not provide that when the broadcasting authority is devising a budget it should present the budget to the Oireachtas committee in the first instance to have it approved?  When it is approved, the authority can seek the levy to service the agreed budget.  With regard to fines, people should not be sent to jail for not having a television licence.  It is nonsense.  First, it actually costs the taxpayer money and, second, one hears of awful instances of hardship.  A few days ago a woman was wrenched from her family and put in jail.  That is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The broadcasting funding scheme for commissioning radio programmes is important.  However, it does not fund recurring strands, regardless of their success.  That is similar to the old F&Aacute;S schemes, where people were brought into schemes from unemployment and made a terrific contribution but once the schemes were up and running, they were cancelled because there was a policy of not repeating the funding.  If one has a success, one should encourage, cherish and develop it.</P>
        <P>The strength of the radio signal was referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  In many parts of the country one cannot receive the RTE signal.  It fades from time to time, for example, when one is travelling on the train to Belfast.  Why is that?  It should be available throughout the island; there is no excuse for it not being available.  The Senator also mentioned that it was not easy to receive the signal in London.  That was acknowledged by RTE in January 2002.  In a letter the station said it had always been hampered by the fact that there is no clear signal reception in the greater London area.  This deficiency was a prime consideration in the decision not to replicate the RTE Radio 1 service, as the Tullamore medium wave transmitter had equal or better coverage in that regard.  That is true, but then RTE closed the Tullamore transmitter so the point made in the letter was cancelled.  The replacement frequency, long wave 252, has been downgraded and broadcasts with half its daytime licensed power at 300 KW.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with FM.  First, it does not cover the blackspots.  One must also consider the weather forecasts for fishermen.  I recall listening to those broadcasts in the same way as I listened to GAA results; I knew nothing about the GAA but loved hearing the names of the townlands I knew in Laois and around the Slieve Bloom mountains spoken in that wonderful voice.  I also listened to the fishing forecast to hear the placenames and to imagine where they were.  However, the fishing fleets are beyond the range of the FM service.</P>
        <P>We recently received leaflets about what we should do in a nuclear emergency.  There was a funny satirical programme about them on RTE Radio I recently.  If there is a nuclear facility available we might have to take shelter with our transistors, but that means we will be unable to receive the advice about what we should do, even if it is a little barmy.  That situation must be addressed.  I have attempted to do so by putting down a couple of amendments.  I will also put down amendments to deal with the issue of people being sent to jail and the question of alcohol advertising.  That will not make me popular in Newstalk but I believe there should be a compensatory mechanism for a ban on alcohol advertising.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope this House will be able to play its role in sharpening the Bill&rsquo;s focus by putting down amendments to achieve this.  There is an allocation of &euro;0.5 million for independent radio production.  That figure should be re-examined.  It should be a percentage and it should be increased.  It is the view of some of independent radio stations that up to 70% of the proposed budget would be required to manage and administer the unit in RTE for procuring programmes from independent radio producers.</P>
        <P>Finally, the broadcasting complaints commission is very welcome.  I have neither the time nor the wish to rake over the Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh controversy again but RTE did not cover <Col N="1078"/>itself in glory.  If it thinks, as its spokesperson said, that it showed its commitment to impartiality by sending the maker of that dubious programme back to Nepal to check the facts, it is not my idea of impartiality or a commitment to fair treatment.  Let us have a complaints commission with teeth.  However, the fine of &euro;250,000 is very severe.  What type of offence would provoke such a large fine?  In my experience of independent radio, such a fine would put virtually any independent radio station in this country out of business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who spoke today and last Thursday for their valuable contributions, and in particular for their constructive approach to this Bill.  The general objective is to provide a regulatory environment that is fair to both public sector and independent broadcasting companies and that will sustain and develop the broadcasting sector in Ireland and the component parts of that sector.  Its key aim is to develop a broadcasting system that is attentive to the needs and interests of the audience and viewers and to put their interests at the core of the legislation.</P>
        <P>This is reflected in a number of initiatives which have been discussed in this Second Stage debate.  These include the children&rsquo;s advertising code; the requirement on public sector broadcasters to maintain children&rsquo;s programming, which is a crucial issue of public interest for which we pay the licence fee; the requirement to maintain audience councils; the enhanced right of reply; and empowering the BAI to conduct audience surveys at the start of the broadcasting contract award process.</P>
        <P>I propose to respond quickly to some of the issues raised by Senators during the debate.  Senator O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the proposal in the Bill to require RTE for the first time to commission a certain level of programming from the independent radio production sector.  I welcome his support for this initiative, the details of which no doubt will be further discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Reilly and Brady referred to the issue of alcohol advertising.  This falls to be addressed by a number of Departments, including the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in respect of broadcasting.  Section 42 provides for the continuance of the advertising code published by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on 10 April 2007.  This code prescribes certain requirements in respect of alcohol advertising, including a ban on the advertising of particular categories of alcoholic drinks.  Section 42 also requires the new single content regulator, the broadcasting authority of Ireland, to maintain and review an advertising code, which protects the interests of audiences.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the need for public education to bring about a better understanding of how the television and radio media operate and impact.  The Senator has hit upon an important point and one which section 26, in requiring the authority to engage in the promotion of media literacy initiatives, attempts to address.</P>
        <P>Senators de B&uacute;rca and O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the proposed development of a Houses of the Oireachtas channel and an Irish film channel which will be carried on RTE&rsquo;s public service digital terrestrial television multiplex.  These two new channels offer exciting opportunities for new carriers and for the licence fee-paying public which has access to a wider range of services on a free-to-air basis.  The Houses of the Oireachtas channel will ensure the important work undertaken by Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is directly accessible to the public.  The Irish film channel will serve to support the creative efforts of the Irish and European film industry and will allow the viewing public access to the rich legacy of Irish film that has developed since the birth of the State and which we have on archive under the control of the Irish Film Board.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan referred to the UK&rsquo;s plans to switch off analogue television in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of digital terrestrial television, DTT.  In Ireland, the development <Col N="1079"/>of DTT is well under way.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, the terms of which are continued in this Bill, provided for RTE to develop a public broadcasting DTT service with space to carry the RTE, TG4 and TV3 channels.  In addition, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is running a competition to provide commercial DTT services.  In these circumstances it is expected that Irish digital terrestrial services will provide a significant range of television services and will be available initially in the south east, which is the first area to lose analogue overspill from the UK administration in 2009.  This is the precursor to the widespread deployment throughout the country of the digital service.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan also raised the issue of the proposed public service broadcasting charter which requires RTE and TG4 to place an increased emphasis on children&rsquo;s programming.  This is a positive and necessary development.  We need to restrict certain advertising during children&rsquo;s programming.  However, we cannot allow broadcasters to decide to withdraw from children&rsquo;s programming, because it provides a cultural, educational and entertainment resource that should be available through the public service operator.  It should not be left to satellite channels to provide this service as such channels cannot provide the necessary cultural context for these resources.</P>
        <P>Senator White raised issues concerning the broadcasting fund and the sound and vision scheme, a review of which is due to be carried out by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland or the new authority in 2009.  The upcoming review can be informed by the debate on this Bill and any conditions we insert.  We can steer the review in the direction it should take.  I take heart from the comments in the House supporting the scheme and we should examine the issues raised in more detail on Committee Stage.  We should consider whether to make changes, amendments or improvements or to leave the scheme in its current format.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle raised the issue of the reform of the television licence system and whether, given the availability of new technologies, we should further alter the television licence.  There are difficulties and we are cognisant of the changes in technology.  For example, it is possible to have a television in a small hand-held device and if such applications become widespread, difficulties arise with the way such portable devices are licensed and monitored.  A similar change occurred in radio licensing.  Before the size of radios began to shrink radios were large boxes with valves and transmitters and one could tune into Radio Athlone.  There was a radio licence that had to be paid.  When radios became more portable, it became impossible to police or control and we moved away from requiring a radio licence.  No doubt we will face a similar situation in television broadcasting, but we are not at that stage yet.  It is appropriate the proposed legislation allows for a continuation of this source of revenue for public service broadcasting through a licence fee.  However, we are not blind to the necessity at a later stage to be more flexible and innovative in the way we pay for public service broadcasting.</P>
        <P>The advertising on satellite channels from abroad was remarked on and it was pointed out that these channels are licensed and regulated in the country of origin and therefore do not fall under Irish law.  However, the new EU directive will allow Ireland to raise concerns with other jurisdictions where it is felt there is specific targeting of the Irish market.  The powers are limited in the new audio-visual directive but we are willing to use them where it may have an effect on inappropriate targeted advertising from another jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of the right to reply in the Bill and the attempts in it to balance redress with the need to ensure investigative journalism flourishes.  I contend this is the reason the relevant section is so long.  We have tried to strike a balance between representing the interest of the broadcaster and the viewer or listener&rsquo;s interest in having a right to reply, which does not exist at present, giving him or her the opportunity to correct any inaccurate or damaging information.  The legislation also strengthens the rights of the broad<Col N="1080"/>caster in this regard.  By providing a right of reply the broadcaster does not incur any admission of liability should there be a subsequent libel trial.  The broadcaster&rsquo;s co-operation in this regard may be considered as a mitigating action if a libel trial proved successful and damages were awarded.  We have the correct balance and careful consideration has been taken in drafting the Bill.  We will revisit the points raised by Senator Quinn and will reconsider and amend where improvements are clearly outlined on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of monopolies in local radio and referred to section 66 which requires the authority to consider the desirability of any person or company having substantial control of radio services in a given local area.  I reassure Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that this is a crucial aspect of the legislation and a development we wish to introduce.  We will give any new authority the ability to examine a local or even a larger area and decide whether the re-allocation or continuation of a licence to a particular company or individual is necessary.  The authority will have the ability to take into account the ownership that such an individual or company has, not only of other local radio stations in the area but of other media too.  If there is a situation where a person or company is dominant through ownership of press, television and radio, this can be reflected in the issuing of broadcasting licences.</P>
        <P>This is a necessary and correct development to complement the ability of the Competition Authority and others to consider any media-based mergers or acquisitions and the issuing of contracts under competition law.  We need a law which provides the ability for us to protect the public interest to ensure there is a plurality of media ownership and not excessively concentrated ownership.  That is what this Bill will provide for the first time.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of changing the name of Radio Telef&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann as a standardisation.  The RTE abroad service will be free-to-air on satellite and will include news, current affairs and some programming from TG4.  That commitment was set out last year and it was agreed by all parties in the Oireachtas that it is desirable to have free-to-air services, particularly in respect of Irish emigrant communities in the UK and elsewhere.  We have started that process and I am glad to see RTE has taken it on as part of its public service remit.  We are considering the use of a satellite channel on freesat to provide a service which will be freely available across the UK and perhaps further afield once we have formatted programming into a suitable structure.  Section 114(3)(<i>a</i>) sets out that RTE has a duty to inform, educate and entertain.  This Bill introduces measures to ensure it fulfils that duty in return for the licence fees paid by the Irish public.</P>
        <P>In regard to the subtitling and access rule issues to which Senator Bradford referred, we have to continue to ensure that broadcasters, whether they are Irish or transmitting from other jurisdictions, observe these rules so that people with disabilities are not excluded from public service and independent commercial broadcasting.  Section 96 requires RTE and TG4 audience councils to include representatives of persons with sight or learning disabilities.  The audience council will, therefore, have a specified contact point with whom these issues can be raised.  Section 38 requires the broadcasting authority of Ireland to report annually on the steps taken to improve accessibility for all users, while section 43 sets out that all broadcasters will be required to report on access rules every two years.</P>
        <P>I have given a brief response to the many issues raised by Senators and I appreciate the interest and attention they have shown to this Bill.  I look forward to discussing it further on Committee and Report Stages and to making suitable amendments where these serve the public interest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />notes the continuing problems and regular crises in the management and operation of our health services, and believes that the HSE is not working;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />further notes that the HSE has failed to meet any of the original objectives set by the Government, namely, to make the system more responsive to the needs of patients, to make the system more accountable, and to provide better value for money;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />believes that rather than improving, the situation is in fact getting worse, and that we now have a monolithic system, distanced from the patient, divorced from ministerial accountability, and driven by budgetary concerns rather than patient need.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>Accordingly, Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to initiate without delay a recovery plan for the HSE consisting of the following six steps:</P>
        <P LI="2">1. establish clear lines of authority, responsibility and reporting within the HSE, with standard-setting at national level and as much day-to-day decision making devolved to local level as possible;</P>
        <P LI="2">2. make the Minister for Health and Children answerable to the public through the Oireachtas for all aspects of health service policy and delivery, and make the Secretary General of the Department the Accounting Officer for the HSE;</P>
        <P LI="2">3. offer a voluntary early retirement, redundancy and re-deployment scheme, as part of the rationalisation of management structures;</P>
        <P LI="2">4. give each hospital and each community care area autonomy to spend its budget, allocated according to national norms. Require each hospital to establish a management board;</P>
        <P LI="2">5. accountability to the public through local and national public representatives should be at network and community care area rather than regional level and regional structures should be abolished; and</P>
        <P LI="2">6. each hospital and community care area should be required to establish a patient liaison programme in accordance with recommendation 11 of the HIQA report on Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s case.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to extend a warm welcome to the Minister.  However, I do not  believe she will be feeling quite so warm towards me when I have concluded my contribution.</P>
        <P>For the past three years we have watched with keen anticipation the workings of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which was established with reference to the Health Act 2004.  The latter provided a legal framework for the establishment of a body to assume responsibility for the management and delivery of health services from the various regional health boards that were then in place.  We were informed that the HSE pledged &ldquo;to use the resources available <Col N="1082"/>to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public&rdquo;.  This is a noble and ambitious challenge, in respect of which, unfortunately, the HSE has already failed.  Since January 2005, the HSE was supposed to manage all the varied aspects of the health service in a co-ordinated and cohesive manner in order to ensure better quality of care.  Consequently, this was to ensure that the health of all members of society would be enhanced in a whole-of-Government approach to health care.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the reality of our ailing health service is a far cry from the brainchild conceived by the Minister.  Services are being cut and relocated in a unilateral fashion, with no meaningful discussion with interested parties such as front-line employees and those availing of the service.  In south Tipperary, breast care services were transferred in a heartbeat to Waterford Regional Hospital and, while this matter was no doubt discussed at length, the final decision was announced as a <i>fait accompli</i> to the people of Tipperary when the service had already been transferred.  There was no opportunity for a local public perspective on the issue.  The experts had made their decision, regardless of the disruption this brought to women who were experiencing serious health problems and who were undergoing invasive and stressful treatment.  Consideration was not given to the distances their concerned families would be obliged to travel in order to be present to support their loved ones.</P>
        <P>Waiting lists are spiralling out of control to such an extent that many essential services are now only partially available to those lucky &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; enough to have a place on them.  Even then, there is no guarantee of the level of service that people will finally receive because there is a concerted effort to simply clear the waiting lists through one-off assessments and referrals to other services.  This will undoubtedly lead to even more waiting.  Many waiting lists have been temporarily closed due to the inability of the health service to provide the necessary resources.</P>
        <P>The HSE has already overspent by &euro;95 million in the first four months of this year.  As <i>The Irish Times</i> and other newspapers have reported, the situation is becoming worse on a daily basis.  The executive&rsquo;s attempt to address this problem through staff embargoes, limiting recruitment in particular areas to the financial constraints that apply in those areas and cutting vital services has simply resulted in further difficulties and nationwide dissatisfaction.  All those who work in front-line services are feeling the brunt of these decisions.  Morale has been badly affected, sick leave has spiralled and, given that the size of the workforce in the health area has been dramatically reduced, staff are finding it impossible to deliver the desired level of care and service.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party has studied the difficulties associated with the management of the health service and acknowledges that reversing the current position will pose a considerable challenge.  We are, however, convinced that the six-point plan I will outline will have a positive impact and return this service to the core values required to provide an equitable and responsible health service that will serve the needs of the people.  To implement the plan, it is essential the Government and the HSE recognise the need to address core issues such as the need to increase bed capacity and, as a matter of urgency, to finalise the consultants&rsquo; contract.</P>
        <P>The six steps in the plan are: to establish clear lines of authority, responsibility and reporting within the HSE, with standard-setting at national level and as much day-to-day decision making as possible devolved to local level; to make the Minister for Health and Children answerable to the public, through the D&aacute;il, for all aspects of health service policy and delivery and to make the Secretary General of the Department Accounting Officer for the HSE; to offer a voluntary early retirement, redundancy and redeployment scheme, as part of the rationalisation of management structures; to give each hospital and each community care area autonomy to spend its budget, allocated according to national norms and to require that all hospitals establish manage<Col N="1083"/>ment boards; accountability to the public through local and national public representatives should be at network and community care area level rather than at regional level, and regional structures should be abolished; and each hospital and community care area should be required to establish a patient liaison programme in accordance with recommendation 11 of the HIQA report on the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case.</P>
        <P>To deliver effective health care, we must start with the patient.  This means we must consider the available budget and ensure there is a fair allocation of funds to all areas of the country and that these funds are spent in a meaningful way at local level.  Local management teams must then be allowed to take charge of this money and direct it into the services required.  There is no doubt the local management teams in our hospitals are best placed to decide the level of funds to be allocated for the range of services provided.  A degree of autonomy will undoubtedly result in better management of funds.  Local managers surely have the wherewithal to assess the service needs, prioritise spending and ensure the continuation and development of core services.  There is no necessity for a three-tier system of management because, as a result of the level of devolvement, this ultimately leads to complete confusion and a marked lack of personal responsibility for budgets.</P>
        <P>The structure of the HSE, as it stands, is a source of great confusion.  Decisions are made and nobody seems to know who was responsible for them.  Again, simple decisions that impact locally should be discussed and made at ground level, with the necessary accountability built into the system.  Once the bulk of local decision making has been delegated to the direct management, more time and energy can be given by the leadership of the executive to developing standards that will facilitate the effective implementation of the policies of the Department of Health and Children.  This will ultimately result in a transparent, accountable and responsible health service.</P>
        <P>At present, it is almost impossible to obtain a direct answer on any issue from the Department of Health and Children.  This is largely due to the way the HSE and the Department work hand in hand.  It was initially envisaged that the Department would be responsible for the formulation of policy, while the HSE would oversee the implementation of such policy,  However, there is so much overlapping between both structures that there are no clear lines of definition.  This is an enormously grey area, with the Minister involving herself with the implementation of policy and, equally, the management of the HSE wandering into the area of policy formulation.</P>
        <P>The HSE and the Department need to work as separate and individual entities which complement each other but which also allow each other to advance their own areas of responsibility in an independent manner.  Consequently, each entity must be separately accountable for the decisions made and should be available to justify these policies and decisions to the Members of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Health and Children must ensure that budgets for new development and policy focus, as recommended in the document A Vision for Change, should be specifically earmarked for this purpose and not redirected to address budgetary deficits.  If the overall standard and delivery of care by the Department and the HSE is to be improved and refined, these funds will have to be protected to ensure development of new and innovative strategies.</P>
        <P>The next point is the offering of a voluntary early retirement, redundancy and redeployment scheme.  The original formation of the Health Service Executive brought together many different strands involved in the management of the health service.  However, all the pre-existing levels of management were simply brought forward into the HSE, with much duplication of responsibility and the resultant layers of administration that prevent the development of a streamlined organisation.  It is clear that in the interests of removing unnecessary inherited <Col N="1084"/>layers of administration, an agreeable redundancy package must be introduced.  While there will be an initial outlay associated with this redundancy package and early retirement scheme, the long-term benefits not only will leave additional funds in the coffers for essential services but also ensure each respective layer of administration can work efficiently and in a productive manner.</P>
        <P>The next point is the strengthening of decision making at local level.  Once again, the present structure of the HSE removes decision making from those who invariably implement the decisions locally.  Independent administration of the annual budget by a committee made up of members of the multidisciplinary team in each hospital will make for a personalised approach to spending where each member has a vested interest in prudent spending to maximise the returns from funds, and it will facilitate the prioritisation and development of important resources in each of the separate areas.  It is recommended that these committees would also liaise with other hospitals, forming a regional network, and with representatives of primary, community and continuing care.</P>
        <P>Labour favours the introduction of universal health insurance as part of the overall reform of the health service.  For universal health insurance to work effectively, it is necessary to strengthen local management and decision-making structures, and to enhance corporate governance at hospital level.  These kinds of reforms, therefore, will contribute in the long run to a more effective use of resources in the health service.</P>
        <P>The next point is the restoration of local accountability.  Labour is proposing that the present regional structures in the HSE be abolished and replaced with a new system of accountability.  In respect of hospitals, this would be located at the hospital network level and would involve local and national public representatives who would meet regularly and have the power to insist that health officials attend meetings and answer questions.  The focus would be on delivery of services.  In respect of social services, there would be a structure in each community care area which would similarly invigilate the delivery of social services and where public representatives could hold local social services to account, again within budgets set out by the HSE and according to national norms.</P>
        <P>The next point involves a patient liaison programme which each hospital and community care area should be required to establish in accordance with recommendation 11 of the Health Information and Quality Authority report on Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s case.  We are all aware of the repeated failures in patient diagnoses over recent years and a way forward must be put in place to ensure such systems failures do not recur.  What has emerged arising from these incidents has been the urgent need for a strong clinical governance procedure and also for the development of a patient liaison programme.  This was identified by the HIQA in the report on the Rebecca O&rsquo;Malley case and forms one of the key recommendations.</P>
        <P>Labour advocates the appointment of an independent advocate as well as a hospital-appointed dedicated patient liaison person as part of a complaints procedure.  This will ensure patients will have somewhere to go should they have any concerns.  It is essential that this recommendation be implemented as soon as possible primarily to ensure patients&rsquo; health risks are reduced and also to restore public trust in the effectiveness of our health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my pleasure to second this motion and welcome again the Minister for Health and Children to the House.  I am interested to hear her response and those of our colleagues opposite in respect of the proposals we are bringing forward.  I am bi-locating somewhat this evening as I am also attending the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  My absence during the debate is not from a lack of interest as I find myself having to be in two places at the one time.</P><Col N="1085"/>
        <P>I will repeat a challenge I threw down to the colleagues opposite yesterday.  Hardly a day or week passes without one or other of our colleagues opposite coming into this House and quite correctly criticising an aspect of the health services that has come to their attention.  Time and again they make the point about the system being dysfunctional and there being a lack of clarity in terms of responsibilities and management lines.  They express their frustration in this House in respect of particular problems that arise and, more seriously, the inability to obtain clarity and answers to genuine issues which arise.</P>
        <P>The picture inevitably painted by colleagues on all sides of the House is of an almost Kafkaesque system which is impenetrable to public representatives, to say nothing of members of the public or citizens who seek to make sense of it.  The frustration people have in trying to make sense of it has been echoed at the highest level in Government, as we know.  A number of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues have reflected this in recent months.</P>
        <P>There is a fundamental difficulty to be addressed and we do not bring this motion forward to have a go &mdash; as might be suggested &mdash; or level criticism in a gratuitous way.  We approached this issue genuinely and my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, has brought forward these proposals in a genuine attempt to have the chaos which characterises much of the operation of the health services addressed in a meaningful and practical way.</P>
        <P>I repeat my challenge to my colleagues opposite, including those who raise these issues every day.  I am disappointed with the response by way of the amendment to the motion.  I, along with others, yesterday indicated our proposals and if there are specific aspects with which the Government has a problem, it should amend them so we can have a realistic and meaningful discussion.  What we have instead is the usual response, which is to delete everything in the motion after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and insert something entirely different that does not address the issues we are attempting to deal with.</P>
        <P>If colleagues are frustrated and believe the system is dysfunctional, they can see a practical answer in the first paragraph of our motion in respect of establishing clear lines of authority, responsibility and reporting within the HSE.  That issue is not dealt with in the amendment to the motion.  There is a reference in a bullet point to yet another review.  It may be there is a need for ongoing reviews in all organisations but we seem to be in a permanent state of review in the case of the HSE.  The matter is not dealt with.</P>
        <P>A second issue is the frustration people feel in respect of accountability for delivery of services, for example.  We know we have the model of the Minister dealing with policy and the HSE dealing with implementation and delivery, as Senator Prendergast pointed out.  At least, that was the vision at the outset, but it has not worked.  The Minister has found herself having to deal with everyday issues and it appears the HSE, almost inevitably, strays into the policy area.  How could it be otherwise?</P>
        <P>If people feel, as I do, that the matter should be addressed, one would imagine it would be addressed in the amendment.  It is not, apart from a generalised acceptance that the Minister accepts full accountability.  There must be accountability at the core as the Minister must constitutionally be responsible to the Houses for what happens under the rubric of her brief.  There is no real everyday and meaningful accountability.  There is a proposal to deal with it but there is no response from the other side.</P>
        <P>For example, with regard to the HSE, the motion points to the fact that there is a statutory requirement on the HSE to manage its budget within its approved Vote.  This is the constant response one gets the whole time.  This gives rise to a genuine belief in many people &mdash; not just those on this side of the House &mdash; that the HSE is driven more by budgetary concerns than it is by real patient need.  To corral into the HSE not just the responsibility for doing the everyday job but to be the Accounting Officer for its own funding is quite wrong.  There is a <Col N="1086"/>democratic issue in this also.  It is unprecedented that a body the size and importance of the HSE, which is tasked with the health services of the country, would have the power of answerability for its budget.  There must be an issue at the core of these problems that we should examine.</P>
        <P>It was a spectacle when Members of the Oireachtas, both Senators and Deputies, gathered in the restaurant downstairs and vied to put questions to the head of the HSE and his staff.  Putting up one&rsquo;s hand in the hope that one can ask a question is not serious accountability in any real democracy or constitutional system.</P>
        <P>People sometimes say the Department of Health and Children was too weak before the HSE came about to make its writ flow, as it were.  The answer to that was to strengthen the governance in the Department of Health and Children and the way it managed the system rather than removing the power and corralling it within the HSE along with all its other responsibilities.</P>
        <P>If the Members on the other side of the House are concerned about staffing, the two constant refrains one hears about the health service, whether it is on radio, television, in this House or outside it, is that it is overstaffed and that we are throwing money at it and getting nowhere.  This is the conventional wisdom one hears every day of the week but let us consider it.  If the executive is overstaffed and the Minister believes it is, we should take an honest approach to the problem and go with a redundancy programme.  We should see the case in that regard.  People might find it odd that the Labour Party is advocating that but we do so in the sense that if there is a need for redundancies, we should have them.  Let us see the case made and have consultations, as Senator Prendergast said.  We should do it instead of maintaining the criticism of the health service that it is overstaffed.  If it is overstaffed we should address the problem.  At that stage we will see whether there is a need for redundancies and if there is not a need, that argument should be left aside.  It either is or is not overstaffed.</P>
        <P>The second point is that we are constantly throwing money at the HSE.  The notion has found its way into the public discourse that money is being thrown at the HSE and we are not getting anything back.  We have had very little discussion about outcomes.  All the discussion is about costs, as somebody said on the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme the other night, but there is little about what we are achieving.  We do spend a great deal of money on our health services.  We are right to do that and the Minister should defend that.</P>
        <P>One of the most remarkable observations made in the course of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme the other night, and it told a major story, was that fine doctors and medical people were seen to leave the public sector and go into the private sector.  What is the reason for that?  It must be partly due to the perception in the system that the action is in the private sector.  We must get the action back into the public sector.  We should favour and privilege the public sector and try to reform the current system by way of this motion, which is a set of sensible proposals that could easily be backed by any Member on the opposite side of the House if they were honest about what they were saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all the words after &ldquo;Seanad Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P FLI="0"><?oasys _is2p0- ?>&ldquo;&mdash;<?oasys _ix ?>supports the fundamental objective of the Government in health policy, that is, the achievement of best clinical outcomes for all patients throughout the country;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />affirms its confidence that this objective is best supported by setting national standards and applying them consistently; by the establishment of the Health Service Executive, <Col N="1087"/>HSE, as a unitary national health authority; and by the effective use of resources for the benefit of patients and service users;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />endorses the many confirmations by the Minister for Health and Children that she and the Government fully accept political accountability for the health services and affirms that this is the position in the Health Acts;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the review under way in the HSE of its internal organisation structure to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation, by streamlining its management structures, clarifying roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships and strengthening co-ordination, governance and accountability;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />acknowledges that a voluntary redundancy scheme for staff of the HSE would best be implemented in the light of the outcome of that review, in dialogue with the relevant staff representative associations, and with the potential for redeployment of staff having been fully identified;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />underlines the importance of the statutory requirement on the HSE to manage its budget within its approved Vote;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />supports management actions within the HSE to allocate and manage budgets at the appropriate hospital and community service levels;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />affirms the importance of management accountability within the HSE for its own sizeable budget and expresses its confidence that this objective is supported by the chief executive officer of the HSE being the statutory Accounting Officer in relation to the appropriation accounts of the Executive;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />acknowledges the steps taken in the Health Act 2004 to provide for and encourage local responsiveness of the HSE; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />welcomes the recent initiative taken by the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE in encouraging greater patient involvement in a wide range of health services.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I, too, welcome the Minister to the House.  The Health Service Executive was established in 2004, before the Minister&rsquo;s time in office, under her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  In budgetary terms it is an enormous organisation with a budget in excess of &euro;15 billion.  The HSE is the biggest organisation in the country and everybody would agree it is a work in progress rather than a finished article.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 112,000 employees in the HSE.  The complexity of dealing with the nation&rsquo;s health needs is frightening, to say the least, and in the past year an enormous amount of the HSE&rsquo;s time has been taken up dealing with the well-entrenched elites of consultants and pharmacists.  It appears that agreement is slowly being reached in both cases, which I welcome.</P>
        <P>We all know the HSE is not perfect, and the system is not perfect either.  We all have our own particular gripes, whether it is specialist centres of excellence for cancer care or overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  We must give the HSE, under the management of Professor Drumm, time to improve those areas.  When considering this issue earlier today I made a reasonable analogy and compared the health services today with the progress of a supertanker.  The latter cannot suddenly stop and turn in a small area, and an organisation as large and as complex as the HSE cannot be asked to do the same.</P>
        <P>I was interested to read in the medical supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday a short piece outlining a lecture held in Dublin City University on Monday night on information systems in <Col N="1088"/>health planning.  Professor Anthony Staines, who is a professor of public health in DCU, referred to he and his colleagues coming together last year and issuing a report that found that public satisfaction with the HSE is much greater than the perception given in the media.  It is easy for the media to ignore good news.  Professor Staines stated that the reason it is ignored by the media is because it conflicts with their master narrative.  Bad news is always better than good news.  Sensational headlines are what is important to the newspaper business.</P>
        <P>The common finding throughout Europe was that most people in Europe are happy with their health services.  Professor Staines went on to state that if we were to abolish the HSE it would be disastrous for us as a nation and it should be stoutly resisted.  If we consider the experience in the United Kingdom with the NHS, it found that changing such structures can often be counterproductive and paralyse the staff for several years while changes take place.</P>
        <P>It is wrong of Members to come into the House and criticise an organisation such as the HSE without giving any consideration to the staff who work in it.  I have family members working in the service and they tell me they are often embarrassed to say they are working for it.  They put that down to the media bashing the HSE is getting currently.  They are proud of where they work but they get embarrassed when they read the way they are perceived by the media.</P>
        <P>I wish to highlight two points in the amendment.  It states that the Government welcomes the review under way in the HSE of its internal organisation structure to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation by streamlining its management structures, clarifying roles, responsibilities and reporting relationships and strengthening co-ordination, governance and accountability, while at the same time acknowledging that a voluntary redundancy scheme for staff of the HSE would best be implemented in the light of the outcome of that review, in dialogue with the relevant staff representative associations, and with the potential for re-deployment of staff having been fully identified.  Regarding what Senator Alex White said earlier, overstaffing is being addressed in the review under way.  He would know that if he had read the amendment to the motion.</P>
        <P>A national organisation such as the HSE is preferable to the old health board system.  Modern research and science tells us that certain health treatments and services must be provided on a national rather than a local scale.  Similarly, negotiations with health service providers, whether they are nurses, doctors or pharmacists, must be dealt with at national rather than local level.</P>
        <P>We all know the problems families face, and they were discussed in the House some months ago, with the treatment and education of children with conditions such as autism.  Again, the improvements we make in dealing with those problems will be better if dealt with nationally rather than locally.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As a nation we are living longer and are now healthier than ever before but as we age our medical needs become greater and more costly.  That is an enormous challenge for all western countries, including Ireland.  Given the limits of our national finances, we are particularly sensitive to that.  I believe in a national organisation such as the HSE providing our health care.  I am not naive enough to believe everything the HSE does is perfect or even acceptable in some cases but I reiterate that the HSE is the equivalent of a child in its early days in education.  It is work in progress and it must be given the necessary time.  I refer again to the points made by Professor Anthony Staines, the expert in the field of health planning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion and I commend the Labour Party Senators on submitting it and providing <Col N="1089"/>the time to debate it.  There is urgent need to address this issue, to examine how the HSE is performing, how it delivers services and the relationship, in terms of responsibility and accountability, between the HSE and the Minister in her Department.  All these issues emerged in a number of reports last year as being key to the delivery of health care services.  There have been two serious investigative programmes by &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; in recent weeks, one on the delivery of services to young people at risk, the other on the pace and rate of delivery of primary care teams.  Both programmes were critical of the delivery issues. </P>
        <P>It is not, of course, only on television programmes that we hear such things.  We also learn from the direct experience of clinicians and patients.  One of the key issues that comes up repeatedly, which is not addressed by the Government amendment, is that clinicians feel alienated from HSE structures.  This is not about bashing the staff of the HSE.  I agree with Senator Feeney on this matter.  A great number of people in that organisation want to do their very best.  It is about how services are delivered and the experiences of people.  It is clear there are major problems.  I am not alone in saying this.  The Fitzgerald report, which was commissioned by the Minister to analyse this, stated that doctors described the HSE as a &ldquo;low trust&rdquo; organisation concerning relations between clinicans and administrative officials.</P>
        <P>We must admit this is happening if we wish to change it.  I spoke to a clinician today who told me that when he goes home at night it was not the patients that are on his mind in terms of pressure, nor is it the services he is trying to deliver.  He said what is on his mind is how he will deal with the bureaucratic structures within which he must work and how to get across to the administrators the needs of his front-line job.  Those words came from a person who is trying to give service in a very disadvantaged area.  In his experience, the relationship between clinician and administrative back up is highly problematic.  A number of people to whom I spoke today said they do not believe anybody is listening to them.  As clinicians, they feel very strongly that their experiences go unheard within the present structures.  This is a very serious issue and I believe it is real.  People are not imagining such things.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Yesterday the Joint Committee on Health and Children heard representatives of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.  I found it traumatic to listen to them because their needs were so great and the lack of delivery to them was extraordinary.  They talked about the need for more personal assistants in order that they might be independent.  In the health service right now, despite all the money available, these people do not get what they need.  To take that group alone, one would have thought that after 11 years of the Celtic tiger, it would be automatic and routine that they would have personal assistants.  These people are in dire need and what they need is not available to them.  We know also that patients from the National Rehabilitation Hospital cannot go home at present because they cannot get enough home-care packages.  I raised this at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Minister knows, I know and everybody in this House knows we could quote example after example.  Something is seriously wrong.  What disturbs me about this amendment is that it contains denial.  There are two ways of looking at it.  The Minister is asking us to welcome the review of the organisation to improve its effectiveness and efficiency by streamlining its management structures, clarifying roles and responsibilities, reporting relationships, etc.  It is an indictment of the Minister, the Department of Health and Children and of the HSE that after four and a half years of an organisation that was meant to deliver, the Minister comes here to tell us a review of its basic roles and responsibilities is taking place.  It is an admission of failure that such measures are needed.  The reports have stated clearly that these things must be done.  Every report has identified this.  What has gone wrong?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s explanation to the House that an organisation she set up is not delivering ?  Why has it gone wrong?  Who has been in charge?  How has this been allowed to develop?  Why, after four and a half years of the HSE, are such measures needed?</P><Col N="1090"/>
        <P>The other side of the coin is that for 11 years we have had a Government made up of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats which has had more money for delivery of services than any other Government.  We have a population that approaches 4 million and we have not been able to organise our health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have no doubt that very serious questions will emerge about the public private partnerships that have been so popular with this Government.  It is clear from the experience in England, for example, that there has been huge spending over budget on many such projects.  This will emerge here too.  I heard somebody say at the weekend that if one wishes to know where the money has gone that should have been providing front-line services in England, he or she should look to the waste in public private partnerships.  It is questionable to assume that these structures deliver the best front-line service in health.  This model has been used.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed there is a need for this debate.  It is distressing for people in every sector.  I could go into detail on all of them but will mention just two where delivery for the patient has failed.  At the end of the day patient care is what we are here to talk about, not about structures for the sake of structures.  We are here because we want the structures to deliver care to patients.</P>
        <P>There should be an inquiry into the outbreak of the C.difficile infection in Loughlinstown Hospital where 16 people died in order that we can learn from the mistakes made.  The Minister will have seen what happened in Maidstone in England.  This is an incredibly serious infection with devastating results.  We have had a very serious outbreak with 16 people dead.</P>
        <P>The other area I will mention is mental health and the decision to locate the Central Mental Hospital beside a prison.  This is against all international best practice.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that decision, which I assume was made by her and that she will take responsibility for it.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment shows a degree of complacency in that it does not inject any urgency into the crisis in the health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad notwithstanding the fact that some of its Members think I have no accountability here.  It is unusual that I do not as I am here so often.  I always enjoy attending debates in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we do not get the basic facts right, we will not have an informed debate.  I want to tell Senator Fitzgerald that the HSE is not four and a half years in existence, nor even three and a half years.  The HSE was established in January 2005 after a prolonged period of analysis carried out by prospectors and others and after widespread consultation with a number of stakeholders.  The reason for advancing a unified organisation for Ireland was that, with a population of 4.3 million, we had 11 health boards with 273 members covering very small populations.  It was not possible to provide quality assured services with such a small population.  I advance the view again that it would not have been possible to have implemented the cancer control programme if we still had the old health board regime.  The midland health board has no cancer centre, the north east and north west are similarly without specialist cancer centres.  When the health plan of former Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan, was put into effect by the health boards, all the evidence backed up this point.  In the midlands, for example, each hospital got a slice of the action and this meant patients did not receive a quality-assured service.  Consequently, a unified service is right for Ireland.  It is right in terms of delivering effective quality-assured services and ensuring that we minimise the cost associated with their delivery.</P><Col N="1091"/>
        <P>Another myth suggests that since I became Minister and the HSE was established, the level of bureaucracy increased greatly at the expense of front-line staff.  Since the HSE was established, there was a reduction of 423 staff in its own corporate headquarters alone.  There has been an increase in front-line hospital staff in the order of 6,000.  There has been an increase of just under 6,000 staff at community and primary care level and a considerable increase in the number of therapists.  This is not understood.  I constantly read articles and hear references in both Houses to the effect that there has been a growth in bureaucracy since the HSE was established and since I became Minister.  We have increased the number of physiotherapists by 20%, the number of occupational therapists by 45% and the number of speech and language therapists by 28%.  The number of consultants has risen by 18%.</P>
        <P>On the issue of clinical involvement, I am a strong fan of clinical leadership.  The cancer control programme was recommended to the Government by a group of 23 people, 17 of whom were medics.  The success of that programme is very much dependent on clinical buy-in.  With a view to implementing the programme, Professor Keane, a medical oncologist, has recruited to his team Dr. Arnie Hill, a breast surgeon from Beaumont Hospital, Dr. Donal Hollywood, a radiation oncologist, and Dr. Maccon Keane, a medical oncologist from Galway.  These three clinicians are working part-time with Professor Keane on the implementation of the programme and there is considerable buy-in from doctors around the country.  Only recently Professor Keane addressed up to 200 surgeons in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  I know from many sources that when he left that meeting, virtually nobody in the room disagreed with what is happening.  Individuals in particular circumstances may not like what is happening but, by and large, there is considerable clinical buy-in, bearing in mind that there is never unanimity.</P>
        <P>The new contract of employment for consultants, which was agreed recently by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, which represents 80% of practising consultants, was favoured by 80% of consultants while 20% were against it.  An important feature of the transformation of doctors&rsquo; working practice is the idea of working on a team with a clinical director.  At present, consultants work as individuals, or lone rangers, within hospitals.  There are a few exceptions, as in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, where there is a clinical directorate model that works very well.  Some consultants tell me they work &ldquo;in the hospital and not for the hospital&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Lead clinicians must work in teams to provide cover in the hospital and to provide the excellence and expertise we require.  The clinical director will be responsible for ensuring there is structured cover by consultants when the hospital requires it, be it on Saturday, Sunday or in the evening.  There will be two directorates &mdash; a medical directorate and a surgical directorate.</P>
        <P>It took so long to agree on the consultants contract mainly because of the issue of access to private practice in public hospitals.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to doctors not being very enthused by the problems that arise.  They do not go home worrying about their patients, apparently; they go home worrying about the bureaucracy.</P>
        <P>Irish doctors are the best paid in the world.</P>

	<P>I did not say it was bureaucracy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish doctors are the best paid in the world by a long margin, as are all health care professionals.  As I stated previously, pharmacists are paid, on average, &euro;100,000 more here than in Northern Ireland, yet we cannot get support for the reforms we are introducing.  Under the new regime, we will ensure that as a result of the high public salaries, there <Col N="1092"/>is greater concentration on access based on medical need rather than private insurance or financial means.</P>
        <P>In the public hospitals, nearly half of the patients of some clinicians, some of whom are not great fans of mine, are private fee-paying patients.  I used to be a great fan of universal insurance but the reality of universal insurance in Ireland would be that we would simply be paying consultants a couple of hundred more million euro to see the patients they are supposed to see to justify their public salaries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have just come from a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on health involving the HSE, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach on aspects of the transformation agenda.  Among the changes are the measurement of performance, including the number of patients being seen at outpatients departments.  There are many measurement requirements in the public health system.  One thing is certain, if one does not measure, one cannot succeed in managing.  The reality is that there is a great disparity between the number of patients seen in each outpatients unit of the same specialty.</P>
        <P>In the other House recently I referred to Dr. Tubridy, a neurologist in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  As a result of changing the way the neurology department operates, he was able to double, in the course of 18 months, the number of patients being seen in a calendar year.  The doctors were able to devote twice the time to each patient on foot of the appointment of administrative support staff.  No further resources were required.</P>
        <P>In the physiotherapy department in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, 18% of patients did not turn up for outpatient appointments.  This clearly implies the slots are not available to other patients.  However, as a result of patients being able to make their own appointments in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital at times that suit them, and as a result of texting and other simple measures, the hospital has enjoyed a 50% reduction in the number of patients not showing up for appointments.  The hospital intends to decrease the figure to a negligible level of 1% or 2%.  I salute these kinds of initiatives.</P>
        <P>The change under way involves measuring performance.  As I stated, 18% of patients do not show up for outpatient appointments.  We know that for every one new patient seen, there are almost three repeats.  There should not be repeats in that with a few exceptions, they should be seen at general practitioner level.  Very often the patients do not see the consultant but might see the consultant&rsquo;s registrar.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Measuring what is happening is essential to changing performance.  I accept that some do not like this.  Some doctors have said to me they are independent, which is true for clinical matters, but this does not mean that we cannot measure what is happening in the public health system with a view to improving performance.  This is happening across the system and will happen also at the community and continuing care levels.</P>
        <P>Central to the reforms is ensuring that those who are accountable for spending the money and delivering the service are accountable to the Oireachtas.  We should not confuse accountability for the Vote or the finance with the responsibility of the Minister.  Nobody would suggest that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not responsible for law and order and matters concerning crime and justice, yet it must be borne in mind that the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer.  Similarly, Professor Drumm is the Accounting Officer in the health system.  He gets the money voted for the public health service by the Oireachtas and attends meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, as he will do tomorrow, to account for how it is spent.  That, in my view and that of anyone who has considered management systems and the need to ensure responsibility for service delivery, is very important.  It was not good enough under the old regime when the Secretary General of the Department of Health in <Col N="1093"/>Hawkins House was the Accounting Officer for every single health board in respect of how they spent their money.  Clearly, this does not make sense.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General is not involved with every HSE area or hospital.  He is not involved operationally in the delivery of services on a day-to-day basis.  To expect him to be accounting for the spending of every single penny does not represent good management, nor does it lead to a very close link between the money and the performance in respect of its allocation.</P>
        <P>Since the HSE was established, it received an increase of &euro;5 billion, which is more than the amount spent running the entire health service in 1996.  That puts what I am saying in context.  Health care is expensive.  Those who work in the health service are generally well paid, as they should be, and are highly skilled professionals.  Given that we pay them good salaries, we are entitled to ensure the best possible outcome.  It is a question of outcomes and nothing else.  It is not a matter of driving budgets, although everybody must live within his budget, as used to be the case under the health boards.  It is a question of ensuring the allocated budget is spent as wisely as possible in delivering enhanced quality-assured care to patients and service users.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that making hospitals responsible at a local level to local communities will work.  However, I am a major fan of patient advocacy and every group appointed by me has included people solely with a patient advocacy role.  For example, last week I was pleased to meet the new Medical Council, which now has a lay majority.  While it will not take effect until next month, its members held a three-day induction course in a County Wicklow hotel from Thursday to Saturday of last week and I was pleased to meet them.  Ms Margaret Murphy was one of those whom I appointed.  I met her through a patient safety conference in the United Kingdom organised by its chief medical officer.  She had come to his attention because she had been obliged to litigate to establish the reason her son had died in a hospital in Ireland as a result of an adverse incident and no one would give her an answer.  That era is over and patients are not obliged to litigate to find out what happened.  Inquiries will take place, lessons will be learned from them and there will be a change in respect of how patients are handled.</P>
        <P>Only three weeks ago, Professor Drumm and I launched a new patient involvement strategy, which must be devolved to the lowest possible level at hospital, community and nursing home level.  For example, many nursing homes now have user councils whereby those who live in such nursing homes can put forward their views on how they operate.  It could pertain to simple matters such as the presence of a coffee bar.  I learned of a case recently in which the residents observed they had nowhere to meet someone to have a cup of coffee.  While these are simple matters, they make a great impact on the quality of service that can be supplied.</P>
        <P>I wish to deal with the rate and pace of the establishment of the HSE, which has been mentioned.  Prior to the passage of the legislation in 2004, an interim board was established in 2003.  However, the interim board had no statutory backing and it was impossible for it to do certain things.  It was necessary to create a body that had legislative backing to take forward the agenda.  At that time, it was not possible to decide what staffing levels should be.  It was much more effective to launch the organisation, put in place a new chief executive office and management structure and then allow the new management structure to decide what staff ratios were required.  Recently, a consultancy called Empower has carried out a review of clerical and administrative staff within the HSE.  Believe it or not, the HSE is on a par with the Scots, the Welsh, the British, the French and so on in respect of the numbers of administrative and clerical staff in the organisation.  However, huge discrepancies exist between one region and another arising from the old health boards.</P>
        <P>It is important to perform such exercises and to have the experience of trying to manage before deciding on redeployment and voluntary redundancies.  The State has operated very few voluntary redundancy programmes.  However, many people observed, of the last such prog<Col N="1094"/>ramme, that the wrong people left, some of whom then returned as consultants to the system.  I do not want that to happen.  If a voluntary redundancy programme is to be carried out in which it is known exactly who is needed and where, it must be based on ensuring the required skill sets are retained in the organisation and that those who have a skill set that may not be required in a particular area are encouraged to move on by way of voluntary redundancy.  While I believe this to be possible, it must be done carefully and properly.</P>
        <P>Moreover, McKinsey &amp; Company has performed a review with Professor Drumm and the board of the HSE&rsquo;s management structure regarding positions and accountability and whether to keep two pillars, that is, a primary care or continuing care pillar and, for example, a hospitals pillar.  The failure to integrate is an issue at local level in particular and these issues must be examined in the context of an organisation that at least knows what it is about.  One cannot do such things with an interim board with no statutory backing.  This is a mission that has never been embarked on in Ireland previously, in either the public or private sectors.  This is something that has been attempted only in very few public systems around the world.  No one has ever sought to perform this kind of change on the scale being attempted in Ireland through the HSE with more than 100,000 people, many of whom work in voluntary organisations that are funded, but not owned, by the HSE.  Virtually no acute hospital in this city is owned by the HSE, contrary to the popular view.  Such hospitals are funded by the HSE but are in the voluntary sector and are owned by others.  Ireland has a strange structure and we must ensure, as we move forward in respect of the organisation of our public health system, that we do so in a way that makes sense.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the issue regarding Clostridium difficile.  Until May of this year, it was not measured and was not notifiable.  Consequently, making it notifiable naturally gives rise to headlines outlining the number of outbreaks that have occurred.  There were no outbreaks previously because no one was responsible for notifying them to anyone else.  Sometimes, positive developments, such as requiring a hospital to notify, are seen in a negative context.  Hospitals now are required, because of enterprise liability, to inform the State Claims Agency of all adverse events that take place.  This has been perceived by some media commentators as a highly negative development, with reports of so many adverse incidents in this hospital or the other.  Worldwide, 10% of hospital experiences are adverse but thankfully, only 1% are fatal while the other 9% are non-fatal.  This statistic obtains in Canada, New Zealand, the United States and in many European countries.  Unless such events are reported, we certainly will not learn from the experience and will not improve matters from a patient safety perspective.</P>
        <P>As for our population and home-care packages, I accept we have a long way to go to put in place the requisite home supports for older people.  However, we started from a base of virtually zero a couple of years ago and now have 11,000 older people being clinically supported at home with the various therapies that facilitate them remaining at home rather than going into residential care.  Moreover, Ireland has an extremely young population.  It has the second youngest population of the approximately 40 countries in the OECD.  Ireland has the youngest population of the 27 member states in the EU with 11.1% being over the age of 65.  The equivalent percentage in Italy and Germany, for example, is 20% and I understand it is approximately 16% in France and the United Kingdom.  Ireland has an extremely young population but often does not get the benefits of that young population.  Our health spending at 9% of national income is the average across the OECD.</P>
        <P>My point is that health reform is in its infancy.  I personally believe strongly that a corner has been turned.   I see this every day.  The health awards took place a few weeks ago and I could not believe the kind of examples of innovation that were happening, in many cases <Col N="1095"/>without any new resources, simply by people thinking outside the box and being encouraged to view matters differently.  In particular, measurement drives performance.  Senator Quinn, who is present, is a businessman and I am certain he used to measure how his staff performed.  I always saw him on the shop floor any time I went into the Superquinn in Lucan or into any other Superquinn branch.  It seemed to be that he was present in all the Superquinn branches at once.</P>
        <P>Managers who measure can manage and those who do not, cannot.  Members are aware that some people who give the impression of working hard sometimes do not produce many results.  A new era of measuring has arrived.  It will involve, as noted previously, measuring outpatients and what happens in the community sector.  As for contracts of employment, negotiations have yet to take place with the general practitioners and others.  The remuneration of those who give a better service, work longer hours and so on, as many do in rural areas, should support and incentivise this.  Sometimes in the past those who shouted loudest and complained most got the resources.</P>
        <P>Individual cases, which always are very sad, in which services do not match expectations always will arise.  There always will be the potential to improve and the health service is no different in that regard.  Perhaps it never will be different as no health system is.  There will be constant issues because democracy means that citizens are concerned about their health and naturally they will make their public representatives aware of when things do not happen.  Equally, there are huge numbers of positive developments.  Senator Prendergast mentioned moving the breast services from Clonmel to Waterford.  That has happened and, as she is aware, I visited South Tipperary General Hospital only two weeks ago, where I visited the oncology ward and spoke to a number of women who had undergone breast surgery in Waterford.  They were extremely satisfied with the service they received and were particularly pleased to be able to have their oncology treatment in South Tipperary General Hospital.  This also will be the case in counties Sligo and Mayo and everywhere else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland is one of the best performers in the world in respect of the treatment of children&rsquo;s cancer.  The service is centralised in Crumlin and chemotherapy is delivered in 16 hospitals through a protocol throughout the country.  It is known that Ireland performs extremely well with children&rsquo;s cancer.  It does not do well with other cancers because of the fragmentation of the service.  We must learn from this and must be sufficiently courageous to inform ourselves, examine the best international practice, consider all the evidence available to us and then implement it because sometimes we have fallen down on implementation.  When doing so, we do a great disservice to patients and to ourselves and that era is over.  Members of the public are up for the kind of change that is under way and are patient enough to wait for it, notwithstanding the fact that it causes heartbreak and difficulties when services cannot be provided as quickly as we would wish.  Improvements in accident and emergency services are a fine example of this as they are 70% better than in 2003.  Comparing this month to the same month in 2003 shows a huge improvement in waiting times and we must do better.  At present an average waiting time of 12 hours is the target and we aim to half that later this year.  The target time, from when one presents to when one is admitted or discharged, will, hopefully, be no more than six hours.  If we can adapt these targets on an incremental basis we will have a public health service of which people can genuinely be proud.  Hopefully countries will look to our public health services in the way they have looked to our economic performance in recent years.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to be in the House to deal with this motion.  I compliment the Labour Party on putting forward proposals and some of them are already happening.  There must be clear lines of accountability and responsibility.  It would be nice to press a green button in order that they could happen instantly but that is not possible.  However, they are going on as we speak and the internal restructuring of the organisation is happening at great pace.  A new human <Col N="1096"/>resources director in the HSE starts on 9 June and we have seen the huge effect of the estates manager, Mr. Brian Gilroy, on leveraging the values of properties to invest in the capital programme.  I believe that as the summer passes and the organisational structure is put right due to the HSE&rsquo;s internal analysis, some of the issues referred to in the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion will be addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and appreciate that she comes here regularly.  She answers our questions and seems to have figures at her fingertips that she does not have to read from a prepared script.  On her last visit here, very recently, I expressed my support for her objectives.</P>
        <P>Some seven or eight years ago I visited a number of hospitals to inquire how we will get around the big problem facing us.  This long predates the Minister&rsquo;s current situation and responsibilities.  I am a great believer in delegation and passing responsibility to where the action is and where customers, in this case patients, are located.  I came to the conclusion at that stage, as did the Minister, that health boards were not the solution because every town, community and county wanted its own hospital and centre of excellence.  I support the Minister&rsquo;s moves in recent years to try to achieve her goal in this regard and the national cancer strategy, announced last autumn, is an example of this.</P>
        <P>The national cancer strategy indicates that breast cancer services should be centralised in eight cancer centres based on clinical excellence and the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients per year.  The logical assumption is that smaller units will close and services relocate to a larger unit.  A figure of 150 new cancer cases per year is the minimum for a designated cancer centre.</P>
        <P>Let me take one instance of a concern my attention was drawn to in Cork.  The situation in Cork is unique in that two hospitals, Cork University Hospital and the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital, currently provide breast cancer services.  The newly built and recently opened BreastCheck unit is located adjacent to the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital unit and is effectively an integral part of it.  The breast cancer unit in the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital is currently the largest unit in the country and handled 220 newly diagnosed patients last year.  This year it is on target for somewhere between 300 and 320 patients, excluding BreastCheck patients, who make up another 100.  The South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital has a well organised multidisciplinary team and is one of the few units in the country to meet the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards with good, well-established data collection for quality assurance.  The Minister has often mentioned that numbers equate to quality.  Cork University Hospital deals with about 80 newly diagnosed cases per year and has only one breast surgeon.  It is the regional trauma centre and the wards are often full of trauma and fracture patients.  Other surgeries, including cancer surgery, get cancelled or postponed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House as he has not been here in my time.  Our problem is that Cork University Hospital has been chosen as the designated breast cancer centre for Cork and that services will cease at the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital.  The consultant medical staff in the Cork hospitals would be happy with this if a purpose-built facility adequate to cope with the clinical workload of around 500 new cancer cases per year existed in Cork University Hospital but it does not and would take years to plan and build.  A unit dealing with 500 new cancer cases may even be too big, given the multidisciplinary meetings and outpatient clinics that would be associated with this workload.</P><Col N="1097"/>
        <P>Professor Tom Keane came to Cork recently and, while previously he had indicated he would be data driven, to use his term, in his implementation of the cancer strategy, he subsequently backtracked on this and is going to implement the strategy to the letter of the document.  He indicated that all breast cancer services would be relocated to Cork University Hospital by May next year, which I believe to be an impossible timescale as there has been no engagement with any clinicians in the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moving a large unit into a smaller one is bizarre, to say the least, and patient care will be adversely affected by moving services to Cork University Hospital.  The service would be better located at the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria University Hospital in the short to medium term while a longer term, properly resourced strategy is put in place.</P>
        <P>I apologise if I have concentrated on a particular instance and I hope it is an exception, rather than a typical example of what may happen elsewhere.  The amendment to this motion supports the fundamental objective of the Government&rsquo;s health policy, which, it says, is the achievement of the best clinical outcomes for all patients throughout the country.  We will assume that Cork achieves that fine objective.  This case may be only one instance but the figures that have been brought to my attention suggest that if this is happening elsewhere the matter needs immediate attention.  I assume the case in Cork is the exception to the rule.  I have great admiration for what is taking place and I believe the HSE is getting on top of this.  Last time she was here the Minister gave us figures and judging from her words today I believe she is confident that she and the HSE are getting on top of this.  I have used the case of Cork and ask to be excused for concentrating on one instance, but if it is an example of what is happening elsewhere it needs serious attention.  If it is something that is an example of a unique exception the Minister may be able to handle it.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the HSE and those mentioned by the Minister today are supported by all of us.  The manner of achieving those objectives is crucial and I believe the Minister is confident we will succeed, though we need the support of everyone in the country to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the Government amendment to the motion and welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the management and operation of our public health service.  This is a matter of concern not only to all public representatives but to all members of our society.  I agree with the Minister that the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion was tabled in that spirit of concern.</P>
        <P>The fundamental objective of the health policy of this Government is to achieve the best clinical outcomes for all patients across the country.  This is a central tenet of the health service reform programme.</P>
        <P>The reforms are aimed at helping to deliver a health system that is more responsive and adaptable and that more effectively meets the needs of the population at an affordable cost.  The principles underlying the Government decision in June 2003 to establish the Health Service Executive as a national health authority are as valid today as they were four years ago, namely, to improve patient care, to provide a new national focus, to reduce the fragmentation of the health service and to improve budgetary and service planning.  Nobody, I believe, is suggesting that we should go back to a time when we had a plethora of health boards operating almost independently of one another.  In a small country of 4 million people it made perfect sense to move towards a centralised and more efficient model of health care and this continues to be the case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important to clarify the current governance and accountability frameworks, both within the HSE and between the HSE and the Minister, as there appears to be a small amount of confusion about the precise position.  The board of the HSE is accountable to the Minister. <Col N="1098"/> The CEO is accountable to the board and has responsibility for the implementation of the board&rsquo;s operational policies.  The CEO is also answerable to the Oireachtas in his capacity as Accounting Officer for the appropriation accounts of the HSE.</P>
        <P>The annual service plan, which sets out the quantum of services to be provided in any financial year by the HSE from the resources allocated to it, is the primary vehicle through which the Minister and her Department monitor and evaluate the performance of the executive against the targets set out in the plan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ultimately, the Minister and the Government are politically accountable for all aspects of the health services.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has confirmed this many times.  The specific political accountability of the Minister under to the Health Acts is quite clear, and I do not subscribe to the theory that the establishment of the HSE has in some way diluted her political accountability or that of the Government collectively.  Senator Alex White mentioned the issue of political accountability and previous suggestions of a democratic deficit in the way the HSE is operated.  My experience at local level in Galway is that we have accountability and a democratic input into the operation of the health service.  I and other Members of the Oireachtas have regular meetings with our local health manager and we are her eyes and ears on the ground in that we funnel to her the concerns and needs of the people we represent.  I do not know whether there is a similar process in other areas but there should be.</P>
        <P>The budget for the HSE for 2008 is &euro;14.2 billion, or almost &euro;10,000 for every taxpayer in the country.  This amount is more than a quarter of Government current expenditure and is nearly the equivalent of total estimated income tax receipts.  Given the sheer scale of this budget, it makes perfect sense that those who have responsibility for managing and delivering services out of the budget should be also accountable for it.  Senator Prendergast mentioned in her speech the wisdom of granting real powers to local management and suggested that these bodies should be given real autonomy in running their local health services.  A welcome development this year is the assignment by the HSE of budgets, approved employment ceilings and service delivery commitments to named individual budget holders at both hospital and community service levels.  These managers are being held accountable throughout 2008 by means of the HSE monthly performance monitoring reporting system.  This represents real and tangible accountability and it is being delivered by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The HSE was formally established on 1 January 2005 and, some three years later, the current review of its internal organisational structure is timely.  The objective of this review is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation.  The Minister for Health and Children agrees that a properly planned and managed voluntary redundancy scheme could have an important role to play in helping to streamline management within the HSE.  This should result in an improvement in the delivery of health services to patients.  Such an initiative would mean the numbers involved in senior management should become integrated and streamlined.  There will need to be much greater clarity in terms of roles and accountability.  Absolute clarity will be also necessary on the staffing requirements of any revised internal organisational structure based on the review I mentioned earlier.</P>
        <P>The issue of safety in the delivery of health services lies at the heart of any care system which has the confidence of the people using those services.  Although the health sector is one of the most complex areas of activity in any country, it must by its very nature command the confidence of those who use it.  Patient safety and quality of service are at the heart of the Minister&rsquo;s agenda.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, which was established in May 2007, is responsible for setting and monitoring standards across health institutions and services in the public sector.  Its functions also include the undertaking of investigations, the evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies and the evaluation and <Col N="1099"/>setting of standards for information on health services and the health and welfare of the population.  There are still some services that are not operating to the highest standards, and errors have been made.  However, the new system of checks and balances is working, as demonstrated by HIQA investigations and other service reviews being carried out by the HSE.  We must now ensure that we learn from these events by improving the service and maintaining a higher standard.</P>
        <P>Earlier this month the Minister for Health and Children launched the national strategy for service user involvement in the Irish health services, which is one of the most exciting and interesting developments in the reform programme.  The strategy was developed by her Department in partnership with the HSE and will drive service user involvement in our health services.  As a result of this strategy, new primary care teams will work with their patients and local communities to develop models of service provision that will meet their needs.  Older people and their families will have the opportunity to speak about the quality of their community care provision.  Mental health service users will be able to work with service providers to tailor their health care appropriately to their specific needs.  Through this strategy, service user involvement will enable the health services to anticipate problems and avoid complaints and it will guarantee that service users will be at the centre of efforts to drive up the quality and safety of service provision.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children has only had one interest at heart since her appointment to that role, and that is the interest of every patient who accesses our health system.  She has taken total responsibility for providing a world class health service.  In my short time in this Chamber I have seen no other Minister appear before us so often.  I have seen no other Minister with such a command of his or her brief and such a commitment for far-reaching and meaningful reform.  She is accountable and committed, and with all our support she will succeed in making that reform happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed that some of the Senators who have been criticising the HSE for the past nine months have not shown themselves in the House today.  I would like to hear them repeat some of the comments they made during the year about the HSE.</P>
        <P>There is a philosophy in the HSE of budget management rather than demand for services.  That is the reality I see every day.  It is there in the answers I receive to my questions and in what people tell me.  I agree with Senator Alex White, who summed it up better than me when he said that the body should not have the power of answerability over its own budget.  It is true.  When we ask a question about the health service and hear the phrase, &ldquo;This is a matter for the HSE&rdquo; in the reply, the reality is that the HSE is not accountable, despite the efforts of the previous speaker to outline his version of the lines of accountability.  It is not accountable in a similar way to any other agency in the State, which, given that we are talking about people&rsquo;s lives and health, is shocking.  That is why the second point in our motion states that we want the HSE to be accountable to the Oireachtas.  This is an imperative.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While speaking I will dip in and out of various areas, mentioning in particular the area from which I come, the mid west, and specifically north Tipperary.  I wish to mention the future of acute hospitals, particularly smaller hospitals.  Last week in my area of Nenagh &mdash; not to be too parochial about it &mdash; two of my colleagues, Deputies Lowry and Hoctor, were falling over themselves, as usual, to announce a new surgical and endoscopy service and a sterile unit in Nenagh hospital.  When the HSE gets its act together this will cost &euro;15 million, as there are various components to be put in place.  This is fantastic news and it is very welcome.  However, it does not in any way suggest that the existence of this hospital and its services will be prolonged.  Using it as an example of a small acute hospital &mdash; it is one of the smallest although it <Col N="1100"/>has a large geographical area &mdash; it can be seen that despite the large geographical area and the 15,500 people who use the accident and emergency department, it is constantly under threat.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have an elderly care unit that is much in demand but is sporadically closed down, despite the fact that it is in the backyard of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  As everybody in the House is aware because it has received national attention, we have a CT scanner that has been sitting in bubble-wrap for a year and a half while people are ferried to and from Limerick for scans.  In addition, the bed capacity is continually being cut.  This is the reality of what the HSE has done to small acute hospitals.  This hospital is underfunded, like many other small hospitals, despite the small &mdash; or minute &mdash; increase in funding it received this year.  Medical inflation and national inflation are raging.  The manager is left in the impossible situation of being forced to sign off on budgets with which he or she is unhappy in order to meet the demands of the HSE which, as I said at the beginning, manages its services based on budget rather than need.</P>
        <P>Where are the Teamwork reports and why have they not been published?  They were promised in February, March and April, but we are nearing the end of May.  I am unsure as to whether they will be published because they are too politically sensitive.  The Hanly report recommendations were implemented by stealth and it looks like the Teamwork recommendations will be also implemented by stealth.  Many believe we will get what Professor Drumm outlined in a number of public utterances concerning small acute hospitals, namely, he will turn them into day hospitals.  He stated that there were too many unsustainable accident and emergency units.  If a unit with the geographical basis of my area is unsustainable, the health service has a serious problem.</P>
        <P>The ambulance services, a pet subject of mine, sometimes get a raw deal and have been negatively affected by the changes administered by the HSE.  In many cases, the work of ambulance crews is so vital that, without them, we would be in serious trouble.  Many of those involved work long and unsociable hours and shifts, on which they must double up due to a lack of qualified staff.  There are not enough emergency medical technicians or advanced paramedics, a situation affected by last year&rsquo;s embargo.  Neither is there enough capacity, but this is due to a lack of ambulances rather than the change to single-bed stretchers in ambulances.  The confusing protocols should be addressed.</P>
        <P>The concept of primary care is worthy, but it has different meanings to many inside and outside these Chambers.  Before we get rid of the old system, we need to bring in the new.  We have not even reached the 50:50 point.  Several years ago, the budget between acute and community health care was divided 70:30, but that ratio has become 40:60.  This is not necessarily good.  There are problems in a number of areas.  For example, the number of home help hours offered is a joke in some cases and there are long waiting lists for occupational therapy.  In my area, some 693 children are awaiting speech and language therapy.  I do not believe the staff recruitment issue and the number of years they must work prior to getting their jobs comprise the sole problem.  Half of the therapist posts in the north Tipperary-east Limerick area are vacant.</P>
        <P>Many point to the success of the NHS in Britain and claim that community driven care can work.  We each must consider our own circumstances and there is no such thing as best practice.  The glue that holds together acute and community care is the GP service. The difference is that GPs are not under the HSE whereas they are under the NHS in Britain.  Hence, the same model will not fit Ireland.</P>
        <P>In many ways, some good people in the HSE&rsquo;s management are not treated well and some of the criticism is unworthy.  As many of the HSE&rsquo;s managerial positions are temporary, people who make decisions watch their backs.  I have an issue with the PR policy of the HSE.</P>

This is not good enough from an information point of view because we are entitled to better.  As evidenced in this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme and as has been stated by Senators during the past six to nine months, the numerous examples of information flowing from the corporate level of the HSE and the aggressive attitude it and its PR department have assumed in response to simple questions are unacceptable.</P>

	<P>I am happy to participate in this debate.  I noted the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion and listened with interest to its Members&rsquo; contributions.  I support a number of the points made, as they were fair, legitimate and realistic in so far as we have experienced many of the situations outlined.  I also noted the countermotion.</P>
        <P>I have the height of respect and regard for those who work in the health services.  I commenced my career in wholesale pharmaceuticals and dealt with pharmacies, doctors and hospitals.  Due to my interests, I became a member of a health board after first being elected as a councillor and worked with the various systems and structures.  Later, I worked in the Department of Health and Children.  I welcome some of that Department&rsquo;s officials to the House.  I worked well with them and it is welcome that they are continuing their good efforts.  I am one of the few people who have been in everything from the back of the shop to the front.  My family is involved in the pharmaceutical business.  I have worked at the front door, the back door and every other door of the hospital system and I have worked with management and health board structures.</P>
        <P>There are benefits and problems and we could do better than we have done, but the solution is probably not to be found in either the motion or the proposed amendment.  When the health board system worked, it worked well.  I was approached about whether I would participate in changing the health board structure in the greater Dublin area to allow a regional authority to come into being.  My colleagues and I, rather than a single Minister, considered the proposals on structural change.  One of the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials could pencil a note correcting me if I am wrong, but I believe the Minister of the day was the current Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Howlin, of the Labour Party.  Other Ministers, including Deputies Noonan and Martin, were involved.</P>
        <P>Some of the structures put in place in the greater Dublin area worked.  For example, shared services proved significantly beneficial.  The health boards&rsquo; muscle allowed them to do a great deal to improve services in certain respects, such as administration and purchasing.  The boards were able to use the purchasing power or muscle of those involved to implement a wage system or to make purchases.  We brought together the voluntary, statutory and charitable sectors, a considerable and unprecedented breakthrough.</P><Col N="1102"/>
        <P>The HSE is too great a step.  The Minister referred to 11 health boards, but I believe that we had 14.  We went from 14 to one, a step too far.  I ask that Senators not tango over this issue and that we achieve a unity of purpose to try to find the right model.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="7" />
      
        <P FLI="0">We should not do so on a Twenty-six Counties basis.  We achieved success in the greater Dublin area by finding a model that worked.  Everybody agrees there must be change.  As I said, I have not dealt with the specifics of the motion or the amendment.</P>
        <P>My time is up but I hope to have another opportunity to engage in a thorough debate on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was not aware I was sharing time, I will have to pare back what I intended to say.  It is difficult to make a meaningful contribution to a debate on the health services in four minutes.  However, I will do my best.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion.  It is a welcome motion because it reflects most aspects of the public&rsquo;s concern about the Health Service Executive.  Rather than merely expressing those concerns, the Labour Party has offered a series of constructive proposals for reforming the HSE.  However, I also take on board the point made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, regarding the changes and improvements that have been achieved in the health service.  The HSE has been in existence for only three years and many of the improvements that have taken place are not recognised by the media.  Negative headlines always make better stories.  Many of the new statutory reporting requirements have enhanced the perception that there is only bad news and problems in the system.  That tends to distort the picture.</P>
        <P>The truth is somewhere in between.  The process of reform is beginning to take effect.  However, many of the concerns raised by Senators in this debate are valid.  The greatest problem with the HSE is the lack of accountability.  It is difficult to identify individuals within the organisation who are responsible for different aspects of its functioning.  The task of bringing more coherence to the HSE is probably the greatest challenge facing the Minister.  The establishment of the executive involved the merging of all the previous health boards.  In such cases, it always takes some years before there is a sense of coherence and orientation.</P>
        <P>New structures will have to be put in place.  I use the example of the national cancer control programme as a model of the type of coherence that can be brought to bear if a particular service is delivered with the right type of clinical governance and leadership.  Professor Tom Keane, who recently briefed members of my party on the national cancer control programme, strikes me as a good example of an identifiable person heading up the process of change within a defined area of the health service.  He has both clinical expertise and experience in change management.  He is bringing to bear that experience in putting in place the right structures.</P>
        <P>Regional specialist centres are recognised as the most appropriate way to deliver some of our cancer services.  One of Professor Keane&rsquo;s greatest criticisms of our existing cancer services is the emphasis on hospital and inpatient care.</P>

	<P>The problem with these types of debates is that Government Members have to support the Minister no matter what happens and regardless of the chaos in our health services.  The road to ruin is paved with good intentions.  That adage is appropriate when one considers some of the developments arising from the establishment of the Health Service Executive.  I do not blame the Minister, Deputy Harney, for most of these problems.  It was her predecessor, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, who is responsible for the mess in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>The setting up of the HSE was a rush job from the beginning.  Most of those responsible for that process were concerned it was happening too quickly.  However, the then Minister, Deputy Martin, wanted the executive to be up and running on 1 January 2005 for the purposes of public relations spin, knowing he would be well gone from that office when the true extent of the mess became apparent.  It is interesting that when people were being recruited to head up the directorates within the HSE, nobody in the private sector in this State &mdash; which boasted, at the time, the most successful economy in the world &mdash; was considered adequate to run any part of the HSE.  All of those who secured senior positions were previously employed in the former health boards.  Within 12 months, however, half of them had either resigned from their roles or were moved because they were found to be incompetent.</P>
        <P>The management structure of the HSE, as announced on 1 January 2005, had been already amended by 1 June 2006.  By 1 June 2007, the structure was being amended again in line with the original formation as at 1 January 2005.  I do not know what the situation is now.  This constant state of flux is causing problems for staff further down the line, including those in local and middle management who do not know to whom they should report.  That sense of incompetence at the senior level of the reform process means that problems with the delivery of services are inevitable.  No matter how good the staff in middle management and in clerical and front-line roles, these problems lead to inefficiencies and wastage of resources.  That is what this motion is about.  The management structure of the HSE must be changed in order that the organisation can work efficiently.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Harney, has given inadequate policy direction.  She made reference to Dr. Donal Hollywood in connection with the cancer strategy report that she claims will lead to great improvements for patients.  Dr. Hollywood produced a report on radiotherapy services to which the Minister reacted badly when it pointed out the mistakes that were made.  However, perhaps she was big enough at least to acknowledge that she was not as wise about radiotherapy services as she should have been and that it was a mistake to wait five years before changing policy in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is now saying we must restrict the number of facilities offering cancer care services.  At the same time, however, the Government is offering tax breaks to small operators for the purposes of setting up small clinics at any location throughout the State to provide the types of services we were told should be provided only in centres of excellence.</P><Col N="1104"/>
        <P>I regret I do not have sufficient time to make all the points I wish to make.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, what has become of the Tribal Secta report which was published in January 2006?  Where are all the great improvements we were told would flow from that report?</P>

	<P>I commend my Labour Party colleagues on tabling this timely motion.  Members may be familiar with the film, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Something about Mary&rdquo;.  There is certainly something about the Government&rsquo;s health policy.  Government Members speak <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House about the failings of local hospitals and other aspects of the health service.  There is a lack of political courage.  We get fine rhetoric and empty talk but no political testosterone.  I encourage Government Members to abandon their idle chit chat on the Government benches and to join us in voting with their conscience.  They should vote for the people of Ireland.  Patients are not consumers or statistics but people.</P>
        <P>At a time of economic challenge, with &euro;16 billion per annum being spent on health in the past ten years, people&rsquo;s health is being jeopardised because of the deficiencies in services delivered by the monolithic organisation that is the HSE.  I do not blame the Minister, Deputy Harney, bur rather her colleagues at the Cabinet table.  Fianna F&aacute;il, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party have abdicated responsibility.  A quarter of all Government expenditure goes on health but we are not getting value for money or efficient delivery of services.  There are grave implications in this for our aging population.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment is one of the weakest I have seen in this House.  What is the Government&rsquo;s fundamental objective for the health service?  What is its overarching philosophy?  Is it about care and service?  It is not; it is about the core Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats slogan of privatisation and co-location.  I challenge Senator de B&uacute;rca, the Green Party and Senator Callely, who are not members of this privatisation gang, to vote against the Government.  They should vote for the people and the patients.</P>
        <P>We need accountability.  I agree the old health board system did not work properly but there was accountability.  The new regional health fora are a joke.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, should go back to the Minister and to the Department and urge that the regional health fora be given teeth to deal with issues.  Currently, they have none.  Management is playing ducks and drakes with the councillors, who have no power to question, interrogate and get answers.  Reform in that regard is necessary.</P>
        <P>There also must be accountability on the part of top and middle management of the HSE.  Last week, Deputy James Reilly spoke in the D&aacute;il about delivery of health services and the management of the health service.  The legacy of this Government and the policy it supports is closure of local hospitals, growing waiting lists for operations, a freeze on recruitment, reductions in the number of home helps and care packages and the debacle in the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin, where 120 staff are to be let go because of bad management.  What does that say to the children and patients in this country?  This Government does not care and shields itself with the HSE.  Shame on it.  It is not dealing with consumers or figures on a page but with people who deserve dignity and care, which they are not getting from this Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a great pleasure to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I wish to share time with Senator Mary White.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Labour Party has put down this motion.  What is important about it, and the Minister alluded to this earlier, is that it puts forward solutions for <Col N="1105"/>debate.  It is regrettable that other business has prevented Senator Alex White being present for the full debate.  We need to focus on solutions.  All Members are concerned about the care administered to the patient, regardless of our political ideologies.  None of us could accuse another Member of not having the care of the patient at the heart of the policy initiatives they espouse.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White and Kelly questioned whether it was right that Professor Drumm be the Accounting Officer for the executive.  Like the Minister, I consider it vital that this be the case, when one is making the choices and decisions.  The policy is decided in the Department but when one is making the choices on its delivery one must have responsibility to ensure that if savings are being made in one area, good practice can be provided in another.  I hate to sound like a broken record but I consider the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, an inspiration.  Her most admirable trait is that she never loses focus.  Yes, it is a difficult job, particularly when it involves life and death issues in people&rsquo;s lives, but she remains focused on the task.  That is highly commendable.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Feeney, I heard Professor Anthony Staines on the radio during the week.  I listened to the programme again this afternoon on the Internet and it is particularly good.  Professor Staines runs the health system research in DCU and I hope Professor Drumm and the Minister are familiar with him.  In the interview he said that systems are not really important, nor is changing the system we have at present, particularly if it involves turning round a process of reform mid-stream.  The Minister is utterly convinced she has turned a corner with the reform, and it is important that we see results on that front.  What is the point in changing the system?  As Professor Staines said, it may not be the perfect system but it is the system we operate.  What is important is how services are delivered, how medical personnel, such as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and so forth, operate within the system and the latitude and capacity they are given, and take themselves in terms of initiatives, to deliver better patient care.</P>
        <P>What the Minister told us about neurology services is important.  We should reflect on it.  As the Taoiseach said this morning in response to the Labour Party Leader, it is all very well for the Opposition to be exclusively concerned about the patient without reference to a budget.  I disagree with the point that the HSE is driven purely by budgetary concerns.  That is not the case.  It seeks to provide best delivery of patient care but it must operate within a budget.  In neurology services it was able to double outcomes with no extra money, purely through a change in work practices.  That is something we should consider.  Staff morale is a problem but we need to examine where this works and how it can be replicated in other areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley that the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, is an inspiration as a leader in the evolution of the health service into the 21st century.  She is the most focused person I have ever encountered.  In the six years I have been a Member I have seen and heard her perform.  She has the most extraordinary focus and all of us can learn from her.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with the Opposition&rsquo;s criticism of Professor Drumm and the Minister, Deputy Harney.  It is absolutely puerile and infantile.  The organisation was only established a short time ago.  The Minister and Professor Drumm are brave people.  Two people were considered ahead of Professor Drumm and they would not take the job.  Professor Keane told us today that he was asked to take up the job.  People are not rushing to take up these positions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe people are too hasty in criticising the organisation.  The Minister said she would like to see the HSE develop in the same way the economy developed <Col N="1106"/>into the Celtic tiger.  For 30 years the IDA spearheaded economic development by encouraging inward investment in Ireland.  It was a major architect in the development of the Celtic tiger.  If the HSE is left alone, Professor Drumm has the courage and understanding, having been a professor in Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital, to change the culture in the health sector.</P>

	<P>There are negatives.  I believe we got our economy right but we seriously neglected the health service.  I watched the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last Monday night.  The way the young child with diabetes had been treated was reflective of a Third World country.  As I have always said, I do not agree with a two tier service of public and private health care.  I do not agree with putting a public hospital and a private hospital side by side and I do not understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the degree of interest in this matter it is a pity there is not a supplied script from the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, which I would have welcomed.  It would have been helpful to those of us who, because of pressure from other sources, were not able to be here to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech.  I am sure there was no disrespect intended, but I hope it will not happen again as we are entitled to a ministerial script in such a serious debate.</P>
        <P>I fully support universal health care provided by the State.  I know that the concomitant of that is increases in taxation and I would be happy to campaign for that, because it is the most basic human right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like the public versus private model.  It was appalling that the woman in County Kilkenny was sentenced to death for the crime of being poor, which I have said before.  That is my principled stand.  I find there are elements with which I agree on both sides of the debate.  For example, regarding step No. 4 in the motion, I agree with most of what the Labour Party put down, but I do not agree that each hospital and each community care area should be given autonomy to spend its budget.  That is madness and will lead to NIMBY syndrome.  Everyone will want their own hospital and I do not believe it will work in that way.  We must have centralised control.</P>
        <P>There are concerns, however.  I listened to a very distinguished professor on the radio and he said that he could have been an adviser and made money out of continually advising on re-organisation of the service.  However, he went on to say, continual re-organisation would involve throwing money at it all the time, but there would be no increase in service delivery and we must face the existing problems.  That is the reason, I believe, step No. 2 in the Labour Party motion, namely, making it clear that the Minister for Health and Children is responsible <Col N="1108"/>to the Oireachtas and appointing a named officer which may be the Secretary General or may be Professor Brendan Drumm, is a way forward that is useful.  I do not believe the proposal is answered by the bland waffle with which the Government responds.  The Government has said these officials are already responsible which is not an answer to a direct and specific question.  That is what is wrong and it is the reason I will vote with the Opposition.</P>
        <P>There are so many problems.  I had a woman who campaigned for specific medical treatment to be made available.  That was agreed.  Managers were appointed and, at that stage, the Civil Service recruitment freeze was imposed.  There was no medical staff, no delivery of services and the HSE is left with the managers and is still paying them.  That is the reason step No. 3 of the Labour Party motion proposing an offer of voluntary early retirement, redundancy and re-deployment scheme is vital to progress.  However, it must be focused, cut out the flab and get rid of surplus people.  There is no point getting rid of the people who deliver the service.  We must go further in our efforts, focus on change and make clear where it should be.</P>
        <P>Regarding step No. 6 which says that each hospital and community care area should be required to establish a patient liaison programme and so on, it quotes a specific case which is one of the problems.  We all find these heart-wrenching individual cases.  However, I do not believe we should endlessly regurgitate them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister for Health and Children cannot be made responsible for each individual case.  The greatest political friend I ever had in my life was Mr. Noel Browne and I salute him, because he single-handedly broke through the curse of tuberculosis.  He broke the piggy-bank of the sweepstakes and established hospitals everywhere.  If Mr. Noel Browne was in this House or the other House demanding that we respond to every individual case it would have impeded delivery of the programme.  This is the reason we must avoid the Joe Duffy radio programme route.  We betray ourselves as politicians when we do take it.</P>
        <P>We can all agree, however, that we have all been touched by the hospice movement.  It is unparalleled in the humane treatment of people who are terminally ill.  Yet, we have a situation which is ludicrous, where there is a budget allocation made for a hospice, for its development and to continue its work and then at the end of the year, it finds it has not been given the money to spend.  The money has been re-allocated to make up a deficit in another area.  This is wrong and we must be focused and prioritise.  We must stop messing around and playing politics with this issue.  We must take seriously our responsibility to the citizens of Ireland and deliver a decent health service.  Given a choice between the two sides, on balance, having previously supported the Minister for Health and Children, who is courageous even when she is wrong &mdash; I do not know whether she has testosterone and I am not a sexual expert on this matter, she may or may not have &mdash; I will vote with the Opposition tonight.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Norris as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  T&aacute;im ag tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n at&aacute; molta ag P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil fadhbanna leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sl&aacute;inte agus nach bhfuil siad ag obair mar is ceart.  Caithimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar na f&aacute;thanna nach bhfuil siad ag obair mar is ceart.  </P>
        <P>It is not enough to say that the HSE is overly bureaucratic, was established in haste and completely lacks democratic accountability.  All of that is true and must be addressed.  However, the problem is more fundamental.  The problem is Government health policy, which is based on the retention of our two-tier, public-private, apartheid health system.  This is the core problem.  The problem is the Government&rsquo;s failure to deliver on primary care, making us over-reliant on our over-stretched hospitals.  The problem is the lack of commitment on the part of <Col N="1109"/>Government to putting patients first and to treating patients on the basis of need and need alone.  It puts book-keeping before life-saving, as we see in the current cutbacks being imposed by the HSE at the behest of the Government.  We all know these cuts are having a significant effect.  Today we learned of staff lay-offs in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin.  There is no doubt that sick children will suffer if that is allowed to go ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will give as an example an individual case, even though Senator Norris gave me the time and he does not like citing individual cases.  However, it lends a human side to the story.  It is important to note, as other Senators have said, that these are not statistics, they are real people.  Today, the office of my colleague, Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, was contacted by the family of a 70 year old man who had to attend Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda yesterday for an X-ray on his arm which was broken some weeks ago.  He had to wait eight hours<b> </b>for the X-ray.  He could not gain access to the toilet because of long queues and could not help urinating as he sat in the chair in the overcrowded accident and emergency department.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>In the interest of not interrupting Senator Feeney earlier I remained quiet when she remarked that she felt there was a criticism of HSE staff implied in the motion.  I worked for 23 years as a midwife and nurse in the health services.  My husband has given 30 years of service.  On the basis that, as a couple, we have given between us 53 years of service I can speak with some degree of authority on the HSE and the way it functions.  At no time did I imply the staff of the HSE were not working to the best of their abilities.  Every day and night of the year, regardless of whether it is Christmas night, Easter or any other holiday, that service is provided by nurses, clerical officers and other staff who give out the cups of tea and clean the hospital wards.  I have the highest regard for the way those frontline staff deliver services.  I appreciate that the Minister feels put out by what she describes as constant criticism, but programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; do not manufacture evidence.</P>
        <P>The stories I have heard from Senator Doherty and others and the support I received from the opposite side of the House gives me a glimmer of hope that we will get support for this motion, although I am aware the Government side will in reality vote against these proposals.  By offering solutions to some of the deficiencies in the health service, we might achieve a positive result.  I have respect for the Minister, who does her best, but I am critical of a system which was established to replace 11 health boards but is not coping or delivering meaningful interventions.  It was claimed that the reduction of waiting times to 12 hours is an improvement <Col N="1110"/>on what existed ten years ago, but the system has not improved if a patient cannot access a toilet or if the condition of a person suffering diabetes is exacerbated.</P>
        <P>Tonight Crumlin hospital is short of 24 neonatal nurses and a further 120 jobs may have to go in this tertiary referral centre.  Difficult decisions will have to be made on where the service will be cut.  Will the jobs be taken from the neonatal unit, child oncology services or education support roles?  I have been in that situation and I know it is not easy but we have put forward our proposals in the hope of introducing a degree of accountability and making a positive intervention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am not here to criticise the Government because I want to think we can work together.  I am heartened that several Government Senators supported me tonight, including Senators O&rsquo;Malley, de B&uacute;rca and Callely.  I hope that support will continue when the House votes on this motion.  I thank the Minister of State for attending tonight and my colleagues on this side of the House for their contributions and support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
        <P>I wish, once again, to bring to the attention of the Oireachtas the position concerning the national schools at Rahan and Glenville, County Cork.  Some months ago, I raised the matter of Rahan national school on the Adjournment.  Rahan is a townland in the parish of Mallow.  The school at Rahan has been a major success story in the context of the quality of teaching on offer and the attractiveness of sending one&rsquo;s children there.  In one sense, however, it has become a victim of its own success and is experiencing major difficulties with regard to accommodation.  As I reported to the House some months ago, in order to bring to the attention of the Minister and the Department the plight of the students and highlight the inadequacies relating to accommodation at the school, parents engaged in what might be described as an unofficial strike and withdrew their children from lessons.</P>
        <P>Through local fund-raising and the efforts of the principal, the board of management and the community in general, a site has been made available in order that the Department might provide a new school at Rahan.  In addition to being a townland, Rahan is a growing suburb and is an attractive location in which to live.  As a result, there has been a major increase in the number of children attending the school there.  The accommodation at the school is extremely outdated and a response is urgently required from the Minister and her Department.</P>
        <P>The other school to which I wish to refer is that at Glenville.  Senator Boyle is familiar with this school and was represented at a public meeting held there some weeks ago by Councillor Chris O&rsquo;Leary of the Green Party.  Councillor O&rsquo;Leary was made aware of the deficiencies that exist in the context of accommodation at the school.</P>
        <P>The most important point to take into account in respect of Glenville national school is the fact that in November 2006 the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, wrote to Members of the Oireachtas, particularly those from the party she represents, and stated that building projects relating to a number of schools, including that at Glenville, would proceed immediately.  The local community, the principal and the board of management of the school were informed that planning for a new school would commence in the immediate future.  This commitment was given in writing &mdash; I hope it was not an exercise in electioneering &mdash; and it indicated that the project to build a new school would proceed.  As with Rahan, however, there have been no developments regarding the building of a new school at Glenville.  There has not been any indication of progress.</P>
        <P>Glenville is situated near Mallow and is a suburb of Cork city.  The position as regards accommodation at the national school in Glenville has reached crisis levels.  On Friday afternoon last, the parents, pupils and those associated with the school, in conjunction with their counterparts from Passage West on the outskirts of Cork, held a protest march to highlight their plight.  The last thing parents and children want to be doing is protesting on the streets.  What is required is a commitment to proceed with new school accommodation.  Interim solutions such as prefabs are only for the short term.</P>
        <P>During my first term in this House in 1987, my very first Adjournment matter related to Rahan national school.  It is disappointing to raise the same subject 21 years later and &mdash; while <Col N="1112"/>we are all glad to be hearty and back here &mdash; one would wonder about priorities in capital expenditure and the direction we are taking in education.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  I appreciate he is not the man in charge of the purse strings but I appeal to him on behalf of both of these rural national schools, which serve growing village-type urban communities.  There is a definite need for additional accommodation and I request the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Education and Science &mdash; himself a Cork man who knows both of these areas very well &mdash; to give the schools fair attention and a response by way of capital investment.  This would help parents, teachers and, most of all, pupils, who should be educated in the proper physical environment they deserve in the Ireland of 2008.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for his kind remarks and for raising this matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to this House the Department&rsquo;s capital programme of works for 2008 and the current position with regard to proposed building projects for Rahan national school, Mallow, and Glenville national school in Glenville, County Cork.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc. leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need and this is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, with band one being the highest and band four the lowest.</P>
        <P>Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  As the Senator probably will be aware, almost &euro;600 million in public funding is being provided for school buildings this year.  This will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary school projects that will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools.  Construction work on 150 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation scheme will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new schools and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit more than 7,000 pupil attendees.  The purchase of sites will facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, particularly in rapidly developing areas, and the progression of new projects through architectural planning and design stages.</P>
        <P>On 1 February last, there was an announcement of the first tranche of projects that will proceed to construction this year.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of PPP schools, while further ones will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years. This is an enormous programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus during the year on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also deliver improvements in the quality of existing <Col N="1113"/>primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The emphasis, however, will be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P>To address the projects of particular concern to the Senator, Glenville national school is a co-educational facility with a current enrolment of 129 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, four mainstream assistants and one learning support and one resource.  The school authority submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  The long-term staffing figure, on which accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  In this regard, it has been agreed that accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal, eight mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>Rahan national school is also a co-educational primary school with a September 2007 enrolment of 91 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of principal, three mainstream class teachers and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.  The school has applied for a new school building.  The long-term staffing has been agreed at a principal, eight mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the Senator an application by Rahan national school to replace temporary accommodation this year has been approved by the Department.  Both of these projects attract a band two rating.  The next step for them is the appointment of a design team.  The Minister for Education and Science is currently examining issues relating to funding and other aspects of the multi-annual school building programme.  At this stage it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of these projects to the next stage.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and point out that over the lifetime of the national development plan, the Government is providing funding of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where they are needed.  This investment will allow the continuation of the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last NDP, when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in school development delivering, as it did, more than 7,800 projects.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment this evening.  There is considerable interest in it and others wish to share time.  I suggest Senators McCarthy and Cummins take one minute each and I will speak for three minutes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The company concerned, Freescale Semiconductors Ireland Limited, is a company that has taken over an operation established by the Motorola Corporation in Cork Airport Business Park in recent years.  It is a high-tech, high-spec. business that employs 47 people.  It is exactly the type of business we should be seeking to have prosper in our new knowledge economy.</P>
        <P>All the 47 employees are university graduates and 37% hold Masters degrees and a further 10% are of PhD standard.  Not only are they largely Irish-based but they have attracted people of ability from other parts of the world, such as Silicon Valley, Hong Kong, France and the United Kingdom.  It is a business whose employees have more than a dozen years&rsquo; experience on average, yet the average age is only above 30 years old.  On all these grounds, this is precisely the type of innovative business we should seek to have thrive in a new economy.</P>
        <P>International global circumstances are not what they could and should be.  As the company operates in the new technology area there are high levels of competition.  I hope the response from the Minister of State this evening will indicate the role played by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through various State agencies to ensure there is a future <Col N="1114"/>either in the existing business by way of purchase by another company or by using the existing skill set to establish a new company.  We should make every effort possible in this regard.</P>
        <P>Discussions at a local level with the IDA indicate the position is serious.  It is making every effort, and appropriate political signals coming from the Department will help the process.  It is not only an engine for providing employment in terms of research, development and innovation, and a number of patents have been put forward by the company, half of which are going towards new projects.  The firm has been responsible for strong relationships in the research and development area with local universities and others involved in trying to advocate the information technology idea.</P>
        <P>On all these grounds, I value the opportunity to speak this evening to express my concern as a local representative in the Cork area.  I know that is shared by other Senators and I hope the Minister of State can give some cause for optimism that the ongoing situation can be rescued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Boyle for the opportunity to speak on his matter on the Adjournment this evening.  The Senator has raised a majority of the points, but I will revisit a few of them.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">These are 47 high-skilled people, with nearly half having Masters degrees and 10% have PhDs.  Many of these employees were working with pioneering IT firms abroad and returned to join this company in Cork.  It was established in 1998 with just two employees as part of the now-closed Motorola facility based in Mahon.  It attracted global talent, with six people from Silicon Valley alone.  It was a key contributor to the 3GSM World Congress and it has a strong relationship with local universities and innovative centres.  It was a leading provider for BlackBerry products.</P>
      
        <P>In his election address the Taoiseach highlighted the importance of scientific research to Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity and as the key driver of economic success.  The world class graduates the Government refers to in the strategy for science, technology and innovation programme would look to companies like Freescale in Cork for their future employment.</P>
        <P>We are asking for full support from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to keep these highly skilled and qualified design engineers in Ireland.  This is a knowledge economy.  We cannot allow this opportunity to be wasted by allowing those highly skilled workers to leave this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join with my colleagues in speaking about this company, which is in grave difficulties.  The other two Members have outlined the position and the calibre of jobs about which we speak.  The Taoiseach spoke about those types of jobs on his election and the need for this country to have such jobs.  It is essential that we do everything possible, and I call on the head of IDA Ireland in particular to find replacement jobs for these employees and to keep those jobs in Cork.  This is not just a Cork issue; it is a national issue because of the type of jobs involved.</P>
        <P>From a personal point of view, one of my relatives returned from the United States to work in Freescale.  He was working in a highly technical job in the US and returned here with his three children to work in this company this time last year.  As outlined, many other people are in a similar position in that they came back to Ireland to take up these positions.  I ask the Minister of State to urge the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and IDA Ireland in particular to make every effort possible to secure those people&rsquo;s jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
        <P>I would like to express my disappointment at the decision of the company to close its Cork operations and have asked the State development agencies under the auspices of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department to make every effort to assist the workers being made redundant in securing alternative employment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Freescale established its Irish design centre in Cork in 1998.  The Cork centre forms part of the radio products division of Freescale&rsquo;s wireless and mobile solutions group.  Freescale is a large global company that regularly makes adjustments to resources as a normal course of operations to meet changing business requirements in a very dynamic industry.  Freescale has decided to streamline its cellular design centres and, as part of this decision, is proposing that all programmes in its Cork design facility be transferred to other locations and the facility closed.  The closure of the facility, expected in September 2008, will result in 47 employees losing their jobs.</P>
        <P>I understand that Freescale is entering into a consultation process with its employees this week, where details of redundancy and options for employees will be outlined.  I understand also that a number of employees may be offered opportunities to relocate to other global sites and the company intends to offer an enhanced redundancy package to impacted employees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">IDA Ireland is working closely with local Freescale management in Cork to help secure alternative employment for impacted staff.  F&Aacute;S will be in contact with the management of Freescale this week and will make arrangements to register the employees.  The full range of F&Aacute;S services will be made available to the employees, including top level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and-or in groups, with affected workers.  These interviews will outline the range of supports and services available; there will be preparation of a skills analysis report by F&Aacute;S based on identified workers&rsquo; needs and local opportunities; referral by F&Aacute;S of redundant workers to jobs, training courses or other options; establishment by F&Aacute;S of special or customised courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</P>
        <P>In terms of foreign direct investment for Cork, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the south west region and County Cork is to work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure in the region; progress the development of a knowledge economy to ensure the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment; work with the existing IDA Ireland client base and to help them to further develop their presence; and provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recognition under the national spatial strategy of the importance of Cork as a major gateway location and Mallow as a hub will assist IDA Ireland in promoting the region for inward investment. It will also assist in the development of the critical mass needed in terms of population, skills and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote Cork and the advantages of locating in Cork, which include a young skilled population, with a student population of approximately 32,000, the presence of a university and institute of technology, and the availability of first class business parks, good infrastructure and an international airport.</P>
        <P>Cork has a long industrial tradition and in recent years has grown into a strong gateway with a strong presence of international companies with significant operations located throughout Cork city and county. In particular, there has been a large concentration in both the pharmaceutical-medical technology sectors and in the information and communications technology <Col N="1116"/>sector.  Recently, there has been a shift towards software, customer support and shared services activities, collectively known as globally traded business.</P>
        <P>In the past ten years, direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork city and county has grown from 13,838 in 1998 to 20,114 in 2007.  The sectors contributing to this growth are ICT, pharmaceuticals-medical technologies and globally traded business.  In the past three years, IDA Ireland has approved new projects for the Cork area with a job potential of over 3,100 people at full operation. There are currently 134 IDA supported enterprises in Cork city and county.  Recent announcements of new overseas companies locating in Cork include Blizzard, SolarWinds and Apex.  These projects will significantly add to the value and depth of the overseas industry in Cork.  In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage the expansion of their operations.  The success of this is demonstrated by the recent expansions of several companies in the county including Citco, VMware, Eli Lilly, Trend Micro, GlaxoSmithKline, PepsiCo and Sanmina SCI.</P>
        <P>The importance of foreign direct investment employment in the south west is evidenced by the payroll cost of over &euro;920 million in 2007 for the almost 22,000 permanent employees in the south west region, providing an average salary of approximately &euro;42,000.  In addition to supporting employment, the benefits of FDI in the region can be seen in their contribution to the local economy.  In 2006, it is estimated that Irish materials and services purchased by FDI companies in the south west amounted to almost &euro;1.5 billion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise once again the plight of school leavers with intellectual disability.  The end of the school year is rapidly approaching.  Additional moneys were allocated in budget 2008 to provide for those people with intellectual disability leaving school in June this year who require placement in HSE-funded services in September.  Funding was specifically allocated to allow for the provision of those places but unfortunately, as of yet there does not appear to be confirmation to either the students or their families that those places will be funded in September.  Considerable anxiety is being caused.  That anxiety is heightened by the fact that as there has not been confirmation of the funding, it has not been possible for students to visit any of the proposed placements as those services are reluctant to raise expectations unless the funding is forthcoming.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this matter on the Adjournment to seek confirmation from the Minister that approval has now been given to allocate part of that additional &euro;50 million for disabilities to the provision of those places for school leavers, and that confirmation has been given to the services which will provide the places and to the students and their families, thus alleviating the need for a stressful and anxious summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by the Senator.  As she will be aware, a range of training, employment and day services are provided by the Health Service Executive, non-statutory agencies funded by the HSE and F&Aacute;S to young people with disabilities when they leave school.</P><Col N="1117"/>
        <P>The HSE employs guidance officers at local level to assist in the transition of young school leavers with disabilities to training and day services.  The guidance officer works with the school leaver, their family, school authorities and service providers to ensure that individual school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy is underpinned by the multi-annual investment programme.  Significant additional funding has already been provided and has been spent on developing new and enhanced health and personal social services for people with a disability, including young people leaving school in the period 2006-07.  These areas will continue to be the focus of developments for the remaining years of the multi-annual investment programme in 2008 and 2009.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the information of the Senator, the Government has provided the HSE with an additional &euro;75 million in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding provided an extra 506 day places in 2006 and 492 day places in 2007.  In addition, day services were enhanced with the provision of additional supports to deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities, with 52 places in 2006 and 66 places in 2007.  In some cases, the funding provided supported the school leavers to access appropriate day services, in line with a person-centred plan.  In many cases, this funding provided places for individuals completing rehabilitative training, thereby creating training places for other school leavers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Overall, the funding provided in recent years has contributed to an increase in services, ensuring that young people with intellectual disabilities have appropriate services in place to facilitate a smooth transition from secondary school.  A further &euro;50 million investment was announced in budget 2008.  This funding includes funds for the provision of additional day places to address school leavers, people leaving training programmes, which will in turn create opportunities and places for school leavers, and improvements in existing day programmes, for example, where the needs of a person have changed.</P>
        <P>I would also like to inform the House of some developments in areas related to the issues raised by Senator Corrigan.  With regard to services for adults with disabilities, the HSE is in the process of undertaking a comprehensive national review of HSE-funded adult day services.  This review will seek to advise on the reconfiguration and modernisation of existing adult day services to reflect the core principles of the health strategy.  Those principles include access, quality, accountability and person-centredness and incorporate best practice, good value for money and better outcomes for service users.  In addition they are in line with relevant legislation and national standards.</P>
        <P>This process aims to produce a clear outline of a recommended service model that is reflective of the above principles.  The review includes, as part of its work, examining and reviewing the range of day services such as activation, rehabilitative training and sheltered work.</P>
        <P>To date, the strategic review of HSE-funded adult day services has consulted widely with service users, families and service providers and is about to engage in discussions with all parties to the sectoral plans, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Family and Social Affairs.  A census of HSE-funded adult day services has been completed and the findings will help inform decision making in this process.</P>
        <P>The Office for Disability and Mental Health was established by the Government in January this year.  The office brings together responsibility for different policy areas and a range of services which impact on the lives of people with disabilities and those with mental health difficulties.  The main focus of the office is to improve co-ordination and communication across Departments and agencies in the delivery of disability and mental health services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My colleague, Deputy John Moloney, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, has been appointed Minister with responsibility for equality, disability and mental <Col N="1118"/>health and his objective is to move the disability agenda to a level which compares with the best in the world.  We will do so in partnership with all stakeholders.</P>
