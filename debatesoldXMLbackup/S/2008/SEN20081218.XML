	<P>I have notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that patients in Donegal are not disadvantaged in their access to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, given that there seems to be a longer than average waiting time in Letterkenny and a waiting time of longer than three months to qualify.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the plans, if any, he has to put pressure on the banks to make more funds available to small businesses.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re Friday sitting, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Appropriation Bill 2008 &mdash; All Stages; No. 3, earlier signature motion, to be taken without debate and which will consist of one question put by the Cathaoirleach; and No. 4, statements on gun crime, which shall be taken at the conclusion of Nos. 2 and 3 and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, on which Senators may share time by agreement of the House, and the Minister to be called five minutes from the end of the debate for concluding comments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday a number of Deputies and Senators attended a cross-party meeting with Pamela Izevbekhai which included a briefing on her current legal situation.  This is the woman whose eldest daughter died as a result of genital mutilation.  She has two other children and is asking to remain in this country.  I make a plea to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give Ms Izevbekhai peace of mind during the Christmas period.  There is legal uncertainty about what will happen to her during the next few weeks if the European Court of Human Rights makes a decision that is not in her favour.  I ask the Minister to do this on humanitarian grounds.  I know he is worried about setting a precedent, but to lose <Col N="124"/>one&rsquo;s eldest daughter to such a procedure surely entitles one to humanitarian treatment.  In view of the other decisions he has made on human rights issues in this country, it is about time he made a decision about this woman on humanitarian grounds.  I know from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting that there is cross-party support for this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of democratic accountability is an issue raised by a number of Senators this week.  It refers to the Government presenting its plans to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have heard cries for patriotism in recent weeks and months because of the dire economic situation.  However, today, on the last sitting day of the D&aacute;il and the second last day before this House rises for the Christmas recess until 27 January, for what is too lengthy a period, the Taoiseach will be announcing a plan for economic renewal in Dublin Castle this afternoon without giving these Houses any details and with no opportunity for debate here.  If this plan is to succeed, it must be presented to all parties.  There must be critical analysis, not glitzy public relations events.  There must be detailed and critical analysis and discussion with all the parties in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach says one thing and then does something else.  He goes off and announces it outside these Houses.  It is disgraceful in the context of the national crisis which we are facing.  He should be bringing those plans in here so that they can be discussed in detail.  He should be looking for consensus on certain issues and at least giving people who have been elected to both Houses the opportunity to discuss the current national situation, but he is not doing that.  He is choosing instead to go up to Dublin Castle, have a PR event and the D&aacute;il and Seanad will go into recess.</P>
        <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the economic plan be brought before this House and discussed today.  We do not know how detailed or comprehensive is the plan which the Taoiseach is announcing today or whether it is just a general framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more.  This is the third day this week that I have raised this issue.  I raised it in the context of full engagement with the State and including political traction.  If the Government is putting together a strategy to claw our way out of a recession, it is not enough to include the people and the social partners because there must also be positive political traction to drive it.  </P>
        <P>I support the engagement of the social partners.  I understand this week&rsquo;s meeting was very positive but that is not enough.  The idea that elected public representatives in the D&aacute;il and Seanad<b> </b>are not engaged in this process, are not invited into this process, are neither consulted nor asked for their views is beyond imagination.  I do not know what the Government is thinking.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  Those of us on this side of the House have been asking for such action.  Even if I do not agree with the document when I read it, I still welcome it because it gives us direction and leadership.  However, this will be launched today on the 6 p.m. news.  The leaders of the other parties, if they are legitimately opposed in their response to it, have a duty to point out the flaws because that is their job, whereas if they had been invited in and had some influence on its development, we would have a different proposal.  I do not see the sense in it.  I cannot see where we are going and I do not see the plan.  It bothers me because if we get the first step wrong, it is difficult to see where we go then.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Leader to bring this plan into the House this afternoon as soon as it is announced.  I suggest we are given 20 minutes to read the document and then we will offer our views on what it contains and what should be in it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not be difficult to organise.  I do not care if a Minister is not present.  If the Government does not wish that a Minister attends, let us have the document and we will offer our views on it.  That would not be a difficult procedure for the Leader to organise.  I do not even wish there to be a vote on the issue.  The people of Ireland are entitled to hear where their political representatives stand on such an important document.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider my request.</P>
        <P>On another related matter, both Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and I have raised in the House on a number of occasions the problems of the Irish fishing industry.  I have bemoaned the fact that the industry along the west coast has been destroyed.  Incredibly it is now the case that France and Spain are seeking to reduce the current Irish fishing quota so that our quota can be transferred to theirs.  It is difficult to believe in this day and age that they could seriously put forward the idea that the very low quota available to Irish fishermen would now be reduced further.  They are doing this on the basis that the Irish fleet has been reduced and that therefore the quota may not be needed.  However, the reason given for the reduction in the fleet was that the remaining boats would at least have a better share.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader, through the Cathaoirleach, to send a message that this House recognises the difficulties encountered by the fishing industry and to exhort the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food not to give one inch on this issue and that he should say this before he even gets on the plane to Brussels.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We are all looking forward with anticipation and expectation to today&rsquo;s announcement by the Taoiseach about his plans for economic recovery.  It is vital that his plans succeeds because many people depend on its success.  It will be the last political and economic act of what has been a tumultuous year.  In the future when historians look back, they will regard 2008 as being one of the formative years of the Irish nation.  It is the year when we went from boom to bust.  In early summer the Lisbon treaty referendum was lost and in September the banking crisis worsened and the economy took a nose-dive.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of people are now out of work.  It was against that backdrop that the Oireachtas met to discuss legislation in an all-night sitting to give guarantees to the banking system.  In a spirit of co-operation, Members from all parties sat on a sub-committee to examine why the Lisbon treaty failed to be passed.  Great credit must go to that sub-committee and to its chairman, Senator Paschal Donohoe.</P>
        <P>It has been a particularly difficult year for those who have lost  their jobs.  They are facing a bleak Christmas and a very worrying new year.  We are very grateful for the bits of good news along the way to keep us all sane.</P>
        <P>On the political front, following a very successful conference in May, we managed to ban cluster munitions as a result of the Bill passed last week.  In sport, Munster won the Heineken Cup, which cheered us all.  In the arts, we saw the band, The Script, making an international breakthrough with their number one album and we saw &ldquo;Once&rdquo; winning an Oscar in Hollywood.  These successes have helped to lift the national mood along the way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that we face a very troubling and worrying new year but by working together I am confident we can overcome our difficulties, as we have <Col N="126"/>done in the past.  It is hoped that this afternoon&rsquo;s announcement by the Taoiseach will kick-start the economy.  We are hoping to see an investment in the construction sector and particularly in education but we also want to see broadband being rolled out not just in urban areas but also in rural areas as this will help to create jobs in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach and his staff.  I read in the newspapers this morning that Pat Moylan has been appointed as the chair of the Arts Council.  For one horrible moment I thought we were going to lose him but, luckily, it is a different Pat Moylan.</P>

	<P>On the last occasion when I raised the case of Pamela Izevbekhai in the House, I received a phone call designed to intimidate me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He also informed me that he would campaign to ensure I would not be returned to this House on the next occasion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant amnesty and residency on humanitarian grounds to this lady and her two beautiful daughters, Naomi and Jemima.  They are a lovely family.  All of us should call on the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to allow this case on special grounds, coming up to Christmas time.  No greater gesture could be made by the Government, particularly the Minister, than to allow these three young wonderful people leave to remain.  I was told there was a black campaign against this woman and her children.  The man who tried to intimidate me put questions to me which I put to her yesterday and I was satisfied with the replies.  I put those difficult questions to her and her solicitor, Gabriel Toolan, yesterday at a meeting of all parties in this regard.  We can be accused of being bleeding heart liberals or whatever.  I do not care what they call us.  I am quite satisfied of the authenticity of this case.  The children in question are in real and present danger if they are returned to Nigeria, especially because they will become a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> to be used and abused.  We cannot allow this, a Chathaoirligh.  I am asking you and your office, and the Leader, to put that aside and appeal to the Minister for the Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I want a joint proposal by this House sent to the Minister to grant this family an amnesty and residency in this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the chief executive officer of Ryanair, Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, on winning his court case in the Court of First Instance on the alleged illegal aid granted to his airline by the Walloon regional authority for services to Charleroi Airport.  This is not the first win for Michael O&rsquo;Leary in Europe.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today, he said Ryanair would not exist without deregulation having been introduced in Europe and initiated by then Irish European Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland.</P>
        <P>Michael O&rsquo;Leary also said in the article that he has been knocked about by Europe.  The most welcome news in the article is that the Ryanair boss pledged to campaign vigorously for the Lisbon treaty.  It is interesting that his main argument for doing so is the economic one.  He said if we are to dig ourselves out of the economic mess, we need to export and compete more in Europe.  He is right about that.  The slogan for the second Lisbon treaty referendum campaign should be that our choice is either Lisbon or Reykjavik.</P>
        <P>If we think of the misleading and confused campaign that took place on the first referendum, we need Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s straight talking to confront the, at times bizarre, arguments of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign.  While we might find Michael O&rsquo;Leary can be forthright and use choice language, it is the type of language needed to cut through the illogical and emotive arguments of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side.  This is a very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a fair amount of illogical emotionality from the Senator&rsquo;s side too.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  We have a European Council framework on the Lisbon treaty, which the Government sought and obtained.  We have a framework on the banks, resolving the banking crisis.  It appears we are going to have a framework for resolving the economic crisis.  When will we have, however, real decisions which change matters on the ground?  I wait to see what will be the real content of this programme the Government is announcing today.  Whether it is the banks, the Lisbon treaty or the economy, the Government is intent on frustrating debate in this and the Lower House.  It is disrespectful to Members of this House that there has been no debate on the proposed economic recovery plan.  It is inappropriate to bypass the Oireachtas on this important issue.  When we talk of patriotism and a bipartisan approach, it is clear the Taoiseach has no intention of fostering such an approach to resolving the problems that exist in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Yet again there has been another murder in Dublin in the space of a few days &mdash; in East Wall, Howth and last evening in Ranelagh.  I offer my sympathies and condolences to the family involved.  It raises questions about supports for vulnerable people, especially the homeless.  Will the Leader refer the matter to the appropriate committee for further discussion?  Those involved in the delivery of services in this area should be asked to attend to work out an appropriate scheme to ensure adequate supports and services are in place.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is duty bound under legislation to put forward a service plan each year.  It has published next year&rsquo;s service plan in recent days.  In light of the impact of further budget restrictions, will a new service plan be introduced?  Will the Leader ensure that if such a new plan is introduced, there would be no impact on service provision and that it would be in the additional layers of administration and management that were put in place at a time when we were in a position to have such monitoring and co-ordination?</P>
        <P>I welcome the measured and fair contribution of Senator Hannigan on the plan for economic recovery compared with those of other Members.</P>

I congratulate all involved in getting on with the national effort and having the spirit required.

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>My attention was drawn to a court case last week and I was horrified by the evidence given at it.  The case involved a group of young men with purposely souped-up motor cars, some ten of them, racing on the M50 at speeds of up to 134 km/h.  One of the drivers had an unwilling passenger, to the extent that her car had broken down and she accepted a lift from him, not knowing what would ensue.  She, a 20 year old girl, was killed in the race.</P>
        <P>In the court case, the judge referred to souped-up cars as an lethal concoction.  I was shocked by the case because the young men involved had removed steering wheels from their cars to replace them with sporty-type ones which meant the airbags did not work.  The revulsion I have is that the young man involved in the accident was given a suspended sentence.  It is a reminder to us that some road traffic accidents occur from activities that someone considers to be fun.  It sends out a message to others who are thinking of doing the same that the State and the Oireachtas do not recognise this as serious if only a suspended sentence is handed down.  I am not asking for anything other than a reminder that these sort of activities must stop.  We must send out that message.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">According to the Order Paper, Second Stage of the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill 2008 is to be resumed.  I presume there is some parliamentary time left for it.  In the Coroners Court last week, a case referred to the parents of a young man of 22 years who had died and who had donated his body organ, as a result of which four lives were saved.  It is a reminder of the importance of donor cards and the proposed changes to the law in the Human Body Organs and Human Tissue Bill 2008.  The Minister for Health and Children did not accept the Bill because she wanted more debate on it.  We must urge the Minister to bring the Bill back in the new year or introduce her own Bill.  This would remind everyone that we can save lives if we carry a donor card and find a better solution to encourage people to donate their body organs after death.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few weeks RTE showed an excellent graphic, historically correct television programme regarding the plight of the Irish who had to flee Ireland because of the Famine and went to America.  If they had remained in Ireland there is no doubt they would have endured unbearable suffering and death.  When they arrived in America they were met with much hostility, bureaucracy and indifference.  A few people stood out at that time, the local bishop and a few officials who died of the same fever that the Irish brought to the country.  In a nation with such a history that saw how the Irish were eventually accepted in <Col N="129"/>America and the contribution they made to the development of America and its society, I find it difficult that we cannot see a mirror story in the case of Pamela and her two daughters.</P>
        <P>It is vital, not just for the good of the family and its safety but for the morale of the Irish people, that we do what is right in this case.  If we do not do so, we will be demoralised as a people for deporting this family given the background and the facts we now have.  I cannot think of a greater expression of the spirit of Christmas than to receive this family with open arms into our home of Ireland, to look after them and help them in any way possible.  If we do otherwise, we will have lost an opportunity to show a generosity and a maturity that we have in abundance.  To fail to use that will affect us for a long time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are undergoing many crises, including the economic crisis, the housing crisis, the employment crisis and the food crisis.  We also have another crisis, the impact of which the Government is not fully aware, namely, the waste management crisis.  We have made great progress in respect of recycling initiatives and the introduction of facilities to deal with our waste, but due to the crisis in this area, we hear that Repak, the Irish Waste Management Association and local authorities are screaming for help with the stockpiling of waste.  There is no clear direction from the Government or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>I am not sure if the Leader is listening to me but I would appreciate if he would because this is a very serious issue.  It is important that we listen in this House.  The House is in its second last day but I call for a debate on this matter.  In November and December we create over 25% of our national waste.  The amount of packaging that comes into this country for the Christmas period is unbelievable.  We are making no attempt, despite the elephant in the room that is the stockpiling of waste, to reduce such waste.  In the UK, a project called the Courtauld commitment involves all major retailers signing up to reduce packaging waste by 10% by 2010.  There is no such initiative here, which is a disgrace.  We must wake up and take account of that.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald in her statement that Government is ignoring Parliament by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement of his economic strategy in Dublin Castle.  To me, that smacks of spin and public relations.  The Taoiseach is accountable to this Parliament and to this House.  I would like to think I am not wasting my time coming to Dublin to hear announcements made in other private venues.</P>

This is the last day of the term of the D&aacute;il and the plan will not be analysed in a parliamentary way, which is a disgrace.  We hear the Taoiseach calling for national effort and co-operation, yet he goes off on these solo runs.  The position is the same with the Lisbon treaty.  Is it any wonder the country is in the state it is in?</P>

	<P>This is a very serious day for the fishing industry.  I echo the calls of Senator O&rsquo;Toole that we send a message of solidarity to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to whom I spoke this morning, who has been in Brussels for a couple of days, and the <Col N="130"/>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, who travels there today.  The fishing industry got a boost a few years ago with the white fish renewal scheme.  It has much better and safer boats than it had a decade ago, yet when it needs the money to pay for those boats, there is a threat to the Hague preferences, which will ensure that people cannot fish &mdash; if they cannot fish, they cannot get the money to pay for their boats.  The whole national effort to protect the fishing industry, as referred to in the Cawley report and the decommissioning programme, will be completely wasted.</P>
        <P>It is clear that France, Spain and Portugal have their agendas in respect of their needs.  We referred to Lisbon earlier, and it is grand to say that the Minister must hold his ground, but when these matters come to votes, there must be solidarity with other member states that will support us in what we need.  I am fearful that support is not as strong as it has been in other years.  I do not know how we can influence other countries at the table because very serious decisions must be made today.  We must hold out to retain the Hague preferences.  We also need the voting strength to make sure that happens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask that we send a message of solidarity to the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, at a historic moment.  This argument always is made at this time of the year because these are annual quotas that are fought for every year.  This is a particularly difficult year and I stand in solidarity with the fishing federations because Greencastle &mdash; declaring my interest &mdash; is at the core of the difficulties today.</P>
        <P>Given that the euro is approaching parity with sterling &mdash; at 93p &mdash; will the Leader examine a number of matters in that regard?  I proposed previously that we explore an all-Ireland VAT rate for alcohol.  I was on a radio programme with Jeffrey Donaldson and he thought it was a good idea.  This drive to the North, which results in people buying other things when they go to buy alcohol, is also fuelling alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I bring to the attention of the Leader the issue of pricing.  If one takes the train from Belfast to Dublin, or <i>vice versa</i>, as we did on the occasion of a European project, it costs &pound;36 for a return ticket, but if one pays in euro, it costs &euro;52, with an exchange rate of 67p.  That is appalling and I am not sure to whose attention it should be drawn, perhaps the consumer affairs officials.  For cross-Border projects to charge &euro;52 for the same journey that costs &pound;36 across the Border is appalling.  This exploitation is giving us a bad name.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo calls from Senators on both sides of the House for a cross-party motion on Pamela Izevbekhai.  I attended the meeting in the audio visual room yesterday when she spoke so powerfully and eloquently about her dreadful experiences in Nigeria and her fears for the safety of her daughters, Naomi and Jemima, who are here in Ireland with her.  There is enormous compassion and sympathy for her on both sides of the House.  As a man of compassion, the Leader, I am sure, will not stand in the way of a cross-party motion.  I was very proud to be involved in the drafting of the cross-party motion on Ingrid Betancourt.  We could draft a more simple motion in this case, along the lines that the House calls on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant humanitarian leave to remain with Pamela and her daughters.  Perhaps something straightforward would get support.  All of us would be delighted to support it and put any influence we can on the Minister to ensure she remains.  There is a real fear that if the European court rules against her between now and 20 January, when her case is next before the High Court, she may be deported immediately.  I know we are in the second last day of sitting but there is a real urgency to agree this motion.</P>
        <P>I welcome the debate on gun crime.  Yesterday, it was reported that the head of the Garda Inspectorate, Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, had made a measured and sensible suggestion in terms of tackling gun crime on which we all might reflect.  She stated that as head of the Boston police <Col N="131"/>she instituted a system whereby police officers told her about individuals and families most at risk of becoming involved in gun and gang crime.  Resources and diversionary tactics were then targeted at those families and young people.  This a model for us as we see worrying developments, particularly the recent shooting by a 16 year old boy on the East Wall.  Where we see gun crime perpetrated by people so young we must target resources and diversionary tactics to prevent young people falling into these situations.</P>
        <P>I repeat a call I made on many occasions for a renewed debate on the Climate Protection Bill in the new year.  This was first debated in October 2007 and was adjourned.  Time remains on Second Stage and I would welcome a continuation of this debate in the context of the Poznan talks and the developments which have occurred since the Bill was first introduced.  I will put pressure on the Leader in the new year to provide more time for this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill will come before the House after Christmas.  This Bill is based on a report by the Boundary Commission which was given certain terms of reference which were not adhered to in the preparation of the report on which this legislation is based.  Is it open to the House to obtain legal opinion on the validity of the Bill?  My information is that the Bill is flawed because the commission which prepared the report did not remain within its terms of reference and broke them on numerous occasions.  The Bill divides counties, areas, regions and even places parts of counties in other provinces, which was outside the terms of reference of the commission.  I understand that once it is challenged in the courts after it has passed through both Houses it will be overturned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Keaveney with regard to the extremely serious threat to our fishing industry.  It is disgraceful that giants such as France, Spain and Portugal can raid our meagre quota at a time when our industry is so vulnerable.  This is a serious matter and we should stand firm on it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the economic plan, we hope it is a plan for economic recovery and we wish it well.  However, it is peculiar that as the Houses are about to break up for the Christmas recess, it is being launched elsewhere today.  It is supposed to be a framework for economic recovery and perhaps it is.  We would welcome a debate on it which the Leader could fit in either this evening, as was suggested, or tomorrow.  We are in the most rapidly deteriorating situation that we have experienced in our lifetimes.  Of course we must debate it.  It is what everybody will be talking about.  This House, as part of the Parliament, should be involved.  We are sitting a day longer and we can deal with it.  I appeal to the Leader&rsquo;s good sense of proportion to place this on our agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I request the Minister for Finance to come to the House at the earliest opportunity in the new year to discuss the sustainable economic renewal.  This is to be broadly and warmly welcomed.  I agree with Senator Keaveney that people are buying Irish but in many cases they are going North of the Border to do so.</P>
        <P>With so many people making such significant purchases North of the Border &mdash; I do not mean people coming back from holidays with presents, I mean sustained major purchases &mdash; there must be a case for pushing forward with the all-Ireland economy whereby VAT rates and duties would be in sync North and South of the Border, particularly because we are an island nation.  This would suit both sides because it seems to be a game of ping-pong.  For a few years people go North of the Border to shop and then go South of the Border for another few years.  It is not sustainable at either side.  We would benefit greatly from having this debate.  One must wonder how the people who go North to shop can be shouting for extra services if they spend their money and pay VAT in another jurisdiction.  This is worth considering.</P>
<Col N="132"/>
        <P>In the same debate we can raise with the Minister for Finance the lack of confidence in the financial markets.  The further blow from the United States where Mr. Madoff &mdash; if one will excuse the pun &mdash; made off with $50 billion.  The market was barely recovering from the previous scandals.  Even though interest rates are set low by the central banks, the interbank rate is still high and therefore people still pay high rates because of the lack of confidence between the banks.  We live in a global financial market.  When will regulation on a global scale be introduced?  As money moves swiftly between borders we need regulation at global level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I wish to comment on the fact that yet again we are at a defining moment for Irish fisheries.  It is important that we send out a strong message on behalf of Irish fishermen that there will be no capitulation.  It is important that we tell Spain, France and Portugal to stop plundering and to go away.  It is incumbent upon the Government to provide leadership.  We need to send a strong message to Europe that we will not allow further raiding of our fisheries.</P>
        <P>Today, another fiasco will take place in Dublin Castle.  We are the Second Chamber of this Parliament.  Eight weeks after the budget and five months after the Minister for Finance discovered there was an economic crisis, the Taoiseach and his Government will go to Dublin Castle.  Tomorrow, the Leader will ask us to recess until 27 January.  I appeal to the Leader not to do so but to allow us to come back early to discuss the Lisbon treaty and the economic crisis, issues we have not discussed in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I make the point I made yesterday that two months after the budget, neither the Minister for Education and Science nor the T&aacute;naiste has come to this House to discuss the education cuts and rising unemployment.  The Leader has not given a satisfactory answer as to why they have not done so.  This morning, I challenge the Leader, and ask him man to man, to give me an explanation as to why they will not come to the House.  We deserve an answer.  More importantly, the children and the people of Ireland deserve an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Government is taking initiative.  It has got at least one element right, and that is research and development.  It should be kept here.  I have spoken in this House on several occasions over the years about situations where brilliant, innovative and imaginative work done by Irish people was repatriated to the United States along with the profits of that work.  We must make sure we get a fair crack of the whip when it comes to our own creativity.</P>
        <P>It is not right that this House should be sidelined, which is an increasing feature of the political system.  It is a pity.  We should not be pussyfooting around the issue of the wage agreement.  The reality is that there must be an immediate wage freeze.  None of us should get an extra cent while people all around us are losing their jobs.  There must be solidarity in this.</P>
        <P>In regard to the fishing industry, I am delighted that Members on both sides of the House have sought to give support to our Ministers in Brussels.  We should not always touch the forelock to Europe.  If one quantifies what other members have received from us in terms of our fish stocks, it more than matches the sum of every single cent we have received from Brussels in grants.</P>

	<P>If we had stayed out of it and kept our fish stocks, we would be in a better position than we are now.  We should remind our European colleagues of that.  France, Portugal and Spain have consistently devastated their own stocks before setting off to pillage those of others.  Many years ago, I offered support to the Canadians in their dispute with <Col N="133"/>European fishermen who had gone as far as the cod banks off Newfoundland and were destroying the fish stocks there.  Our Ministers are strongly deserving of our support in this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader respond to the series of questions I asked of him in recent days?  The first relates to the situation of Ms Pamela Izevbekhai.  I honour Senators Leyden and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for their strong support on this issue.  I would be pleased to withdraw my motion in favour of an all-party proposal, which would be preferable.  Like Senator Leyden, I have been the subject of anonymous contacts, although it was not a telephone call but an anonymous letter.  Unfortunately, I threw it in the bin, as I do with all such correspondence, when I should have handed it to the Garda.  The letter was accompanied by a newspaper article in reference to which I asked the Leader to raise with the Minister the apparent leaks from sources within the immigration service and whether there should be an inquiry in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also asked him about certain matters surrounding the resignation of the chairman of the Equality Tribunal.  The statement by the chairwoman of the Equality Authority was issued almost simultaneously with the announcement of that resignation, which had the effect of undermining it.  Was that statement mandated as a result of a board meeting or was it a type of maverick action?  The representative of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland has done the decent thing by resigning.  The remaining members of the board should do the same.  It is astonishing that they should so openly display the fact that they do not have the guts of a gooseberry compared with this wonderful woman who resigned in protest and in order to cease collaborating in the destruction of equality rights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>At its height, the cost of a barrel of oil was some $147, after holding at approximately $80 for a considerable period.  The current price is some $45 a barrel.  When the price reached its height, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is sought an increase in their prices in the region of 17% to 19%.  That request was granted.  However, now that the price of oil has fallen dramatically, there is no sign of a corresponding price decrease from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  This is of particular concern at Christmas when people, particularly elderly people, may struggle to meet their fuel costs.</P>
        <P>The excuse given by the regulator for this was that the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is had a six-month supply of oil in storage which they had purchased at the higher price.  If that was so, why did they not have a six-month supply purchased at a lower price when the prices rose?  There is no logic to that excuse.  In the context of Government plans for economic recovery, the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is should be put under serious pressure by the Government, all parties and the Seanad as an institution to reduce prices in keeping with the reduction in the price of oil.  If it was logical to increase prices in the past, it must be equally logical to decrease them now.  People&rsquo;s livelihoods and homes are at stake.  I appeal to the Leader to take on board this serious matter.  I expect that he will because he has a sense of enterprise and understands what I am talking about.  It is bizarre to allow the current situation to continue.</P>

	<P>Is mian liom cur leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; agus Leyden maidir le c&aacute;s Pamela Izevbekhai.  I am not sure whether a motion is required.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in his typical fashion, put it more eloquently than anybody else when he said that what is needed is a genuine manifestation of the spirit of Christmas.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will come before the House in due course next year.  In addition to that, however, we must have a serious discussion of our entire approach to immigration policy.  A newspaper report today includes an encouraging picture of a group who swore loyalty <Col N="134"/>to the State yesterday, in the presence of Government representatives.  We must examine whether we have managed to put in place a structure that respects those who wish to become Irish citizens, whether through the asylum process or otherwise.  There is a heartlessness to current policy.  In a time of economic difficulty, I am concerned we will become even more heartless.  There must be a debate on this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I support the point made by Senator Ellis.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil leatrom &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar Chontae Liatroma.

There must be a debate in the new year on the political system and the weakness of our parliamentary system.  For example, we have seen the Taoiseach making significant announcements in Dublin Castle.  This lessens public confidence in our parliamentary democracy.  We should tie this discussion in with the necessary debate on Seanad reform which I hope will take place soon.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has great leverage with the banks and, thus, an opportunity to help families who face the threat of losing their homes.  Will the Leader bring to his attention the situation of the many couples who fixed their mortgages a year or more ago when they saw that interest rates were rising?  It is great news that the European Central Bank has since reduced the rate, but these people are caught.  I understand they would benefit by some &euro;300 to &euro;400 per month if they could renegotiate their agreement with the banks.</P>

        <P>I propose that colleagues will have an opportunity tomorrow, in the Second Stage debate on the Finance Bill, to make reference to the document being brought forward today.  I am aware that many colleagues wish that corrective measures be taken urgently by the Government to deal with a situation that is changing on a day to day and week to week basis, as has been pointed out in respect of the sterling currency challenge.  That is a further challenge to us doing business here in the Twenty-six Counties.  All of that must be corrected.</P>
        <P>As was correctly said, the budget was brought forward by the Government on 14 October and we should consider the changes that have taken place since then.  They are unprecedented.  A 90 year old man, who is a substantial employer in this State, told me yesterday that in his lifelong experience he has never seen anything like it.  All we can do is look to the forefathers, the pioneers, and those who have created the Ireland of today.  We should consider the changes that man made since he came from the province of Munster to create such enormous opportunities for hundreds if not thousands of people in our country.</P>
        <P>We should all learn from this experience.  None of us is infallible.  If we all told the truth, we would admit that none of us has the answer.  We are all trying to do the best we can for the opportunity the people have given us, regardless of the party one represents in this House.</P>

	<P>We should all be fair in this festive season.  We will have an opportunity tomorrow on Second Stage of the Finance Bill to make known our views to the Minister for Finance who will be in the Chamber.  I want to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is waiting to come into the House, to take statements on gun crime.</P>
        <P>Regarding the call made on me this morning by many colleagues regarding Pamela Izevbekhai and her family, I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Keaveney, Coghlan, Buttimer and Norris expressed strong concerns and called for the full support of the House for our Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and the Minister, Deputy Smith, in regard to the fishing quotas.  As far as we are concerned, it is &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; our fishing quota.  We are a small nation making up only 1% of the population of the EU.  In regard to the Irish fishing industry I say &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; what is left of our fishing quota.</P>

	<P>I welcome the announcement that will be made by the Taoiseach in my county of Westmeath this morning of an additional 200 jobs in the town of Athlone.  I acknowledge the good work carried out by the IDA in securing those 200 jobs and assisting the economy, particularly the economy in the midlands, for years to come.  </P>
        <P>Senator Callely referred to another horrific murder that has occurred in Dublin.  A young woman lost her life tragically yesterday evening in Portobello.  The tragedies that are occurring on a daily basis are appalling.  The murders of women and the lack of respect for human life is horrific.  There is no longer any fear of the law.  We might have an opportunity in the future to have a debate in the House, with the Minister present, on sentencing policy.  Life should mean life, 25 years if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of what side of the House Members are on, we must agree that there must be fear of the law.  That does not appear to be the case for certain offences.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the tragedies involving cars and outlined the case of another young woman losing her life.  It is difficult to fathom the justice meted out in that case but that is a matter for the courts.  It is nothing to do with those of us in this House.</P>
        <P>I will allow a debate on the Health Service Executive, as called for by Senator Callely, in the first two weeks after we return from the recess with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised the issue of waste management.  I have already given the Senator a commitment on that.  I take the matter seriously, and I know the Senator&rsquo;s strong views on this area are genuine.  The cost of waste management is a major challenge to Ireland in the future, particularly for local authorities.</P>
        <P>I again contacted the Department yesterday regarding the three queries from Senator Norris.  When I get word back from the Minister&rsquo;s offices, I will directly contact him about those matters.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney and Hanafin raised the issue of the all-Ireland opportunities that should present in the future.  Senator Keaveney spoke about the exchange rates, which are unacceptable.  Whether one is buying North or South this Christmas time, I ask people to help everyone and try to buy Irish if at all possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That strong message should go out from the House this morning.  Senator MacSharry spoke to me at length about this matter yesterday.  We should all buy Irish, whether we are shopping North or South, and help in any way we possibly can.  In doing that we will be doing a great deal for the economy.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik asked about the Bill she outlined.  It is still on Second Stage.  We will review that early in the new year.</P>
        <P>Senators Ellis and Mullen raised the matter of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  The Bill breaches the county boundaries in Senator Ellis&rsquo;s case in Leitrim and in my own case in Westmeath.  It is fair to say Senator Ellis and myself are honoured Members of this House because of the boundary changes that occurred in the elections to the 30th D&aacute;il.  While it is an honour and privilege to be here, the people we represent feel they are disenfranchised and that they should have an equal opportunity to be represented by an Oireachtas Member in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is unacceptable that Senator Ellis&rsquo;s county of Leitrim does not have a Leitrim person representing them.  While they are represented very well by Deputies from the other constituency, the people of Country Leitrim would wish to have a Leitrim person representing them.  All I can say to Senator Ellis, who feels strongly about this, is that if he wishes the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider his proposal, it is not a matter for me but for the Senator to consider the position in that regard.  I will do all I can to assist him in his plight.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer and Senator Healy Eames called for a debate on education.  The Minister will come to the House in the first two weeks of the next session.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Reilly raised the high cost of electricity and gas, which is unacceptable now that oil prices have been substantially reduced.  I call on the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is to consider an immediate reduction of 10% in their prices  The ESB got a 17.5% increase in August and Bord G&aacute;is got an increase of 20% in September.  As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly said, there have been huge reductions in oil prices so there is no good reason that these two great companies cannot play their part in assisting Ireland.  The past ten or 13 years have been very good for them, as they have been for all companies, during the Celtic tiger economy, parts one and two.  These companies have been exemplary in working for the national interest, particularly the ESB which has had a huge role in the economy over the years.  I make that call on them today.  I also call on the regulator to state why there cannot be a reduction of 10% in prices in the early new year, given that oil prices have gone down to the current low level.</P>

	<P>I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the important subject of gun crime.  Senators will appreciate that I am very constrained in what I can say about a specific recent tragic incident where a gun was used. A person has been charged so it would be inappropriate for me to comment either on the detail surrounding the immediate incident or the circumstances which gave rise to it.  That information will emerge in the fullness of time and we will see if any lessons can be learned from it.  At the moment, all I can say is that the death of Mr. O&rsquo;Kane is deplored by <Col N="142"/>all right-thinking people and our sympathy is with his family and friends, as well as with the wider community in East Wall.  The Garda and the local community in East Wall work closely together and this tragic incident will reinforce their determination to continue working together.  The House was told last Tuesday, in the course of an Adjournment debate, of the strong and vibrant communities in the East Wall and adjacent areas.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I attach the highest priority to tackling organised and gun crime and bringing those involved in such activities to justice.  One of the main priorities I have set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 is to target gun crime, organised crime and drug related crime through a range of measures, including the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations, such as Operation Anvil.  In doing so, I am conscious of the achievements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose members are called upon daily to put their lives on the line in their efforts to thwart the activities of gangs.  It is because of those efforts that many gang members who may have considered themselves untouchable are behind bars facing long sentences, for which there will be no mitigation.</P>
        <P>Operation Anvil began in the Dublin metropolitan region in 2005 to deal with this type of serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the operation is to target active criminals and their associates who are involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt policing and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  By the end of November 2008, 1,200 firearms had been recovered in Dublin and 1,000 had been recovered in the rest of the country under Operation Anvil.  There had been more than 7,000 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, robbery and burglary and 67,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods under the operation, which the Garda will continue to pursue as it relentlessly tackles the issue of illegal guns.</P>
        <P>At a time when the public finances are under pressure, I am ensuring that priority continues to be given to front line policing.  The level of funding provided under Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from &euro;20 million to &euro;21 million.  That will enable the Garda to continue to target and disrupt serious and organised criminal activity.  The decision I made more than four months ago to provide for an increase in funding for the operation, which was made in the context of a reduction of 2.7% in my Department&rsquo;s total Estimate, meant I was giving priority to the fight against organised crime rather than other areas of departmental responsibility.  I have been the subject of criticism in this House for that key decision.  I have given increased resources to the Garda under Operation Anvil, which specifically targets organised crime, to ensure the fight against such crime can continue.  It is obvious that the deployment of additional garda&iacute; on the streets is an important aspect of that.  The decision to recruit an additional 400 garda&iacute; in 2009 represents a significant achievement at a time when the overall level of Exchequer funding given to the Department is being reduced.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that other key operations will be maintained in 2009.  The savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish front line policing.  The level of funding given next year to the Criminal Assets Bureau, which I recently discussed in the Seanad, will increase by &euro;1.5 million, or 20%.  Next year, the overall Garda budget will be &euro;1.589 billion.  The recent increase in Garda numbers will more than compensate for the reduction in the allocation for Garda overtime.  The attested strength of the force will increase to almost 14,900, from its current attested strength of 14,267, by the end of 2009.  During last year&rsquo;s general election campaign, my party indicated that it would increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000 by 2010.  We will reach that figure at the end of 2009.  It is important to remind the House that the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, indicated in the contract it produced before the election that it would not increase Garda numbers to 15,000 until 2012.  We will achieve that by the end of <Col N="143"/>next year, three years before the date that was indicated by the Opposition in advance of last year&rsquo;s election.</P>
        <P>The number of garda&iacute; will increase from its current level of 14,267 to almost 14,900 by the end of 2009.  It will increase by more than 1,100, or 8%, over 2008 and 2009.  There are 1,100 recruits in training and 400 new recruits will be taken on in 2009.  The significant increase in the policing hours available will more than offset the planned reduction in the overtime budget, from &euro;108 million in 2008 to &euro;80 million in 2009.  In the past 21 months, the number of civilians employed in whole time positions by the Garda has increased by 59% to 2,038.  It has increased by 20% in 2008.  Over the years, the general public, along with most public representatives in both Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere, complained that too many garda&iacute; were sitting in stations doing desk duties.  There has been a rapid increase in civilianisation over recent years.  If one takes into account part-time and temporary employees, the total number of civilians employed by the force increases to approximately 2,600.  Given that there will be almost 15,000 garda&iacute; in the force at the end of next year, it is clear there has been a significant increase in the number of people working for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The stark and regrettable reality is that the growing gun culture in Ireland is inevitably having fatal consequences.  I accept that our priority has to be to rid this society of illegal weapons.  That has been a priority of Operation Anvil which, as I have indicated, has had considerable success.  Since my appointment as Minister, I have expressed concern about the number of handguns which have been licensed here in recent years.  The majority of licensed firearms holders act responsibly and pursue their interests legitimately.  Many of them deeply resent any reference that is made to the increase in the issue of licensed handguns in the context of our crime problem.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I cannot deny that an increase in the number of weapons of a certain type that are in circulation can add to a gun culture.  Such a gun culture already operates in criminal gangs.  I regret that the activities of criminal gangs are impinging on the interests of law-abiding owners of licensed firearms.  I cannot overlook the fact that the overall level and kind of licensed firearms prevalent in the community is relevant to the prevention of crime.  This problem is demonstrated by the fact that 27 licensed handguns, including some very serious firearms, have been stolen since 2005.  A further 1,236 other firearms were stolen during the same period, some 373 of which were recovered.</P>
        <P>All handguns were banned in this jurisdiction from the early 1970s, during the Troubles, until 2004.  That is no longer the case, following a series of judicial decisions.  Approximately 1,800 handguns have been licensed since 2004.  No public policy decision was made to bring about this situation.  During the summer, Mr. Justice Charleton said in a judgment that any &ldquo;reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns&rdquo;.  I am concerned that the number of handguns licensed could grow exponentially if strong and decisive action is not taken.  We could develop a similar firearms regime to that of countries like the United States, which has a very different attitude to weapons.  That would be unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Some time ago, I directed my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct an urgent and intensive review of firearms law.  Following the review, I introduced proposals to provide that no new licenses will be issued for handguns, subject to limited exceptions in the case of Olympic sports, and existing licenses will not be renewed unless applicants fully meet the requirements of a radically tightened licensing procedure whereby the safety of the community will be paramount.  In his judgment on a recent case, Mr. Justice Birmingham indicated that he has some worries in this regard.  A District Court judge, Kevin Kilraine, has also indicated his opposition to some of what is happening within the licensing regime.</P>
<Col N="144"/>
        <P>I hope Members on all sides of the House will feel able to support these proposals.  They are not designed to interfere needlessly with the rights of sporting enthusiasts, but to recognise the specific dangers posed by guns.  I welcome the fact that the head of the Garda Inspectorate, Kathy O&rsquo;Toole, who is well known and had broad experience when she was the Boston Police Commissioner, has written strongly in favour of the proposed handgun ban in the latest edition of the <i>Law Society Gazette</i>.  While a <i>de facto</i> ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will be given legislative form in the forthcoming criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which will be published early in the new year.  The Bill will tackle comprehensively the issue of airsoft guns by making their possession in public a serious offence.  It will contain measures that the Garda Commissioner has suggested to me in respect of the tightening of the law on the possession of knives.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the problem of guns held or used illegally.  Severe penalties for firearms offences are in place under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  For example, the possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and the use of a firearm to resist arrest or aid escape carry a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.  Offences such as the possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, the possession of a firearm or ammunition in suspicious circumstances, the carrying of a firearm with criminal intent and the alteration of a firearm carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.  It must be remembered that the mandatory penalty for murder, whether using a firearm, is life imprisonment.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved my proposals for a criminal justice (covert surveillance) Bill and I recently published the general scheme.  The Bill will open up the possibility of intelligence gained through secret surveillance being used as evidence in the prosecution of cases involving serious criminal activity.  In the light of the increasing sophistication of criminals, subversives and terrorists, their use of intermediaries and the associated difficulties in obtaining direct evidence, the use of additional evidence is crucial.  The Bill will provide for a system of authorisation of covert surveillance, operations which will, as a rule, involve an application to a judge for authorisation to proceed with the surveillance and where the reasons for the surveillance will be clearly set out before the court.  The Bill also provides that in cases of exceptional urgency a senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces may approve a surveillance operation for a period of no more than 14 days.</P>
        <P>Work is also ongoing on the preparation of the general scheme of the criminal procedure Bill.  While this Bill is primarily aimed at giving effect to the legislative aspects of the justice for victims initiative which I announced in June, some elements will be of considerable benefit in our fight against serious crime.  In particular, I am thinking of the proposal that will enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to seek a retrial where an acquittal is tainted due, for example, to intimidation of witnesses or jurors.  There will also be a provision on expert evidence, to ensure the prosecution is given adequate opportunity to examine and challenge evidence being introduced by the defence; in other words, there will be a levelling of the pitch.  I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for the drafting of the Bill in December with a view to its publication in the spring.</P>
        <P>Work is also ongoing on the criminal justice (forensic evidence and sampling) Bill which will provide for the establishment of a DNA database for criminal investigation purposes.  Such a database will, as has been the experience in other countries, greatly enhance the intelligence available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill early in the new year.  In difficult financial circumstances, I have made provision in the Estimates for my Department for next year for an &euro;18 million funding package for new state-of-the-art forensic science facilities and State pathology laboratory.  This will enable the work on DNA database to proceed once the new legislation is in place.</P>
<Col N="145"/>
        <P>Many of our reforms have been targeted at the fight against gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide-ranging initiatives to strengthen the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle crime.  While I do not intend to list every reform, I want to highlight some of the more far-reaching.  In the cases of offences connected with organised crime such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of firearms or explosives, detention of up to seven days is possible.  The bail laws have been strengthened in order to allow the prosecution to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications, for example, opinion evidence from a chief superintendent that bail should be refused because the applicant is likely to commit a serious offence is admissible.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect&rsquo;s silence in response to Garda questioning have been expanded.</P>
        <P>As with all such reforms, it takes time for their impact to be seen in criminal trials.  It is na&iuml;ve to think measures we enact in the House one day will immediately transform the situation the next.  However, we have recently begun to see clear evidence that these reforms are working.  For example, the figures for 2007 showed a doubling of the number of mandatory minimum ten-year sentences handed down by the courts in drug trafficking cases, compared with 2006.  We have seen the provisions allowing for witness statements which a witness fails to stand over or recants to be used in evidence helping to secure a conviction in a recent trial.  Up to 11 people who had previously given statements subsequently refused to give evidence or when they went into the witness box, could not remember what had happened.  As a result of a change that the House and Oireachtas generally made, the judge in that case was able to take the original written statements provided by the people concerned as their evidence.  A positive ruling has also been handed down by the Special Criminal Court in respect of the provisions on the drawing of inferences.</P>
        <P>We cannot overlook the fact that the demand for drugs is the lifeblood of many criminal gangs.  Anyone, from whatever class or background, who uses illicit drugs is not well placed to deplore the activities of gangs when in reality they are complicit in these activities.  The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Curran, is drawing up the national drugs strategy for the next eight years.  I expect that strategy will be debated fully in the House.  I will confine myself to saying I reject completely suggestions made from time to time from some quarters that the answer lies in legalising drugs.  That overlooks completely the harm that comes from drug abuse and would be handing a victory to purveyors of death and destruction.</P>
        <P>As we recently had statements in the House on the excellent work being done by the Criminal Assets Bureau, I will not go over that ground again, other than to say four months ago when I was preparing the Estimates, I earmarked a 20% increase for the bureau.</P>
        <P>The increasing use of guns in our society raises serious issues which must be and are being addressed.  However, we must do so in the context of the factual position.  The CSO crime statistics for the third quarter of this year show a continuing marked decrease in homicide offences, of 57% in the quarter.  The number of murders in the quarter reduced by 50% and instances of dangerous driving leading to death by 85.7%, with no percentage change in cases of manslaughter.  There has also been an 8.3% decrease in the number of murder threats.  Year-on-year there has been a decrease of 50% in the number of homicide offences, including a 33% decrease in the number of murders.  This downward trend is continuing.  The number of firearms murders to date this year is on a par with that in the same period last year &mdash; 21 compared with 18.  Obviously, 21 firearms murders are 21 too many.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that some of the gangland killings occur in the wake of Garda activity directed against gangs.  That activity has led to a situation where gang members have sought retribution against other gang members as a result of the Garda success.  Such killings are to <Col N="146"/>be deplored but the Garda cannot and will not be deflected from taking every possible action against gangs just because there is that danger.  Let me put something beyond doubt.  I pledge, on behalf of the Government, that all resources of the State will be used in our unstinting endeavours to ensure there will be no hiding place for those who engage in gangland activities and the illegal use of guns.  I reiterate that our first priority is the fight against crime and keeping garda&iacute; on the streets to deal with the burgeoning gun culture, particularly illegal guns.  It is a priority of the Garda and the State resources to ensure they are all apprehended.  Thankfully, since 2005, under Operation Anvil, some 2,200 firearms have been apprehended.</P>
        <P>I can appreciate that Members on both sides of the House have been lobbied by gun clubs on my stated intentions regarding licensed handguns.  I can accept that this is a difficult issue.  I am not so na&iuml;ve as to think that moving on licensed handguns will solve the overall crime problem, in particular, the illegal use of handguns by organised criminals.  However, when a judge brings to the attention of the public and the Oireachtas that any reasonable person would need to feel alarmed at the proliferation of licensed handguns, that is an indication that we should do something about it.  In conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues, I finally decided that the people do not want a gun culture here.  They want to be sure that we will not go down the road followed by other countries.  Regardless of whether it was decided by the Legislature or whether it just happened as a result of court decisions &mdash; as happened recently here &mdash; given that we have gone from zero licensed handguns in 2004 to 1,800 today, we need to take action.  If we did not take action and if, God forbid, something did happen as a result of the use of a licensed handgun by the person licensed or a person who had stolen it, the public and media commentators would validly ask why the politicians had not acted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome his expos&eacute; on Government policy on tackling gun crime involving both legally and illegally held weapons.  The Minister&rsquo;s speech was a clap on the back &mdash; we are doing very well, the resources are in place, and if the legislation is not, it is being worked on very diligently.  The Minister mentioned the issue of Garda numbers and I appreciate the Government is playing catch-up on promises made in the past about Garda numbers.  In view of the alarming rate of serious crimes, however, especially gangland crime, I do not think we should be clapping ourselves on the back for getting the number of garda&iacute; right for a growing population and an increasing incidence of the most serious forms of crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s emphasis is on legally held weapons.  He pointed out in his speech that 1,800 handguns have been licensed, mainly since 2004.  He said there was no public policy decision to bring this about.  However, it did happen under the watch of a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  To suggest it was not a conscious policy decision is not very helpful.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister are responsible for this policy area, and the increase in the licensing of guns and handguns was apparent to them.  The Minister is now saying that Mr. Justice Peter Charleton pointed this out and we have to act.  The reality is that all this information has long been available to the Minister and his predecessor and to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  The Minister indicated that he has introduced proposals to deal with the situation, which include the issuing of no new licences for handguns subject to certain exceptions.  However, this can only be done through legislation, and there is legislation in place.  Where is the legislation?  If the Minister is intent on dealing with this, let us see the legislation and we will deal with the specifics of the proposals he has introduced.</P>
        <P>There are a number of areas of legislation about which the Minister has spoken.  He stated: &ldquo;The Government has approved my proposals for a criminal justice (covert surveillance) Bill, <Col N="147"/>and I have published the general scheme.&rdquo;  Again, we would like to see the Bill.  It has long been known that action was needed in this area and that the existing legislation was antiquated and ineffective.  We are still at the stage of proposals and promises of legislation.  The Minister also speaks about the general scheme of the criminal procedure Bill, giving effect to the legislative aspects of the justice for victims initiative.  Again, we await this Bill.</P>
        <P>The Minister also stated: &ldquo;Work is ... ongoing on the criminal justice (forensic evidence and sampling) Bill which will provide for the establishment of a DNA database for criminal investigation purposes.&rdquo;  This is the one area in which the Government has been particularly negligent.  A DNA database is important for combating crime, especially the more serious forms of crime.  DNA investigation has proven an essential source of material for detecting and prosecuting crime, yet we are still at the stage of drafting a Bill in this regard.  While we are all agreed on the objectives, there is a lack of urgency from the Government and the Minister.  To say that work is ongoing on such important Bills, when we have had announcements of this type of legislation on and off over recent years means we are not moving at the required pace.  I would like to see a bit more urgency in this regard.</P>
        <P>The figures clearly show there has been a significant increase in the number of legally held handguns and firearms in general.  That is an issue that must be considered.  We must have legislation which does not interfere with those who hold these firearms for sporting activities and other genuine reasons.  That is why we need to ensure the precise wording of the Bill allows those pursuing a legitimate sport or interest to continue to do so.</P>
        <P>The killing of Aidan O&rsquo;Kane in East Wall last week was shocking.  The notion that a teenager could gain access to a firearm and kill someone is most disturbing and highlights the question of the source of weapons for those who act illegally.  We must obtain the exact number of legally held firearms that are stolen and elucidate the connection with gangland crime and other serious crime.  It is important to get this legislation right.  I understand where the Minister is coming from in this regard, but we need to see the details of the Bill.  There are figures for stolen firearms, but it appears that since 2005 only 27 handguns have been stolen, some of which were recovered.  The figures for stealing and illegal use of firearms do not jump out at one, as it were.  However, I accept that, overall, it would be a surprise to many people to hear the total number of firearms in the State in 2008 was 232,000.</P>
        <P>It was very helpful of Mr. Justice Charleton to highlight the problem, because he has highlighted other deficiencies and loopholes in criminal law.  I am pleased that on this occasion the Minister is taking heed.  It is unfortunate that Mr. Justice Charleton had to do this before the Government would examine the statistics and figures it had on hand for some years and decide to act.  I hope the issue of the licensing of legally held firearms and the changes in legislation being considered by the Minister do not deflect from the real issue, which is the obtaining of illegal firearms and their use for the most dastardly crimes.  This initiative of the Minister should not deflect from that priority.  I also ask the Minister to take into account some of the ideas that have been put forward by Fine Gael in the draft criminal justice (violent crimes prevention) Bill when he is considering this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important debate on the subject of gun crime.  Crime of any description, especially murder, is deplorable.  The catalyst for this debate was the unfortunate murder of Mr. O&rsquo;Kane in East Wall.</P>
        <P>I live in a very peaceful location in the Mizen peninsula and at this time of Christmas I always ponder the appalling, high profile murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier which occurred half a mile from my home in a peaceful and quiet location.  This murder remains unsolved.  Everyone in that peninsula remembers that appalling murder at Christmas 12 years ago.  I hope that sometime in the near future this murder can be solved and the perpetrator of that appal<Col N="148"/>ling, dastardly, cowardly crime will be found.  This was a woman enjoying her holiday home peacefully at Christmas and she was brutally battered to death outside her home.  My thoughts are with the French family as the event will never be forgotten by those close to her.  I had the opportunity on one occasion to meet that stunning and wonderful lady.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on his wonderful work as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The statistics show that we are winning the battle against crime.  We will never have a Utopian situation with no murders and no guns on the streets but we are winning the battle as proved by the statistics referred to by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Crime statistics for the third quarter of 2008 show a decrease in homicide offences of 57%.  Decreases were also recorded in murder offences, which were down 50%, and dangerous driving leading to death, which was down 85%, with no change in the case of manslaughter offences.  These statistics are a clear indication that the policies and the draconian and powerful legislation introduced by this Government and the previous Government over the past ten or 11 years, are working.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il from 2002 to 2007 and we were being accused from some quarters of bringing in legislation that was too extreme and draconian.  That legislation is now bearing fruit in that there has been a decrease in crime.  I would be the first to say that any murder of any description is appalling.</P>
        <P>I welcome the proposed legislation to curb the use of handguns and to restrict their licensing.  Unless one is a farmer trying to protect stock against marauding dogs or foxes, I do not see the reason for people holding handguns.  The remarks made by Mr. Justice Charleton are to be welcomed.  It is good that senior judges, District Court judges, Members of the Oireachtas or even persons in society who are aware of an issue can offer their comments which are positive and constructive.</P>
        <P>The legislation will make it more difficult to obtain bail for drugs trafficking and firearms offences.  The Government has approved proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce new legislation underpinning the use of covert surveillance methods by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On that point, does the Minister of State envisage that other agencies will be given such powers, such as Customs and Excise when dealing with drugs crimes?  Under this legislation the State will be able to use collateral material obtained by means of covert surveillance as evidence to support or strengthen the case for the prosecution.  I expect this legislation will be strongly challenged in the courts and on constitutional grounds.</P>
        <P>We must be proactive at all times in bringing in legislation because crime is now very sophisticated.  Some of these criminal gangs have the best equipment available.  A young garda told me recently that garda&iacute; are now being trained to use types of weaponry that the criminal mobsters have been using for the past five to seven years.  It is like playing catch-up but I am glad we are succeeding.  I commend the Minister and the Government on the fact that at the beginning of 2009, we will reach that magnificent target of having 15,000 garda&iacute; on the streets, something that could not have been envisaged ten years ago.  This is to be welcomed.  Many of the current garda&iacute; are better trained.  The new recruits from Templemore are more intelligent and sophisticated and a very bright bunch of garda&iacute;.  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the Garda.  One can imagine what Dublin city or any part of Ireland would be like if garda&iacute; were not on patrol.  I compliment the Minister and his predecessor on Operation Anvil.  It is very comforting to us that more than 2,000 guns have been taken off the streets having been confiscated by garda&iacute; in raids, whether in Limerick, Cork or in Dublin.  I hope this continues.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very proactive.</P>
        <P>I see the fight against crime as needing a three-pronged approach.  The Minister leads with his responsibility for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na <Col N="149"/>is the second prong operating on the ground and the third prong is society, something that is overlooked.  Society can sometimes become complacent.  The Minister made a valid point in his speech.  One must take away the reason for the existence of drug lords.  Some people we know are users of drugs.  There may be a decrease in the use of drugs because of the recession, please God, and a decline in the use of cocaine at parties or in clubs by these sophisticated people.  I refer not to the impoverished people who are addicts and who are lying in the streets but rather to the well-heeled members of society who use drugs.  If society actively accepts in any way that we can and should use drugs, the mobsters, warlords and drug lords will prosper as it will be a stimulus to their activities.  We cannot ignore the role of society in the area of drugs.</P>
        <P>The use and importation of drugs brings with them the use of various types of sophisticated weapons such as Glock pistols.  I commend the Minister and the Department and all concerned.  In the past 12 to 15 months, there have been two significant hauls of drugs which may not necessarily have been destined for Ireland but rather for Europe.  One recent haul was in Castletownbere, which case is <i>sub judice</i>, and the other was the famous haul off the Mizen peninsula.  The amount of drugs was alarmingly high.  We are talking not about grams but tonnes of cocaine destined for either the London market or the European market.</P>
        <P>Once society becomes more responsible and stops using drugs, the work and success of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department and the Minister will be more obvious.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  I was impressed by the concern expressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the moderate tone in which he spoke.  We have a large problem with gun crime and the danger is we could bend over backwards in an attempt to solve it and still fail.  One reason we have not been able to fight crime in the past is because we have been too protective of the accused to ensure no one was ever wrongly convicted.  On occasions, we have bent over backwards to protect the accused and the guilty rather than protecting the innocent.  I remember 12 years ago the journalist, Veronica Guerin, spent a day in Leinster House with me and listened to a debate in the Visitors Gallery.  It was three weeks before she was killed.  The criminal laws that we passed until her death were not strong enough because there were many voices of concern about going too far.  After her death, the catalyst which changed matters, we introduced legislation that got the balance a little bit better.  Even in 1996, we were not speaking of the extent of the gun culture we now have.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I was pleased the Minister referred to an &euro;18 million investment in the Garda pathology laboratory to assist in DNA testing and recording.  There will be howls of protest about individual&rsquo;s privacy and data protection but we need this investment.  When I met Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York, he informed me he had introduced DNA testing and a database in New York.  The liberal attitude was negative to this.  In one of the first instances of using DNA testing, however, he was able to prove the accused was not guilty because it was someone else&rsquo;s DNA on the murder weapon.  He used it as an instance to remind us that there are times when legislation, introduced to protect those who might otherwise be innocent, actually saves the wrongfully accused.  We need strong criminal legislation that can be enforced and takes into account the rights of the innocent.</P>
        <P>While the majority of firearms licences are for hunting rifles and shotguns, target shooting also has a long history in Ireland.  In August 1972, the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Des O&rsquo;Malley, made an order under the Firearms Act 1964 that all private, registered pistols and rifles above .22 calibre be handed in for a maximum of one month.  The one-month temporary custody order was extended by successive Governments for 32 years, however, which had a major impact on shooting sports.  The extension of the custody order was only brought to an end in 2004 by a constitutional challenge by a private citizen.  Within three months of the ban <Col N="150"/>being lifted, an Irish target shooting team competed in the Austrian open shooting championship and took six podium places.  A balance needs to be taken into account.  I was pleased the Minister acknowledged his proposed legislation on firearms would take into account shooting sports and may include limited exceptions to the handgun ban for use in Olympic sports.</P>
        <P>The number of handgun licences granted has increased significantly since 2004.  According to Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform figures, of the slightly more than 233,000 firearms licensed in the State, more than 177,000 are for shotguns with rifles accounting for 54,000.  In July 2008, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton said there was a pressing need for drawing together into a clear law the multiple piecemeal rules on the control of handguns.  He said reasonable people were entitled to feel alarmed about a substantial increase in the number of pistols licensed for private use in recent years.</P>
        <P>The increased growth of gun licences, in the four years since the High Court overturned the 30-year ruling banning them, is astonishing.  In addition, 1,263 registered firearms, including 27 handguns, have been stolen since 2003.  Something has to be done about this increase in gun ownership.</P>
        <P>However, the argument that gun murders will go down if there is a ban is irrelevant.  Drug dealers will not worry that their illegally held handgun will have to be handed in at their local Garda station.  In the UK, pistols were banned between 1997 and 1998 yet murder rates increased in the period.  This emphasises the simple fact that civilian ownership of lawfully held firearms has little or no effect on crime rates.</P>
        <P>This debate can easily overlook the root cause of much of the gun crime &mdash; drugs.  Unfortunately, so many drugs get into the country and almost all of the recent drug seizures have happened owing to accidents caused by bad weather, ships breaking down, etc.  Tackling gun crime is inextricably linked to criminal gangs and drugs.  While banning handguns is a media-friendly initiative, there must be a real drive to limit the importation of drugs to stop the power of criminal gangs.  This is the real root problem of gun murders.</P>
        <P>The real problem that must be addressed is not that there are more guns on the streets but that there is more circulation of guns.  One gun may be used by several individuals in several different crimes.  Guns are now often sold on or rented out.  For instance, a weapon used in a shooting in Limerick may be linked to a murder in Dublin or elsewhere.  We need to ensure we are accurately keeping track of these weapons used by several people.  The national ballistics intelligence programme, a police database, was launched this year in the UK to keep track of such weapons.  In America, the integrated ballistics identification system does a similar job.  We must ensure the ballistics section of the Garda technical bureau is given adequate resources in this fight, as good as in other countries, before introducing blanket bans.</P>
        <P>The problem of improvised weapons, that is of replicas converted to fire live ammunition, will become an even larger problem.  This aspect of weapon conversions may be of as much importance as the banning of conventional handguns.  I welcome the moderate tone taken by the Minister but also his tone of concern.  The actions he is taking are in the right direction.  I welcome this debate before the Bill is introduced in the new year.  I hope we will have a chance to go through it and ensure, in doing so, that we save lives.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to the House.  I welcome also this timely debate on gun crime.  There is much public anxiety and a genuine sense of insecurity about the current level of gun crime.  The public is looking for a strong and adequate response.  There is no scope for the legal possession of handguns in this country.  Other Members have said that almost 1,300 guns, included 27 handguns, were reported stolen over the past six years.  Of these, only 373 were recovered.  Operation Anvil against organised <Col N="151"/>crime has seized 1,192 firearms since May 2005.  Many of these weapons fall into the hands of drug criminals who subsequently use them to terrorise, maim and kill in pursuit of their vile trade.  We know of innocent victims who have been highlighted in the media coverage of these terrible gun crimes received.  Some names include Aidan O&rsquo;Kane, who was murdered recently in East Wall, and Donna Cleary.  The list goes on of innocent civilians murdered accidentally or in error.  They die at the hands of those participating in gun crimes.  I back the move by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to bring in an outright ban on handguns.  I disagree with those who argue that legally held guns are not a threat.  From the early 1970s until 2004, handguns were effectively banned as part of the effort to curb the threat of paramilitaries.  Owing to a series of court rulings, this was relaxed and the number of legally held handguns has increased significantly in recent years.  I welcome the <i>de facto</i> ban on issuing new handgun licences which the Minister has introduced.  He is also to be congratulated on his plan to introduce legislation early next year to ban all handguns.</P>
        <P>There are 1,800 legally held handguns in the Republic.  If the current rates of growth in gun licensing are sustained, we could have ownership rates comparable with some US states.  This would be unacceptable in a country that has kept a civilian unarmed police force through many crises.  What we need is better targeting, detection and prevention of crime.  Unfortunately, the majority of gun crimes in this country are drug related.  We have dangerous gangs operating in the country, involved in organised crime, human trafficking and drug trafficking.  It is incumbent on the Government to provide better resources to our police force for the better targeting, detection and prevention of these crimes.</P>
        <P>We need to see prison sentences strengthened.  I call for at least a ten-year sentence for the illegal possession of firearms.  Fewer than one in five gun crimes result in a conviction.  Unfortunately, the figures are disappointingly low.  There was a 17% conviction rate for gun crime in 2003, 18% in 2004, and it fell to 15% in 2005.  I call for the introduction of an absolute ban on the legal possession of handguns.  There is a danger that we are going down the road of an emerging gun culture similar to those we see in some states of the US.  This would not be in the interests of Ireland or our civilian unarmed police force.  For that reason, we need to move quickly.  I support the move by the Minister to introduce an outright ban on handguns and to control the licensing of handguns from this point on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government generally on addressing this serious issue and the urgent need for revised firearms legislation.  There are two facets to this debate which are not mutually exclusive.  These involve the legal private ownership of firearms and the critical issue of how many firearms are in circulation in the criminal community.  I will address private ownership first.</P>
        <P>In July, Mr. Justice Peter Charleton called for urgent reform of what he termed our piecemeal controls on the ownership and use of handguns.  He said that reasonable people were entitled to feel alarmed about a large increase in the number of pistols licensed for private use in Ireland in recent years.  Four years ago, clause 4.1 of the Firearms Act, which had been in place since 1972, was found to be unconstitutional following a challenge from a private citizen.  The clause stated that all private registered pistols and rifles above the .22 calibre should be handed in to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is worth remembering why those handguns were removed from circulation in 1972 and 1973.  I spoke to my father, who was a garda in a Border county at the time.  The measure was taken because of the Troubles and the dangers of handguns entering an inflamed situation.  At the time, all owners were asked to give their handguns to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
<Col N="152"/>
        <P>Since the removal of the clause four years ago, people have been able to carry handguns again.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of private firearms owned by individuals.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform estimates that there are almost 250,000 handguns, rifles and shotguns registered in the State.  The majority doubtless are held by law-abiding upstanding citizens.  I agree with Mr. Justice Charleton that it is troubling that there are so many firearms in the State.</P>
        <P>Of graver concern is the number of handguns.  As it stands, there are 1,800 legal handguns in the State.  I have been contacted by many owners of private handguns.  They have impressed upon me the seriousness with which they take the responsibility of ownership of a handgun.  They told me that they all must undertake training and must be members of an approved and Garda authorised club.  Security measures in their homes must be set up to prevent people robbing the handguns.  We saw 27 handguns stolen from people&rsquo;s houses over recent years.  A further 1,237 other types of firearms were stolen.  We must bear in mind that the removal of these handguns will not solve the problem of legally held firearms entering the criminal world.  That will still exist and must be addressed outside of legislation on handguns.  This point was made by Senator de B&uacute;rca.  I am glad the Minister is making exemptions for Olympic sports.  I ask him to meet members of the private handgun owners clubs to see if some accommodation can be made to allow them to enjoy their pastime.</P>
        <P>I refer to how we tackle gun crime and illegally held firearms.  The erosion of public safety in the face of gun crime and gang law presents a considerable challenge to the security of our citizens.  The idea that people can be shot in broad daylight demands immediate action.  As we respond to the issue of gun crime in our society, we should not concern ourselves with labels of left, right, liberal or conservative.  Ideology does not come into it.  Our commitment should be directed to those policies that will work on the ground.</P>
        <P>I propose a two-pronged strategy.  We must punish to the full extent of the law those criminals who take or threaten to take the lives of others with guns.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the number of shootings in Ireland jumped from 211 in 2003 to 325 last year, an increase of more than 50% in four years.  Any individual in this State who engages in gun crime should be dispassionately subjected to the full extent of the law.  Mandatory sentences for possessing an illegal firearm and lengthy sentences for the discharge of a firearm must be considered.  If we are to be successful in rebalancing the burden of fear away from the innocent member of society and onto the criminal, we must provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with sufficient and adequate resources.  Well-trained community garda&iacute; would ease the pressure on local communities and free up personnel for deployment in areas where they are required.  We must invest in those elite Garda units trained to deal with gun crime and bomb threats.</P>
        <P>In an interview in a recent edition of the <i>Garda Review</i> magazine, Detective Sergeant Higgins, a specialist in ballistics, stated that the workload had increased but the resources available to deal with the workload had remained the same.  Highly trained, specialist units examine murder scenes on a national basis and are recognised as the experts in the field of crime scene interpretation.  These units must be expanded and supported so that their expertise can be used to maximum effect.  There is also need to tackle the roots of gun crime, and this is something Senator Quinn referred to in his contribution.  There is usually a reason for guns and typically it is drugs.  Chief Superintendent Mahon confirmed that there was a substantial and worrying return last year to the importation and distribution of heroin.  Of the &euro;3 million worth of drugs seized in Limerick, some 42% was heroin.  We are all aware of the danger of heroin but drug use and gun crime are closely linked.  We must tackle these issues together.</P>
<Col N="153"/>
        <P>At the top end of the gun crime problem we must punish offenders and send a message that actions directly endangering the lives of citizens will be met by relentless enforcement of the law.  Criminality, especially gun crime, is an ongoing developmental problem and it is essential we tackle the issue at an embryonic stage.  Last month the <i>British Journal of Criminology</i> published a landmark study that comprehensively outlines the link between the criminal behaviour of parents and that of their children.  The study states a father who engages in delinquent acts teaches the skills, norms and values needed to display such anti-social behaviour.  The more time a child spends with a criminal father the greater the probability that he or she will engage in delinquent acts also.  This study was reviewed by peers and published in the <i>British Journal of Criminology</i>.  It found that children of persistent offenders were considerably more likely to commit crimes than those of non-offenders.  The authors also found that children of persistent criminals tended to engage in more delinquent acts in every phase of their lives.  It is imperative that we deploy resources in high crime areas with lower socio-economic demographics.  We need to tackle and punish the perpetrators of crime but it is also our duty to show a generation of potential criminals that there is an alternative way of life.</P>
        <P>Yesterday the head of the Garda inspectorate, Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, stated the Irish could learn from what had happened in Boston where 1,000 people who were in danger of becoming involved in gun crime were identified by police and liaison officers.  They and their families were targeted with a range of community educational resources to fend off any potential transition into crime.  Ms O&rsquo;Toole recommended that we consider something similar.</P>
        <P>If we are serious about targeting gun crime, we need to intervene at all levels.  We need to be tough on the perpetrators of crime.  However, we also need to support and engage with young people who are in danger of turning to crime in the first instance.  The generation of violent criminals on our streets deserve punishment first and rehabilitation later.  A generation is waiting to take their place.  It is prior to lives being ruined and lost that we need to intervene and effect real change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>We are at tipping point with regard to gun crime.  We need a collaborative approach to it rather than expecting the Government and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the matter.  Prevention and intervention are as important as enforcement.  Bullets cannot be repelled with legislation and denunciation.  We need new thinking.  We need to learn from other countries where young people at risk of engaging in gun crime are identified by police and they and their families are targeted with a range of resources to prevent their progress into serious criminality.  We need to mobilise local task forces and perhaps give the go-ahead to the joint policing committees to work with schools, the probation and welfare service and social services to gain access to the homes of young people who could be at risk of becoming involved in gun crime.</P>
        <P>Often, the children concerned are brought up by single mothers trying to make ends meet.  During previous debates on crime I stated we needed to examine our family law legislation, with particular reference to unmarried fathers.  We need to make fathers more responsible for their children and have men in the lives of the children concerned.  It is ridiculous to have time in the courts spent by fathers applying for guardianship of children.  If they were given responsibility for their children from the word go, we would have a far better fabric of society.</P>
        <P>We must not be shy in stating the State must think ahead and intervene.  However, we need to intervene when the young people concerned are in the cradle to keep them out of harm&rsquo;s way.  In this context, we need to examine job creation, literacy programmes, summer camps, extra social services and activities.  I agree with what the Minister stated on tackling gun crime.  However, we are considering it from one end only, as opposed to from the beginning.</P>
<Col N="154"/>
        <P>DNA testing was mentioned and it is absolutely vital.  We also need tougher policing.  In the United Kingdom tougher policing has resulted in a reduction in street crime by 16% since the introduction of the street crime initiative.  This shows the effectiveness of carefully targeted co-ordinated and well resourced policing measures.  Senator Quinn mentioned the increase in the number of murders and gun crime in the United Kingdom, despite strict gun legislation, which is of note.  We can learn from this when we introduce legislation next year.</P>
        <P>The increase in the use of cocaine and its link with gun crime and culture was also mentioned.  We know for a fact and have seen evidence that some of the cocaine sent to Ireland comes with a number of unasked for guns.  It is normal that guns and drugs are given to gangs to be used in continuing their reign of terror.  That is a fact.  We may have lost some of the battles in this regard but should not tolerate the activities of those who think it is smart or sophisticated to use guns.  While many older gangland criminals might be beyond rehabilitation and require a harder policing approach, we must never give up hope the next generation could be engaged and developed.</P>
        <P>I note the recent comments by the head of the Garda inspectorate, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, mentioned by the Minister.  She told the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> that if more garda&iacute; were relieved from court duties, they could spend time on the beat in communities and help prevent gun crime.  This might result in effective intervention in the lives of young people at risk.  It is the type of constructive solution we need.  On Monday last week I was in Wexford District Court and counted 30 garda&iacute; waiting to give evidence; approximately five of the cases ran.  This is a complete waste of time.  I am not sure many gun crimes are committed in the morning but if this statistic is replicated throughout the country, one can see my point.  Valuable time is wasted while files could be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and witnesses interviewed.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the proposed <i>de facto</i> ban on legally held handguns.  The evidence is that many guns are being used to commit crimes in the State and that guns are stolen.  We must tackle this trend through the introduction of controls.  Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s proposal is welcome.</P>
        <P>Although by international standards gun crime is not at the crisis point it has reached in other countries, we must not see this as an excuse to adopt a soft approach.  Laws dealing with gun criminals need to be significantly toughened and the ringleaders need to be taken out of circulation with the youngest placed in secure accommodation, if necessary, or subject to intervention.  Members of the public are afraid of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and we have had a myriad of examples during the year.  Most murders involving the use of guns are gangland related and stem from the use of drugs and the money that can be made from them.  I gather we have had examples of professional gunmen and mercenaries being flown in from abroad to take people out before leaving again.  This is a frightening prospect for us to face as a society.  One can throw all the resources and legislation one wants at the problem of gun crime but more people are using drugs.  Drugs were confined to deprived parts of our cities 20 or 30 years ago and a scourge on the less well-off in society.  However, despite our best efforts, the drugs culture is expanding, as increased numbers of the middle class use them.  Senator O&rsquo;Donovan was hopeful that in these recessionary times drug use would decrease but, unfortunately, the facts prove the opposite.  As greater demand for leisure drugs is generated, more drugs enter the State, drug barons make more money and become more vicious in doing what is necessary to protect their patch.  Citizens must face up to this frightening reality.  The sophistication of the weaponry being used has also been mentioned and it is frightening.  Automatic and semi-automatic handguns are weapons used by foreign armies.</P>
<Col N="155"/>
        <P>Gun crime is largely linked with gangland and drug crimes.  However, last week I heard a story which was a direct replica of a soap opera event on &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo; and played out to the letter in rural Ireland.  We must examine the effect soap operas have on society.  This might seem facetious but it is true and I have heard many examples.  People believe what they see on television is true.  We are approaching Christmas and people are not in the best of form.  They will watch what is happening on &ldquo;Eastenders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;.  The media must take responsibility and stop glamorising crime, particularly gun crime.</P>
        <P>Domestic violence and crime against women need to be mentioned in this debate.  We need to examine our laws on domestic violence and make it easier for women to come forward.  Many crimes are perpetrated against women; we had another horrific example last night.  It was not a gun crime as a knife was used which leads me to believe that even if we remove guns from society, knives will still be in use.  We are at tipping point.  Guns must not become a permanent feature of our landscape.  We need to get rid of them altogether.  I commend the Minister on his bravery and courage in his efforts to do this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to drugs and gun crime, it seems that in many instances, despite the welcome intervention of Mr. Justice Charleton, the Judiciary has ignored the minimum mandatory penalties laid down by the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate, particularly the views expressed by Senator McDonald.  Other speakers have pointed to efforts to curb crime through legislation.  Instead, I intend to focus on the roots of crime.  These types of crimes happen for a reason.  We have seen young teenagers shooting people dead on the streets.  In the United Kingdom, a teenager was convicted in recent days of the murder of Rhys Jones.  This corresponds to the alleged involvement of a young teenager in the awful murder of Aidan O&rsquo;Kane.</P>
        <P>The children who perpetrate these crimes have been known to the authorities for a long time.  They are out of control and identified as at risk.  These types of problems manifest themselves at an early stage within the education system.  I spent 20 years in that system before becoming a Member of this House.  In the mid-1990s, the then president of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, Ms Sally Shields, spoke about identifying children at risk.  Teachers can recognise such children from an early age and are aware of the circumstances of their home environment.  They are not being targeted and helped.  Such support would be to the good of society in general as well as helping the children themselves.</P>
        <P>There must be an interdepartmental effort to deal with the causes and roots of crime, led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science.  There must be engagement with youth groups in an effort to provide alternatives for young people and to keep them off the streets.  In other words, we must save them from themselves.</P>
        <P>Some weeks ago, I visited the schools in the area of Liverpool where Rhys Jones lived.  The problems that are evident there are also evident in the East Wall and in other socially disadvantaged areas in the State.  The reality is that some parents are incapable of parenting, with many of them unable to control their aggressive behaviour towards their children and others.  There is also a small minority of parents who do not want to parent and who allow their children to run wild.  It is time to give up on such parents.  These are harsh words, but when school princi<Col N="156"/>pals and management boards blame parents, it is often a cop-out on the part of the schools.  We know in our heart that such parents will not intervene.</P>
        <P>I have done a considerable amount of research into the issue of underachievement by pupils in disadvantaged areas.  The most remarkable aspect of this is the evidence of great intentions but lack of consistency by parents.  They are available to the children only at certain times.  We are fooling ourselves that we can rely on these people to parent and keep their children off the street and out of trouble.  The only way to ensure a better future for these children is to put in place adequate supports and resources in schools.</P>
        <P>One such resource, which has been cut back in the budget, is the provision of home-school liaison teachers.  Those teachers have an opportunity to see and record the difficulties being experienced by these children in their homes.  The entitlement to the appointment of one of these teachers was removed in the budget for schools other than those designated as disadvantaged under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme.  It is vital to recognise that there are disadvantaged children in every school, even where those schools are in middle class areas.  Such children will now be deprived of this resource.  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure the right supports are in place in all schools.</P>
        <P>An usher told me earlier today that children who are in difficulty can be recognised at an early age through their involvement in sport.  Many of the children who are at risk of being bred into crime have great talents and gifts, but they need special help to realise their  potential.  Above all, they need an alternative curriculum.  One size does not fit all.  I have visited many second level schools as part of my work as a learning consultant.  I was hired privately by the schools to work with children in this situation.  It is a waste of time expecting the traditional junior certificate or leaving certificate, or even the applied leaving certificate programme, to suit them.  It is a waste of time expecting these children to do homework.  I suggested to the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, that provision should be made for a special type of junior and leaving certificate programme for these children, with a minimum of five subjects and an emphasis on practical learning.  They could choose subjects they enjoy and which tie in with their interests and strengths and make them feel purposeful and meaningful.  This is the way to keep them off the streets and make crime less attractive.</P>
        <P>The Government must consider putting in place these types of alternatives for youngsters who are at risk.  This is consistent with the views recently expressed by the head of the Garda inspectorate and former head of the Boston police force, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, that we must identify at-risk young people and target resources accordingly.  We must invest in after-school clubs and alternatives that build on their strength.  We must make these children feel useful.  I know children like these in Galway city.  I know, as do many other educators, how to devise a programme to assist them, in conjunction with community garda&iacute; and the juvenile justice system.  Some of these individuals can be saved.</P>
        <P>The glamorisation of crime on television through detective shows and otherwise, and in computer games, is also an issue.  Perhaps it is time to issue warnings before and after such television shows, in the same vein as the warnings on cigarette packets, to indicate that they are bad for one&rsquo;s health.  We must examine the effect of that type of glamorisation on young people.</P>

We have been fortunate to avoid some of the spectacular and hideous crimes in other jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.  Elsewhere, we all recall the incidents in Dunblane and Finland.  There have been many high profile cases of gun crimes in schools in which many young people have been killed and seriously injured.  There are many strong arguments for why we should avoid going down the road of encouraging people to become acquainted, particularly at an early age, with guns and other weapons.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to include in the legislation provisions for the control of the proliferation of knives.  Many crimes, including many murders, are committed using knives as weapons.  Some young people carry knives as status symbols.  The problem with young people, and we were all young at one time, is that they get into an altercation of some kind, if they are carrying a weapon it tends to be used and what would have been a minor incident becomes a very serious one.</P>
        <P>I note the provision in the legislation for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for such offences.  I welcome that even though, as was pointed out by Senator McDonald, the minimum sentence that applies to the possession of drugs is not always enforced.  Also, mandatory life imprisonment for murder invariably is much less than a life sentence and we must examine that.  In that regard, and I have mentioned this issue many times in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I want to raise two issues.  First, a judicial council is overdue and I hope the Judiciary is not an impediment to the establishment of such a council.  I would like a debate on that at some stage in the House.  It happens in other jurisdictions and the Executive would not have any input other than a peer review of the conduct of the Judiciary.  That is an important issue.</P>
        <P>Second, in her interesting contribution Senator McDonald referred to parental responsibility in this area, which is essential.  I agree fully with that.  Children need the influence and controls of a mother and father.  I would be opposed to any diminution of the unique status of marriage in our Constitution.  It should not be downgraded in any way or any other relationship put parallel to it.  That is the reason I oppose the model of civil partnership from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I hope it will be modified to reflect the important role marriage plays, particularly in terms of ensuring that those of the next generation are good citizens because of the good influence of both their fathers and mothers.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Chathaoirleach as seans a thabhairt dom cr&iacute;och a chur leis <Col N="158"/>an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm nach bhfuil mor&aacute;n ama agam, ach d&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; mo dh&iacute;cheall.  Ar son an Aire Dl&iacute;  agus Cirt, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas do ghach &eacute;inne a labhair ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</P>
        <P>Gun crime is a matter that has been addressed seriously by all sides of the House.  Organised crime and drug related crime are inextricably linked, as has been pointed out.  The Minister has reiterated that he attaches the highest priority to tackling these types of crime and bringing to justice those involved in such activities.  One of the main priorities he has set for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for next year is to target gun, organised and drug related crime through a range of measures.  Chief among these measures is the use of the Garda specialist units and targeted operations such as Operation Anvil.</P>
        <P>This is a time when the public finances are under pressure.  Nevertheless, the Minister will continue to give top priority to front-line policing.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from &euro;20 million to &euro;21 million to enable it continue with targeted disruption of serious and organised criminal activity.  Other key operations will be maintained throughout 2009, and any savings that have to be made will not be allowed to diminish front-line policing.</P>
        <P>In regard to bail, the Bail Act tightened up the bail regime generally.  The Criminal Justice Act 2007 introduced new provisions designed to tighten up the granting of bail.  For example, a person could be required to provide a statement of his or her means, previous criminal record and details of any offences committed while previously on bail. The law takes a serious view of offences committed while on bail.  It is mandatory that a sentence for such an offence is consecutive on the sentence for the first offence.  Committing an offence while on bail is to be regarded as an aggravating factor.  Failure to answer to bail is to be regarded as an offence committed while on bail.</P>
        <P>The granting of bail is a matter for the courts.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the performance of his functions, represents the State for the purpose of dealing with such applications.  The Minister is keeping under review what is actually happening and whether anything more needs to be done.  He will examine in particular whether the changes in the 2007 Act, which are not long in place, are bringing about an improvement in the position.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding what Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said about the surveillance Bill, it is envisaged that the powers of the Bill can be exercised by senior members of the Defence Forces as well as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Regarding community garda&iacute;, in which we are all interested in terms of our own constituencies, they provide an extremely important point of contact between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  At the end of October, the total personnel strength of the force was 14,247.  Of these, 695, or almost 5%, were community garda&iacute;.  This represents an increase of 59% since the end of 2005.  It must be stressed that community policing involves more than just a single unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As a former teacher I relate to what Senator Healy Eames said in terms of targeting resources at children at risk.  I mentioned that recently on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; when I spoke about the subject of gun crime.</P>
        <P>In this discussion we must bear in mind the rehabilitation of prisoners for long-term justice.  The prison and probation services provide a range of rehabilitative programmes with the aim of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.  More than 250 prison service posts and in excess of 90 workshops operate in our prisons, actively catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.  Educational services are now available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Prison Service is developing and rolling out a fully co-ordinated integrated sentence management system across all prisons and places of detention.  This system is being piloted in <Col N="159"/>two prisons currently and the lessons learned from the evaluation of the pilot will inform the continued roll-out to all other institutions.</P>
        <P>This has been an important debate and I know Members expect that action will follow from it. I assure them that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken careful note of all suggestions with a view to improving efficiency in our justice system.</P>

       <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  I also thank him for his forbearance during this session and accommodating many of the important issues I have raised.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue, waiting lists in Letterkenny General Hospital and access to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, in the House on 8 May.  There appears to be a problem in County Donegal.  The statistics show that four out of every ten people waiting for an operation for longer than 12 months are either in Letterkenny, Sligo or Limerick and that six out of every ten are awaiting a procedure in Letterkenny General Hospital, Sligo General Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  Regardless of how one looks at the statistics, Letterkenny is on the hit list for the longest possible waiting times for patients.</P>
        <P>When I raised this issue previously, I thought people might not be aware of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and strongly advocated its use.  I must declare my interest because a member of my family successfully used the NTPF in recent months.  I continue to advocate its use.  After three months on a surgical waiting list a person is entitled to either self-refer or have his or her general practitioner or hospital refer him or her to the fund.  I was under the impression that patients were not being referred and was blaming the wrong people in some respects.  Then I was told people were offered the NTPF but were not prepared to take up the offer.  However, I was also told that, in the case of Letterkenny General Hospital, unless one was waiting for more than nine months or one year, one did not qualify for the NTPF.  The reason it was doing this was to get rid of the long waiting lists.  The reality is that people in my part of the country are being treated differently from people in others.  If I am on the waiting list of a hospital for more than three months in another part of the country, I can be referred to the NTPF.</P>
        <P>I am seeking clarity on this issue.  If there are consultants with particularly long waiting lists and others within the same discipline who do not have long lists, what can the Department do to encourage general practitioners to direct their patients to the consultants with the shorter lists?  There should be more discussion between general practitioners, consultants and the HSE about the difficulties.  I am aware that meetings take place but my experience is that when I make pronouncements calling on people to use the NTPF and state, from personal experience, that it is wonderful, I will receive a telephone call from somebody who has been told they will have to wait one year for their operation or that their child&rsquo;s urgently needed operation will not be carried out in the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>It is wrong, when so much Government funding is being put into this very good scheme, that people in my constituency are being forced to go private.  The need to opt for private care <Col N="160"/>should have been abolished the day the NTPF was established.  I am a strong advocate for the NTPF but there should be fair play.  If there is an internal war between one side and another with regard to who has these long lists and why they are so long, the patient should not suffer.  People in County Donegal are being discriminated against.  They do not have the same access to the NTPF as others.  That is the basic tenet of my argument.</P>
        <P>I am seeking clarity on this issue.  I might be wrong and would be happy if people were able to correct me, but the evidence does not indicate it.  In recent weeks Letterkenny General Hospital topped the list of hospitals with the longest waiting times.  I have told people they can self-refer or ask their general practitioner to send them to a different consultant in an effort to speed up matters but the statistics are clear.  I accept they are improving.  When I raised this issue previously, there were 2,900 people in the country waiting for longer than 12 months but now the figure is only 1,846.  However, if I was one of the 1,846, I would like to know when I would be operated on and would also like to think I would not stop somebody else having an operation.</P>
        <P>The NTPF chief executive, Mr. Pat O&rsquo;Byrne, has been quoted as saying many are waiting needlessly.  Why are they waiting needlessly?  What can we do to ensure the system is better streamlined?  Wherever the blockage is, be it with consultants, hospital administrations or people within the NTPF, it must be removed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to reply on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Senator Keaveney and the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to address this important matter.</P>
        <P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund was established to tackle the issue of excessive waiting times for hospital treatment for public patients.  The fund has been very successful in fulfilling this remit and arranged treatment for some 135,000 patients to date.  It is on target to arrange treatment for a total of 37,000 patients in 2008.  On average, public patients are waiting 2.9 months for their operation, down from two to five years before the NTPF was established.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this success, there remain a number of hospitals in which there are significant numbers of patients waiting for more than 12 months for treatment.  The Minister has asked the NTPF and the HSE, working together, to give this issue particular attention.  As a result of the efforts made by both organisations during 2008, the total number of persons waiting over 12 months has been reduced by 60%, from 4,594 in October 2007 to 1,846 in November this year.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure waiting lists reflect the numbers in a position to avail of treatment when it is offered to them.  This includes offers of treatment via the NTPF, given that this is a statutory body which is provided with significant funding to facilitate treatment of public patients.  The Minister has, therefore, asked the HSE to ensure there is consistent and active management of waiting lists.  The NTPF, working with representatives of both the HSE and voluntary hospitals, has drawn up the national guidelines for management of inpatient and day case waiting list data which provide a basis for a consistent approach.</P>
        <P>At this point, the problem of particularly long waiting times for patients is largely confined to a small number of hospitals.  Five hospitals &mdash; Letterkenny General Hospital, Sligo General Hospital, Temple Street Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital and Cork University Hospital &mdash; account for some 60% of those waiting over 12 months for surgery.  While substantial reductions have been achieved, the latest returns from the two hospitals in the north west, Sligo General Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital, show that there are still 337 and 316 patients, respectively, waiting over 12 months for surgery.</P>
<Col N="161"/>
        <P>In line with the requirement to focus particularly on those who have been waiting for excessive periods, the NTPF has asked the HSE and the hospitals concerned to accord priority to facilitating the treatment of these patients.  The Minister supports this approach.  The fund has the resources to arrange treatment for these patients and wishes to see the hospitals concerned referring their longest waiting patients in order that treatment can be arranged for them.  Treatment is free of charge and in most cases can be arranged within weeks.  It makes sense to ensure there is a concentration on this group ahead of persons who have not been waiting as long for treatment.  The fund also arranges treatment for patients waiting for under 12 months in these hospitals.</P>
        <P>In 2008 to date, 974 Letterkenny General Hospital patients have been referred and treated under the NTPF, 260 in the last two weeks.  This is progress, but it has to be said the NTPF could have treated substantially more patients had more referrals been made.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I emphasise a recent initiative by the Minister.  In approving the HSE&rsquo;s service plan for 2009, the Minister indicated her particular concern about patients having to wait a long time for hospital treatment.  She said the HSE needed to give consideration, where necessary, to directing co-operation with the NTPF, including through the imposition of financial penalties for hospitals failing to refer patients who could benefit from NTPF-funded treatment.  A long delay in treatment for public patients, when treatment is actually available, cannot be excused.  If it takes financial penalties on hospitals to drive home this point, so be it, but we hope this would not be necessary.  The Minister looks forward to continued effective co-operation between the NTPF, the HSE and individual hospitals in order that the unnecessary and unacceptable situation where people are waiting for 12 months and more for surgery will be eliminated.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the honesty of the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  In May this year, 400 people had been waiting for more than 12 months for treatment at Letterkenny General Hospital.  While the figure stood at 316 in December, the decrease is not significant when one considers that 260 patients can be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund in two weeks.  While I commend the efforts being made to address this problem, I reiterate that some type of obstacle is preventing those waiting longest from being called for treatment.  It is this that is stymieing use of the facility to refer those waiting for three months to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, as is done elsewhere in the country.  I ask all those concerned to ensure this matter is addressed and patients do not suffer as a result of a geographical bias. </P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Finance to outline the plans he has, if any, to put pressure on banks to make more funds available to small businesses.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware that the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service met representatives of the banks, the Small Business Association and Irish Hotels Federation on Tuesday.  The groups could not have put more diametrically opposed views.  The message from the meeting was simple.  On the one hand, the banks stated they continue to lend money to small businesses as they have always done while, on the other, small businesses argued that this was simply not the case.  Perhaps there is a question about who one believes but few people are in doubt that they do not believe the banks.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State will have noted from her constituency, a chorus of protest is coming from small business.  Deputies, Senators and the media are hearing small businesses squealing because they are being squeezed by the banks and not being given the type of facilities they received in the past.  Businesses are not making up this for the sake of amusing themselves.</P>
<Col N="162"/>
        <P>Approximately 1.1 million are employed in small businesses.  The number of small businesses stood at 250,000 in January 2008 but may have declined to approximately 240,000 as a result of the credit squeeze and economic circumstances.  The small business sector is more vital for the economy than the banks which are depriving business of funds.  It is imperative that the Government is not a spectator in the crisis which has hit small business.  Although it does not have money to lend to small businesses, the Government must not invite various organisations to the Oireachtas to bleat and act as a spectator as the banks come here and claim they are lending a large amount of money.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that the Government&rsquo;s role in this matter is one of arbiter and catalyst and that it recognises the needs of small businesses and finds out immediately which side is telling the truth.  Both sides cannot be telling the truth and if the Government finds out it is the banks which are not telling the truth, it is not beyond its power to expose them.  Never has a Government been in a potentially more powerful position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the banks than it is today.  It has two nominees on the board of each of the six banks participating in the guarantee scheme.  These individuals are accountable to the Government for the behaviour of the banks and can, if they so wish, put irresistible pressure on the banks to behave in a manner that is in the interests of the economy.  Whatever about the past, banks now have an obligation to the economy as well as to their shareholders.  This is acknowledged by the banks, as a representative of the AIB did at the meeting of the joint committee on Tuesday.</P>
        <P>It appears the banks are not lending to small businesses because they have lent so much money to developers they do not have money left to lend to small business.  It is also apparent that they will not get their money back from developers whom they are not pushing hard because they are frightened they will make them bankrupt.  As a result, money which could have been lent to solvent small businesses providing major employment is not available.  These businesses are starved of funds and some will go under.</P>
        <P>While I have not examined specific complaints made by small businesses, there are so many of them they must be true.  Many companies complain that all they lack is working capital.  These are healthy businesses which have always operated on the basis that the banks provide them with working capital to tide them over weekends, months, etc.  They cannot access capital because the banks will not give them money and businesses are not paying each other.</P>
        <P>A problem has arisen in the area of prompt payments from one business to another.  An even greater problem has arisen because some of the larger chains, particularly UK companies, are not paying small businesses.  Thriving businesses are starved of cash as a result because they are not being paid by their large customers.  They need the banks to lend them money, even if only on a temporary basis, or they will go under.  Thriving businesses, which could easily survive if the banks lent them funds on a short-term basis, will go under for no good reason.  In the meantime banks are storing capital, calling in large sums from small businesses and not offering them the facilities they should be given.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give the House an assurance that profitable businesses under temporary pressure will be able to survive because the Government will force the banks to give them the funds they need to remain commercial.  I make this plea on behalf of healthy businesses, rather than those which are not profitable or commercially viable.  Failing this, healthy businesses will go under.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarieHoctorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy M&aacute;ire Hoctor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I thank Senator Ross for the opportunity to discuss this important matter. </P>
        <P>When the Government introduced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme its objectives were to maintain the stability of the financial system in its contribution to the normal <Col N="163"/>functioning of the economy and safeguard the interest of the taxpayer.  The prompt and decisive action on the part of this Government has been very successful.  Irish banks have continued to do business and people and businesses have been able to deposit with financial institutions with confidence.</P>
        <P>The Government recently decided on an approach to the recapitalisation of banks.  The objective is to ensure the long-term sustainability of the banking sector.  Increased capital will provide a buffer against losses if they occur and will underpin its contribution through the availability of credit to individuals and businesses in the real economy.  While there is likely to be some tightening of credit standards on the part of banks owing to the uncertain international and domestic outlook, the Government&rsquo;s actions should help to encourage the flow of funds to the economy and limit the impact of financial market difficulties on businesses and individuals.  The availability of finance is a critical element of Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness and a key part of our national economic infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and the T&aacute;naiste have been in regular contact with banks regarding the flow of lending to small business.  Institutions covered by the guarantee have been asked to consider the contribution they could make to the economy through credit initiatives for SMEs.  Following that, several institutions recently announced significant financial lending packages to assist SMEs.  In addition, the European Investment Bank is in discussions with four Irish banks about its recently announced &euro;30 billion loan facility to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks.  These important developments are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware of the importance of the SME sector, which employs approximately 800,000 people, to our economic prosperity.  Our indigenous sector will be critical if we are to return to the levels of prosperity achieved in recent years.  We will need to foster the emergence of significant numbers of new indigenous businesses that are export driven and sustainable.  We will only be able to foster the emergence of such enterprises if the operating environment for business, particularly small businesses, is supportive.  This has been, and will continue to be, a key focus of Government policy.</P>
        <P>The Government will also use whatever other instruments are available to support business.  Access to finance has traditionally been a difficulty for SMEs at start up and development phases.  All financing options for viable businesses need to be explored and exploited in the future.  Grant, seed capital and business expansion schemes and venture capital arrangements all contribute positively to SMEs financial requirements.  The Government&rsquo;s &euro;175 million investment in venture capital funds, promoted through Enterprise Ireland, has resulted in seven new venture funds which have raised over &euro;500 million and is available for investment in the Irish SME sector.</P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies are focused on helping Irish businesses through the current economic difficulties to develop and grow their exports by continuing to prioritise investment in science, technology and innovation and providing financial and non-financial supports to small businesses.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place policies and programmes that encourage the emergence of new business creations and facilitate long-term business survival, including the positioning of our tax system as one of the most supportive of business in the world, the development of Ireland as a knowledge-based economy through the dedication of significant Exchequer resources to the promotion of research and development, the introduction of the better regulation programme to tackle regulatory burdens, particularly those faced by the business community and acting on the report of the small business forum which provided a blueprint for the further development of the sector.</P>
        <P>Some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations implemented to date include increases in the VAT cash accounting and VAT registration turnover thresholds introduced to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small businesses.  Small companies are <Col N="164"/>now permitted to calculate their preliminary tax payments based on 100% of the prior period tax liability if their tax liability for the prior period did not exceed a threshold of &euro;200,000.  New companies which do not expect their tax liability for the first year to exceed &euro;200,000 are no longer obliged to pay preliminary tax in that first year.  The most recent Finance Bill introduced tax relief measures for start-up businesses by way of remission in corporation tax and capital gains tax in the first three years for new and start-up businesses.  These measures will help to grow small business and promote an entrepreneurial culture.</P>
        <P>The extended international credit crunch which Ireland and virtually the whole world are experiencing should remind us of the pivotal role the financial system plays in the economy and conduct of business.  We must find a path through these difficult times and I am confident that all in the House today want to assist in this task.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the following question in view of the fact that the Minister of State has said nothing and I will give evidence for that.  Phrases such as &ldquo;The T&aacute;naiste has been in regular contact&rdquo;, &ldquo;Institutions have been asked to consider&rdquo;, &ldquo;They are in discussions&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Government is well aware&rdquo; and &ldquo;focus&rdquo;, which appears twice, mean nothing.  The Minister of State says the Government will explore, exploit and encourage, but what is it going to do?  </P>
        <P>This reply indicates that no one in government is aware of the fact that a crisis is taking place.  It is asking people to consider and focus, but what is it going to do?  Small businesses will go bust next week, during Christmas week.  What will the Government do to push banks to ensure money is released to viable small businesses?  It should not simply ask them to consider doing something.  The Government has powers to force such things to happen.  Will the Minister of State tell us what the Government will do, not what it thinks?</P>

After that, the lending of funds to commercial enterprises and small businesses is a matter for the banks concerned.</P>
        <P>I am aware of at least one bank which indicated clearly to me recently that it was open for business and for small and medium enterprises.  Ulster Bank made it clear it has changed its policy.  I cannot speak for other banks.  The Government has made every effort but it cannot decide who receives a loan and who does not.</P>
