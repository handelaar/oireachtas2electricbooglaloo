	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to amend the current structure of the building and planning process for school building projects in light of ongoing delays and constant stalling for schools involved in building projects, in particular, Dromclough national school, Listowel and Rahan national school, Mallow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Corrigan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide details of the planned expenditure of the additional &euro;50 million provided for disabilities in budget 2008 and to indicate if a requirement for service quality and guidelines for management of allegations of non-accidental injury and abuse will be included in all new service agreements between the HSE and disability service providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator MacSharry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene to review and revise the cancer care strategy to ensure that cancer care services at Sligo General Hospital, including breast surgical and diagnostic procedures, are maintained and enhanced.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Education and Science to reverse the exorbitant price increase in school transport.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with <Col N="1698"/>responsibility for voluntary housing to review with the Department of Health and Children the need for having a medical support or medical dimension incorporated in the voluntary housing scheme given the age profile of the occupants.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I  have selected the matters raised by  Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Corrigan and MacSharry and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators McFadden and Keaveney may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Defamation Bill 2006 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of tributes to a former Member; No. 3, Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Bill 2008 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1; and No. 2, Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3 but not earlier than 7.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, at the conclusion of the Order of Business, to take tributes from party leaders and constituency colleagues on the death of a former Member of this House, Kit Ahern, to conclude no later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>When the three reports on the situation at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise and the management of the crisis there were issued last week, I asked the Leader for a debate as soon as possible.  Will he confirm whether that debate will take place this week?  It is critical that we have an opportunity to discuss the details in the Fitzgerald report, which I hope everyone will read, and the questions that arise in regard to ministerial responsibility.  Members on all sides of the House have spoken of their concern about how the Health Service Executive is doing its work.  This report offers no reassurance in this regard.  If it offers us a bird&rsquo;s eye view into how the HSE is being managed, the need for reform is clear.  We must have a debate as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader agree to a debate on the economy in light of recent headlines and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments on economic developments yesterday, notwithstanding his placing of the blame on the United States economy?  It is interesting how, when everything is going well, we are told that Fianna F&aacute;il created the boom but, when it is not going so well, we are told that the economy is determined by factors outside the Government&rsquo;s control.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="1699"/>Cowen, is awarding himself a substantial salary increase, thus bringing his salary to more than twice that of the United States Secretary of the Treasury, the least we should expect is that he come to this House for a debate.  The Central Bank issued a warning yesterday that our competitiveness has slipped again, by some 5%.  Competitiveness has decreased by 17% under successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments and by at least 5% under the watch of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>There are actions the Government can take to address this.  Members of this House have a range of experiences and should be allowed to participate in a debate on how best to manage the changes in the economy.  Nobody wants to see record numbers of people signing on the dole.  The number in receipt of social welfare has risen to the highest level in eight and half years.  I would like the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to come to the House to discuss the economy so we can consider all the factors of concern to the public.  Many people are worried about house prices, for example.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader consult the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the Garda retirement age of 60, and then update the House on the matter?  A number of studies, including one compiled by Dr. Maurice Hayes, have concluded that there is a brain drain at top levels of Garda management.  The House could examine this issue in the context of the serious levels of crime in this country.  Senator Mary White has pointed out that the police retirement age in other countries is between 63 and 65.  The report that has been made available to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be examined and a decision should be made on this issue.  It is ironic that some garda&iacute;, who want to extend their period of service in the force, have asked the Equality Authority to assess whether an Act that was introduced by this Government applies to them.  Perhaps the Leader will raise this matter with the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue on which the Chair allowed Senator Harris to make a lengthy intervention a week or so ago.  It is a matter of great importance to standards of honesty, decency and justice in this country.  It is fundamental to the well-being of a number of people in Ireland and abroad.  I hope the Chair will allow me a gracious degree of latitude.  I refer to the film, &ldquo;Fairytale of Kathmandu&rdquo;, which purports to document the exploitation of young men in Nepal by the Donegal poet Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh.  Having seen this work, I have grave concerns about the motives and methods employed.  It is proposed to transmit the film on RTE tonight.  As public money has been spent on the film, we are entitled to know the truth wherever it leads.  Therefore, I call for its exhibition to be <Col N="1700"/>postponed until a full investigation by those qualified in the analysis of film has established the truth or falsehood of the techniques used in its production and the conclusions reached in it.  The correct forum for such an investigation is the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>An attempt has been made to create such a firestorm of hostile publicity that justice may never retrospectively be done.  This film was selectively leaked to quarters where, it was calculated, it would do most damage and most dangerously inflame opinion.  The subject of the film has been tried, sentenced and crucified already.  What of the youths involved?  Despite pious protests, they have been most callously exposed in a dangerously homophobic society and then left to sink or swim on their own.  I am aware of the existence of a smear campaign against anyone who dares to raise his or her voice to ask these questions.  I am aware also of the possible damage that may be caused to my standing in the community I love.  I have chosen to make this intervention in what I consider to be the most appropriate place &mdash; the free Parliament of the Irish people &mdash; because I love justice and truth even more than I fear any misunderstanding of my motives in so doing.</P>
        <P>While it has been denied, it is clear that systematic creative editing has taken place.  For example, the most disturbing image in the film is a sequence showing Mr. &Oacute; Searcaigh lovingly straightening the tie of what appears to be a 14 or 15 year old schoolboy with a satchel on his back.  While Narang is indeed boyish looking, he is a 20 year old physics student in a third level college.  His words need to be heard.  He was over the age of 18 when the film was made.  In an interview voluntarily given, he alleges he was told he had been abandoned by Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh.  He was naturally angry.  He claims to have been pressurised into giving the answers the film-makers wanted.  He has since said: &ldquo;They make me say things, they twist their questions and make me say Cathal was not a good man&rdquo;.  Is Narang&rsquo;s voice to be smothered?  The owner of the copyright has never been contacted for permission to use extracts from Mr. &Oacute; Searcaigh&rsquo;s poetry in the film.  He has now refused permission for the broadcast of material to which he owns the copyright.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Gloriously, the artists of Ireland have supported Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh as they previously did in the case of Oscar Wilde.  This is because they have a unique insight into the processes of works of creation and destruction.  I wish to make it clear that I support the brave letter sent by the artists to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  When I saw the film, my stomach sank and I thought of the words of the great British poet, William Blake:</P>
        <P LI="1">O Rose, thou art sick!</P>
        <P LI="1">The invisible worm</P>
        <P LI="1">That flies in the night,</P>
        <P LI="1">In the howling storm,</P>
        <P LI="1">Has found out thy bed</P>
        <P LI="1">Of crimson joy;</P>
        <P LI="1">And his dark secret love</P>
        <P LI="1">Does thy life destroy.</P>

	<P>Senator, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for this film to be referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources so that the truth can be established with the assistance of experts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given the Senator time.  The programme is a matter for the RTE Authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The illegality is possibly a matter for this House.  Communications is an appropriate matter for the committee established by both Houses of the Oireachtas to examine such matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can raise that with the Chair of the relevant committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept your ruling but I ask the Leader to ensure this matter is referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I, and I believe others, share the concerns expressed about how Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh has been treated by some sections of the media in recent weeks.  I agree with remarks made in this House last week that an extraordinary suggestion appeared to have been made that <Col N="1702"/>his poetry should be taken off the leaving certificate syllabus.  I disagree with that.  It is not appropriate for this House to become embroiled in a consideration on whether RTE should broadcast a programme.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I said to Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate that a committee of the Oireachtas should take on itself the role of deciding whether a programme should be broadcast.  If there are concerns about illegality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is to identify the truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry but I did not interrupt anybody.  I have great sympathy with the position Senator Norris has taken in regard to this case but it is not appropriate that this House or a committee of the Oireachtas should determine what RTE broadcasts.  That would be a step too far.</P>
        <P>We have had debates on integration and the Minister of State came to the House for an interesting preliminary debate on integration.  However, it is time we moved away from speeches, from essentially theorising about what integration is and from discussing the experiences of other countries and so on, and considered practical measures which could be taken by the Government to ensure a higher degree of integration in respect of students and young people, particularly in our education system.</P>
        <P>A timely statement was made by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland.  It pointed out that at the very heart of any integration policy must be language support in schools.  It correctly criticised the Department for failing to properly resource the teaching of English to young students in schools to help counter racism which, of course, is a much more complex question.  However, nothing is more important than language and the teaching of language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 1,800 teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It pointed out that newcomer students get two hours of English lessons per week.  Senator Keaveney might respond to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>She is not the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>She was getting very exercised.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding that they get two hours of English lessons per week, they must spend the rest of the day struggling to <Col N="1703"/>understand what teachers are saying in science class and elsewhere.  This statement came from teachers involved in schools and who know what they are talking about.</P>
        <P>It is entirely inadequate that the teachers who provide these lessons get only one day&rsquo;s training.  We do not have adequate provision of English language teaching in our schools.  Far more work needs to be done in that regard and we need more resources.  Let us have another debate on integration but not at a theoretical level discussing the experiences of other countries, interesting and all as that is.  It should focus on how we can practically support the teaching of English to newcomer students in our schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Binge drinking has been defined as five drinks in one sitting for a man and four drinks for a woman.  The latest EU survey states that 34% of Irish people are usually binge drinkers and that Ireland is followed by England as having the highest level of binge drinking in Europe.  The number of off-licenses in Ireland has increased from 600 to 1,800 in seven years.  The EU barometer survey conducted in 2007 found that Irish households spend three times more on alcohol than those in other European countries.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has said the problem with alcohol is not just a youth issue and that adults are four times more likely to commit public order offences while under the influence of alcohol.  I could continue to list statistics for the rest of the hour.</P>
        <P>As soon as the group set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the issue of alcohol has reported at the end of this month, we should ask the Minister to come to the House to debate alcohol abuse.</P>
        <P>On 8 and 9 May there will be an investment conference in the North that will attract many businesses.  As Deputy spokesperson on Northern Ireland, and as one who lives in Donegal, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to discuss how we can maximise the potential from any such conference in respect of regional development and cross-Border co-operation on job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The second part of a documentary on Frank Shortt on RTE last night showed how the Morris tribunal exposed perjury by two detectives in this case.  Will the Leader refer the matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  Perjury is a criminal offence but when are people prosecuted for it?  Truth in the D&aacute;il is essential to democracy, and in the courts and tribunals to the administration of justice.  One often hears of cases being referred from the civil court to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Numerous affidavits are sworn on oath yet there was only one example of proceedings concerning perjury in 2004 and again in <Col N="1704"/>2005, four in 2006 and two in 2007.  There was one successful prosecution for perjury in 2004 and one in 2007.  Those figures indicate that even if someone lies through his or her teeth there is no fear of prosecution.  This is an important issue.  It appears that this crime is not viewed seriously and the Minister should reflect on and review it.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate here and for the Minister to address the issue specifically.</P>

        <P>Goodwill for the language is visible everywhere.  The groups I have mentioned do great work and I speak Irish to at least 25 or 30 Senators here every day, likewise to Deputies.  It is a great pity that if one speaks on a serious issue in Irish the media is almost certain to ignore one.  That is a pity.  We have done much good work with the new legislation and the status of Irish in Europe.  Good work is being done in the schools, but the breakthrough must now be achieved in the recognition of Irish when people use it in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would ensure an opportunity for publicity when statements are made through Irish, whether in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that we need the Minister for Finance to come to the House.  I hope he will be in the House to debate the Finance Bill tomorrow and the day after.  Obviously that is a Bill that contains much detail and Senators will be going through it.  However, we need the Minister to address the House separately because of the changing economy.  It has turned around quite dramatically, something not seen in a western European country for quite a time.</P><Col N="1705"/>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be asked also to come to the Seanad.  There is one area on which we need a mature debate to try and turn the economy around, namely, technology.  I shall not again go through the three components needed to promote this area: education, broadband infrastructure and investment techniques.  However, I shall make a few comments that might be helpful.  We do not have sufficient incubation services for small to medium-sized enterprises as regards technology.  We do not have the proper Government investment schemes in place and I was disappointed by this year&rsquo;s budget in terms of tax incentives, etc. for the promotion of technology.  Banks do not give the funding to these technology companies that they did previously.</P>
        <P>I have come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny and I believe we need to work more proactively through the EU.  The joint technology initiative for embedded computer systems is a very important area because the volume of embedded computer systems which will be in existence by 2010 will be equivalent to three times the population of the world, and Ireland needs to have its share of that.  There is a joint technology investment technique within the EU for this area, yet Ireland contributes only &euro;1 million towards it.  That simply is not good enough.  We need to do more in the area.</P>
        <P>I genuinely welcome yesterday&rsquo;s comments by the Taoiseach on the alcohol debate, in particular his response that people who enjoy mature consumption of alcohol can contribute to the debate.  He was not against social drinking or anyone enjoying themselves, he said that if one is into that agenda, one is going nowhere.  I suggest the Leader of the House is going nowhere on this issue.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at the issue of the retirement age for garda&iacute;.  I call for a general debate on age in Irish society, not just simply in terms of restrictive employment practices, etc. but in terms of its wider parameters.</P>
        <P>Last night in Cork I attended the three-hour testimonial to Dan Donovan, one of the stalwarts of Cork theatre in Irish and English.  I was struck by the fact that during a three-hour show everyone on stage was over 75.  They each had to work up six or seven plays and memorise them all, and none of them fluffed his or her lines or showed any signs of physical wear and tear.  All their brains were working well.  It was striking that the audience was full of young people who appreciated the show because it crossed the generations.  That used to happen in every Irish village long <Col N="1706"/>ago.  Michael Collins strikingly sought out older men and women to speak to and indeed &mdash; it is not a late conversion on my part &mdash; all the people I admired in RTE were then in their seventies when I arrived there.</P>
        <P>It seems ridiculous that a male or female garda who has been accumulating intelligence, wisdom, balance, judgement and gravitas over 40 years should then be dispensed with, and all that information, intelligence and simple cop-on going down the drain.  It does not make any sense.  Neither does it make sense in any other category of employment.  I strongly support Senator Fitzgerald in that specific call and ask the Leader for a general debate, if possible.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange for an early debate on planning?  There have been many calls for such debates heretofore but I call for a specific one on high-rise developments.  I refer to cases in which they should not be permitted under any circumstances.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I recall that the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la spoke on this issue in a general way some time ago and he was careful to give rather good advice to the effect that planning authorities should make specific provision for high-rise developments where they deem them to be appropriate, rather than leaving things blank.  Obviously, this issue would arise only in large cities, perhaps on the quays and certainly in the centre.  High rise developments certainly should not be permitted in the suburbs, where they would be totally out of character.</P>
        <P>As we know, there are controversial plans for Dublin at present and it seems they are in contravention of the development plans laid down by councillors.  I am sure Senator Boyle will be aware of such developments in Cork but I am not sure what has been provided for in that city.  A recent decision was made in respect of which neither the residents nor the public representatives were notified by the city authorities.  This is unfortunate and represents a total breakdown.  The matter should have been dealt with properly but this has not occurred to date.  I call for a debate on this subject.</P>

There is no doubt there is a perception that the US economy has gone into recession.  I commend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other Ministers for their correct assessment that we should cut our cloth to measure and focus on employment.  In light of <Col N="1707"/>our history and knowledge of what employment does, we should realise it is sometimes as expensive to keep people out of work as it is to keep them in work, bearing in mind the high levels of social, health and other problems that ensue in times of unemployment.  The current trend of ensuring the continuation of a high level of employment is to be welcomed in changing times &mdash; I would not say &ldquo;difficult times&rdquo;.</P>

        <P>As we approach Easter Sunday many people will again start to read the Irish proclamation proclaimed on the steps of the GPO in 1916.  For me, obviously, all the sentences in that proclamation are relevant today in a different way in a modern Ireland, but one of them that always jumps out for many people is the need to cherish all of the children equally.  I say that in the context of the decision by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to renege on the commitment she gave the children of this State to cut class sizes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I seek a amendment to the Order of Business so that we can have a debate on the issue of class sizes and ask the Minister why she is doing this, whether she will rescind her decision and if it is her intention not only to renege on this commitment, as the Government did in the previous programme for Government, but also not to reduce class sizes in 2009 and 2010 as promised by this Government to the people.</P>

Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id i nd&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; agus t&aacute; dualgas ar na me&aacute;in chumars&aacute;ide &eacute; a phiocadh suas agus a fhoilsi&uacute;.

        <P>My colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, proposed at the outset that we have a debate on the economy.  I recommend to the Leader and the Members that in that debate we focus on what measures will be used as retrenchment for the way the economic boom has been wasted.  In an effort to retrench the public finances, the focus is being put on reneging on the commitment to class size reduction, on placing an embargo on the creation of new home help positions and on the summer works scheme in schools.  These are areas of real need.  The emphasis should be on the plethora of Government advisers and on the wasteful expenditure on a number of projects.</P>
        <P>I recommend to the Leader that an audit be done Department by Department to see where there is wasteful expenditure in terms of administration, wasteful advisers, silly decisions and projects such as PPARS which are more fitting to Alice in Wonderland.  We should focus on these rather than on leaving our children in large classes and our elderly without home help.  I recommend that the thrust and focus of the debate be on how retrenchment can take place without it being at the expense of the weak and vulnerable in society.</P>
        <P>I second the call by Senator Keaveney for a debate on alcohol abuse.  The issue is that because of low-cost selling of alcohol in supermarkets, drinking has retreated away from the public gaze into private houses and alleyways.  People are not going out in public to drink socially anymore and therein lies the problem.  This House needs to address how we stop people buying trolleys full of alcohol below cost price and taking them to unsupervised locations to drink.  We need to address the matter in those terms.</P>

T&aacute; an cl&aacute;r ann i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in.</P>
        <P>Despite the best intentions, we have a bilingual Standing Orders, but when it comes to the index, it is only in English.  That is just a small thing, but it illustrates how difficult it is for us to find concistency in matters of the use of the Irish language.  It is important to re-emphasise what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, that we should have appropriate respect from the media towards con<Col N="1710"/>tributions that are made tr&iacute; Ghaeilge in the House.  Perhaps in that way more people would be encouraged to use it.</P>
        <P>Maidir le ceist an alc&oacute;lachais, t&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an cheist seo ardaithe ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Cecilia Keaveney agus daoine eile.  The Taoiseach informed us there may be legislation to ban the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and garage forecourts.  I welcome that.  We need to have a debate on this and specifically on alcoholism.  I was talking to a local politician in Galway recently who said that at a recent event he attended many people, in particular young people, were putting trolley loads of drink into themselves.  This behaviour will store up huge problems for the future in terms of public health.  Many people are invisibly developing a high dependency on alcohol.</P>
        <P>While I welcome what the Taoiseach said about banning the sale of alcohol in supermarkets and garage forecourts, I have noticed in filling stations I have stopped at on my way from Galway to Dublin that there are literally shrines to alcohol behind the counters.  This must stop.  It is one thing to target the demand.  Dr. Joe Barry said the Taoiseach stated in 2003 that the Government would legislate to control the marketing of alcohol, but nothing has happened yet.  The devil is in the detail.  We must tackle the more thorny question of demand.  How will we educate the public about the dangers of alcoholism and of high dependency on alcohol in society?  We will rue the day.</P>

        <P>A total of 108 workers working for Contact 4 in three centres in Gweedore, Achill and Dingle have lost their jobs.  These workers were treated rudely and abominably by the management of that company, particularly the managing director.  That companies should treat workers in such a manner is a disgrace.  These workers were left without their salaries, which were due to them, and any outstanding pay last Friday.  However, I acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the chief executive officer of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, P&aacute;d<Col N="1711"/>raig &Oacute; hAol&aacute;in, to assist the workers in every way possible.

	<P>It is vital that Ireland grasps the opportunity and that the Minister tackles the officials responsible for us to grasp the opportunity to bring teams to train here.  This week, I was in touch with some of the Irish Olympic team athletes, who are currently training in Valencia in Spain.  They contacted me because I gave them brochures.  The Olympic team manager, Patsy McGonagle, travelled to Valencia with brochures to try to entice other nations to train in Ireland.  The news coming back is that the British Olympic Association is offering &pound;25,000 to any Olympic or Paralympic team which uses a British base as a training camp before the 2012 games.  We must address this issue.  I urge the Leader to ensure the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism comes to the House to discuss this very important issue.</P>
        <P>I will return to an issue referred to by Senator Doherty in respect of the sentiments of the 1916 Proclamation and those hugely significant words which refer to cherishing all the children of the nation equally.

It gave equal strength and meaning to our Northern Protestant community and it is heartening that those words are still very much alive and that the peace process is bringing about the dividends and bringing the religions in the North of Ireland together.  In recent months, we have seen the significant dividend of those words in cherishing all of our children equally.

        <P>We are in the middle of brain awareness week.  Senators opposite like quoting phrases like &ldquo;cherish everybody equally&rdquo;.

I am calling for a debate on our neurological services.  We have had two reports in 2003 and 2005.  We have a shortfall in the number of neurologists, neurosurgeons and beds.  People are being refused to be sent for rehabilitation because it is seen as a pointless exercise because waiting lists are endless.  If we cherish all our citizens equally we need an urgent debate and an improvement in the condition of neurological services for all our people.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Doherty&rsquo;s comments on class sizes and the Government&rsquo;s reneging on commitments to reducing primary school class sizes over the terms of the past two Governments.  It is time to have a debate on the issue.  I would like to broaden it somewhat to cover other issues.</P>
        <P>A number of calls have been made today for a debate on alcohol.  It is time to have a debate on young people&rsquo;s social personal and health habits, encompassing binge drinking of alcohol and the issue of suicide.  Last week a report indicated that one-tenth of teenagers admit to self-harming, which is a very serious statistic.  Two weeks ago I published a study which showed that 16% of 16 <Col N="1713"/>year olds admit to feeling disillusioned, with no life purpose and no goals.  Some 40% indicated that young people are attracted to drugs and binge drinking because of peer pressure.  According to them they do it &ldquo;because my friends do&rdquo;.  It is time to have a serious debate on the broader issue of social personal and health habits, including considering an integrated set of solutions involving the Ministers for Health and Children, Education and Science, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We also need to consider the crucial issue of parenting.  Where are the parents of these young people aged 14, 15 and 16  when they are out at night?  Under what remit is that problem considered?</P>
        <P>I support Senator Alex White&rsquo;s request for a debate on racism and the promotion of interculturalism in our classrooms.  I was present at a school this morning and another yesterday.  I see many newcomer students from other countries in our classrooms.  I am amazed at their resilience and ability to cope.  However, they are struggling with the language.  The model of language support being used to immerse them into this setting is not working.  Two hours of language support each week is inadequate.  These children are sitting lost in science and history classes.  The poor teachers are getting one day&rsquo;s training to deal with the issue, which is totally inadequate.  The Minister for Education and Science along with the Minister of State with responsibility for integration should consider a better model to integrate students into education and community.Is there any means whereby a number of Ministers can address a topic in this House?  Many issues, such as alcohol and racism, are complex and do not fall within the portfolio of one Department.  How can we get an integrated response from the Cabinet on such matters?</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Kelly, Hanafin, O&rsquo;Reilly and Callely called for the three reports on the situation at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise to be debated.  I will discuss this matter with the other party leaders after the Order of Business tomorrow morning to see what progress is being made.  All of this week is devoted to legislation and, as Senators know, we will be sitting very late this evening and possibly quite late tomorrow night also.  I will endeavour to facilitate the Senators&rsquo; request for a debate and we can discuss it after the Order of Business tomorrow.  </P>
        <P>There have been calls for an urgent debate on the economy and changing economic circumstances, particularly in the western world.  I will agree to arrange such a debate in light of what is currently happening.  Some 600,000 jobs were created over the last ten years but this growth could not be sustained.  Nonetheless, the Seanad acknowledges the great work that took place in that decade.  Many Senators have expressed opinions on this and will have a further opportunity do so in the coming days when the Finance <Col N="1714"/>Bill is before the House.  As the House will be dealing with legislation this week and next, it does not appear that we will have time for a debate on the economy before the Easter recess.  I strongly suggest therefore that Senators should make their comments on Second Stage of the Finance Bill, which is an ideal opportunity as the Minister will be present.</P>
        <P>Senators Harris and Fitzgerald referred to the age limit of 60 for retirement from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government has recognised, and the Minister for Finance in particular has acknowledged, that all new public servants will have to work until they are 65.  As Senators have pointed out, the most experienced, dedicated and committed members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be allowed to continue working until they are 65, provided everything is equal medically.  I fully agree with that.  I will pass on the Senators&rsquo; views to the Minister after the Order of Business and I will have no difficulty in arranging for a debate on this matter.  I does not make sense that some of the most experienced garda&iacute;, who have been highly commended and have received awards, including special service medals, should have to retire so young.  I support the Senators&rsquo; call on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris, Alex White and Doherty expressed various views regarding the Cathal &Oacute; Searcaigh case and the forthcoming television programme.  I will pass the Senators&rsquo; request to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Given the forceful contributions, and particularly that of Senator Norris, I will have this done immediately after the Order of Business.</P>

        <P>Senator Alex White called for a debate on the integration of young students, including language supports in our schools.  Current spending by the Department of Education and Science totals &euro;8.5 billion, which is enormous.  That is what will be invested in 2008 with the biggest item being the pay budget for approximately 90,000 people.  Many of us did not realise that such a large number of people are employed in the education sector.  Approximately 1,100 extra primary and post-primary teachers have been put in place this year alone, and the Minister has confirmed that a further 1,200 teaching places are planned for the 2008-09 academic year.  In the primary sector alone there are now in the region of 6,000 more teachers on the Department&rsquo;s payroll than in 2002.</P>
        <P>Extra teachers were provided in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  The primary programme for Government contains a commitment to provide a further 4,000 primary teachers by 2012.  According to the <Col N="1715"/>Department, with the additional teachers in place, those provided for in this year&rsquo;s budget and the 2,000 extra primary teachers to be provided during the next two years, we are ahead of target.  A 21% increase in funding for primary teacher training colleges will expand significantly the number of places for postgraduate diplomas in primary teaching from next February.  This will ensure an adequate supply of qualified primary teachers to meet Government and departmental requirements.</P>
        <P>Senators Keaveney, O&rsquo;Reilly, Mullen and Healy Eames called for a debate on alcohol and alcohol related problems.  I, and everyone in the country, wholeheartedly welcomed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement in this regard at the weekend.  We look forward to the support of all parties in addressing the concerns expressed by him in respect of the difficulties being experienced and the free availability of alcohol at filling stations and supermarkets.  As legislators processing the legislation in both Houses, we never intended this would be the case.  I have agreed to allocate time for an all-day debate on the challenges facing us in respect of alcohol and the required social changes in this regard.  Senators will have an opportunity to contribute to this debate following the Easter recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan spoke about the legal profession.  I recognise and acknowledge its contribution to society since the foundation of the State.  I will pass on his views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I have no difficulty in providing time for a debate on the issues outlined to the House by Senator Regan.</P>
        <P>Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Doherty, Mullen, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Buttimer expressed various views in respect of this House debating the Irish language issue and in respect of coverage by the national media of matters uttered in Irish in this House.  I welcome the TG4 representative present in the House earlier to cover part of the proceedings of the Order of Business and any arm of the media that comes here to cover the affairs of this House.  I believe the Des Bishop programme will enhance the future of the Irish language.  We all support the enhancement of Irish as our national language.</P>
        <P>Senator Kelly called for a debate on enterprise, trade and employment and outlined the difficulties being experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises.  I have given a commitment to invite the relevant Minister to the House for such a debate.  While it is often felt that the midlands region does not get its fair share, the provision by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, of &euro;35 million for the new engineering block at the Athlone Institute of Technology to cater for 1,000 new engineering students is to be welcomed.  The 53 acre site will be used by 6,500 graduates attending the institute.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan, a long-standing and experienced Member of this House, called for a debate <Col N="1716"/>on planning issues.  I have no difficulty in allowing time for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Doherty, O&rsquo;Reilly, &Oacute; Domhnaill and Healy-Eames called for a debate on matters pertaining to the 1916 Proclamation and Easter Sunday.  I have no difficulty in providing time for such a debate.  I am sure the points I made earlier in respect of education will lay to rest the fears of some Senators in terms of cherishing all the children of the nation.</P>
        <P>Regardless of who is in Government or in what country, there exists always people who are underprivileged or who, for one reason or another, do not receive a fair share of a nation&rsquo;s funding.  No one could have foreseen 40 years ago the position in which we find ourselves today.  I acknowledge, as I have many times before, the institutes of technology, free transport of students to second level and free education for second level students.  Much has been done in this area in the past 40 to 45 years.  I salute those in the teaching profession who, when funding was put in place, made it all possible.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill expressed serious concerns about the Contact 4 employees who lost their jobs at the three centres in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta areas.  It is not easy to attract new industry to these areas given their distance from main centres of transportation and so on.  It is in this regard broadband will come into its own and play a part.  We must ensure the Irish language is preserved in rural and Gaeltacht areas.  Broadband is of the essence in these areas.  We all know from experience that once in place, it is an enormous boost to these areas wherein there are no motorways or facilities.  I will pass on the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also called for a debate with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism on the possibility of training for participants in the Olympic Games.  The matter is worthy of debate and I will endeavour to have the Minister attend this House in that regard.  I will pass on to the Minister Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s experiences as relayed in the House today.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer called for a debate on brain awareness week and the two reports on neurological services.  I will consider the matter and come back to the House on it later in the week.</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to Kit Ahern, a former member of this House and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who died recently at the age of 92. <Col N="1717"/> Although a native of Limerick, she spent her adult life in Ballybunion, County Kerry, following her marriage to Dan Ahern and went on to become an active member of Kerry County Council.</P>
        <P>I had the pleasure of knowing Kit personally.  She was a truly wonderful person, a formidable woman who worked tirelessly promoting the welfare of rural Ireland and, in particular, the quality of life for Irish women.  Kit was passionate about the Irish language, our culture and the arts and used every opportunity to promote all things Irish.  She first came to prominence as president of the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, ICA, between 1961 and 1964.  Kit and her ICA colleagues travelled the length and breadth of Ireland recruiting new members and instilling a sense of optimism for the future of rural Ireland.  The ICA was involved in many battles to bring running water and electricity to rural Ireland, the basic essentials of day-to-day living.</P>
        <P>Kit was appointed to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, in 1964 and subsequently retained her seat on the cultural and educational panel in 1965.  She contested the general elections in north Kerry in 1965, 1969 and 1973 and secured a seat in the D&aacute;il in 1977 under the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.  It was the first time two Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies were elected to the north Kerry constituency, the other being the late Tom McEllistrim, also a Member of this House and whose family continues to be represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.   She served one term in the D&aacute;il as a Deputy and, on losing her seat in 1981, subsequently retired from national politics.  However, despite all her achievements, Kit never lost sight of her humble roots and once described herself as &ldquo;the first pleb to be elected president of the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>She was a wonderful woman and a great person to know.  She worked tirelessly on behalf of the people of north Kerry and rural Ireland.  She will be sadly missed by all who knew her.  We on this side of the House will remember her as a great friend who served in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The people of Kerry have lost a loyal and true person.  Go nd&eacute;ana Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I pay tribute to the former councillor, Senator and Deputy, the late Kit Ahern.  She was a pioneering woman, one of the few women in Irish politics when she was first elected.  She had a passionate commitment to rural Ireland, to the quality of life for women and a strong commitment to arts, culture and language.  Her influence in many ways transcended party political lines.  She was a president of the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association, which is a marvellous organisation.  She played a key role in building up that organisation in the 1940s and 1950s.  As she said, she did not come into it a ready-made organisation; she helped to form and <Col N="1718"/>build it.  It played a key role for many years, particularly at that time in rural life, and it continues to play a role today. </P>
        <P>She was also a member of the Bord F&aacute;ilte.  She was an avid promoter of the Irish language and president of the Kerry Historical and Archaeological Society.  She had broad interests.  I did not know her personally but people speak warmly of her.  She was first female cathaoirleach of Kerry County Council when appointed in 1977.  She was also elected, as the Leader said, to the Seanad and D&aacute;il on a number of occasions and retired in 1981.</P>
        <P>While I did not know her personally, what I have heard about her shows what a positive, constructive and innovative contribution she made to public life in Ireland and in the Oireachtas.  I note Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan was quoted in the <i>Irish Examiner </i> as saying she had huge integrity.  That is a wonderful tribute to be paid to anyone.  To her family, friends and her colleagues, I extend my deepest sympathies and those of the Fine Gael Party.  May she rest in peace.</P>

	<P>I extend condolences from the Independent benches to the former Senator Kit Ahern&rsquo;s family and party.  I never served with her but knew her quite well.  She was a pleasant woman and a great conversationalist.  She never visited the House without going out of her way to speak to any of us with Kerry connections or from Kerry.  I used to always tell her, like I tell all people from that part of west Limerick, that they know they are really Kerry people even though their address might be west Limerick.</P>
        <P>She spread her wings quite well and her bloodline has had a significant impact on Kerry&rsquo;s status.  Her great nephew &ldquo;Bomber&rdquo; Liston brought great silverware to Kerry and her cousin, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, is continuing the name and operation of Kit&rsquo;s family in politics.</P>
        <P>She was born in Athea but we always associate her with Kerry.  We pay tribute and recognise the work she has done in this building, be it the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Anybody who puts himself or herself forward for public representation is engaged in the highest area of activism in a democracy.  Regardless of his or her party or views, I always recognise and salute that, and we should do that.</P>
        <P>More importantly in the case of this woman, she was a role model as a community activist.  She was involved in everything in her community and in the development of the ICA, in particular, in which she reached high office.  She made her contribution at local level, including in the ICA, but also in every local association, organisation and club.  She was a member of a county council and had a commitment to local community.  She also served in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is people like her who become role models for young people.  It is to people like her we should refer as teachers in terms of people&rsquo;s responsibilities in a democracy.  Their responsibilities are not only to receive but to give.  While we might agree <Col N="1719"/>or disagree with some of the measures she proposed along the way, her commitment is the requirement and responsibility or being a citizen in a democracy and must be much prized and supported.  As a teacher she made her contribution, which I recognise.</P>
        <P>I recognise, salute, and pay tribute to a woman who made a contribution as a teacher, in her local community, county, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We can ask no more of a citizen.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to add my voice and that of the Labour Party to the tributes that have been paid to the former Senator and Deputy Kit Ahern.  </P>
        <P>I was struck by a point made by Senator Harris, with which I strongly agree, that there is a tendency in our public debate and discourse to almost to write off  people at a relatively young age or increasingly at a younger age.  In particular in political life, it is important to recall and pay tribute to the enormous contribution of somebody like the former Senator Ahern who joined a new political party at the age of 70.  In an age when it is often suggested that politics is an ephemeral entity or is purely characterised by media spin, it is vital that we recall and pay tribute to the enormous contribution of somebody like the former Senator Ahern over many years, not only directly in political life but through the ICA, an extraordinary organisation with huge history and record of public service, as referred to by Senator Fitzgerald and others.</P>
        <P>I pass on our condolences to the late Mrs. Ahern&rsquo;s family and her political colleagues in the Progressive Democrats.  I noticed that in one interview when the former  Senator Ahern was asked about her nomination for election to the Seanad she said, with a mixture of idealism and true practical thinking, that she accepted the nomination that had been given to her to the Seanad for three reasons.  She said it was first, as a tribute to the women of Ireland, secondly, as a tribute to herself and, thirdly, to try to create a base for a new north Kerry Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy.</P>
        <P>She was a woman who made a huge contribution and it is sad that we are noting her passing today, but her&rsquo;s was a life full of commitment and real, genuine public service.  In those circumstances, I am pleased to add my voice to what has been said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I express sympathy on the passing of the former Senator and Deputy Kit Ahern.  I was struck by two factors from reading media notices of her passing.  The first one is the reputation she &mdash; having lived to the age of 92 &mdash; seemed to have maintained in the Kerry area well after she had exited public life.  The second factor is a personal one.  She finished elected public office at the election I first participated in as a <Col N="1720"/>voter; there is probably close to 50 years between us.  For her to have maintained such a reputation among the people she served is a recommendation in its own right and anyone involved in public life should strive to attain that.  Some people look for baubles from their activities in pubic life but her example is a better one to live by.  On finishing elected public office, she maintained her involvement in public life.  By her actions and words she made herself known in terms of her views on the nature of politics and how she believed she could contribute as an individual, despite not holding public office.</P>
        <P>Another area should be further acknowledged before we conclude these expressions of sympathy.  In a political system where women continue to be under-represented, she was active at a time when female Members in this and the other House numbered no more than single figures.  To have operated in such an environment and to have ploughed a furrow for the slow and steady progress that has since been achieved should serve as an indicator of how much remains to be done in this area.  Particular tribute must be paid to a parliamentarian who played a role in advocating the need for women to be more actively involved in public life.  Her passing presents us with a challenge to ensure the level of female participation in politics is improved as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to Ms Kit Ahern and the contribution she made to political life.  Although small in stature and fragile in appearance, she was certainly tough in spirit.  As a woman in politics, and traditional politics in Kerry at that, she was a pioneer.  She was a courageous woman who stood up for what she believed in and represented her community, country and gender proudly.  She was something of a trail-blazer and I am proud that she was born in Limerick.  It is typical of Kerry people that they try to take credit for every good that comes out of Limerick.</P>
        <P>Kit Ahern was a modest woman in many ways and I was delighted to get to know her in the course of the emergence of the political party of which I am a member.  At the tender age of 70, as Senator Alex White observed, she decided to join another political organisation to which she remained fiercely loyal until her death.  As Senator Boyle said, when she left public life and the front line of politics, she continued to work loyally and tirelessly behind the scenes on behalf of her local community and her political party.  She was an impressive individual and a person I am proud to have associated with my political party.  It is a pleasure to pay tribute to her as a person who paved the way for the involvement of women in politics.  I am proud to follow in her footsteps.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Kit Ahern was a cousin of mine.  She was a person I greatly <Col N="1721"/>admired and whom I was proud to support during her long and successful political career.  She was an individual of great vision and with a strong sense of duty to serve her country and community.  She was driven primarily by a desire to ensure women received political equality at a time when that principle was not universally acknowledged.  She was president of the ICA prior to her involvement in politics and she worked hard to develop home industry for housewives at a time when there were few opportunities for women outside the home.</P>
        <P>Kit was honoured to receive a nomination to the Seanad from the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, on two occasions, in 1964 and 1965.  As Senator Alex White observed, she accepted the nomination to the Seanad as a tribute to mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.  She was subsequently elected to the Seanad in 1969 and 1973 on the cultural and educational panel before finally being elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1977, on the fourth attempt, after coming close on two occasions prior to that.  Just before her death she joked to me that the new configuration of north Kerry and west Limerick gave her reason to think of coming out of retirement at the age of 92.  Her political battles in north Kerry, not all of them with members of other political parties, are part of the folklore of political life in the county.  Kit used to say it is not a question of the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog.  She always displayed great courage in adversity.</P>
        <P>She was a great supporter of all things Gaelic.  Bh&iacute; f&iacute;or-ghr&aacute; ag Kit d&aacute;r gcult&uacute;r dh&uacute;chais.  Bh&iacute; s&iacute; d&iacute;lis don teanga Gaeilge i rith a saol.  She was a loyal and dependable individual.  Her integrity was important to her and there could be no compromise on matters of principle.  This was the reason for her decision to join the Progressive Democrats Party under the leadership of her close friend, Des O&rsquo;Malley, a man she admired greatly and who is admired by many of us in north Kerry.  This decision was respected by her former colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il and although she made many new friends, she never lost her old ones.  However, her decision gave me many sleepless nights at the time.</P>
        <P>Her late husband, Dan, and her brother, Eoin, were her greatest supporters.  She was proud of all her family, with a special pride in the achievements of her nephew, Eoin &ldquo;The Bomber&rdquo; Liston.  I am grateful for the opportunity to continue her work in the Seanad and to pay tribute to her in this Chamber.  I thank the Leader for arranging this tribute to Kit.  On behalf of her family, I thank all those who have spoken so kindly of her.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with the warm and well deserved tributes that have been paid to the late Kit Ahern.  I did not know Kit well but she struck me as a kind and most pleasant lady on every occasion I met her.  She was a great conversationalist and a wonderful contributor to everything in which she was <Col N="1722"/>involved.  It is good and fitting that her cousin, Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, should be here to pay tribute to her.</P>
        <P>She was a great national president of the ICA.  As county president for some of that period, my mother worked well with her.  Kit had a tremendous record of dedicated and distinguished service, both locally and nationally.  She was a wonderful leader of the county council &mdash; the first female chairman &mdash; in 1977.  She was a great representative and promoter of Kerry and a wonderful director of Bord F&aacute;ilte.  She served well in this and the other House.  Her contribution to everything she did speaks for itself.  Kit led a full life.  I extend my deepest sympathy to her family.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not have the pleasure of being in the House when Ms Ahern was a Member and subsequently Cathaoirleach, but I met her on three occasions, widely separated by years.  The first was when, as Cathaoirleach, she chaired a debate organised by one of the major debating societies in Trinity College.  At this debate, one of my friends who had not only a double but a triple personality, being variously a strong republican from the midlands, an Orangeman from the shipyards of Belfast or a relic of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, decided to make lurid comments and vulgarly abusive remarks about the appointment of a Roman Catholic clergyman as chaplain to Trinity College.  Ms Ahern took these comments seriously and remarked that this person must be a Protestant guttersnipe from Ballymena.  She was terribly entertained when the joke was explained to her.</P>
        <P>I met her subsequently at Listowel writers&rsquo; week where I discovered she had a grip almost as good her successor, Tras Honan.  Ms Ahern was devoted to Kerry, knew its literature intimately and had that wonderful way with words that Kerry people have.  The final time I met her was some two years ago when I spoke at the Brendan Kennelly summer school in Kerry.  She was as vigorous as ever even though a woman of considerable age.  I listened with great interest to what she had to say.  Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan said she liked to remark that the important thing is not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog.  This accurately reflects my occasional experiences of the late Senator Ahern.</P>

	<P>I wish to be associated with the tributes which have been paid to the late Kit Ahern who, as has been said already, was nominated to this House on two occasions by the former Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass.  Kit served on the cultural and educational panel from 1969 to 1977 and made many worthwhile contributions to the debates in this House.  She then successfully contested a D&aacute;il election and served in that House from 1977 to 1981.  On a personal note, her late brother Paddy was a neighbour of mine in <Col N="1723"/>Banagher for many years.  In keeping with the Ahern tradition, he was a very industrious and respected member of the community as a tailor and publican in the town.  I extend my sincerest sympathies to the extended family of Kit Ahern on their sad loss.</P>

	<P>This amendment reflects a concern I expressed on Committee Stage.  The Minister indicated at the time that it is a question of the retrospective nature of the legislation.  Section 3(2) currently states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A provision of this Act shall not affect the operation of the general law in relation to defamation, in force immediately before its commencement, except to the extent that that provision provides otherwise (whether expressly or by necessary implication).</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wonder whether the final sub-clause needs to be included.  When the Minister explained the position on the last occasion, he said he would be happy to ask the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to examine the issue I raised.

	<P>The position has not changed.  I am glad the Senator has given me an opportunity to put the position on the record of the House.  During the Committee Stage discussion on section 3(2), Senator Regan sought clarification on the last part of that provision, which appears to provide for retrospection.  I agreed to re-examine the wording of the section.  The amendment before the House proposes to delete the latter part of section 3(2).</P>

	<P>The advice of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was sought.  I was <Col N="1724"/>advised that this is a standard drafting provision and that no change is required to the text.  The purpose of section 3(1) is to ensure that when this legislation is enacted, it will not have retrospective effect.  Clearly, it has to speak from the time of its commencement.  Section 3(2) is designed to ensure that the general law relating to defamation &mdash; the definition of what constitutes &ldquo;publication&rdquo;, for example &mdash; will remain in force unless expressly abrogated or superseded by the Act.  It is putting in place some sort of presumption in favour of the existing law.  That is really the advice received on the amendments.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes the deletion of section 7(13), the purpose of which is specifically to disallow the application of the section in the context of declaratory order provisions.  In other words, one will not need a verifying affidavit in such cases.  The reason for this measure is that it is clear that applications for declaratory orders are not the same as normal defamation actions &mdash; no damages can be sought, for example.  Any application for a declaratory order must be grounded in an affidavit.  This is specifically provided for in section 26(5).  The requirement that the applicant for the declaratory order has to give some sworn averment is provided for in section 26(5), which states that any &ldquo;application under this section shall be brought by motion on notice to the respondent grounded on affidavit&rdquo;.  Section 7 sets out the position in the case of a plaintiff in a defamation action who serves a pleading containing assertions of fact and the pleadings which are exchanged in a claim for damages.  The issue is addressed in a different section of the Bill.</P>

	<P>We discussed the definition of &ldquo;multiple publication&rdquo; on Committee Stage.  There was some concern about the appropriateness of the definition.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to consider the matter?  We had a lengthy debate on the subject.  I have proposed an alternative definition which, I believe, reflects the intention.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on it.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice available from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the parliamentary counsel is that the provision, as drafted, is clear in providing that a person has a single cause of action in relation to multiple publications subject to subsection (2) where the court may grant leave to a person to bring more than one defamation action in respect of a multiple publication where it considers that the interests of justice so require and the definition in subsection (3).  </P>
        <P>The general rule is that only one cause of action will lie in respect of a multiple publication by a person of the same defamatory statement whether made contemporaneously or not.  This is designed to prevent a person taking a defamation action as a result of an article published in a paper, which is read by a certain number of persons on that day, from returning to take a further action in a few years&rsquo; time because another person who finds the old copy of the paper reads the article and tells the person in question that he or she is angry or upset by the content of the article.  It would be clear from the circumstances involved that it is still the same publication and not a republication.</P>
        <P>It does not affect the multiple publication by a number of different persons of the same or similar defamatory statement.  In that instance, more than one cause of action would result.  The proposal from Senator Regan does not add any additional clarity and I do not see any reason for its inclusion in regard to the ownership of publications and the nature of publication of defamatory statements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This refers to the troubled business of the corporate body.  I do not propose to take up a huge amount of time on this but it is odd that a corporate body is assumed to have feelings.  I have said this a number of times in the past.  The Minister pointed out previously that, for example, my own august institution, the College of the Sacred and Undivided Trinity near Dublin, might be defamed without incurring any financial loss and that would be a great shame.  I am confident it could defend itself well with the public relations skills it has and with the employees it has for that purpose.</P>
        <P>We are principally talking about large corporations such as Shell which is a filthy, nasty environmentally unfriendly conglomeration.  In situations where people make statements about it and where there is no financial damage to it which, to be fair, is all it is interested in, I do not see why it should be in a position to take action as a corporate body.  I am not interested in the feelings of Shell or of McDonald&rsquo;s which used defamation legislation to attempt to crush a couple of ordinary citizens who made statements about its operations with which many people agreed.</P>
        <P>Without wishing to take up too much of the time of the House, those are the reasons I tabled this amendment.  I will be interested to hear if the Minister has had any reason to ponder.  I am not sure if this is one of the matters on which he said he would come back to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>My intention in tabling this amendment was not to over-rule the existing common law where a company can sue for defamation but whether it must prove special damage.  In other words, the penultimate clause is whether it has incurred, or is likely to incur, financial loss as a result of the publication of that statement.  That is where the change lies.  The Minister has relied on a decision of the House of Lords to justify another innovation in this Bill, and I refer to the Jameel<i> v. The Wall Street Journal</i> case.  I wish to quote two of the Lords in this case.  Lord Hoffmann, in paragraph 91, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the case of an individual, his reputation is a part of his personality, the &ldquo;immortal part&rdquo; of himself and it is right that he should be entitled to vindicate his reputation and receive <Col N="1727"/>compensation for a slur upon it without proof of financial loss.  But a commercial company has no soul and its reputation is no more than a commercial asset, something attached to its trading name which brings in customers.  I see no reason why the rule which requires proof of damage to commercial assets in other torts, such as malicious falsehood, should not also apply to defamation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the United Kingdom, one does not have to prove special damage.  Baroness Hale of Richmond stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It seems, therefore, that while the retention of the rule that a company does not have to show that it has in fact been harmed in any way may be within our margin of appreciation, we should scrutinise its impact with some care to see whether it may have a disproportionately chilling effect upon freedom of speech.</P>
        <P>In paragraph 155, she also pointed out that:</P>
        <P LI="1">Lest it be thought that these are maverick academic views, it should be noted that amongst the recommendations of the <i>Report of the [Faulks] Committee on Defamation</i> (1975, Cmnd 5909, para 342) was the proposal that:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) No action in defamation should lie at the suit of any trading corporation unless such corporation can establish either &mdash; (i) that it has suffered special damage, or (ii) that the words were likely to cause it pecuniary damage.....</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">The Faulks Committee were influenced by Mr Weir&rsquo;s views [etc.].....</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;A company cannot be injured in its feelings, it can only be injured in its pocket. Its reputation can be injured by a libel but that injury must sound in money.  The injury need not necessarily be confined to loss of income.  Its goodwill may be injured.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">The need to prove financial loss, or the likelihood of financial loss, should be a requirement for a corporation to sue for defamation.  I do not believe we should change the law in that regard.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which would address the matter he raised, namely, the requirement of proof of special damage in the event of a corporate plaintiff.  There was some debate on this section on Committee Stage and I undertook to have another look at it.  The Attorney General indicates that recent case law in the United Kingdom has made it clear there is nothing wrong in legal principle in having a cause of action for a body corporate to sue for defamation whether it incurred, or is likely to incur, financial loss.  Inci<Col N="1728"/>dentally, on the technical question of whether one requires a definition of a body corporate, the parliamentary counsel states that the Interpretation Act 2005 applies to that.</P>
        <P>Senators have been very critical of this provision but an individual plaintiff who is a natural human being does not have to prove loss in the case of a defamation and libel as distinct from slander.  Section 11 was recommended by the legal advisory group but it did not address the merits of the proposal.  The Law Reform Commission did so and stated that under existing law, trading and non-trading corporations appear to be capable of suing in defamation in respect of defamatory allegations concerning their business capacity and more general allegations relating to trading and the treatment of employees or their sponsorship of public events.</P>
        <P>For us to accede to Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment would not simply be to refuse to confer something new on a body corporate but it would be to withdraw a right which bodies corporate have in existing law.  Senator Norris essentially said a company should not be allowed to sue.  It is true that a libel action dies with the natural human being whereas a company can have a perpetual existence.  No doubt the lapse of time would qualify any amount of damage for which they could sue for past excesses.</P>
        <P>On the point Senator Regan raised of limiting actions by bodies corporate to claims for financial loss, the Law Reform Commission took the view that there can be harm caused by a defamatory statement which would be almost impossible to prove.  The financial loss caused to a defamed company could be as a result of individuals or bodies deciding not to trade or associate themselves with it, which is a notoriously difficult type of loss to prove.</P>
        <P>The provenance of this provision is a recommendation that there be no change in the existing law but that for the avoidance of doubt there should be a statutory provision confirming that all corporate bodies have a cause of action in defamation irrespective of whether financial loss is consequent upon the publication.</P>
        <P>There is no authority on that point in this jurisdiction but it seems that if one recognises the body corporate as an entity which at least has a reputation &mdash; part of Senator Norris&rsquo; argument seemed to proceed from the assumption that many bodies corporate do not have a reputation worth protecting &mdash; one has to assume that they are entitled to sue on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>These are Government amendments arising out of the debate on Committee Stage.  Section 15 provides for absolute privilege for witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees.  On Committee Stage Senators raised some concerns as to the drafting of the provision.  Following advice received from the Office of the Attorney General I propose to amend subsection (2) to make it subject to section 11 subsection (2) of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses Act 1997.  That section provides: </P>
        <P LI="1">If a person who is giving evidence to a committee in relation to a particular matter is directed to cease giving such evidence, the person shall be entitled only to qualified privilege in relation to defamation in respect of any such evidence as aforesaid given after the giving of the direction unless and until the committee withdraws the direction.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That amendment reflects the reality of the position in regard to privileges of witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees.  Amendment No. 10 has been proposed following consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel to improve the text to ensure that all Oireachtas committees, including sub-committees or joint committees, are so covered.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Walsh raised an issue on which I indicated that I might consult with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but in fact the Office of the Attorney General agreed with the Senators which is why I am tabling these amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I thank the Minister for graciously acknowledging the work previously done in the Seanad on this matter.  The amendment concerns judges and I table it in the light of an experience I had many years in the courts where I used to attend fairly regularly.  Certain judges made a habit of making the most derisory, cutting, defamatory and humiliating remarks about people who were in situations where they could not defend themselves.  The Minister, however, replied comprehensively on that occasion and I was almost battered into submission, but there is perhaps scope for a book of practice or etiquette to ensure that judges do not do this.  I read in the newspapers that from time to time they still do so.  This is very regrettable, particularly for the weaker members of our society.  This was not only my observation because at that time Nell McCafferty, in her excellent column &ldquo;In the Eyes of the Law&rdquo;, drew attention to the very practices that I deplored then and still do.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
        <P>I have not gone so far as to propose deleting the lines but in my amendment I propose using the phrase &ldquo;in the course&rdquo; of performing a judicial function.  This makes clear that any statements made by a judge in performing his duties or making a ruling, etc., are confined and circumscribed in some shape or form, and that they relate to the case.  This is an effort to deal with Senator Norris&rsquo; remarks on Committee Stage that at times extraordinary statements are made in the course of cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the Senators who spoke on Committee Stage agreed that absolute privilege should attach to statements made by the Judiciary in court and that is essential for the effective operation of the judicial arm of State.  In Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment the additional words are not necessary to qualify the performance of a judicial function but cast doubt on it and open an undesirable vista.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris did not press the amendment on Committee Stage and was especially interested in the current status of the judicial council Bill.  At that stage the Chief Justice had not replied to me about that Bill.  I have since, however, received certain information from the Chief Justice and a working group has been established to advance the Bill, comprising a nominee of my Department and of the Chief Justice so I am optimistic that the Bill can be finalised.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris makes the fair point that a code of ethics for judicial utterances can be formulated.  It is a matter for the Judiciary to regulate its business under the Constitution but I have <Col N="1731"/>made clear to the Chief Justice that I believe that this is sensitive legislation which I look forward to introducing in this House and believe I will do so in the lifetime of the Government.  We must be careful, however, to respect the independence of the Judiciary while ensuring that collective standards of discipline inform it.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This is the matter of the defence of honest opinion which goes to the crux of the reservations many of us have about this Bill.  It is not sufficient for somebody to think that something may be true and to honestly believe it.  One can honestly believe something that is untrue.  Whether one can honestly believe a lie is a slightly different point but one can in fact because it may not be a lie told by oneself.  Somebody else may have told one the lie which one then prints.  It is not enough to say that one thought it was true and believed Old Joe because he is a decent bloke and put it in a newspaper.</P>
        <P>It gets worse.  Section 18(2)(<i>a</i>) says if: &ldquo;at the time of the publication of the statement, the defendant believed in the truth of the opinion or, where the defendant is not the author of the opinion, believed that the author believed it to be true&rdquo;.  This is believing that someone else believed something else to be true and it is like a hall of mirrors.  One never quite knows where it is going to end.  I am against this business of honest <Col N="1732"/>opinion and the related matter of good faith.  What is published, either in the broadcast or print media, should be true, and to believe that someone else believed it to be true does not seem to be a good reason for publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I am speaking on the alternatives.  My amendments relate to a rewording rather than a deletion, to try to insert some objectivity into the test such that &ldquo;It shall be a defence ... to a defamation action for the defendant to prove that, in the case of a statement consisting of an opinion, the opinion was honestly held.&rdquo;.  I suggest that at the time of the publication of the statement, the defendant reasonably believed in the truth of the opinion.  Simply to say that the defendant believed is too simplistic and too subjective.  I also suggest that where the defendant is not the author of the opinion, he or she must have reasonably believed that the author believed it to be true. </P>
        <P>As Senator Norris indicated, the notion that someone else told one that he or she believed the matter to be true is very subjective.  If I understand the text, paragraphs (<i>a</i>),(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are cumulative.  I wonder whether an &ldquo;and&rdquo; after (<i>a</i>) might not make that clearer.  Also, there is a certain defect in this in that there is no reference, as has been said, to the issue of good faith, malice or improper purpose.  We shall be discussing section 24 later, but this section 18, which is replacing the defence of fair comment, obviates in large measure the need for section 24.  However, that is a matter I shall address later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the argument made by Senator Norris in respect of this provision.  On this occasion, as on the last, I respectfully must disagree with him.  As I indicated when this was discussed on Committee Stage, the widest possible latitude must be given to the media in respect of the publication of opinion consistent with fundamental principles, such as the right of a plaintiff or a citizen to challenge or, if there is a breach of the provision we shall put in place, to bring an action to court.</P>
        <P>However, I do not agree that this section is in some way undermined or at least it is open to question in the manner in which Senator Norris says it is.  I understand his argument that a newspaper, for example, could set up a defence of something it published and say in effect: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not claiming that this is true, but we have been told that it is, and therefore we have a good defence.&rdquo;  That is not, in fact, what this section proposes.  We are talking here about a mixture of fact and opinion.  This is a section dealing with honest opinion.  It is saying, in effect, that if the person who expressed the opinion can show that he or she honestly held it, however strange, excessive, radical or odd it might be, that position should be protected.  That should be an important principle in our law.  In fact, to date, it has been <Col N="1733"/>essentially what has applied.  There are some changes because as Senator Regan said, the defence of fair comment is being replaced by a renamed and somewhat amended defence of honest opinion.</P>
        <P>One cannot apply the same principles to an allegation of fact as may be applied to the expression of an opinion.  They are two different things.  We are right in our laws to distinguish between an honestly held expression of opinion on the hand or a statement of fact on the other.  They must be characterised as two different things.  Our laws traditionally have given a fair measure of protection to the expression of opinions and we should continue to uphold that, whether in the political, journalistic, financial world or whatever.  If articles are written or programmes produced and aired on radio or television in which people express opinions, however odd, strange, excessive or mad, even, they may be, and we often might think something is mad on the grounds that the opinions expressed are deeply offensive, annoy, irritate or make us angry, our media law ought to allow for the expression and publication of such opinions in circumstances where they are truly and honestly held, however excessive they may be.  That is what this section attempts to do.</P>
        <P>While I do not suggest Senator Norris has done this, it would be a mistake for us in our general approach to this section of the legislation to confuse the question of a statement of fact on the one hand with the expression of opinion on the other.  The law should continue to give a wide latitude to the expression of honestly held opinions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant changes in defamation law to a large extent hinge on this section and the section on honest opinion.  We have debated it back and forth and have probably gone as far as we are likely to get with it.  Nonetheless &ldquo;believed&rdquo; is a very subjective word.  I have raised the fact before that &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  As a consequence, that creates a lacuna which might be exploited.</P>
        <P>Let us take the example of a person who is seriously defamed and the commentator who wrote the offending article knew he or she was defaming the person, yet the editor genuinely believed that what was said was the writer&rsquo;s honest opinion.  If the defamed person subsequently takes a case, who is the defendant?  I suggest it is the newspaper, probably represented by the editor.  As we have not defined &ldquo;defendant&rdquo; sufficiently, it creates a situation whereby damage can be done to a person&rsquo;s reputation without him or her effectively being able to get recourse subsequently to this being corrected.  This a major change in the legislation and I know it is being sought by  the media.</P>
        <P>To some extent I accept that the freedom of the press is an essential part of the democratic process.  This must be weighed in the scales when we are trying to achieve a balance.  One of the <Col N="1734"/>difficulties is that we can have views on this but they really only manifest themselves subsequently in case law.</P>
        <P>The wording in the original draft of the Bill was ambiguous but the Minister made an amendment on Committee Stage to address it.  However, I am not 100% satisfied with it for the reasons I have outlined and given that the truth can be subjective.  If the facts substantiate an article, that is fine, but if they do not, it is not a particularly strong defence for its author to claim subsequently that he or she believed his or her remarks to be true.  Perhaps we are depending too much on judicial discretion.</P>
        <P>In light of the amendment made by the Minister on Committee Stage, I will withdraw my amendment, No. 15.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator Alex White on his distinction between opinion and fact.  I was indisposed during the earlier Stages of this Bill but, on the occasions on which I could have contributed, I felt I would have been regarded as having had a vested interest.  However, I must speak on the question of fact and opinion simply because I have been astounded in recent weeks by the absolute determination of politicians of all parties to trammel and limit, in every niggling way, the work of the press.  A myth is being created in so many of these amendments about the small man in a shop who has his reputation defamed and who has no recourse against the great barristers, the O&rsquo;Reillys, RTE and the great corporations.  I worked for 25 years in RTE and never encountered such a small man.  I encountered programme after programme that wished to expose exploitation in respect of the sweepstakes of the Irish Hospitals Trust and pension funds, and by rogue solicitors and gangsters continually protected by the libel laws.</P>
        <P>I work in a newspaper in which the business of the libel lawyers is a matter not of law but of risk management.  This is the case with all newspapers.  Mischievous letters demand apologies and they are followed immediately with demands for damages.  Surely politicians, who comprise the most litigious of all groups, should be more careful to ensure they protect the press.  Surely the events of recent weeks would make politicians realise the reputations of no small men have been defamed.  A man with a long criminal record has been awarded almost &euro;1 million in damages and the jury was not allowed to be told about this that and the other, which matters would have brought themselves to bear in any fair-minded court.  One of Ireland&rsquo;s wealthiest men was awarded &euro;750,000.  The Supreme Court lowered the award but it was increased again because the jury was not allowed to be told about that court&rsquo;s intervention.</P>
        <P>The reality of life is that none of the activities of the rogue solicitors, rogue capitalists, gangsters and criminals, who have names such as &ldquo;the <Col N="1735"/>Viper&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Tosser&rdquo; and whom Paul Williams has been exposing for years, would have been exposed if the politicians had their way.  In the approach to this Bill &mdash; I do not refer to the detail of the Bill as it is good and long overdue &mdash; there seems to be no good will by politicians to back a free press.</P>
        <P>I have never sued anybody in my life.  One should look at the Internet some time to see the entries on me.  They include references to death sentences and murder and suggest I should be run out and abused.  This is a small country and it is almost impossible to lose one&rsquo;s reputation in a small country; everybody knows one and knows pretty much when lies are being told.  The Earl of Clarendon stated libels are best dealt with by being ignored and by being ignored they appear not to be deserved.  There is a lot of truth to this in a small country.</P>
        <P>Politicians, who comprise one of the most litigious and sensitive groups, should be particularly careful not to convey the impression to the public that they are trying to trammel the press further.  This is a good Bill but I fear there is a privacy Bill behind it.  The daily life of a newspaper, be it <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>The Star</i> or the <i>Daily Mail</i>, involves an endlessly difficult struggle to get the truth printed.  What newspapers need is help and not trammelling, manacling and dragging down.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White rightly stated facts are sacred and comment is free, but when one is dealing with rogue solicitors or criminals, it is very important to be able to say that such and such a criminal is hanging out with another criminal and has been doing so for ten years, thus resulting in the reasonable opinion that a third party, who is with those criminals all the time, is in fact a dodgy customer.  This may not be a matter of fact but any reasonable person will assume that if one habitually hangs around with criminals, one has no good intent.</P>
        <P>In this regard, consider the Ferns case.  This story would not have emerged if many politicians, of both Houses, had their way.  They would have introduced laws to prevent the publication of the facts and opinions necessary to throw light on the extraordinary events surrounding Fr. Fortune in Ferns.</P>
        <P>In the cases I can recall, including that of the money lending tribunal and the Irish Hospitals Trust sweepstake, in addition to those involving Denis O&rsquo;Brien and Michael McDonagh and the recent ones involving rogue solicitors, all I see are strong people.  In a society in which anybody can approach a solicitor on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee basis&rdquo; to take a mischievous case, there is no particular danger to the small man.  The case of the small man that is being posited is mythical.  What goes on in both Houses regarding the libel laws and the privacy Bill shows excessive concern for the proprieties of politicians.</P>
        <P>This is an open democracy.  Provided there is genuine freedom of the press, an adequate apol<Col N="1736"/>ogy system and adequate freedom of discourse, we should take a bit more of the rough with the smooth and stop trying to crush press freedoms, which, in the fine analysis, we have seen to be the foundation of freedom so many times in our democracy.</P>

	<P>I have supported this Bill from the very beginning and have had reservations regarding some aspects.  However, I could not agree with Senator Harris on the small man not being hit because it is he about whom I am worried.  I am not worried about the criminals and other individuals to whom Senator Harris and others referred.</P>
        <P>Not so long ago, a colleague of mine went to America where it was plastered over the newspapers that he had struck his wife and engaged in other activities.  This never happened.  The man in question is a small man and I am in favour of amendments tabled to protect the small man.</P>
        <P>As I and Senators Walsh and Norris can testify, we debated this Bill inside out on Second and Committee Stages during the term of the last Seanad.  It is the small man I am interested in protecting rather than those mentioned by Senator Harris.  I have no interest whatsoever in the latter individuals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Alex White on this section.  There was always a defence in our law of fair and reasonable comment on a matter of public importance.  All that this section is doing is restating that well-established defence in a more elegant way in terms of honest opinion, which always comprised the gist of that defence.  That is the purpose of the section.</P>
        <P>I was concerned when I heard Deputy Norris construe the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy? I resist that demotion to the Lower House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is introducing an innovation in our law.</P>
        <P>The philosophy of this Bill is very clear.  As Senator Harris pointed out, we must have a free press, but a free press is not entitled to abuse the reputations of individuals by the publication of falsehoods.  When one analyses what is a falsehood &mdash; clearly it can be an untrue fact &mdash; and when one enters the realm of opinion, &ldquo;Comment is free but facts are sacred&rdquo; has always been the old dictum and that has always been reflected in the law.  We are not speaking of facts here.  We are speaking of opinions.</P>
        <P>A few weeks ago Senator Norris, speaking outside this House, stated that the legislation on same-sex couples I was preparing gave nothing better than a dog licence to those affected by it.  That is a statement of opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1737"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;honestly arrived at and therefore I cannot sue Senator Norris for that even though I would suggest there is no underlying factual basis for the assertion that he made.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event I agree with Senator Harris&rsquo;s philosophy in this matter, that it is not worthwhile to sue newspapers, but that is purely a personal point of view.  We all have an interest in this matter.  We all are public figures.  There is one ex-barrister, two current members of the Bar and two journalists present, one of whom also happens to be a legal practitioner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Three journalists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Three journalists, excuse me.  There is quite a proliferation of interested parties around this House.</P>
        <P>In this legislation we must ensure respect for those two fundamental principles &mdash; the right of the individual to his or her reputation and the absolute right of the press in a free society to publish freely about matters.  Within that framework we must achieve another purpose, namely, to stop the present position where an individual, to vindicate his or her rights, must spend a long time in the Four Courts to arrive at a verdict after what can be traumatic court proceedings.  That is why we have these procedures for accelerated apologies and for some sort of certainty on damages.  In my view, that is an entirely reasonable proposal.</P>
        <P>Section 18 provides for the defence of honest opinion.  It replaces the current defence of fair comment.  Under the present law fair comment is available where it is being pleaded that the alleged defamatory words were fair comment or expressions of opinion as opposed to fact.  It is the same with this section.  We are making it clearer that it relates to opinion, not facts.  The deletion of this section, as proposed by Senator Norris, would be a revolutionary change from the current law, and I cannot support it for that reason alone.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan has mooted amendments Nos. 12 and 13.  The additional words proposed do not add to the understanding of the pleaded defence.  Senator Regan is trying to introduce the concept of reasonableness, that if a defendant claims he or she believed an opinion then that is the opinion.  Opinion rests on belief, not on reasonableness.  That also would introduce a dramatic innovation in the law.  I happen to think Senator Norris&rsquo;s characterisation of my legislative labours was highly unreasonable but I do not believe that I should be entitled in a defamation action to go to a court and try to prove the considerable unreasonableness of his opinion.  We must be <Col N="1738"/>careful in this area.  We are not doing anything in this section that involves a radical change in current law.  Senator Jim Walsh fairly acknowledged that I had addressed his concern about the lack of clarity in the original formulation in an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>It is important that we realise that this is not new law.  It is existing law that, in the case of opinions, an opinion honestly entertained does not land one in a liable action.  That, to me, has always been the law and seems a reasonable provision.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Getting back to the matter at hand, with the permission of Senator Walsh, one of the matters about which I was worried was that it seemed it was possible that someone might preface their words by saying, &ldquo;In my opinion&rdquo;, and I referred to a comedienne at the time who was using &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; to protect herself against libel.</P>
        <P>We also ought to remember that there are people being defamed.  Whether they are small <Col N="1740"/>men or women, fat men or women, or tall men or women, we should remember that there is an object of this defamation.  There is also always the horrible prospect, which my good friend Senator Walsh may find too horrifying to contemplate, of perjury.  They could be lying.  As any good geologist will say, schist happens.  This does occur from time to time.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am a little confused about section 18(2)(<i>b</i>)(ii), which states that an opinion is honestly held if it was based on allegations of fact to which the defence of absolute privilege or the defence of qualified privilege would apply if a defamation action were brought.  I am not a legal practitioner and I wonder whether that means that a judge, acting outside his or her court, would be capable because it just says in circumstances where that qualified privilege exists.  Does that parallel allow certain professions to come outside the operation of their professional life?  I am a little concerned about the lying aspect of it.</P>
        <P>On the contribution of Senator Harris, I prefaced my earlier remarks, which possibly he may not have heard, by stating that the fire in my belly had been diminished quite a bit by precisely the action to which he referred, namely, the <i>Sunday World</i> case.  I do not want to trespass on the matter of the separation of powers, but it seems to me that that very substantially weakens the kind of case that people like me were trying to make honestly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>At the end of the day, as Senator Harris will be aware, the Government side will win on this.  Whatever they have decided is going to happen, but it is important for those of us on this side of the House or people who have an honest disagreement.  Returning to my warm friendship with Senator Walsh, undisturbed by the moral issues or his gallantly protective nature, we all raise these issues in an attempt to clarify legislation.It is important that in these matters, particularly where the Government will inevitably win any vote, despite Cheltenham, that people act as <i>advocatus diaboli,</i> which one sometimes does.  I am glad to have provided the opportunity for Senator Harris.  I will discuss the other matter with Senator Walsh over a strong cup of coffee, with which he needs to be fortified.</P>

	<P>This section replaces the defence of &ldquo;fair comment&rdquo;.  Fair and reasonable comment on a matter of public interest is what is being replaced.  My concern relates to the issue of reasonableness.  I have simply tried to refine the drafting, not delete it.  I suggested a <Col N="1741"/>number of changes that would introduce reasonableness or objectiveness into the wording.  Take, for example, where the defendant is not the author of the opinion, but  believes that the author believed it to be true.  The question is was there any reason for him to believe it to be true, did he ask the author or did he rely on the fact that this was a journalist in whom he would generally have confidence.  There is a slight refinement in the amendment which would improve the wording and introduce a test of reasonableness, particularly into the second leg of subsection (2)(<i>a</i>).  Will the Minister address that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did address it in sense.  I was concerned that the acceptance of such an amendment would, rather than clarify the existing law, introduce a further change.  I gave the example of Senator Norris&rsquo;s recent comments on my legislative endeavours and said that I did not believe it should be essential for him to prove in an action by me that he was reasonable.  I would view his opinions on the matter as highly unreasonable, but I think unreasonable opinions deserve to be published occasionally.  I am not prepared to accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has tabled an amendment to section 22, the section that deals with apologies, with regard to the prominence of an apology.  Section 20 deals with an offer of amends procedure, that exists since the <Col N="1742"/>1961 Act.  It would be inappropriate in the context of the offer of amends provision to insert any provision about the prominence of an apology because the offer to make amends is contingent on court approval and the agreement of the parties.  Therefore, it is not an appropriate section in which to introduce the concept of the prominence of the apology.  There is a Government amendment on section 22.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan made the point that he has gone through the Bill to check where reference is made to apologies.  The issue depends on the section in which the apology is contained.  In the context of this section, it would not be appropriate to have a reference to the prominence of the apology.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 18 is a Government amendment to section 22.  Section 22 permits an apology to be given in evidence.  The fact of an apology or the offer of an apology to the plaintiff can be given in evidence in a defamation action in mitigation of damage.  This is an important and essential part of our law.  The Government proposal makes clear that the evidence of the apology can be given in the form set out in the amendment:</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>a</i>) made or offered an apology to the plaintiff in respect of the statement to which the action relates, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) published the apology in such manner as ensured the that apology was given the same or similar prominence as was given to that <Col N="1743"/>statement, or offered to publish an apology in such a manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government amendment ensures that where an apology is made and published by a defendant, the apology will be given the same or similar prominence as was given to the original defamatory statement or that the defendant offered to publish the apology in such a manner.</P>
        <P>One of the prime purposes of the Bill is to make it easier for the media to give apologies.  This is important.  One of the big reasons newspaper editors were reluctant to apologise is they believed an apology would be used to accelerate or increase the amount of damages which a plaintiff could recover.  This led to the undesirable situation where cases did not settle and apologies were not given and we ended up with expensive gold-mining operations in the Four Courts.  If we are to avoid this, it is essential that the fact of an apology being made cannot be used against a defendant in a defamation action.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to what Senators said on Second Stage and in Committee with regard to their views on the conduct of the media and consulted with my Government colleagues.  I took the view that a reasonable change that could be introduced in this Bill was to insist that an apology should have at least a prominence that corresponded with the wrong that was done to someone&rsquo;s reputation.  Therefore, the formula I have drawn up in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel is that the apology is given the same or similar prominence.  I know this does not warm the hearts of newspaper editors, but it is not an unreasonable proposal in the context of the philosophy of this legislation.  The amendment proposed by Senator Regan and the Labour Party deals with the separate issues of the adequacy and timing of an apology.  It is not useful to impose time limits or qualifications as to adequacy.  That puts a timeframe on both a defendant and a plaintiff in the matter of the issue in acceptance of an apology.  It potentially could limit the application of this Bill.</P>
        <P>The provision in the Bill that the apology be offered as soon as is practicable is an appropriate approach.  It leaves it up to the plaintiff to accept an apology prior to any court action.  Where the issue becomes a concern of the court in an action, the court, in looking at the matters concerned and where there is a dispute, no doubt will take into account arguments about reasonableness but we should not write that into legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome what the Minister has said in so far as it concerns the desirability of providing that an apology made would not act against the interests of a defendant.  It is desirable that the law would always encourage people to do the right thing.  In that regard, it is desirable that a defendant would give evidence in <Col N="1744"/>mitigation of damage to the effect that he or she made an apology.</P>
        <P>I also welcome what is provided for by the Government&rsquo;s amendment in terms of ensuring some adequacy of apology in respect of prominence.  However, the Minister should go further and accept Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  The question of it being a reasonable and adequate apology is surely worthy of our consideration.  In so far as the Minister suggests that this might act to limit the effect of the section, surely it would only limit it in such a way that it could not be availed of by the media where the apology in question was not adequate.  It is one thing to talk about the prominence of an apology.  We have all seen situations where the outrage is perpetrated and the apology subsequently gets much smaller billing.  However, we have also seen a phenomenon where the apology can be very mealy-mouthed.  It is desirable that the legislation should provide that the reasonableness or adequacy of the apology should be a matter for consideration.  I do not see why the law should not specify that the apology in question should be a reasonable and adequate one.</P>

I also support section 22 and what it seeks to achieve, in particular the change in our law such that the carrying of an apology will not be relevant to the determination of liability in a defamation action.  The change proposed in this legislation is correct in this regard.  I also agree with the Minister when he says that part of the intention is to make it easier for media defendants, about whom we are talking essentially, to give apologies by which he means that the Bill should incentivise media defendants to give apologies.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to address a point I made on Committee Stage about the importance of timely apologies.  From my experience in the media in the dark and distant past and from what one observes, the dynamic of a situation where an alleged defamation is carried in a newspaper or, perhaps even more so, on radio and television, changes very quickly.  If a person believes he or she has been defamed and wishes to take action in respect of it, we all know that battle lines are quickly drawn in terms of litigation if some satisfaction is not given to that person quickly.  If he or she is intelligent about it, he or she will look for a quick apology because the sting of the damage to his or her reputation, as he or she sees <Col N="1745"/>it, in the public domain can be most easily or satisfactorily corrected if it is done quickly.  For something to take weeks, months or in some cases, as we know with litigation, years to be resolved will change the entire dynamic.  The battle lines will have been drawn and, very often, it becomes concerned with something quite different from what it was about in the first place.</P>
        <P>Why can the Minister not see the sense in encouraging not just apologies but timely apologies?  The amendment proposed by us does not, as was suggested by the Minister, impose a mandatory requirement for a timely apology.  It simply says that the court &ldquo;may regard an apology as effecting a substantial mitigation of damage if, but only if, it is made within 14 days of complaint&rdquo;.  It does not exclude apologies not made within that period.  It simply says that an apology made in a timely and expeditious way to deal with a problem can be taken into account by the court.  It is not a proposal for a mandatory requirement or anything like it.  In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s argument about making it easier for media defendants to give apologies, can he not see the sense in at least encouraging timely apologies in the circumstances?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that the Minister addressed the prominence of the apology, which was an issue raised by me and other Senators on Committee Stage.  Time is of the essence in terms of the meaningfulness of an apology.  The formulation I proposed in amendment No. 20 has a lighter touch than that suggested by Senator White.  It refers to a period within 30 days from the date of the written complaint or as soon as is practicable thereafter.  It emphasises the issue of time but does not lay down a firm limit.  It is that type of timing which the court can reasonably have regard to.  As Senator Alex White said, to come in with an offer of an apology on the day of the court hearing does not merit being considered in the same light as an apology that is promptly given within 30 days or so of a written complaint.  The wording of this section would be improved if there was some rephrasing to give greater emphasis to the timing of the apology.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>During the various Stages of the Bill, all Members were <i>ad idem</i> in respect of the prominence that should be given to an apology and possibly the time lines.  I acknowledge and welcome the amendment the Minister has tabled because he has taken on board the points that have been made.  While he is not as prescriptive perhaps as we might have suggested with regard to the time line, in the latter part of amendment No. 18, he places an imposition that it should be done as soon as is practicable thereafter.  I recognise that he has responded positively to that.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1746"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of time lines, as Senator Walsh pointed out, the formula used in the Bill is &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  I am being asked to go beyond that and have concepts of strict time limits within which the apology will only operate for the purpose of the section &mdash; within 30 days, which is Senator Regan&rsquo;s proposal, or Senator Alex White&rsquo;s proposal which is that we can have an apology as a substantial mitigation of damage within 14 days.  In the event of a case taking place, the formula &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; leaves it to the courts to determine whether reasonableness and promptitude were observed.  I am not convinced that we, as legislators, should be more prescriptive than that.</P>
        <P>Listening to Senators Alex White and Regan, I thought of future libel textbooks replete with chapters devoted to the subject of the distinction between a substantial mitigation of damage and ordinary mitigation of damage or, in Senator Regan&rsquo;s case, of the reasonable and adequate apology and the amount of jurisprudence and juristic thought which would be expended on it.  It is not desirable for us as legislators to state the law in such a prescriptive form.  It suffices in this context to state the general principle that matters should be dealt with as soon as practicable where an apology is merited and leave it to the courts to determine the application of that to the particular facts.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, line 24, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;automatically&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We had this debate on Committee Stage.  Section 22(3) states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) In a defamation action, an apology made by or on behalf of a defendant in respect of a statement to which the action relates&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) does not constitute an express or implied admission of liability by that defendant.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to insert the word &ldquo;automatically&rdquo;.  Circumstances could arise in which an apology was offered and should not automatically be.  This does not entirely remove the protection to the newspapers and it advances the position of the newspapers as they see it.  I do not understand why simply giving an apology should automatically wipe the slate clean.  There is room for some prudent judgment by a court that would not give any exposure to the newspapers.  The inclusion of <Col N="1747"/>the word &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; would clarify the matter and improve the legislation.</P>

	<P>The Chief Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s advice is that the proposed wording would not be normal in drafting legislation and does not provide for any additional clarification of the provision.  However, the Chief Parliamentary Counsel also warned that it might have the effect of changing the meaning.  I fear that is precisely what the Senator is trying to do in this case.  Of course the whole meaning of the section is very clear.  It is at the kernel of the Bill that the apology cannot be used as evidence of liability.  That section is a pivot for the Bill.  As Senator Norris is very ingeniously trying to remove that pivot, I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, to delete lines 35 to 45, to delete page 19 and in page 20, to delete lines 1 to 10.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raised this matter on Committee Stage during the discussion of the defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest.  The justification for introducing this defence in the Bill is that it is settled law in this jurisdiction.  We have had some discussions on the matter on Committee Stage and the Minister referred to the various case law.  He also said:</P>
        <P LI="1">I agree philosophically with Senators Norris and Regan on this.  Many commentators argue that the issue in defamation should be truth or falsehood.  Absolute and qualified privilege trench on it...</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am surprised that the Bill now on Report Stage does not reflect the views expressed on Committee Stage by the Senators and the Minister.  The fact is that the law is not settled in this area and we are essentially deeming that law established by the British House of Lords should be given a statutory basis here.  That is law which in the main case of Jameel was a two-to-one judgment and <Col N="1748"/>has only persuasive influence in the courts here.  I am not suggesting that there is not an opportunity for the jurisprudence in this matter to be developed in the Irish courts.  It is best left to the courts at this juncture that this defence be developed if it is to be developed.  There is currently an appeal to the Supreme Court that needs to be adjudicated upon, which would clarify the law in this area.  It raises issues of constitutional law.  There is the constitutional guarantee to the right to one&rsquo;s good name and the right to privacy.  On the other hand there is the public interest issue, which is served in terms of the constitutional right to freedom of expression.  Section 18 contains the honest opinion provision, which is appropriate.  However, in this instance, given the constitutional implications and the need for balancing these rights and given that the issue is before the Supreme Court at the moment, the matter would be best left to the courts.</P>
        <P>Originally two Bills were to have been introduced, the privacy Bill and this Bill on defamation.  When the privacy Bill was withdrawn or parked as the case may be, this provision of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest was introduced.  In the absence of the privacy Bill and the law being settled by the Supreme Court, it would be appropriate to stay this matter and not to include it in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I could refer to case law involving material mistakes of fact and publications that are factually incorrect and defamatory but which are given effectively qualified privilege here.  It is an extension of qualified privilege to political information as it were.  I am not sure the manner in which the provision is articulated is appropriate in the light of the unsettled state of the law in this jurisdiction.  I ask that this amendment be deleted and that the matter be left to the courts where the law can be properly developed and the constitutional provisions can be interpreted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I second amendment No. 25.  I take a different view from Senator Regan in terms of what I am proposing in amendment No. 26 as a means of redressing what I would regard as the mischief in the proposed section 24.  I base my comments largely on the debate that took place on Committee Stage.  It is clear not only that there is a large element of disquiet among public representatives to whom I have spoken on the proposed section 24, but also that the disquiet is shared by the Minister and the Fine Gael party.  I will recall Senator Regan&rsquo;s comments on Committee Stage in a moment but, first, I will briefly revert to what the Minister said.  He noted that the proposed section 24 would extend the occasion of qualified privilege to the world at large.  He said that  defamations can, on occasions of absolute or qualified privilege, occur without malice.</P>
        <P>The Minister talks about the judicial precedence not being encouraging in this area, by which it is clear what he means.  I note the Mini<Col N="1749"/>ster&rsquo;s impressive legal credentials but he noted the fact that case law in this area was such as to lead gradually to this kind of defence of fair and reasonable publication being available to media that would defame a person.  The Minister regarded such judicial precedence as not being encouraging.  As Senator Regan noted, the Minister went on to agree philosophically both with my colleague Senator Norris and with Senator Regan.  The Minister said that, wearing his ministerial hat, he was in a difficult position.  He said that were he not to legislate for this area he would leave the matter for the courts where the signals are not encouraging.  He went on to say therefore that the only option is to legislate for this defence of fair and reasonable publication but to restrict it in every possible way.  The Minister said that as a person interested in legal matters &mdash; he understates the position there, I think &mdash; that he never agreed with the Sullivan judgment.  He said the fact that our courts are introducing this defence gradually was disappointing to him.</P>
        <P>I fully agree with the Minister.  This case law is not taking us in the proper direction.  A defence of fair and reasonable publication should not be available because I believe that a person&rsquo;s good name is important.  I agree with what Senator Harris said, by implication, about the importance of investigative journalism.  I note, however, that the expos&eacute;s he referred to &mdash; although I am going from memory &mdash; happened under the current defamation regime.  I have not heard many examples of wrongdoing that were not outed because of the precise content of our defamation laws to date.  Even if there were such examples, I do not see how that could justify defaming a person.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned by the public interest dimension incorporated in the proposed section 24, which seems to suggest that where we are talking about a person&rsquo;s discharge of their public duties, it might somehow be more legitimate to defame them, or that there might be a greater entitlement to the defence of fair and reasonable publication.</P>
        <P>My big difficulty, however, is that the Minister appears to believe that the courts are somehow on this journey, jurisprudentially speaking, and that they cannot be stopped, but that we can somehow legislate to restrict it.  I apologise if I have misunderstood the meaning of what the Minister is saying, but this is why I disagree with Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  The mere deletion of what is proposed would certainly allow the courts to continue in the current direction.  That would have the effect of frustrating the Minister&rsquo;s intent, which is to limit as far as possible the availability of the defence of fair and reasonable publication.  There is another way to limit it, however, which is &mdash; as I have proposed &mdash; to exclude specifically the possibility that the courts might allow such a defence.  It is in the hands of the Oireachtas to determine, subject to the Consti<Col N="1750"/>tution, what the courts decide in these matters.  That is why I did not understand what was said on Committee Stage.  I say that with all respect for the Minister&rsquo;s legal credentials, which are considerable.  I just do not understand why there is an implication in everything that was said on Committee Stage that there was nothing we could do to stop the courts from deciding as they have been.</P>
        <P>I am therefore proposing an amendment that would clearly establish that there shall be no defence based on fair and reasonable publication, or based on the idea that the statement in respect of which the action was brought was published in good faith, or in the context of a discussion which is the subject of a matter of public interest, and so on.  I do not know what to make of the various whisperings one hears that a deal was done under the last Government with captains of the media industry.  I do not think there is any point in discussing that.  Why is it, however, that politicians on both sides of the House regard this proposed section as a retrograde step, yet we seem to be careering towards its adoption in this House?  I do not understand the logic of that.  We are purporting to do something very serious in departing from the principle that if one is defamed &mdash; even if, God help us, one is a public person &mdash; one shall have a remedy in the courts.  Politicians in particular will rue this section if it goes through.</P>
        <P>I work in journalism part-time and have much respect for the very fine journalists who research, report, analyse and comment upon complex and important issues.  I have concerns, however, about journalists who, in my view, do not have the right to defame somebody and not be liable to legal sanction.  Nobody has that right.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention briefly the concerns of a barrister, Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan, who is more experienced than I am in this context.  He is a colleague of the Minister in the Fianna F&aacute;il party but also an eminent barrister.  In addressing the Bar Council conference in December 2007, Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan expressed significant concerns about the proposed section 24.  He said that no analysis of the right to free expression, of which he was aware, had sought to promote it into a form of protection for the dissemination of factually inaccurate material.  Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan also said that the right to freedom of expression should not afford any protection to a false statement.  He said the State must ensure that there is a statutory mechanism available so that a real remedy is available to the victim of such a false statement.  He said that the balance between freedom of expression and a person&rsquo;s right to their good name could be achieved through the simple requirement that the media can publish anything they wish, subject to the laws on privacy &mdash; whenever we have more of them &mdash; and fair trials, or any statutory prohibition such as those that apply in family law proceedings, provided what they say is true.  I could elaborate further, but I will not.</P><Col N="1751"/>
        <P>What is proposed in section 24 will promote and exacerbate a culture of irresponsible journalism.  There is a time to talk about freedom of expression and, if we were in Burma, I would, perhaps, express a different view.  The fourth estate in this country is very powerful.  I do not believe it needs the extra leeway proposed in section 24 in terms of defaming people&rsquo;s characters and getting away with it.  It will undermine a culture of good journalism.  As public representatives, we will rue the day.</P>
        <P>It would be nonsensical for this proposed section to stand given the reservations expressed by the Minister, Senator Regan and others.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would be interested to see whether Senator Regan could bring his party, including members of the D&aacute;il, along on this and whether there might be all-party agreement which would put us all in a stronger position.  While the Minister is a man for whom I have great respect, it sounds to me like he is looking for an excuse to do the right thing.  I call on Members on all sides to take courage in their hands and to not be afraid of negative headlines or bullyragging from some sections of the media who believe they deserve the powers of this section, and to legislate, as suggested in my amendment, to specifically exclude its effect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief as I regret I must attend two meetings this evening.  In speaking to amendment No. 30, I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 29 goes some way towards addressing the points raised here on Committee Stage and during a previous debate on this Bill prior to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Subsection (<i>h</i>) of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment states: &ldquo;if the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events was not so represented, the extent to which a reasonable attempt was made by the publisher to obtain and publish a response from that person; and&rdquo;.  I am asking that such reasonable attempt made by the publisher be made in advance.  When we last discussed this, the Minister stated that would be understood.  However, he also stated in reply to another of my amendments that we cannot leave matters to be determined by the courts or leave issues open.  While the proposed change is minor, it obviates a situation arising whereby with five minutes to the by-line an attempt is made to contact a person and that contact having failed an article appears in the daily newspaper.  While an attempt may be made to contact the person the following day, the damage will have already been done.  The argument could be made, under the section as drafted, that everything possible was done to make contact with the person.  An article can be prepared over a number of days and there is no reason a person, the subject matter of an article, cannot be contacted well in advance of publication of that article.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, I must now leave the Chamber.  I acknowledge and thank the Minister for amend<Col N="1752"/>ment No. 33.  I know we are not dealing with amendment No. 33 now but it addresses the issue raised in amendment No. 34 in my name.</P>

        <P>I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on the rationale for this section as outlined by him in previous debates.  I believe there is clear rationale and logic for making a distinction in respect of what is often referred to as &ldquo;the public figure defence&rdquo;.  I understand Senator Regan when he says we should wait and see how the jurisprudence develops.  There are cases that might influence us in this regard.  However, I do not support my colleague, Senator Mullen, who said we should arrest this section or stop this from happening.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever the issues before the Supreme Court, this section has merit. <Col N="1753"/> I do not support those who seek that it be arrested.  There exists an unanswerable logic and rationale for saying that we ought to regard, in the spirit of promoting public debate on matters of public concern, a man or woman in the public arena as being in a somewhat different position to the so-called little man referred to earlier on.  There is no question but that this is the case.  We must support this if for no other reason than that the Acting Chairman or I must have an opportunity to respond to things said about us.  </P>
        <P>It is true that in public debate people are often offended.  I have suffered this myself.  However, I will not discuss the matter now as we should not discuss in this House issues related to us personally.  People in public life ought to understand that they are part of a wider public discourse.  In my view, it is overly defensive for people to take the view that newspapers should not be rigorous and robust in their dealings with us.  That is the type of democracy in which we live and it should be promoted rather than stemmed in this Oireachtas.  I strongly support this provision.</P>
        <P>It may be suggested this gives <i>carte blanche</i> or a free-for-all to the media to say what it likes about public figures.  However, that is not the case.  The section contains safeguards in this regard.  One could even make the argument that some of the safeguards are overly restrictive.  For example, an over-arching safeguard is that the court must take into account the extent to which the statement concerned refers to the performance by the person of his or her public functions.  It does not relate to any statement made willy nilly about a public figure.  Rather it refers to statements about him or her in the context of the performance by him or her of their public duties.  The notion that this is a free-for-all is wrong.  It is wrong of Senators or anybody else to give the impression that is what is being proposed.</P>
        <P>Subsection (2)(<i>f</i>) refers to the Press Council and the requirement for the court to consider the extent to which its code or a standard equivalent to it were adhered to by the media concerned.  That is vital.  Relevant to this debate is the support which we provide to the Press Council and press ombudsman.</P>
        <P>I also share Senator Harris&rsquo;s scepticism about the notion of a privacy Bill; I have real doubts about it.  I know the Minister&rsquo;s position on it.  He has said fairly he will give the Press Council an opportunity to consider where it will go and what it will achieve, which I appreciate.  I, no more than the Minister, do not want to  pre-empt what might happen in that regard.  I have an innate scepticism about these proposals that appear increasingly to be made that people consider it necessary to restrict the media in the way that has been suggested.  I am not saying we should have a free-for-all position, as many restrictions are already in place, as is right and proper.</P>
        <P>This is a substantial Bill.  It is not a charter for the media to do or say what they want.  It has nuanced some of the existing law and introduced <Col N="1754"/>some new progressive changes.  I regard the introduction of a provision for fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest as a progressive change, which I support.</P>
        <P>Following what Senator Mullen said and my good friend, Senator Norris, teased me a little on the debate on Committee Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I also am a good friend of the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>They both are my friends.  Senator Norris said he was surprised &mdash; I know he was only teasing me but this issue is important as there is a serious aspect to it &mdash; that the Labour Party appeared to be aligning itself with the big media bosses and the press barons.  On occasion, one finds oneself in the same camp as people with whom one does not particularly want to dine or be associated, politically or otherwise, but that should not take from the extent to which it is important for one to come forward and express a view.  I do not know if deals, discussions or anything else engaged in with newspapers, whether with media barons or anybody else, formed any part of the rationale for this Bill.  I very much hope that was not the case.  I am much more interested in promoting debate, however, through newspapers, radio and television, and anything that I say on this debate has that in mind.  I have no interest in being associated with media barons, bean barons or anything else.  I regard this as a fundamental issue of democracy and that is the basis on which I support this provision.</P>
        <P>It appears that in amendment No. 29 the Minister has substantially dealt with the issues raised in my party&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 31 and 32.</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen made some effective points, especially when he referred to the previous debate.  I do not want to rehearse the whole debate because that would be tedious and it is already on the record.  When the Bill goes to the other House, Members of it will have an opportunity to consider the whole debate, including Second and Committee Stages.  We are now on Report Stage and it is not the time to be overwhelmingly tedious and while I am not suggesting <Col N="1755"/>that anyone has been, I might well be in danger of so being.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the Minister said he was philosophically in agreement with me and Senator Regan, yet he is acting in the opposite direction.  That suggests, to use the American phrase, that the Minister is conflicted.  I simply point that out.  He mentioned the Sullivan case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This does not go as far as the Sullivan case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but it is the directional trend which is worrying.  Senator Alex White said that people in public life should be subject to robust and rigorous examination.  I completely agree with him.  Who on earth imagines that I am against robust and rigorous investigation and comment?  I am, however, against untruth, lies and the printing of lies.  We should be careful about where this leads.  However, the Government has the numbers and it will do what it wants.</P>
        <P>In my amendment I examined one of the sections to which Senator Alex White referred which deals with the establishment of the Press Council and the adherence to the code of standards of the Press Council or to standards equivalent to those specified in that code of standards.  What is this equivalence?  That is very woolly.  It is bad draftsmanship and that is why it should be deleted.  If there is a standard set by the Press Council, what are we doing by including such equivalence?  What is this parallel universe that also exists?  This is bad law and bad draftsmanship.  It opens the gate wide enough to let a herd of stagecoaches through &mdash; that is a bit of mixed metaphor.  I am concerned about this.</P>
        <P>I repeat the fact that I am not against robust and rigorous examination.  Senator Pearse Doherty and others referred to the Proclamation of Easter 1916 and the cherishing of all the children of the nation equally.  Likewise, the Constitution of Ireland makes no distinction in the Articles, which I quoted extensively during the previous debate, where the State guarantees to vindicate vigorously the good name of the citizen.  It does not provide that it will do that until the citizen goes into public life.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I do not want to attack Senator Alex White.  He is a decent person and his party has not yet made the jump and done what Tony Blair did.  He was happy to dine with Rupert Murdoch in Australia and that is how the Labour Party got into power in England.  The newspapers owned by Mr. Murdoch had done in Neil Kinnock, so to speak, who was a fine and decent man, and put in the queasy little equivocator, Mr. Blair, instead.  The very fact that Mr. Blair was a nominee of Rupert Murdoch did not appeal to me.</P>
        <P>I will leave it at that and I hope that someone in the other House will take up this point.  We are creating two-tier citizenship.  A person has one set of rights as an ordinary citizen and another set of rights when a person is in public life.  I support robust and rigorous examination but am against untruth.  That is my view and I do not apologise for it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I still find it difficult to believe that a group of legislators who are responsible for changing the libel laws would speak as Senators Norris and Mullen have and appeal to the Minister to circle the wagons around elected politicians.  If the average member of the public could see what goes on in <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Examiner </i>every day and the way the libel laws are used to protect the powerful in this society, reform of libel laws and defamation long ago would have been an election issue.</P>
        <P>It is outrageous to suggest that the legislators here should ring themselves around with a fat protective screen against the scrutiny by the public.  All previous generations of Irish politicians would have rejected it as a nonsense.  We can appreciate that Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, Parnell and all those Irish politicians in the first D&aacute;il lived in a robust world.  When did we become such a precious little group of people that we cannot take public scrutiny?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Several issues arise in regard to this section.  My comments on Commit<Col N="1757"/>tee Stage were precisely that and were made in the context of a proposal that we should not legislate in this area.  Senator Regan has restated that proposal in advocating that we simply delete the section and do not address this issue.  I disagree.  Senator Regan referred to pending legislation before the Supreme Court, but this Bill is prospective rather then retrospective in effect.  We as legislators have a duty to legislate the law in its original form.  This Bill is presented as a codifying and reforming measure and it lists in an exhaustive manner all the defences available in a defamation action.  It is not a desirable state of affairs to say that we should not legislate for this area but instead leave it entirely to the courts.  Many of my comments on Committee Stage must be referred to in this particular context.</P>
        <P>The United States courts, in the decision in The New York Times Company <i>v.</i> Sullivan gave a wide latitude to commentators and journalists to defame politicians.  That is not what is proposed in this section.  In regard to Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments, I am prepared to accept that there can be such a creature as a journalist who decides that there is a public matter upon which he or she fairly and reasonably wants to comment and that he or she can publish something in good faith which, in all the circumstances of that case, it is fair and reasonable so to do.  As Senator Alex White observed, we have subjected this matter to the requirements of our equivalent body, the Press Council.  The courts drew up these judgments in the context of particular cases where they saw a particular difficulty.  There have been several statements by judicial authorities of some eminence that they are prepared to recognise such a defence.  We have a duty, therefore, to state the law.</P>
        <P>There was some reference to the possibility that I may be conflicted or that promises may have been made to media interests.  That is certainly not the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nor did I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen referred to that.  I was open in my attitude to this Bill which was introduced to this House in the lifetime of the previous Seanad.  On my appointment as Minister, I decided to review it.  This included a process of consultation with interests in the legal profession many of whom take the views put forward by Senators Norris, Mullen and Walsh.  I also met representatives of the media organisations, both on the journalistic and the editorial side.  The views of the journalists did not always correspond with those of their editors.  I tried to strike a fair balance.</P>
        <P>Although my initial instinct was to drop this defence, the more I examined it, the greater became my conviction that the Oireachtas should take its responsibility seriously in this area by <Col N="1758"/>stating the circumstances in which the defence could be availed of.  The defence has been recognised not only by our own courts but by courts in the United Kingdom and by other common law jurisdictions outside the United States.  Moreover, there is a view that elements of it have been recognised in the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is better to recognise the reality of this issue and legislate for it.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to accept the fundamental point that in a democratic society, in regard to public discussion of matters of great political interest, there can be an honest journalist who makes a mistake.  Senator Harris has launched vigorous defences of some of the criticisms of the Taoiseach in recent times.  We must be robust in these matters and I agree with him in that regard.  It is not an option, as Senator Regan suggested, to send this off to the Supreme Court.  We have a duty to legislate and lay down the parameters within which this defence can be availed of.  This Bill seeks to do so in a reasonable way.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment No. 29 addresses the concerns raised by Senator Alex White.  This amendment is along the same lines as that proposed by the Labour Party on Committee Stage.  It clarifies the position to strengthen the subsection in terms of imposing an obligation on a journalist.  It is a further strengthening of the subsection in that there must be some &ldquo;reasonable attempt&rdquo; by the journalist to allow the plaintiff to put forward his or her version of events.  This is reasonable.  One cannot, as Senator Walsh advocates, include the words &ldquo;in advance&rdquo;.  Whether a reasonable attempt was made is something that will be judged in the circumstances of a particular case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I respectfully disagree with the Minister.  The matter should be left to the courts because there is at issue here the interpretation of the Constitution and the balancing of the rights of freedom of expression and privacy.  This is the fundamental reason it is not appropriate at this juncture to insert the defence.  This does not negate the evolution of the common law and jurisprudence.  The defence as formulated here is rather crude in the circumstances.  I propose to press the amendment.</P>

	<P>I have reflected further on the proposal Senator Walsh made on Committee Stage and again today and am happy to say that essentially I am accepting his amendment through my amendment No. 33.  Section 24(3)(<i>b</i>) as drafted provides that a court shall not draw an inference from a plaintiff&rsquo;s failure or refusal to respond to attempts by the defendant to elicit the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events.  There was concern, however, that the remainder of the text in that subsection was superfluous and could detract from the no inference provision.  I propose to delete that provision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  If I am right, and Senator Alex White will correct me when he has collected himself, this amendment gives a person a fair opportunity to respond to a potentially damaging article that may appear in a newspaper.   It  must be a reasonable attempt to publish a response.  I have had the experience when highly libellous material was published about me and I got a very muddled call late at night, and so on.  Senator White is attempting to be fair to both parties by protecting newspapers in making this some type of defence but also indicating that they should attempt to obtain in advance and publish a response from the person who is maligned.  That is as I understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak in support of the amendment.  This was referred to in a proposed amendment by Senator Walsh as well, namely, the use of the term &ldquo;in advance&rdquo;.  There appeared to be a lack of clarity on Committee Stage, if I have not misunderstood the situation, as to whether the words &ldquo;in advance&rdquo; should be inserted.  I believe the Minister said at one point on Committee Stage that by definition, the attempt to contact the person would have to be made in advance.  I will not put a strain on the time of the House except to say it is important that the concept of the media making an effort in advance to obtain the view of the other side, so to speak, should be provided for explicitly in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still on section 24, of course.  The Seanad has already amended the Bill and accepted a Government amendment, after the hullabaloo, which has provided &ldquo;the extent to which the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events was represented in the publication concerned and given the same or similar prominence as was given to the statement concerned&rdquo; and &ldquo;if the plaintiff&rsquo;s version of events was not so represented, the extent to which a reasonable attempt was made by the publisher to obtain and publish a response from that person&rdquo;.  That has now been written into the Bill by way of amendment and addresses the substantive concern raised in this amendment.  For some reason, this amendment was not grouped with a similar one tabled by Senator Alex White which he withdrew a few moments ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct and I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 36 not moved.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the respondent failed or refused to accede to that request or, where he or she acceded to that request, failed or refused to give the apology, correction or retraction the same or similar prominence as was given by the respondent to the statement concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 26 provides for the making of a declaratory order by the court that the statement of a respondent is false and defamatory.  Subsection (2) provides that the court shall make the order if it is satisfied on the basis of conditions set out and is consequential on acceptance of amendment No. 18.  The effect of the amendment is that an apology in the context of a request by an applicant for a declaratory order is required to have been given the same or similar prominence by the respondent as the original defamatory statement.  This again follows from the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the principle that apologies should have the same or similar prominence.</P>

	<P>As I explained on Committee Stage, to accept this amendment would be to overturn the very essence of the reforming modernisation of our law on defamation &mdash; to maintain a connection between a lodgement and a failure to accept liability.  Subsection (4), which Senator Walsh proposes to amend, is a critical component of the section in that it ensures both parties to an action are placed on an equal footing at the commencement of the hearing.  Senator Walsh&rsquo;s amendment would have the effect of reverting to the previous position which would require the defendant to admit liability in offering a lodgement prior to a court hearing.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 22, line 37, to delete &ldquo;shall give directions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may advise&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the question of the judge &ldquo;shall give directions&rdquo; to the jury in the matter of damages.  That is pretty authoritarian and again we have gone through all this on Committee State.  However, I want to table it again.  The judge &ldquo;may advise&rdquo; would be much preferable as far as I am concerned because it is not so authoritarian.  They should not give directions but rather advise because it seems to me that we are second-guessing the jury.  Let the judge advise.  Any sensible jury would take very much into consideration the advice of the judge, but to give directions undercuts the role of the jury and that is regrettable.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 29 provides that where a defamation action is brought in the High Court, the judge shall give directions to the jury in the matter of damages.  That updates the existing provisions on an award of damages.  The parties to a defamation action may now make submissions to the court in the matter of damages.  Subsection (4) sets out a number of factors to which the court &mdash; and it is made clear in subsection (8) that this means the jury if the High Court is sitting with a jury &mdash; shall have regard in making an award of general damages.  Of course it is a matter for the jury and that is set out in section 29(8).  However, the judge is entitled to give directions as to the legal obligations of the jury.  That is all the subsection provides.  The jury, as so advised and directed, arrives at its own decision.  The expression &ldquo;directing a jury&rdquo; is a common phrase used in legal practice concerning the advice which a judge gives a jury.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It may be common, but I am tempted to say it is very vulgar, too.  This is <Col N="1765"/>a clear case where the specialised language used by lawyers confuses the public and I am concerned this might happen with regard to the jury.  If members of a jury are told the judge is giving them directions, they probably will believe they are being told what to do, whereas if he or she advises, it means they are just being given parameters.  We have something later about parameters.  I accept that in this area people such as me have had their case substantially weakened by the decision in the <i>Sunday World</i> case, and that was a regrettable occurrence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was nothing specialised about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there was not.  However, the law needs to be looked at and we should try to make legislation that is accessible to the citizen.  Words should mean in law what they mean to ordinary people so that they might have an opportunity to read the legislation, understand it and, if they come within the ambit of a court, have some familiarity with what is going on.  I am not sure this specialised use of language is at all helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris raises a very interesting point.  I do not believe we have arrived at the transatlantic position where the judge can say virtually nothing to the jury other than in the form of a direction, which is the position in the United States.</P>
        <P>When we use the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo;, we use it in a broader sense and resting on the principle that matters of law are for the judge and matters of fact are for the jury.  Defining that boundary is a difficult exercise and one which judges must attempt to do.  The direction refers to the principle that a judge directs the jury as to what the law is.  This is an important principle in our legal system and must be reflected in our legislation.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a quite important amendment and I wish the Government had indicated it would take it on board.  Senator Harris was waxing lyrical about the unfortunate position of people in newspaper offices and the pressures under which they came and he referred also to the storm of libel writs that harassed journalists.  I am a journalist and a member of the National Union of Journalists.  Of course, the trend is worrying to ordinary journalists but it should be made clear in the legislation that, in the case of a successful defamation action, &ldquo;the Editor and Proprietor of the newspaper which published the defamatory statement shall be liable for damages&rdquo;.  It is a question of where the buck stops.  It should stop with the proprietor and the editor and not the ordinary journalist.</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen should be careful in seconding all Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposals because this one refers expressly to the editors and proprietors of newspapers who should not be singled out as a class in ordinary legislation when they are already comprehended by it.  The position is that in any defamation action taken on its own merits, for example, in the case of a newspaper, it is possible to sue the journalist, the editor and the publisher.  This is the case in existing law and will remain so under this legislation.  There is no reason to single out the editor and proprietor as being uniquely venal potential defendants in the context of a defamation action.</P>

	<P>I propose to take amendments Nos. 44 to 48 together because they are essentially linked.  I agreed on Committee Stage to reconsider an issue raised by the Labour Party, namely, that the express permission of the court be required prior to a defendant being allowed to give evidence of any matter that might have a bearing on the reputation of the plaintiff in a defamation action.  I am proposing to provide the requirement to obtain the leave of the court along the lines suggested by the Labour Party.  It will send a signal to the courts that they must be careful not to admit prejudicial evidence in a particular context.  Amendment No. 44 is a consequential drafting amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 49:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 24, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(7) In a defamation action the Press Council may make a recommendation regarding the reasonable parameters of damages and limitation thereto to be awarded in any case where the newspaper apologises in advance of the hearing.  The court must take such a recommendation into consideration in assessing damages.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment would give one tooth to the Press Council of Ireland, a significantly greater number than it possesses at present because all it is allowed to do is wag its finger at people such <Col N="1768"/>as Rupert Murdoch and say, &ldquo;You are very, very naughty and you must never do it again.&rdquo;  I am sure Mr. Murdoch will have to call for the diapers when he is threatened with this sanction.  In my amendment, at least, there is a provision that is very consonant with what the Minister is talking about, namely, advising and giving directions as to the scale of damages.  The amendment provides that the Press Council of Ireland may make a recommendation regarding the reasonable parameters of damages.  This is quite important, especially when the Minister and others, including the editors, feel some libel or defamation awards are excessive.  The provision at least gives some guidelines from the statutory body established by the Oireachtas on the advice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to protect and advise in these areas.  They body already has a quasi-judicial function in these matters.</P>
        <P>I am surprised the Minister has not indicated he will accept my provision because it suggests the court should take into consideration this recommendation in assessing damages.  It seems to establish an organic connection between the Press Council of Ireland and the operation of this legislation.  I would have believed the Government would have welcomed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator Norris and I have not agreed completely on this Bill but there are a number of issues in respect of which we have managed to agree, including this amendment.  It is very helpful and certainly does not interfere with the spirit of the Bill.  It lends a <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> and gravitas to the findings of the Press Council of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am very supportive of the operations of the Press Council of Ireland, as I stated on other Stages of the Bill, and I do not have a difficulty with it.  What attracted me to the proposed approach is that it has a certain precedent.  The legal profession is not a major fan of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, of which I am vice chairman, but in this regard the Minister will be aware that the legislation passed to establish the board included a requirement that the courts would consult the book of quantum which establishes limits to the damages or compensation awarded to those suffering from injuries.  This amendment is similar to that requirement.  It does not break any significant new ground and it would be helpful in creating a certain sense of connection between both bodies in a way that does not interfere with the power or authority of each.</P>
        <P>I examined the proposal long and hard to determine whether it interfered with the courts system, bearing in mind that it would not cause interference in respect of the Oireachtas or any body that would give guidance to the courts.  The amendment comprises an appropriate way to proceed and maintains a clear distinction between the operation of both bodies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with the proposal.  The giving of guidance on damages to be awarded is always desirable.  The Minister stated he accepted the principle that an honest journalist can make a mistake but he appears to have made his statement in the context of talking about the section 24 defence.  However, reasonable and honest mistakes should be taken into account when damages are being awarded.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I also wonder, in the context of the recent <i>Sunday World</i> case which has occasioned considerable comment in this House, although I accept this is not the time for it, whether we need to have a debate on how damages are awarded in defamation cases and whether it should be a matter for juries at all.  There is a case to be made &mdash; it will not be made today &mdash; that we should really think about whether judges are the ones who should make awards in libel cases.  While I have spoken with a view to restricting some of the media&rsquo;s privileges in this legislation, there is also an argument that sometimes members of the public act rather arbitrarily in the way they would treat the media which may have defamed.  In any event, I support this amendment which, as Senator Norris stated, gives at least one tooth to the Press Council.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, the entire Bill is about how one computes damages in a libel action.  Specifically, section 29 sets out the standards to be applied and there is a list of matters which the jury must take into account in arriving at an award of damages.</P>
        <P>Essentially, this amendment is trying to add an additional matter which should be taken into account, namely a recommendation of the Press Council.  Senator Norris presented this as giving the Press Council some sort of teeth, although I fear it would give the courts a substantial toothache in their own teeth if one introduced this provision.</P>
        <P>I will not take a point on the form of the amendment, but it is not clear to me that the amendment in its form respects the principle of the separation of powers because it appears to give undue weight to an opinion of a body, which is not a court or a judge under the Constitution, in the determination of proceedings.</P>
        <P>I take Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point that the intent of the amendment is to set up a Personal Injuries Assessment Board system.  Perhaps there is a case for the Press Council to set up a PIAB-type arrangement for libel claims.  I see the arguments, but it would need to be worked out in far greater detail than this amendment.  If the Press Council came forward with a suitable proposal I would entertain and consider it, but this proposal in its terms cannot fly, so to speak.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In response to Senator Mullen on the question of juries, the Supreme Court has stated the jury is the correct constitutional tribunal to determine issues of liability because the person in the jury <Col N="1770"/>box can make the judgment about whether the particular statement lowers the person&rsquo;s estimation in the eyes of the right-thinking men and women of the community, and that is an important function the jury has in defamation matters.</P>
        <P>On damages, Senator Mullen made the point that one can review the position of the jury there.  Of course, the plaintiff has an option.  The plaintiff need not seek a trial by jury.  A plaintiff can seek trial by judge alone on defamation matters.  It always amazes me how public figures put themselves at risk before a jury in defamation cases and why they do not opt to elect for trial by judge alone.  Of course, if one opts for the Circuit Court and one opts to limit the upper end of one&rsquo;s reputation at a designated monetary figure, then one has a trial by judge alone as well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We are now discussing an obscure corner of the law, namely, the law relating to criminal libel.  Section 35 relates to the proposal to establish an offence of the publication of a gravely harmful statement.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I was considering this matter.  On reflection, I do not think it is desirable to create a criminal offence of the publication of gravely harmful statement.  It is a substantial intrusion on freedom of speech to say to any individual that he or she has published a gravely harmful statement for which one can be made <Col N="1771"/>accountable in the criminal code of this country.  Therefore, I have decided to propose the withdrawal of that particular section.</P>
        <P>Article 40.6.1&deg; creates an offence relating to the publication of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter.  These offences are created in and form part of the Constitution.  Sanctions for the offences of blasphemous and indecent matter, which include both fines and imprisonment, are contained in Part 2 of the 1961 Defamation Act.  The sanctions for seditious matter are dealt with in the Offences Against the State Act 1939.</P>
        <P>If we repeal in full the provisions of the 1961 Act in reforming the defamation laws, we create a gap unless some provision is made for the constitutional offences.  We must be mindful also of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Corway <i>v.</i> Independent Newspapers in 1999 where the Supreme Court indicated a need to address the law on blasphemy.  At this stage I would suggest our duty is to ensure there is no gap created in the case of these offences which are recognised by the Constitution.  Essentially, there is a problem of timing.  I am anxious to expedite the passage of this Bill.  I note the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution has sought submissions from interested parties on issues concerning freedom of expression, including blasphemy.</P>
        <P>At this stage, I propose to delete section 35 from the Bill &mdash; the Labour Party had tabled an amendment in that connection &mdash; and to reflect on what sanctions I provide for blasphemy and the publication of seditious and obscene matter.  I will have to provide for a sanction and that is provided for in the 1961 Act.  I will have to restate some provisions for a sanction for these offences but I do not propose to go beyond that.  I do not think we need go beyond that in the context of legislating in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One must bear in mind that in our law it is a criminal offence for a person to utter or publish words which are directly calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.  A person who uses words of religious incitement at an occasion with the deliberate intention of formenting a breach of the peace commits an offence in our law.  It is likewise with the publication of seditious or obscene matter.  That should be borne in mind by anyone commenting on this provision.</P>
        <P>I am constrained by the Constitution to provide for sanction.  Candidly and as a personal opinion which I am not sure is shared by the Government, I do not see much prospect of a referendum on blasphemy, obscenity and sedition.  We must provide for the penalties of these offences and I must reflect on that, provide for it in another place and come back to the House on it at that stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an interesting decision of the Minister to drop section 35 in its entirety from the Bill.  The rationale for his doing <Col N="1772"/>so is compelling.  Obviously, the amendment my party has tabled will not be proceeded with because it was to amend one subsection of section 35.</P>
        <P>On the Minister&rsquo;s general argument, Senator Regan and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution.  The Minister was Chairman of the committee at one stage.  I noted his frustration &mdash; it was said with a bit of a sigh &mdash; that he did not think there would ever be a referendum on the issue of blasphemy.  I certainly hope that at some point we might find an opportunity, perhaps in a wider review of the Constitution where a number of proposals were put to the people dealing with some of these questions.  The offence of blasphemy is problematic for all kinds of reasons, but I can express my views in that regard at the deliberations of the joint committee.</P>
        <P>What the Minister proposes seems to make sense.  Does he or the Attorney General have any concerns in respect of the balance with which we are now left, namely, that the constitutional offences remain but there are no sanctions in respect of them, and whether that will remain the position, even for the relatively short period for which the Minister hopes or perhaps the somewhat lengthier period than he hopes for?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to bring forward proposals for sanctions in the D&aacute;il and I will bring them to the Seanad.  I have no option but to do that under the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I misunderstood what the Minister said.  That makes sense.  Under the circumstances, I will support the deletion of section 35.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I came here tonight was to talk on these two issues.  I was having extraordinary difficulty reconciling the position on sections 34 and 35.  I welcome that the Government, in an extraordinarily progressive move which has not been recognised outside of here, is taking libel out of the criminal area and making it a civil action.  At the same time, section 35 appeared to provide for jailing people for certain types of libel.  While I had strong sympathy with what was written into section 35 with regard to a person who knowingly and with the intention of causing injury to reputation publishes a false statement  &mdash; I did not have sympathy for a person like that going to jail &mdash; I was trying to prepare an argument that would define and describe differently the crime of libel.</P>
        <P>The Minister is to be congratulated.  What we are about to do is significant, not just in Ireland but in western democracies.  There is no democracy in western Europe which has removed libel completely from the criminal law area.  This is a magnificent move and is a model for many emerging eastern countries where people are regularly put in jail for the slightest libel.  This will <Col N="1773"/>stand the Minister in good stead when dealing with his colleagues in other European countries.  It will also give him the right to talk about free speech and civil rights when dealing with emerging democracies.</P>
        <P>I welcome this important move and hope the media takes note of it.  It is a significant move and makes us the only European country to remove libel from the criminal law area.  That should be recognised and welcomed.  I hope journalists recognise it.  This is an issue the National Union of Journalists and various international colleagues have raised in debate and consultation.  It is something for which people like myself have fought over many years, namely, to achieve this balance between various kinds of rights.  What the Minister has proposed is a step we need to take.  He is also correct in stating that we need to examine the constitutional issues and how they might be responded to in civil law.  It is worth a few bottles of champagne if the Minister can hold his position on this.  I urge him not to be deterred by colleagues in Government when they come to recognise the importance of the decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  This is a significant move on criminal, seditious and obscene libel.  Somebody raised the question of whether blasphemy should be also looked at in terms of the Constitution.  It should.  I remember a case 20 or more years ago in which <i>Gay News</i> was successfully sued by Mrs. Whitehouse.  What was used in that case was a parallel offence of blasphemous libel.  That nearly sank the newspaper, which would have been regrettable.</P>
        <P>On the question of blasphemy, my view is that God, assuming he or she exists, is quite able to sustain slings and arrows of mere mortals in terms of his or her reputation.  What people are usually doing when talking about blasphemy is protecting their own feelings.  It is understandable that people have strong feelings, but this is covered by incitement to hatred.  A number of columnists in one of the main daily newspapers regularly incite hatred against particular religious groups, particularly Muslims, but this can be covered by incitement to hatred.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I welcome what the Minister has done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not expect such a welcome for a matter I thought was an exercise in common sense.  I must warn Senator O&rsquo;Toole that we still have three offences in the Constitution and out of respect for the Constitution I am obliged to provide penalties for those offences.  All of those offences are subject to the sanction of the High Court before the offence can be prosecuted or proceeded with, which is a valuable safeguard.  I am looking at the option of confining the penalty to the seizure of the offending item and seeing whether we need to go beyond that in the penalty clause.</P><Col N="1774"/>
        <P>There are difficult issues with a referendum.  The House of Lords is currently examining in the legislative context the question of blasphemy and its possible abolition.  In England and Wales blasphemy traditionally only consisted in the scandalising of the established church.  It is probably the case in Ireland, with the enactment of the Article 44 provision in 1937, that blasphemy was extended to cover all of the denominations recognised in the Constitution and that in 1972 it passed into a stage where it extended itself to all theistic religions, since all theistic religions are honoured by the Constitution, although Christianity is uniquely invoked in the preamble.</P>
        <P>Christianity in the general sense and, possibly, other theistic religions are protected by the law of blasphemy in our modern law.  There has been no prosecution.  The one attempted prosecution led to the Supreme Court consideration that we should consider modernising the law of blasphemy to protect all faiths.  The difficulty in that regard is that the essence of the offence seems to consist of the hurt that is caused to the believer.  This is a dangerous basis for an offence.</P>
        <P>It is far safer to have an offence based on the incitement to hatred or the immediate proximity of the statement to the causing of a breach of the peace.  If we could redefine blasphemy in that way and if that were acceptable, I would be much more comfortable with the offence.  I am not sure we can do that constitutionally or whether the reference in the Constitution means it is frozen in time with the meaning it carried in 1937.  The all-party committee can reflect on these matters.</P>
        <P>Obscene libel and seditious libel are dealt with by the censorship legislation and the Offences against the State Act generally, in so far as they are mischiefs in society.  There is a specific provision on seditious libel in the Offences Against the State legislation.  The best I can do is to return to the House after the Bill has gone through the D&aacute;il with the proposal for the sanctions that will apply to the constitutional offences.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is concerned with the novel provision that a cause of action for defamation can survive one&rsquo;s death.  I wonder whether this is a matter that would be best dealt with by the Press Council rather than legislation.  I am not sure it <Col N="1775"/>is practical or reasonable.  It carries with it the corollary that if there is a cause of action subsisting against a person, that action also survives against the estate, which would be a burden on a family after the person&rsquo;s death.  I appreciate the background to this legislative initiative but I wonder whether there is a better way of dealing with it than legislating for it in this Bill.</P>

	<P>I am moving the amendment and am asking the Minister to consider it.  I put it in reasonable terms whether there is an alternative way of dealing with the issue contained in this section.  That is why I proposed its deletion.  I suggest it might be better to have it dealt with by the Press Council on issues that arise of the type that has motivated this section.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I hope I have made myself clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we deleted these sections, a cause of action could accrue in respect of defamation of a deceased person.  That is the effect of the amendment proposed by Senator Regan, as I understand it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what I am proposing.  I am not sure that is the implication of the acceptance of the amendment.  If I understand the initiative set out, it is to provide for the survival of a cause of action on death.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>So a defamation action will survive the person&rsquo;s death and the next of kin or executor can sue in the name of the deceased person and recover damages for that person&rsquo;s estate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>And <i>vice versa</i>.  I believe this is what is provided for in the Bill, if I understand it correctly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want to delete this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions in section 38 are a modest advance on the current legal position whereby a cause of action ceases on <Col N="1776"/>the alleged defamed person&rsquo;s death.  Subsection (2) provides that a cause of action vested in a person immediately before his death shall survive for the benefit of his estate.  However, monetary damages are not recoverable.  Only special damages could be recovered.  Subsection (3) provides likewise in respect of the alleged defamer.  Should he be deceased, the cause of action survives against his estate, which is appropriate.  My instinct is to preserve these particular provisions as they stand.  They seem to be a reasonable compromise on this issue.  I apologise for not understanding what Senator Regan said initially.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister understand my suggestion now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Preserving the cause of action after death is cumbersome and problematic.  It is problematic from a legal point of view and for the surviving family because that is the corollary of the section.  This is why I proposed its deletion and suggested that a reformulation where this type of matter could be dealt with by the Press Council might be a more appropriate procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I misunderstood the Senator because of the reference to the Press Council.  I now see exactly what his intention is.  It is a new amendment that was not raised on Committee Stage.  However, it is interesting and I must reflect on it.  I will bring forward proposals in the other House if necessary.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 30, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Any such order made under this section shall be for a period not to exceed five years.</P>
        <P LI="2">(3) After the expiry period for each order the Minister shall conduct a review which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, together with a copy of any new or renewal order.&rdquo;.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  Section 43 provides for the making of an order of recognition conferred on the independent Press Council pro<Col N="1777"/>vided it meets the standards set down in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The section requires both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the matter.  The order of recognition cannot be made without the approval of both Houses.</P>
        <P>The Senator proposes that an order shall be for a period not to exceed five years and that the Minister shall conduct a review of the order.  I believe the conditions attaching to the grant of an order of recognition as provided for in the Bill are adequate.  The current construction of section 43 allows the Minister to review the activities of the Press Council at any stage after the recognition order is made and to take appropriate steps to amend or revoke the order if the Minister is of the opinion that the Press Council is not complying with the conditions attached to the order.</P>
        <P>I do not think it is desirable to write in a fixed, prescribed period of five years or to require the Minister to conduct a review.  The Press Council is independent but if there is a manifest breach of its obligations, it will come to the attention of the Minister and there is ample power to deal with it under the legislation as it stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 56 not moved.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 34, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(3) The quorum for a meeting of the Press Council shall be 7 directors, a majority of whom shall represent the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to provide something which I would regard as being something of an oversight from Schedule 2, namely, minimum requirements in respect of a Press Council.  As things stand, there is no provision for a quorum.  The Government went to great trouble to set out some excellent minimum requirements for a Press Council and specifically require that the number of directors of the council be 13 and that a majority should be representative of the public interest rather than the interests of the owners, publishers or journalists.  I have proposed, therefore, that the law would require also that there would be a quorum for meetings of the Press Council and that this quorum would be seven.  The key issue is that the majority of those present would represent the public interest for any meeting of the Press Council to be quorate.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister would look favourably on this proposal.  It is reasonable and in keeping with the spirit of what is proposed, which is to provide an alternative means for people to have redress when they believe they have been treated unfairly by the media.  For the Press Council to have credibility, it should be established that there would be a majority of members representing the public interest required for it to be quorate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1778"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I am happy to support my colleague, Senator Mullen.  This seems to be a very sensible thing.  Most organisations and groups, including this House, have provision for a quorum.  The James Joyce Centre, of which I am a director, and the Friends of the Library, of which I am chairman, have requirements to be quorate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen is also very sensible to ensure there should be a substantial representative of the public interest so that one cannot have a meeting below a certain level that is dominated by the press interest.  This is not a matter that will strengthen the Press Council.  I already described the Press Council as having no teeth.  I tried to insert one tooth and the Minister repelled my attempts at legislative dentistry.  This is a very wise matter.  I recognise that we are getting very close to the end of the Bill and I imagine the Minister will not be in a position to accept this.  However, he may do what he has done on other occasions, namely, say it is something he will think about and introduce it as an amendment in the other House.  It may then come back up to us.  I am certainly very happy to support Senator Mullen in his intention.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I also add my support to this amendment.  It is a sensible suggestion that protects the decisions of the Press Council so that they cannot be put in the hands of vested interests.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If there is to be a quorum, it should be a requirement that the majority of the seven members of the quorum be public interest representatives.  In those circumstances Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposal is not unreasonable.  The Minister might suggest that type of governance issue might be more properly left to the Press Council itself &mdash; I cannot anticipate what he might say.  It seems to have considerable sense that there should be a quorum.  I imagine it will have a quorum anyway and if so it should reflect Senator Mullen&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">I subscribe to that superstition and I have never attended a political meeting of 13 within my organisation or created an entity of 13 within my organisation or party.  Of course I have had to attend public meetings with 13 present.  Senator Mullen has made an <Col N="1779"/>interesting point, worthy of examination and support.  Some legislation provides for a quorum or at a minimum envisages the fixing of a quorum.  As Minister I must be satisfied about the independence and procedures of the Press Council.  It seems reasonable that there should be some legislative reference to a quorum.  I do not want to tie myself down to the precise formula proposed by Senator Mullen.  I take the point made by Senators that the public interest should be safeguarded in that respect also.  I will examine the issue with care.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senators for the very detailed consideration they gave this legislation.  Towards the end of the life of the last Seanad a debate was initiated which excited great interest in this Bill.  While I will not repeat my view of the Bill, it is a progressive and codifying measure.  I hope it leads to a better relationship between the press and the people for the future.  I found the contribution of the Seanad very useful and the legislation has been amended substantially in the course of discussion in the House.  While the Committee Stage in the other House now takes place in a detailed committee, it is useful to have a Committee Stage in a full House and the Bill has benefited greatly from that.  The amount of time given to the Bill on both Committee and Report Stages has been very welcome and helped focus my mind on the provisions of the Bill.  They have helped improve it to a state whereby D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will not have very much more to do with it.  I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate and for facilitating the passage of the Bill.  There are some matters raised in the debate that will require attention in the D&aacute;il and of course they will revert to the Seanad in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for devoting so much time to the Seanad on the Bill and for being patient with the various amendments tabled.  I thank him for taking on board <Col N="1780"/>some of the suggestions made.  There were some suggestions made today which, I hope, will be reflected in the revised Bill.  On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I express appreciation for the manner in which the Minister conducted the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Independents I also thank the Minister for his courtesy and good-humoured informing of the Seanad on a series of matters.  It is very appropriate that it should be this Minister, because I notice that the Bill was presented by his aunt, then Senator, now Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  The nephew has completed the business.  I am sure the aunt will be very pleased when it is reported to her no doubt sometime during the evening.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister consolidated the functions of this House by accepting some amendments.  One should also compliment the officials who assisted in the matter.  They have continued from the earlier debate before the general election.  They had the job of drafting many of the amendments.  As one who is occasionally a stern critic of certain aspects of the operations of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I should put this on the record of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I regret that the last amendment was ruled out of order, because I would have liked to see a more independent press council.  I hope the issue of public interest will be further ventilated in the other House because it is very relevant.  This morning Ms Clare Duignan on behalf of RTE said with regard to a particular controversial programme that she had taken the word of the film-maker.  She said she was doing so because there were truths which were in the public interest.  In so doing she prejudged the situation.  She also closed her ears to the words of the people whose rights have been most vitiated, the young men in Kathmandu.  I am afraid of this public interest section particularly if it is operated in that way.  I welcome that this long day&rsquo;s journey into night has ended.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid that is Senator Mullen&rsquo;s problem.  The Minister has done a good job.  I do not agree with everything &mdash; that is the way legislation goes.  I very much welcome that he has paid tribute to the work of the House in refining the Bill before it goes to the D&aacute;il.  We are frequently told, including in recent weeks, by several columnists that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is a useless farce and that it never reforms legislation.  A Minister has now indicated that we have done a good job on this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Freedom of the press is a very important element of any democracy.  This legislation has been vitally important to that debate and in securing a robust regime &mdash; if I can <Col N="1781"/>use that word &mdash; of freedom of expression in this jurisdiction.  We know it also has an important constitutional underpinning.  We have better tuned the balance that needs to be provided for as to a person&rsquo;s good name and the important right of freedom of expression.  The debate has been important in that regard.</P>
        <P>There are many journalists, editors and, no doubt, newspaper and other media proprietors who do a very important and professional job.  Much of what is published and broadcast offends people and much of it is offensive and in some cases reprehensible.  However, we must uphold the right to freedom of expression given the important safeguards we have in our legislation and the restrictions that exist.  These changes have not been brought about at the behest of any element of our society, whether newspaper editors, media barons or otherwise.  The question of determining where the public interest lies is a matter for the Parliament of any country and not for any particular special interest, whether they be the owners of newspapers, broadcasters or anybody else.  That is the basis on which I have approached this debate.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on his willingness to listen carefully to what has been said on both sides of the House &mdash; even though our side has not always been in full agreement with itself.  That has also contributed to the debate which has been intelligent and stimulating.  The legislation going to the Lower House is much improved for that reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the Minister for the time he gave to the Defamation Bill in the House.  As the other Senators have said, he has taken a reflective approach taking into consideration the amendments that were given much hard thought and work by the various Senators.  We have struck the right balance in the Bill between the person&rsquo;s right to a good name and freedom of expression and speech.  A column in one of last Sunday&rsquo;s newspapers suggested that satire in the 1980s was not as much fun as it is now.  We have come a long way in the past 20 years in our press and media.  That is something we need to cherish because obviously we cannot go back to the way it was.</P>
        <P>This Bill, which was long overdue, heralds a new era in defamation law and marks a balance between the media and the public.  I think we have struck the right balance.  I thank the Minister for attending the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I still have some of the reservations I had when the Bill was first introduced by the previous Minister, Michael McDowell.  At that time, I found myself in an invidious position because, as Government spokesman on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I was supposed to be promoting the Bill whereas I, along with others, was trying to get as much of it changed as possible.  I still have reservations about it, especially <Col N="1782"/>with the court lodgement and the fact that it will not have an accompanying correction.  The Press Council will not be independent; it is a product of the media themselves.</P>
        <P>Having said that, however, I do not wish to be churlish.  I acknowledge that the Minister listened to every item that was raised throughout the debate.  He took on board many of the suggestions and amendments from both sides of the House, and we should be grateful for that.  I also acknowledge that, as a Minister, he has that advantage but he also has the added advantage of experience of such cases from the Law Library.</P>
        <P>On the previous occasion, Senator Norris and I were the only two Members to contribute to the debate.  I suppose we developed a bit of an unholy alliance on this particular legislation.</P>

May I ask Senator Norris to be less effusive in his terms of endearment?  I would give three reasons he might refrain from addressing me in those terms in future.  First, it is probably unparliamentary; second, it certainly could give rise to a little bit of scandal; but, third, and most important of all, my wife strongly objects to anyone else calling me &ldquo;darling&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Bill is largely a technical measure to cover the relevant bodies.  On the last occasion, I forgot to mention the good work undertaken by the Irish Water Safety Association around the country.  I want to acknowledge that work today.  I appreciate that the Minister of State reverted to me on some queries as to whether the Limerick regeneration projects had CPO or planning powers.  He has now confirmed they do not.  I also sought clarification on service indicators in local authorities, for which I thank the Minister of State.  I look forward to debating the wider issue of local government in general when the Green Paper is published.  </P>

	<P>Amendments which I introduced on Committee Stage created an offence of soliciting or importuning a trafficked person for the purpose of prostitution.  I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel, who drafted the amendment, that the definition of &ldquo;trafficked person&rdquo; used in those amendments might &mdash; I would not put it any stronger than this &mdash; give rise to some confusion as to the meaning of &ldquo;trafficked person&rdquo;.  By deleting the meaning of &ldquo;trafficked person&rdquo; used in the Committee Stage amendments for the purpose of the new Section 6 and redrafting the meaning given to that term in Section 6, any such confusion can be removed. </P>
        <P>Briefly, as previously drafted, the trafficked person who was solicited for the purpose of prostitution could be interpreted as not necessarily being the trafficked person in respect of whom an offence was committed under section 5.  I recommend this drafting amendment to the House.</P>

	<P>I move amendment<?oasys _jy ?>No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">3.&mdash;The Minister shall promulgate a code of victim&rsquo;s rights in respect of victims of trafficking which shall address the following issues:</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) protection of private life of victims;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) appropriate medical assistance to victims;</P>

        <P LI="3">(<i>q</i>) compensation and facilitating legal redress against traffickers.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I apologise, I do not have the relevant papers in front of me.  Perhaps the Cathaoirleach will bear with me while I get them.  Amendment No. 2 is almost identical to amendment No. 3 except in respect of subsection (<i>d</i>) which deals with recovery and reflection periods in the context of a code of victims&rsquo; rights in respect of victims of trafficking.  Subsection (<i>d</i>) of amendment No. 3 proposes we provide a minimum of three months in respect of a recovery and reflection period whereas subsection (<i>d</i>) of amendment No. 2 proposes a period of 30 days in that regard.</P>
        <P>This matter was discussed at length in the D&aacute;il and on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  We are proposing that for us to take an approach to the issue of human trafficking that is truly focused on the victims we must seek not alone to criminalise those who traffic persons but to identify the problems created by trafficking in the round and to look at the suffering of people who are trafficked in terms of their specific needs.</P>
        <P>I accept this legislation is but one aspect of the Government&rsquo;s response to the issue of human trafficking in accordance with its obligations under various international conventions and agreements and that the expert group in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may well have recommendations to make about the specific rights that should be made available to persons who are victims of trafficking.  However, the Labour Party and I are united in believing we should not take it for granted that somebody somewhere down the line will provide for such rights, needs and entitlements.  Rather, they should be enshrined in legislation.  This is the minimum we can do when we consider the awful phenomenon of human trafficking and how friendless these victims are.  When one considers that persons trafficked into this country may well have been coerced, abused and violated, do not necessarily speak the language of the host country and have no friends to whom they may appeal, one begins to get an idea of just what a lonely place they are in and how vulnerable they may be.  This is all the more reason we should seek to <Col N="1786"/>set out clearly the rights and entitlements to be made available to them.</P>
        <P>I ask that the Government reconsider taking on board this proposal to ensure this is not just legislation punitive in terms of those who traffic but proactive in terms of providing for the legitimate and undeniable needs of victims of human trafficking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  As pointed out by Senator Mullen, amendment No. 3 is as close to identical as can be to amendment No. 2 save that Senator Mullen has improved on what is proposed in the latter amendment.  I do not suggest Senator Mullen has changed our proposal, rather the version he has put before the House is a better one in terms of the periods referred to.</P>
        <P>I recall the Minister saying in respect of many of the provisions proposed in the amendment that they are issues that do not require to be addressed by way of legislation.  I have considered this as a rationale for their not being included in the Bill and I do not believe it is a particularly good answer.  As Senator Mullen stated, legislation has the potential to assist significantly in easing the plight of victims of trafficking.  I understand from where the Minister is coming when he says some of these matters do not require to be addressed by way of legislation.  The Minister or a speaker from the Government side stated at the outset of the debate on Second Stage that we needed to take a holistic approach to this serious problem.  The criminal measures proposed in this Bill deal only with part &mdash; though I accept it is a substantial part &mdash; of the problem.  The Government needs also to consider the rights, entitlements and protections that ought to be put in place in respect of victims of trafficking.</P>
        <P>There was much agreement across all parties on Committee Stage in respect of what is being proposed here.  I recall that while several speakers on the Government side were supportive of this proposal, they were unable to support the proposed amendment.  That is a pity.  An opportunity remains for them to deal with this issue in a holistic fashion.  The various subsections proposed by amendment No. 3 are humanitarian proposals.  They relate to the type of medical assistance or accommodation that ought to be provided in any civilised society for people who are victims of trafficking.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">The recovery and reflection period referred to is vital in a holistic approach to the problem.  The issues of residence permits and so on are also vital, as are the provision of translation and interpretation facilities, the provision of all of which we would expect to be associated with this measure being introduced.  While I strongly support the thrust of the Bill, it is wanting in this important regard.  I ask the Minister of State at this relatively late stage to reconsider the regrettably hardline approach the Government has taken to <Col N="1787"/>exclude the possibility of inserting into this important legislation these protections for the victims of trafficking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment and the previous one proposed by Senator Kelly, which it mirrors.  As I said on Committee Stage, there is a lacuna in terms of the protection of the victims of trafficking.  It is suggested that this will all be dealt with in the immigration Bill, but that does not deal with the position of people who are trafficked, particularly from Eastern Europe, which accounts for, as the figures suggest, the majority of people who are brought to this country.  There is a gap in the Bill.  The Minister of State should reflect on the amendments proposed.  Not taking account of the victimisation of those who are trafficked in the provisions of the Bill means it is faulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for making those points on these amendments.  As previous speakers said, the amendments have been debated in great detail in this House on Committee Stage.  The argument basically boils down as to whether the protection of victims and supply of services to them should be dealt with statutorily and administratively.  There is no difference between us in our concern for victims and ensuring they receive proper protection and are in receipt of the necessary State services and those provided by non-governmental organisations, where appropriate.  </P>
        <P>However, from some of the comments made in earlier debates, there may be some confusion as to Government policy on this issue.  I take this opportunity to clarify exactly what we are doing, where our initiatives in this respect are being accommodated and the benefits that will accrue to the people concerned.</P>
        <P>There are three separate but interconnecting strands to the Government&rsquo;s strategy.  The first strand is the Bill we are debating, which deals comprehensively with the criminal law aspects.  Where it is possible to offer protections through the criminal law, that has been done, as can be seen mainly in sections 11 to 12, inclusive.  That is what this Bill purports to do and I have no hesitation in saying it does it well.  Second, most of the persons trafficked into our country would be from outside the European Union.  Therefore, immigration issues arise in some cases.  Those issues are included in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, referred to by Senator Regan.  That Bill includes a &ldquo;no strings&rdquo; attached period of recovery and reflection of 45 days and renewable six monthly periods of temporary residence where the victim is co-operating with an investigation.  It was never stated that immigration issues in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill would apply to anyone other than non-EU nationals, as it is only in such cases the question of residency arises.  The third strand in <Col N="1788"/>our holistic approach, as referred to by Senator Alex White, to combating human trafficking is the drawing up of a national action plan in accordance with the requirements of the Council of the European Union conclusions on trafficking.</P>
        <P>Our difference in approach from that of the Senators who proposed the amendments and spoke on them is one of strategy.  All victims of trafficking will benefit from our strategy, whether they are from the European Union or from outside it.  I said previously that a new anti-trafficking unit, under the leadership of an executive director, has been established in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to drive the discussions on the action plan.  This surely illustrates our determination to put a plan in place as soon as possible to ensure that the protections offered to victims of trafficking and the services to which they will be entitled can be on a properly focused and co-ordinated footing.  The interdepartmental high level group met no later than yesterday in regard to these issues.</P>
        <P>I hope our strategy is more clear in meeting the challenge posed by trafficking in human beings.  It is a multifaceted problem which must be addressed at several levels from creating the offences, enforcing the laws, increasing public awareness of trafficking, international co-operation in what is a transnational crime and protection of victims to ensuring that our immigration laws are no impediment to treating victims generously and humanely.</P>
        <P>I have stated my case as to how victims should be protected and receive appropriate services.  Clearly, not everyone agrees with it and, presumably, there may be a suspicion that administrative services will never be supplied.  In answer to such an argument, I can point to the anti-trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has been established and which will draw up the national action plan recommended in the European Union conclusions on trafficking.  I can also point to Government policy on ratifying the Council of Europe convention.  Failure to implement the provisions relating to victims would mean we could not ratify the convention.  I mentioned previously that there is a strict monitoring procedure attached to the Council of Europe convention.</P>
        <P>While an enabling provision such as that proposed in the amendments might look good, it would not bring forward by even one day a more cohesive policy on the provision of services to victims.  I reiterate that I am as concerned as the Senators who spoke on these amendments to ensure that the interests of victims of trafficking are protected.  I am convinced that the strategy I outlined on how we intend to vindicate those interests is the most appropriate.  I mentioned the unit established in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the national action plan and the interdepartmental high level group.   We have put in place the agencies that will <Col N="1789"/>deliver the services in advance of the legislation going through this House.  That clearly demonstrates that we are determined to ensure that those victims get the assistance, services and help they need and that they will be dealt with in a proper and humane way, as they rightly deserve being the unfortunate victims of such malpractice.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal was discussed extensively on Committee Stage.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment No. 14 is admirably expressed and seeks to bring about the same result, which is to orient our law towards full protection of the dignity of the human person, particularly in respect of persons engaging in prostitution.  I outlined extensively on Committee Stage the reasons that we should take the law in this direction.  Efforts to target those who engage in the trafficking of persons cannot be divorced from the issue of demand, that is, the end users who seek to avail of the services of persons in prostitution.  The latter increasingly include those who are trafficked for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I listened to a debate yesterday on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio show between Geraldine Rowley of Ruhama and a person speaking for those who characterise themselves as sex workers.  Ruhama has been admirably vocal in advocating legislation akin to the Swedish model which provides that persons in prostitution are people to be protected.  Moreover, it sees those who avail of the services of persons in prostitution as exploiters and abusers who seek to violate the dignity of another person by purchasing the use of his or her body and who damage the fabric of society by contributing to the continuation of highly negative and exploitative attitudes towards women.</P>
        <P>I was critical on Committee Stage of the Government&rsquo;s reluctance to take on board the point that we should criminalise the users of persons in prostitution not just because it might in some cases lead to successful prosecutions of users but also because the law is clearly an educator.  This point was denied by implication when it was suggested that the law should not concern itself with moral issues.  I note in recent days, <Col N="1791"/>however, that the Government is anxious to present alcohol abuse as a moral issue in which the law should seek to be an educator, to regulate behaviour and to point the way for society.  I refer to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and subsequent discussion.  The Government seems unwilling to accept that the law can have a similarly beneficial approach if it criminalises the users of persons in prostitution.</P>
        <P>It has been argued on previous Stages in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad that to criminalise the users of persons in prostitution might have the unintended effect of driving prostitution further underground and forcing women &mdash; for it is mostly women we refer to when talking about people in prostitution &mdash; into more dangerous situations and do little to prevent the noxious trafficking of human persons.  I pointed out that this has not been the Swedish experience.  The Swedes criminalised the use of persons in prostitution in 1999.  They have not only not repented of that course but are quite evangelical in advising other countries to follow suit.  Moreover, far from driving the problem of prostitution and trafficking further underground, the Swedish authorities claim there has been a vast reduction in the number of persons in prostitution on the streets and that while thousands of people are being trafficked into neighbouring countries for work in the so-called sex industry, the figure for Sweden runs only to the hundreds.</P>
        <P>The same Norwegian report which suggested that the criminalisation of users might have the unintended effect of driving prostitution further underground showed that the Dutch experience, which was to make prostitution almost completely respectable and above ground, did nothing to prevent the development of an unhealthy and sinister underground prostitution system and that the authorities there now regret the approach they took.  It makes sense that criminalising users will ensure we do not create another potential strategy for those who would traffic persons into the State for work in the sex industry.  A certain amount of this has gone underground already and will remain so as long as we have the Internet and mobile telephones.  These new technologies represent a phenomenon that is difficult to police.  We should not make it more difficult by creating a massive disincentive for the potential user.  That point was all but acceded by the person representing the so-called sex workers on RTE Radio 1 when this person accepted there would be a reduction in numbers.  Representatives of persons working in prostitution oppose legislation according to the Swedish model.  One might expect such opposition from some people who are engaged in this industry, whatever the misery involved.</P>
        <P>I said on Committee Stage that I suspect the arguments which have been thrown up against criminalising users as I have proposed mask other arguments that people dare not ventilate.  We had <Col N="1792"/>the argument that prostitution, as the oldest profession, has always been with us and that there are women in prostitution who are there as a matter of choice.  It has even been argued that a minority of errant and criminal garda&iacute; might seek to blackmail people.  However, one could say of any criminal law that somebody might seek to blackmail a person by making a false accusation.  Among the Garda sources with whom I have been in contact directly and indirectly and who have been involved in policing criminality in the sex industry, there are those who see no problem with the criminalising of users.  They believe it would act as a deterrent.</P>
        <P>Why is no action being taken in the interests of human rights?  Why is the Government citing only one side of the argument?  When I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, on Committee Stage about the social anthropologist whose view the Government was putting forth to support its case, I was given the name of Petra Östergren.  It is disappointing that the Government seems to be basing its arguments on the views of a person who may well be professional but is in the pro-sex worker category.  This suggests a reluctance to engage in fresh thinking.  Ms Östergren is a Swedish writer and social commentator who admits that the women who are at the centre of prostitution policy are rarely heard and often feel discriminated against.  No doubt she is correct in that.</P>
        <P>She has also stated, however, that most of the sex workers she has interviewed reject the idea that there is something intrinsically wrong with their profession or that they should be subjected to therapy or retrained.  This is a type of libertarian, pro-choice attitude to prostitution, taken on board by this Swedish writer and social commentator, who may well be a social anthropologist, and quoted at first anonymously and then named by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody was quoted anonymously in this House.  That is inaccurate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is correct.  It was in the D&aacute;il that she was referred to merely as a social anthropologist.  When I asked him to identify her, he kindly did.  I do not seek to equate the devil with the Government in reminding Members of Shakespeare&rsquo;s observation that the devil can cite scripture for his purpose.  It is easy to create a cloud of misunderstanding or ambiguity by saying there are people on both sides of this argument.  I remind the Minister of State that Ruhama, which has the best record of caring for persons in prostitution, is clear about what it wants.  It wants this legislation to criminalise the users of persons in prostitution.  It argues that such a law is needed in the interests of the people in question and for the sake of civil society.  Ruhama does not believe we should continue to have such an unhelpful and negative attitude towards women.</P><Col N="1793"/>
        <P>I am interested to note that countries near Sweden have been rethinking their positions, although no unanimous position has been reached.  While not everybody in Norway is satisfied to follow the Swedish model, which has been in force since 1999, some Norwegian political parties are giving consideration to developing their law in accordance with that model.</P>
        <P>I wonder whether the Government has a serious interest in fresh thinking on this issue.  The Minister has said that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is keeping the laws on prostitution in other countries under continuing review.  How has the Department carried out that review?  Whom has the Department consulted?  Has it consulted Ruhama and the women who use Ruhama&rsquo;s services?  What conclusions have been reached on foot of the Department&rsquo;s legislative review?</P>
        <P>We need to bear in mind how enormously the prostitution and sex industry scene has changed since this country&rsquo;s most recent legislation in that regard was introduced in 1993.  The advent of mobile telephones and Internet technology, etc., has made it easier for users to access people in private, away from the streets.  Therefore, it is now all the more desirable to introduce clear laws which deter users from engaging in activity of this nature.</P>
        <P>Last Friday&rsquo;s news reports told us about the conviction of a pimp who would not have been caught if it were not for sheer luck and the commitment of a designated vice squad.  The man in question was caught when he walked into an apartment that was being used as a brothel while the vice squad was carrying out surveillance on the apartment.  What has the Government done to equip garda&iacute; with legislation as they try to police the sex industry?  The 2008 scene is very different from that of 2003.  What type of resources have been made available to Operation Quest?  Is the vice squad operating throughout the country, rather than just in Dublin?  Has there been a huge increase in the resources available to it?</P>
        <P>As the sex industry expands in all parts of this country, it is interesting that Garda resources for the Dublin vice squad have been cut considerably, if I am not mistaken.  What conclusions have been reached by the Government on issues like the advertising of prostitution on the Internet and the use of mobile telephones?  What is its view on the running of lap dancing clubs and massage parlours and the provision of call-out sexual services, some of which directly exploit persons in prostitution and others of which provide a mask or a semi-legal environment in which prostitution can take place?</P>
        <P>If we seriously want to address prostitution and protect vulnerable children, women and men, as the Swedish authorities have been courageous enough to do, we need legislation which criminalises users.  Substantial resources need to be made available to those, such as the Garda <Col N="1794"/>sources I have quoted, who want to tackle the sex industry, particularly those who recognise that it involves tackling the users as well as the providers.  As in the case of the alcohol industry, one does not just tackle the supply &mdash; one also tries to tackle the demand.  While we are not seeking to criminalise those who use alcohol, we are trying to educate them in order that they choose to change their habits.  Perhaps it would cost too much for the State to keep people out of prostitution.  If there is an unwillingness to engage in the serious transformative social change that is needed if we are to deal with this issue properly, it is a major tragedy.</P>
        <P>It does not take much to determine the human cost of prostitution.  Roger Matthews, who is professor of criminology at South Bank University in London, was interviewed in <i>The Guardian</i> recently about his new book, <i>Prostitution, Politics and Policy</i>.  He is entirely against liberal solutions to prostitution.  I admit that the Government is not proposing liberalisation in this legislation.  He completely disagrees with the notion of legalisation, as he believes punters should be deterred.  According to Professor Matthews, &ldquo;murders such as those in Ipswich are actually the tip of a very large iceberg&rdquo;.  He believes that many women are in extreme danger.  As he puts it, &ldquo;I have never met a happy hooker&rdquo;.  The remarks of Professor Matthews should concentrate the minds of those &mdash; not necessarily in this House &mdash; who claim that engagement in prostitution is somehow an expression of free choice.  The article in <i>The Guardian</i> states, &ldquo;the most important lesson learned in Sweden, says Matthews, was the need to treat the women in prostitution completely differently from the men who buy them&rdquo;.  Are we doing that in this legislation?</P>
        <P>I remind all concerned that we are not talking about something that is hugely removed from the issue of trafficking.  If one tackles the users of persons in prostitution, one will reduce the market and thereby remove the lifeblood of those who are involved in the trafficking industry.  This amendment, for the purposes of which I have adopted the Government&rsquo;s preferred language, proposes to criminalise anyone who &ldquo;solicits or importunes another person, in any place&rdquo;.  I emphasise, in order that there is no possible misunderstanding, that this amendment would not criminalise just the person who solicits a person in prostitution in the street.  It seeks to target the person in the brothel who accepts the proposal that is made to him or her to avail of the services of a person in prostitution.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="1795"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay.  I understand that this is a tricky and difficult issue for the Minister of State to deal with.  I recognise that a great deal of side discussion, etc., is taking place in this regard.  We need to examine a number of matters.  While amendment No. 14, in my name, proposes to amend the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, its intent is very much in line with that of amendment No. 8.  The only difference is that my amendment is more concise.  It is important that I establish from the outset that its relevance is rooted in the fact that a significant proportion of young women who are trafficked are trafficked for the purposes of prostitution.  That is how the issues of trafficking and prostitution become connected.  The Minister of State has linked them in his comments on various sections of the legislation.</P>
        <P>Prostitution is a triangle in the sense that three groups of people &mdash; pimps, prostitutes and punters &mdash; are generally involved in it.  While prostitution is a criminal offence, just two of the three sets of people involved are criminalised.  The amazing thing about last week&rsquo;s case, to which Senator Mullen referred, is that while it is an offence to run, keep or organise a brothel or live off the immoral earnings of a brothel, it is not an offence to use a brothel.  Even though the money paid by those who use brothels keeps them in business &mdash; prostitution is entirely focused on punters &mdash; we do not take any action against such people.  The issue that arises in this context is whether the State should be involved in moral issues.  I am raising this as more of an ethical, civil rights and human rights issue than a moral issue.  That is where I come from on it.  There is an offence in the prostitution area called &ldquo;living off immoral earnings&rdquo;.  The question of whether we are straying into a moral area does not arise because we have been doing so since 1860, including in 1993.  The moral question is not a new one.  Many of us might ask whether we should get into that, but that does not affect this argument in any way.</P>
        <P>The people who use the brothel, who keep the whole process going, on whom it is focused and whose money supports it are the only ones who can walk away scot-free.  There is something wrong with that.  If prostitution is a criminal offence, why is the person who gets the benefit of it in terms of personal pleasure  let off the hook?</P>
        <P>I have taken a different approach from that of Senator Mullen for the following reason.  The Minister of State will recall that I examined closely the 1993 Act.  When I table an amendment, I always try to make it as incremental as possible.  I prefer an incremental change rather than a revolutionary one because change must be managed and a gradual approach is required.  The Minister of State should consider the impact of what I propose.</P>
        <P>Last week the Minister of State said that prostitution was a crime under the 1993 Act.  At one stage, I disagreed with him but part of my argu<Col N="1796"/>ment was wrong.  The person engaging in prostitution &mdash; the client &mdash; can be found guilty of a criminal offence under the 1993 Act.  There is, however, a conundrum, although we are agreed up to this point.  If a guy avails of the services of a prostitute in a street or public place, they are both guilty if charged, as is the pimp who organised it.  If we move them off the street, it is no longer a crime for one of those three people.  That bamboozles me.  The only way one can interpret that is to say we do not want people doing that type of thing in the street but it is okay if they do it somewhere else.  The fact it is happening in a street or public place makes it a public order issue.</P>
        <P>How can the State, which considers it a crime for a person to live off the immoral earnings of prostitution, at certain times consider prostitution as a public order issue?  If that is the case, it is appalling.  I do not know what moral or ethical standard we would apply if we came to that conclusion.  I do not want to put words in the Minister of State&rsquo;s mouth because I do not know if that is the case.  I am working my way through this.</P>
        <P>I have read all the Acts dating back to 1860, including the 1930 Act which, I believe, referred to street order or street loitering.  It is a process, there is a continuum and it is a clearly understood position.  It would appear there was a view that no action would be taken against the person using the prostitute.  Surely that cannot be right.  If the Minister of State says he understands what I have said but the Government is not prepared to take a position on it, I would understand that.  It would be logical, although I would not agree with it.  I cannot find any logic in the arguments against what I propose.</P>
        <P>The point was made from the Government benches last week that we should consider what happened in Ipswich and what people have learned about the prostitutes there.  This is no &ldquo;Pretty Woman&rdquo; or happy hooker scene.  These people are coping with addiction, desperation, phobias, mental illness and poverty.  As was said last week, those are the issues and I completely agree with that.</P>
        <P>I do not put this forward from a prudish or necessarily moral point of view.  Although I believe it is a moral issue, I am not coming from that point of view at this stage.  Human rights, civil rights, ethical issues and a sense of equity are driving me at this point.  In this triangle of prostitution, the prostitute, the pimp and the punter are, at the very least, all equally guilty or they are all aiding and abetting if they are not acting.  It is impossible to separate one from the other two.</P>
        <P>I refer to the phrase &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo;.  It is almost as if one would sign up to being a sex worker when filling in the CAO form.  I am not suggesting for one second that the Minister of State has said anything like that.  However, there is an attempt outside the House to suggest that people decide whether to become a teacher, politician, <Col N="1797"/>factory worker or sex worker.  The words &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo; are as unacceptable as is the word &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; in another situation.  The words are unacceptable and should not be used by people.  I do not say that to in any way admonish the Minister of State.  The words come into the discussion as we find things at present and that is no reflection on him.  The forces behind this huge industry use those words.</P>
        <P>The other issue with which I wish to deal is the question of driving prostitution underground.  I have tried to look logically, fairly and disinterestedly at this.  Two out of three people will be criminalised but people have said that if the third person is criminalised, it will drive it underground.  Are the other two people not interested in being underground and protected?  We have criminalised two of three which does not seem to have driven it underground, although perhaps it has.  Whether it has or has not, will somebody outline why including the third person would drive it underground?  If we say it will drive it underground, what are we saying by not taking action?  How does that reflect on us?  What is our perspective and read on this?  There are huge questions here.</P>
        <P>I accept this is a very big issue.  Society and democracy have feared addressing this issue which has been on our Statute Book since the 1860s, and perhaps it is a bit unfair to dump it on the lap of Minister of State.  However, three quarters of an hour ago, a Minister took a decision here to decriminalise libel in all sorts of ways.  It was the first time it was done in Europe.  It is a huge issue about which we have talked for generations.  This is an issue on which we could take a similar step which would be a model and a standard-bearer to be copied.  It would give confidence in other ways.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State consider my amendment on the basis that it looks in a fair and equitable way at apportioning blame and criminality to the protagonists in prostitution?</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="7" />
        <P FLI="0">Those protagonists are the three &ldquo;P&rdquo;s, the pimp, the prostitute and the punter.  Blame and criminality should be shared equally.  Neither I nor anybody else here brought the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; into the debate.  Previous generations of legislators deemed it a crime to live off &ldquo;immoral earnings&rdquo;.  It is not for us to decide that this is a new step towards introducing morality into people&rsquo;s lives or interfering in morality in other ways.  That has been done already.</P>
        <P>The impact of my proposal is slight.  I am not proposing a new crime.  The 1993 legislation made it a crime to use the services of a prostitute, but restricted the crime to a street or a public place.  If it is a crime, it is irrelevant where it takes place.  It should be seen to be a crime and those who are guilty on a street should be equally guilty of taking advantage of, or exploiting, vulnerable people, prostitutes, wherever they choose to do so.</P><Col N="1798"/>
        <P>The argument in favour of taking appropriate action is overwhelming.  I urge the Minister of State to respond in that way.  This is not a party political issue.  Members on the other side share my views and I am sure the views of the Minister of State would not differ greatly from mine.  If the Minister of State cannot act on this tonight, will he indicate where, when and how he might act on it?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>The most important thing to remember in this debate is that this legislation deals with human trafficking.  We have arrived at a high degree of agreement in these Houses, and in the country, on what the crime consists of, and what measures are required to combat it.  The Minister of State has responded to concerns raised on this side of the House about the users of the services of trafficked persons and has proposed an amendment to deal with the issue.  </P>
        <P>While I do not criticise my colleagues for raising issues related to trafficking in the debate, I strongly counsel against our doing anything that would detract from the principal objective of this legislation, namely, to criminalise and enforce criminal sanctions against traffickers and trafficking to prevent this scourge.  I counsel against taking the debate, at this relatively late hour, so far beyond the question of trafficking as to require a longer, fuller debate.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said this is a huge issue, which it is.  If it is to be debated here, as it has been in other countries, it ought not to be grafted onto another Bill.  I do not deny that the issues are connected but it would be controversial to introduce the kind of measures Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole propose.  There ought to be a wide public debate on this question rather than introduce it at this stage in this legislation.  That could have the unintended effect of detracting from the principal objective of this legislation to deal with the scourge and scandal of trafficking.</P>
        <P>It is a complex question.  The evidence of the Swedish experience, to which other Senators and the Minister of State have referred, does not point to a settled conclusion.  There are different views about its effect and about what the Swedish Government thinks of its effect.  It is not as settled as the question of the need to combat trafficking.  We have asked the Minister of State to change the legislation, which he has done in some cases.  It all, however, falls under the rubric of introducing measures to deal with trafficking.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to do precisely what I have suggested we ought not do but I wish to point out some of the issues that would require to be addressed were there to be a wider debate.  Senator Mullen says it is all very well to talk of arguments about the oldest profession and so on and Senator O&rsquo;Toole rails against the term &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo;.  While I understand his view, we would also need to respect the views of others, including people who are content to describe themselves as sex workers.  Their voices must be heard.  We <Col N="1799"/>would not be required to agree with them but they are part of the debate and we ought not be so dismissive as to say that people who so describe themselves are deluded in some way because the term offends people, which I can understand.   We need to hear all the voices and as much of the evidence as we can gather if we are to have such a wide debate.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mullen&rsquo;s criticism of people being selective in their arguments, but perhaps we are all tempted to be selective in respect of the arguments that we like.  It is fine for Senator Mullen to say that should not be done but he is in danger of doing it himself when he is so dismissive of some of the arguments made about prostitution.  I do not object to our having that debate, but let us have it in its own right and not tag it onto this vitally important Bill on which the Minister of State, his officials and the Members of these Houses have done significant work.  Let us get this tightly focused Bill into action and have a wider debate on prostitution.  As legislators we must think not twice but ten times about introducing criminal offences which carry sanctions such as fines or periods of imprisonment.  These are big calls for legislators.  Senator Mullen is correct to say the law has an educational dimension.</P>
        <P>To introduce sanctions on people being imprisoned is momentous and involves serious decisions.  The law in the area of criminal legislation cannot just be seen as an educator.  I am not suggesting Senator Mullen said this, but we cannot simply see the law as some form of declaratory entity, which shows how seriously we take matters and so forth.  That is only part of the importance of law, but we must also have regard to the fact that it has real effects.  Let us have such a debate, but not in the context of this item of legislation.  That is my view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot support the amendments.  However, as I said on Committee Stage, the debate as regards prosecuting people for purchasing sexual services from prostitutes requires a wider debate and should have its own legislation.  It is not just that aspect of this particular realm that should be included in that legislation.  We need also to look at brothel keeping and the advertising of prostitution services, the use of the web and the need for a dedicated vice squad, not just in the capital, but outside the greater Dublin area.  Funding for this must also be considered. </P>
        <P>I support the tenet of what Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole propose.  This is excellent legislation and it is needed.  However, I believe we are creating a grey area which appears to suggest it is all right, in one sense, to purchase sexual services from a prostitute of the home-grown variety, but not someone who has been trafficked.  We are creating a grey area, even though the law is already grey.  During the debate on Committee <Col N="1800"/>Stage I heard details of Acts dating back to 1860, which left me somewhat confused.  We require an amendment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  I note a sexual offences Bill will hopefully be introduced and in the event, that is the area where this debate needs to be held.</P>
        <P>It is interesting in the context of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill, as it is proposed and will hopefully be enacted, that  this issue is the one that has bogged us down most &mdash; and attracted the most debate.  It is something the media need to highlight.  I am glad we have had some reaction from the debate in the Seanad on the last occasion.  It is something that needs to be discussed more widely.  Any lay person to whom I have mentioned it over the last week has been shocked by the imbalance of the law in this area.  Many of the men I have mentioned it to just nodded, smiled and put their heads down.</P>
        <P>We need to get rid of the embarrassment factor in our country as to how we treat women.  A wider debate on how women are treated and what we have on the Statute Book to protect them is enormously important.  In that context we also need to have a debate on the purchasing of sexual services.  Somebody told me during the week the only people who want to see criminalisation with regard to the purchase of sexual services are nuns and feminists.  I am neither.  I am not overly religious.  Although sometimes I believe life is turning me into a feminist, I did not start out as one &mdash; or intend to be one.</P>
        <P>That is not what is intended here.  We are concerned with dignity and human rights and treating people with respect.  Another person asked me during the week whether I should like my sister, mother or someone I knew to be involved in this &mdash; and what were the root causes.  This is the type of debate we should have.  Knowing how committed the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, is to the law and trying to get it right, I urge him to see we get some clarity on this issue.  It needs to be brought forward.  It is not for this occasion, and I completely agree with everything Senator Alex White has said in that regard.  We need to get this Bill onto the Statute Book as soon as possible.  However, as a young woman living in Ireland, today, I would rather live in Sweden than in Amsterdam.</P>

	<P>It is true that amendments proposed by Senators Mullen and O&rsquo;Toole hijack this Bill to a certain extent.  In fairness, the trafficking Bill is dealing with exploitation of different varieties, including sexual exploitation.  The Minister has accepted an amendment in the Bill to the effect that those who avail of sexual services from a person who has been trafficked are guilty of an offence.  The amendments are legitimate, even though there is, perhaps, the requirement of a wider debate.  However, if prostitution is illegal, which it is, then there is a case to be made that the ambit of that offence should extend to all those who participate, including the <Col N="1801"/>user.  The case has been made persuasively by both Senator Mullen and Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  It is before us, the amendments are validly made and we must decide on the matter based on the discussions we have had this evening and previously. </P>
        <P>There is an anomaly in the criminal law of prostitution and in fairness to both Senators, they are attempting to address this.</P>

        <P>I am confused as to whether this is the right forum.  Men in here might be shocked to hear me putting a viewpoint from the other perspective, but should I have the wish to avail of the oldest profession in the world, do I have to ask someone, in effect: &ldquo;Are you trafficked from eastern European?&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I do not mind getting help to clarify this.  At the moment, if I try to secure sexual services I have to be sure that the person is eastern European, and then I know I am committing a crime.  However, if I approach someone who has not been trafficked, but is eastern European, then I am safe but a crime may be committed.  I thought that under the Constitution there had to be an element of everybody being treated the same.  I worry that we might be creating an anomaly.  What happens to these trafficked in a couple of years when they might want to become Irish citizens?  I wanted to come into the Chamber to say this, because it is relevant to prostitution and to this debate and needs to be aired.  It is good that there are at least two females who are prepared to air it, because it is not popular to raise the issue. </P>
        <P>I was at a conference in Sweden on drugs a number of years ago, opened by the Queen of Sweden.  I went there to listen and learn and I was tackled the moment I sat down with regard to what Ireland was doing about its problem.  Members will be happy to know the prostitution issue was not central to that aspect.  The key issue at the time was what we were doing about our big drug problem, namely, the alcohol issue.  Those at the conference linked alcohol, drugs, prostitution, sex rings and all that together.  The whole issue of supply and demand was discussed.  I should hate to think we might be creating a difference between one person and another in our legislation.  I do not know how this might be overcome.  I agree with anyone who is calling for a debate on the issue of domestic sexual violence, <Col N="1802"/>sexual bullying and bullying in the workplace.  These are issues which might not be directly involved in this debate.  However, I am told quite often that not every prostitute is forced into prostitution.  They may not be forced into it but, in light of statistics on abused individuals proceeding to abuse, I wonder whether there is a link between those who have been abused and those who enter prostitution.  Overtly they are not forced into anything but much of the pressure is covert and below the radar.  This is worthy of discussion.</P>
        <P>I accept that considerable work has been done in this area and that the legislation is about trafficking <i>per se</i>, but an anomaly is being created whereby one set of rules is being created for one group and a different set for another.  I would like to believe this can be addressed at this late stage.  If not, I hope this Bill will be followed rapidly with other legislation dealing with the issue.  I look forward to a debate on it.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed on amendments Nos. 8 and 14.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to criminalise soliciting or importuning any person in any place for the purpose of prostitution.  In other words, it extends the present soliciting laws to include soliciting in private.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I assume it is intended to repeal section 7 of the 1993 Act as it would overlap with this amendment and cause nothing but confusion.  In that case, the amendment would decriminalise soliciting by a prostitute.  The purpose and effect of this amendment are the same as those of an amendment defeated following prolonged debate on Committee Stage.  It seemed to me during that debate that there was confusion as to the present laws governing prostitution and allied issues.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the present laws.  Some are very old, as most Senators have stated, but most are modern and originated in the 1990s.  On the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1885 and the offences of procurement, there was some confusion over the meaning of &ldquo;procure&rdquo;.  Procurement has been interpreted in case law as bringing about a course of conduct that the girl in question would not have embarked on spontaneously or of her own volition.  It was held that the offer of a large sum of money for undertaking tasks could amount to persuasion and, consequently, an attempt to procure.</P>
        <P>The offences of procuring are: to procure or attempt to procure any woman or girl not being a prostitute or of known immoral character to have sexual intercourse with any other person; to procure or attempt to procure any woman or girl to become a prostitute or to leave Ireland with the intent that she should become an inmate of or frequent a brothel; and to procure or attempt to procure any woman or girl to leave her usual place of abode with the intent that she may, for the purpose of prostitution, become an inmate of <Col N="1803"/>or frequent a brothel.  These offences are clearly out of date and are being examined at present in the context of the preparation of a sexual offences Bill, as a referred to Senator Lisa McDonald.</P>
        <P>The main prostitution offences are listed in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 and were referred to by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole.  Section 7 created an offence of a person soliciting or importuning another person in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  The scope of this provision was questioned on Committee Stage.  First, the soliciting must be in a street or public place.  &ldquo;Public place&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;any place to which the public have access whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge&rdquo;.  The soliciting can be by the prostitute, the customer or the third party.  This is set out in section 1(2), in which it is stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">a person solicits or importunes for the purposes of prostitution where the person&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) offers his or her services as a prostitute to another person [in other words, the prostitute],</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) solicits or importunes another person for the purpose of obtaining that other person&rsquo;s services as a prostitute [in other words, the client], or</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) solicits or importunes another person on behalf of a person for the purposes of prostitution [in other words, a third party such as a pimp].</P>
        <P FLI="0">This has been outlined very well by Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
        <P>Under section 8 of the 1993 Act, it is an offence to loiter in a street or public place in order to solicit or importune another person for the purpose of prostitution.  Again, this offence can be committed by the prostitute, customer or third party and is useful in curbing kerb crawling.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Act made it an offence, for the first time, to organise, direct or control prostitution or to coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute.  Under section 10, it is an offence to live on the earnings of prostitution.  Section 11 recreated the offence of brothel keeping, an offence in respect of which the Garda has had some recent success in gaining convictions.</P>
        <P>Section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act made it an offence to advertise a brothel or the services of a prostitute in circumstances that would give rise to a reasonable inference that a premises is a brothel or that the service is one of prostitution.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, in so far as prostitution is concerned, had two purposes, the first of which was to protect areas of our cities from the harassment, noise and anti-social activities generally that accompany public prostitution.  Those of us who were Members of the Oireachtas in 1992 and 1993 will remember <Col N="1804"/>the public call, through the broadcast and print media, to curb desperate harassment caused by prostitution.  The call was made by community leaders, families and the public at large and the topic was covered constantly.</P>
        <P>The Act protected prostitutes from the clutches of persons who controlled their activities or coerced or compelled them into prostitution.  The provisions of the Act came about after much consideration following an earlier court case that had effectively struck down the soliciting provisions and created a balance that seems to be working reasonably well.</P>
        <P>Virtually all street prostitutes are poor, vulnerable drug addicts who prostitute themselves to obtain money to feed their habits.  No matter what changes are made to criminal law, these unfortunate prostitutes will still be poor, vulnerable and addicted to drugs.  What they require is not a change to the law, which might increase their vulnerability, but the provision of services to enable them to come off drugs, obtain frequent health checks and have a normal, healthy life.</P>

	<P>The problem is a social one and not associated with criminal law.  This Bill is not the appropriate one in which the implement the changes to our laws on prostitution.  The amendment in question has not been thought through in terms of its effects and implications.  I have given examples during the preceding Stages that show that this type of proposal could work to the disadvantage of the prostitute, placing her in even greater danger.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to a radio programme yesterday morning on one of the national stations.  I did not have the opportunity to hear it but understand the person referred to as the sex worker &mdash; Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole quite rightly referred to the unfortunate use of the undesirable term &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo; &mdash; said there may be a reduction of on-street prostitution but that those remaining on the streets would face increasing dangers.  It is important that we recall the lady&rsquo;s comment.</P>
        <P>Changes to criminal law should take place only after detailed research and after consideration is given to their effects.  Changes will be made only after we are satisfied they would improve the conditions of prostitutes and reduce the level of prostitution.  This has been the theme of every contribution in the House this evening and during the previous debates.</P>
        <P>I referred on Committee Stage to an article by a social anthropologist, Petra Östergren, on the effects of the changes to the prostitution laws in Sweden.  I simply referred to the article as outlining the point of view of prostitutes in Sweden, whom the laws are designed to protect.  It makes sobering reading and, if nothing else, would make any responsible person who had any regard for the plight of prostitutes to at least do more <Col N="1805"/>research on this entire area.  It is a major social issue that requires detailed research and consideration, after which effective legislation should be implemented.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in his best m&uacute;inteoir style, involving the when, the where and the how, asked us what we were doing about this matter.  I referred to the preparation of legislation on sexual offences.  Since the Committee Stage debate in this House Senator Lisa McDonald has contacted me inquiring about the exact position on the preparation of laws on sexual offences.  Prostitution offences, in particular child prostitution and the sexual exploitation of children, where our main concerns lie, are being examined in the context of that legislation.  If we are satisfied following a thorough examination of the laws governing adult prostitution that changes to those laws are justified, appropriate provisions will be included in the Bill.  I outlined previously in this House that this is an issue that needs detailed consideration.  I am sure that this House and the D&aacute;il will have the opportunity to revisit this important issue in addressing these issues with the appropriate legislation.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White and Regan stated that the legislation before us is the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill 2007, which is an important point.  The debate in both Houses has been important.  There has been extremely detailed work put into the preparation of this legislation.  The Bill was extracted from the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill so that we could bring forward that legislation to give those necessary protections to those unfortunate people.  We have fast-forwarded extracts from that greater Bill to ensure, as Senator Alex White stated, that we could deal with these particular issues.  He correctly stated that the focus has been placed in that Bill in dealing with the issues before us.</P>
        <P>I repeat that we are not putting in place legislation that will not be followed up by the appropriate services and regulations.  Unusually, we already have in place the services, and a particular office, to drive these programmes to assist these people before the Oireachtas passes the legislation.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Regan made the same point, that it is important we do not lose the focus on the human trafficking issues in this Bill.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole correctly asked if we can expect a criminal law (sexual offences) Bill.  The reality is we have a considerable amount of work done in this area.  I have had sight of the second draft of such a Bill.  It is not a completed product and we have a great deal more work to do on it.  Work is in hand in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on all of these issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen asked what conclusions we had reached.  We have not reached conclusions because we are realistic enough to know that we will do our research and consultation before we reach conclusions to ensure we get the legislation <Col N="1806"/>right.  Senator Mullen, at the end of his lengthy contribution, made one apt comment.  He stated that the issue of prostitution he was addressing in his amendments, along with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, was not significantly removed from the trafficking issue.  That clearly shows that we need to deal with the issues in the Bill before us and the other valid issues that need to be addressed shall be addressed in the appropriate legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I compliment Senator O&rsquo;Toole on amendment No. 14.</P>
        <P>There are a number of issues to which I want to respond briefly.  I note a certain disquiet.  Generally, I am disappointed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  I know he as an individual means well but he must carry the can for the Government here.  I am not as convinced as he is that the Government is engaging in fresh and properly researched and informed thinking here, and particularly on the authentic search to try to vindicate the welfare of persons in prostitution.  I say that with no apologies.  I know the Minister of State is personally sincere but I am not happy that the Government has looked at this properly, I have said why and I do not resile from that.</P>
        <P>Part of the problem here is that there is almost a squeamishness about speaking about this issue because it is seen as somehow an unacceptable kind of moral issue.  There has been a long tradition of debate about the extent to which the law should seek to enforce morality.  Students of law will remember the great Hart and Devlin debates.  We should not be ashamed about speaking of some issues as being moral ones.  It is immoral to commit murder.  It is true to say that there are some moral issues that we do not seek to enforce using the law, for example, rightly, we do not try to criminalise adultery.  However, let is not be afraid of speaking of some issues as having a moral content because whenever one speaks of looking out for other people, one is in the area of morality or ethics &mdash; the terms are interchangeable in my view.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest what Senator Alex White had to say.  I felt that there was a note, albeit a respectful one, of censure in his voice.  It would be important to state that people should not misconstrue our passion on this issue for some kind of a lack of respect for different points of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, that is what I was worried about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important not to misconstrue, as I believe might be happening.  It was Senator O&rsquo;Toole who deplored the use of the term &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo;.  He is correct.  It does not mean to say that there are not people who describe themselves as sex workers who may be perfectly sincere.  It does not mean to say that we deny or would seek to deny the right of people, such as the person who appeared on the radio yesterday speaking for some women in prosti<Col N="1807"/>tution, to express a viewpoint.  However, it does mean to say that we are entitled to believe that they may be badly misled in their view.</P>
        <P>I should not have to remind people that this is an issue, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, of civil rights, human rights and human dignity.  It is important to speak with passion and to challenge the <i>status quo</i> way of thinking when one is speaking of protecting or seeking to protect other people.  There have been cases through history where people blithely threw up arguments that there were two sides to a matter.  In the end people&rsquo;s rights get ignored, not necessarily trampled on in every situation.  Sometimes the people are quite well-meaning but, nonetheless, people&rsquo;s rights get ignored.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a day when we see more clearly that one way, among many other necessary measures, we can have due regard for the equal dignity of men and women in our society is to criminalise those who would exploit other persons&rsquo; bodies.  It is simply unacceptable that there are certain people in our society, especially men, who in terms of their attitudes towards women see these kinds of services as ones that women can be legitimately expected to provide, provided of course that there is consent.  That is why there is a problem with using terms such as &ldquo;sex worker&rdquo;.  I do not say that the Minister of State used it, although one of his colleagues in Government used it in a different context a few years ago when he referred to a commercial worker.  That normalises the exploitation, primarily of woman.  Let us be in no doubt about that.</P>
        <P>I also note that Senator Alex White made many references to the fact that there is not agreement.  Of course there is not agreement.  There are few issues on which there is unanimity.  Senator White referred to certain doubts in the Swedish establishment about their law.  I would be interested to hear about those.  The only doubts I heard from the Government came from those who are advocates for the commercial sex worker point of view, which is a point of view which people have a right to hold.  I have described it as a pro-choice point of view which seeks to defend the business.  However, I have shown it is difficult to speak of choice in a situation where there are no happy hookers, as I cited from <i>The Guardian</i>, and where people often find themselves, as Senator McDonald so eloquently suggested, in this business through circumstances of life which militate against any kind of free choice being exercised.</P>
        <P>There is rarely unanimity on issues.  There is an active lobby, which has found a listening ear in the Government, which seeks to oppose legislation according to the Swedish model.  They have thrown up enough doubts, either to convince this Government intellectually or to enable this Government to choose the path it was going to choose anyway.</P><Col N="1808"/>
        <P>I am disappointed that I do not appear to have managed to convince people.  I was surprised at the Minister of State, referring to me, state that the matter was not hugely unconnected.  Let me be clear that what I am trying to get across is the point that it is difficult to separate the issue of the need to criminalise the users of persons in prostitution from the issue of trafficking.</P>
        <P>The United States Trafficking in Persons, TIP, report is published annually and the Department will be familiar with it.  This year at a meeting in the US embassy in Dublin attended by NGOs and representatives of the new anti-trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was interesting that our colleagues in the United States wanted to know what efforts countries were making to decrease the demand for trafficked persons.  I hope I have made it clear that by creating a disincentive for the user, we would make the country a colder house for traffickers, because fewer persons would be willing to avail of the services traffickers are only too willing to provide.</P>
        <P>This is an issue that will not go away.  It is, in a way, a tragedy that we have to think twice about these amendments.  The message should be as obvious as issues to do with the radical essential dignity between men and women and different races.  I hope that day will come.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole was particularly eloquent in exposing some of the bogus argument on this issue.  Senator White referred to the law as an educator.  He appeared to agree and disagree with me by turn.  Take, for example, an issue such as infanticide.  Clearly, the law does not seek to punish the person who commits infanticide, but nonetheless, it is a very much a part of trying to normalise a certain attitude towards a very tragic human situation that a criminal law exists.  The comparison may not be great, but it should illustrate the fact that sometimes the law seeks to send out a message, but very much soft-pedals the issue of punishment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this situation the law seeks to send out a message towards the potential users.  It does not so much seek to soft-pedal the issue of punishment, but seems to recognise that it might, in some cases, be difficult to get a prosecution.  The hope would be that the mere fact that trafficking is criminal, would prevent certain people from seeking to avail of the services.  I remind the Minister of State and Senator White that the Swedish experience has been that they have fewer trafficked persons into their country.  We heard the argument on Committee Stage that one of the down sides of criminalising trafficking was that we would have dispersal.  This as much as admits that the traffickers will go elsewhere because they will not find solace to the same extent.</P>
        <P>I accept this amendment will not be accepted.  However, I put the Minister of State and others on notice that the issue will not go away.  The Minister of State is not the only person who has researched the issue.  I believe the Government <Col N="1809"/>has not done enough research on it and has been selective in the choice of issues on which to lay stress.  I remind it again that it does a disservice if it even implies that organisations such as Ruhama &mdash; I do not say the Minister of State did imply, but he came close to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen, without interruption.  I ask Senator Mullen not to invite comment from the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We shall agree, honourably, to disagree.  I want to put on record that the people in Ruhama, with whom I have a lot of contact, have paid close attention to this issue.  They are much better informed than I am and, I dare say, than the Minister of State, about <Col N="1810"/>the complexities of this issue, as they have been tracking it for many years.</P>
        <P>Some 15 years have passed since we last had legislation in this area.  The climate has changed enormously, but we have not seen any significant evidence of Government attentiveness to the shifting situation with regard to the sex industry.  There  is no denying that.  However, the people in Ruhama who accompany women in prostitution and would do nothing to put them in danger are clear that they seek legislation that would criminalise the users.  They are to be applauded for that.  Admittedly there are people with other points of view.  They are entitled to their point of view and their points of view must be heard, but this does not mean that they should carry the day, particularly when put against the views of dedicated, diligent and careful people involved in the accompaniment of persons in prostitution who would do nothing to put them at risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These people are supported in their view by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have worked in tackling the sex industry.  Some of these take the view that not only would persons in prostitution not be endangered by criminalising the users, but that this would be a very desirable measure in bringing down the number of persons involved in prostitution by discouraging potential users and thereby making the country a colder house for traffickers.  That would be a good thing and I look forward to the day we bring that situation about in the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">6.&mdash;(1) A person (other than the person or persons who trafficked the person) who sexually exploits a trafficked person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction on indictment -</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, or</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) at the discretion of the court, to a fine.</P>
        <P LI="2">(2) In proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the Defendant to prove that he or she did not know and had no reasonable grounds for believing, that the person in respect of whom the offence was committed was trafficked.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with the offence of sexually exploiting a trafficked person and includes prostitution, pornography, etc.  Members will be relieved to hear that I have already said much of what I have to say in the context of the previous amendment.  There is a definition of sexual exploitation available in the Bill.  I do not want to <Col N="1811"/>misquote the Minister, but if I recall correctly, on Committee Stage he basically said that trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation would be covered.  However, I do not believe all situations are covered, for example, where A trafficks a person into the country for exploitation, whether in the labour market or in the sex industry and down the line, B, who was not involved in the trafficking, is making pornographic movies and seeks to engage the services of a trafficked person.  That is the type of activity this amendment seeks to criminalise.</P>
        <P>It will be of comfort to the Minister of State that there can be no doubt of the connection between this and the issue of trafficking, because we are talking about a person who is a trafficked person and who gets used down the line by somebody who may not have been involved in the trafficking but who uses them in the sex industry in some way.  The amendment also provides that there would be a defence where the defendant could prove that he or she did not know and had no reasonable grounds for believing that the person was trafficked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mullen raised this issue on Committee Stage.  I undertook to consider the amendment before Report Stage to see if there was a gap in the law that needed to be plugged.  Following an examination of the issues involved, I am satisfied and advised that the Bill is strong enough to cater for the situation envisaged in the amendment, which has been resubmitted in a slightly different format.</P>
        <P>Human trafficking is an offence against the person.  It is different from people smuggling, which is an offence against the State.  Persons who are smuggled into a country, usually economic migrants who have paid a substantial amount of money to the smugglers, are free when they arrive at their destination.  The smugglers have no further interest in them.  This is in total contrast to trafficking, where the trafficked persons on arrival at their destination are enslaved by the trafficker or by another person to whom the unfortunate trafficked person has been sold.  This is the reason human trafficking has been described as a modern form of slavery.  The trafficked person has no independence and he or she will remain under the control of the exploiter, whether the exploiter is at that stage still the trafficker or another person.</P>
        <P>The definition of &ldquo;trafficks&rdquo; in the Bill incorporates all the persons in the trafficking network, from the trafficker him or herself to any person who subsequently takes control of the trafficked person.  As long as the trafficked person is of value to the exploiter, he or she will be in the care or charge of the exploiter and will be under his or her control.  The trafficked person would be also in accommodation provided by the <Col N="1812"/>exploiter.Therefore, under the provisions of the Bill, a person who is comprehended by the definition of &ldquo;trafficks&rdquo; who sexually exploits a trafficked person for any of the purposes listed in the definition of &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; would be guilty of one or more of those offences.  Almost certainly, the trafficked person would not consent to the sexual abuse set out in the definition of &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo;.  Even where she did consent or appear to consent, under section 5(2), that would not be a defence for the defendant in any case brought before the courts.</P>
        <P>The effect of the amendment would be to criminalise a range of activities with a person who may have been trafficked but is now a free agent.  At this stage, if it was ever reached, the person who had been trafficked but was now totally free to do as he or she wished would be in position that was no different to that of any other person who had not been trafficked.  The conduct that makes up the definition of sexual exploitation of a trafficked person is a mixture of conduct which would, in any case, be an offence and conduct which may not, depending on circumstances, be an offence.  An example of the former is paragraph (<i>d</i>) of the definition, that is, the commission of an offence specified in the Schedule to the Act of 2001.  An example of the latter is paragraph (<i>a</i>), which is the production of pornography.</P>
        <P>I hope I have adequately explained why this amendment is unnecessary and would offer no additional protections to trafficked persons, as would be its intention.  It would also be bad law in that one person could be criminalised and face up to life imprisonment for doing something which, if done by another person, might not even be an offence.  If Senator Mullen wishes to initiate a debate on any aspects of what is included in the definition of sexual exploitation, such as our attitude to pornography, that is his right.  Such a debate might not be a bad thing.  Any changes to the law on such issues could only follow a public debate and would have to take into consideration such modern technologies as the Internet, mobile phones and satellite television.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 10 in the names of Senators Kelly, Hannigan, Prendergast, Ryan, McCarthy and Alex White arises out of Committee Stage.  Amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 13 are related and may be discussed by agreement. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment<?oasys [jy?>No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
<P LI="2">&ldquo;12.&mdash;A victim of an offence under this Act shall not be prosecuted for entry into or presence in the State or for carrying out the <Col N="1813"/>labour or sexual acts, insofar as such entry, presence or carrying out labour or sexual acts were a consequence of the trafficking of that person.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Acting Chairman rightly indicated, these are three linked amendments.  By leave of the House, I will read out the amendment because it is important that we are absolutely clear about what is being proposed.  Amendment No. 10 proposes that a victim of an offence under this Act shall not be prosecuted for entry into or presence in the State or for carrying out the labour or sexual acts, insofar as such entry, presence or carrying out labour or sexual acts were a consequence of the trafficking of that person.  It is important to clarify that it is not a proposal to accord an amnesty to persons in all circumstances.  There is no suggestion that a free for all is being advocated or that<i> carte blanche</i> is being extended.</P>
        <P>What we are talking about is a measure which would put in place a regime whereby the victim could not be the subject of a prosecution in circumstances where he or she had been trafficked for the purposes of that particular activity.  I am not sure what the Minister of State&rsquo;s response will be.  I cannot remember precisely what the Minister said on the last occasion in respect of this.  Again, it comes back to the question of a holistic approach, if I may dare to use that phrase again.  We talk about the measure to prohibit trafficking and introduce stringent sanctions for it.  We must have regard to the fact that the victim of trafficking must be protected.  Is there any more important provision that would protect the person in those circumstances than a provision which says that we will not prosecute them for carrying out any of these acts in circumstances where they were trafficked to this country for that purpose?  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I agree with what Senator White said in his explanation of the amendment.  This is an essential obligation of compassion.  We need to revisit what this legislation should be about.  It is not merely about complying with our international obligations.  It is about remembering the persons who are at the heart of all of this, namely, the victims of trafficking.  </P>
        <P>It would be wrong if a person who is shown to be a victim of an offence under this Bill could then be prosecuted being undocumented or engaging in activities which they were trafficked to engage in.  It is important that the law sends out a strong message of solidarity with the victims of trafficking.  It would be wrong if this legislation left this House without establishing this non-prosecution provision firmly, given that it is not going to set out a charter of victims&rsquo; rights, as Senator Alex White, his Labour Party colleagues and I had hoped.</P><Col N="1814"/>
        <P>To go back to the amendments we discussed earlier, how inappropriate would it be if a person who used a person who has possibly been trafficked down the line in the way I sought to criminalise with my last amendment walked free while a person who was a victim of trafficking could be subject to the rigours of the law?  That would make a farce of this legislation, despite the best intentions of the Government in bringing it forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate on these amendments.  All of these amendments would grant total statutory immunity from prosecution to victims of trafficking in the various circumstances provided for in the amendments.  I have major concerns about amendments like these which I mentioned before and to which I will refer briefly.  </P>
        <P>I draw the House&rsquo;s attention to section 124 of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.  It provides for a no-strings-attached 45-day period of recovery and reflection for victims of trafficking.  At the end of that period, the victim is entitled to a further period of temporary residence of six months, which is renewable, where that is necessary for the victim to assist the Garda or other relevant authorities in respect of any investigation or prosecution arising in respect of the trafficking.</P>
        <P>In respect of people who have been trafficked into Ireland from within the EU, who would probably be relatively few in number, the simple fact of the commission of an offence is not sufficient reason to deport a person.  Persons who are citizens of another EU country have a high standard of rights of residency in our country.</P>
        <P>An action plan is being drawn up by the high-level group which we discussed earlier.  The group is contacting stakeholders, including the Director of Public Prosecutions concerning all matters of relevance to human trafficking.  While I cannot predict the detail of what may be in the plan, it is relevant that in other jurisdictions, such plans offer guidance to prosecutors concerning persons who have trafficked into their countries.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, I referred to the independence of the DPP.  This is not something we can shrug off when it suits us.  As Members are aware, under section 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1994, the DPP is independent in the performance of his functions.  This is something we should cherish and I have every confidence that he performs his functions in an independent, fair and effective manner.  The DPP may decide not to prosecute where it is in the public interest not to do so.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, I also referred to the dangers of offering a blanket immunity from prosecution in legislation from the point of view of it being seen as an inducement that could be cited by the defence in the trial of an alleged trafficker.  Again, this argument was shrugged off as <Col N="1815"/>unimportant.  It is great to be able to do so when one has no responsibility for the fallout from those particular amendments.  I, on the other hand, must be cognisant of the advice I receive and cannot ignore very real arguments about the DPP&rsquo;s independence and the possibility of a statutory immunity being interpreted by a court as an inducement.  I understand the thinking behind the amendments and the supporting comments made by the different Senators.  No reasonable person could defend the prosecution of victims of trafficking for offences concerned with their fully accepted status as victims.  I have full confidence in the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use their discretion and good sense and have regard to the public interest when dealing with the alleged victims of trafficking.  For those reasons I regret I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised at the Minister of State saying at least twice in his contribution that this amendment proposes blanket immunity from prosecution.  It does not.  The reason I read out the text of the amendment was to try to convey to the House that it is not a proposal that comprises blanket immunity from prosecution.  It is most unfair for the Minister of State to describe it in those terms.  There is not much difference between this proposal and the other two, with which it is grouped.  My amendment proposes immunity from prosecution in respect of &ldquo;entry into or presence in the State or for carrying out the labour or sexual acts&rdquo;.  However, that immunity attaches only to possible prosecution in respect of those offences where they happened as a consequence of the trafficking of that person. It is not the sort of blanket immunity from prosecution about which the Minister of State talked.  It is confined to these alleged acts.</P>
        <P>We say, as others have said, that with all the infrastructure we are rightly putting in place to address trafficking it is wrong to leave this thread hanging, whereby a victim still has an exposure to prosecution.  Victims of trafficking will remain exposed to prosecution in respect of their entry into or presence in the State or the carrying out these acts in circumstances where they were a consequence of their  trafficking to this country.  I am surprised the Minister of State has characterised in the way he has.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes to give an alleged victim of trafficking six months&rsquo; temporary residence which may be renewable in the State.  I do not propose to go into any detail on this issue at this time.  It will be more appropriate for discussion when the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill comes before the House after Easter.  I am sure Senator O&rsquo;Reilly will have the opportunity to contribute on that important Bill.  I have already referred to section 124 of that Bill, which provides for a no strings attached period of reflection and recovery of 45 days.  It also provides for a further period of temporary residence of six months in certain circumstances which may be renewable.  The person who decides whether a person is a suspected victim of trafficking is a Garda superintendent.  There are other differences between section 124 and this amendment and they can be discussed when the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill comes before this House.</P><Col N="1817"/>
        <P>I take the opportunity to repeat an undertaking given by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and me previously that in the period between the coming into operation of this Bill and the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, the provisions of section 124 will operate on an administrative basis.  I hope that meets with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s concerns.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I should have said in the earlier discussion that this amendment does not go as far as the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment, in that it would provide immunity from prosecution only in the context of a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;entry into or presence in the State&rdquo;.  I recognise that limited strike is unlikely to succeed and therefore I will not press the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, after line 13, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">15.&mdash;Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 is hereby amended as follows&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) by deleting the words &ldquo;in a street or public place&rdquo;, and</P>
        <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) after the word &ldquo;prostitution&ldquo;, to insert &ldquo;or any person who uses the services of a prostitute&ldquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Long Title states clearly that it is for the purposes of amending certain enactments, some of which are named, and to provide for matters connected therewith.  This issue was addressed clearly by Senator Regan and he is correct.  Senators who believe this amendment goes beyond and refocuses the Bill are incorrect &mdash; it does not purport to do that.  Sections 5 and 13  make reference to the 1993 Act.  It does not change it but takes elements from it.  I do not say that in an argumen<Col N="1818"/>tative way nor do I direct that comment at the Minister of State &mdash; I direct that comment in another direction altogether.  It is quite in order, as the Government has done in parts of the Bill, to provide for matters connected therewith because that is included in the Long Title of the Bill.  That is the way it stays.</P>
        <P>The issues are inextricably linked; these are related matters.  We should not leave the Bill as it is without agreeing amendment No. 14.  That amendment does not decriminalise prostitution.  It merely moves prostitution to a level playing pitch wherever it takes place.  Whether it takes place in a public or other place it ensures the person can be charged.  It is inextricably linked with trafficking to the extent that if we leave the Bill as it is, we will have the situation as outlined by Senator Keaveney that if somebody goes into a brothel and avails of the services of a person who was trafficked, it is a crime and if somebody avails of the services of a local person it is not a crime.  In terms of equity that is a daft way to leave things.  It is no more than a tidying up issue.</P>
        <P>It is never too soon to do the right thing.  The strongest and most passionate contribution on this matter was made by Senator McDonald on Committee Stage and I agree with every word she said.  However, tonight she took the position of a Government Senator, to which I do not object.  It was similar to St. Augustine in that they want to do the right thing but not quite yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LisaMcDonald"><NameTxt>Senator Lisa McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>All I am saying is that I have total empathy with the points the Senator made.  This amendment is a tidying up exercise.  It would not mean a major change.  It would simply create a sense of equity and equality of guilt wherever it happens.</P>
        <P>I am not raising the big debate of legalising or otherwise prostitution.  I am simply saying that what is criminal on the street should be criminal elsewhere.  I am suggesting that if it is criminal to do it with a trafficked person, it is criminal to do it with a local person.  Those are not difficult issues.  On that basis I am pressing the amendment.</P>

I note the Minister of State&rsquo;s earlier comment that this Bill is but part of a wider set of measures with which we will tackle the evil of human trafficking in our midst.

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Dromclough national school, Listowel, County Kerry, has been already brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Science by Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan, who shares my interest and concern in this regard.  I wish also to raise the situation at Rahan national school, Mallow, County Cork.  </P>
        <P>Both schools have experienced various problems for many years.  Of concern to both schools is their position on the Department&rsquo;s list.  The Department&rsquo;s school building programme is based on various stages including stage 1, initial sketch; stage 2, design; stage 3, tender, action, evaluation and award; stage 4, construction; stage 5, hand-over of works and so on.  Two problems arise, namely, the Department regularly changes the stages of development and there is no clear transparency in this regard.  I know that the Minister of State has had to deal with these issues.  Schools must be kept informed of their position on the list and of their progress from year to year.</P>
        <P>Dromclough national school has experienced subsidence in sections of its building; the heating failed completely and had to be replaced; pipes underneath the building are broken and floors are cracked.  One might well ask what the problem is.  The problem is that the school has been waiting more than two years for a site visit and is having difficulty obtaining information through Tullamore and the various press offices.  When one phones the building section, one is told it communicates only with the Minister&rsquo;s office and when one rings the Minister&rsquo;s office one is told to ring the building section.  This has happened.  I have a record of it in my office.  I spoke to a person in the building section and was told to take up the matter with the Minister&rsquo;s office.  When I contacted that office I was told to take up the matter with the building section and the person in the Minister&rsquo;s office with whom I spoke then put me through to the same person in the building section who earlier could not deal with my query.  The system is a nonsense.  We have complained about procedures in the HSE on various <Col N="1822"/>occasions, but I have outlined what is happening in this Department.  I should not have to raise this matter here.  I should know exactly what is the position in regard to these school projects, what will happen next in the process, when the next stage will occur and what is the likely stage of projects in the process.  That is simply not happening.</P>
        <P>We need to know the reason Drumclough national school has been waiting one and half years for a technical team visit, and the names and locations all the schools on the list awaiting a technical visit.  The Minister usually appoints such a team at the beginning of each year, but we do not know the exact date of that proposed technical visit.  We do not know why the school was not assessed, when it will be assessed, who will assess it and where it will be ranked on the list.  I could go on about the position of this school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Rahan national school has a problem of rat infestation and a school building issue.  The project is at stage 1, preliminary level, but it should be processed to stage 2 because it has been designated as a school that needs to accommodate the requirements of a principal and eight teachers.  Why has a stop been put to the school&rsquo;s progressing to the next stage of project?  The board of management had an open discussion with the Department of Education and Science in Tullamore last month about the position, but the Department would not commit on the position.  It has said that a ministerial decision is required and that the project is subject to funding, whatever that means at this stage.</P>
        <P>The principal of Rahan national school told me that the school he attended in the 1960s was in better condition than the school of which he is principal.  This position is appalling.  There are many schools in a similar position.  The principals and teachers in these schools do not believe their pupils are getting the chance to which they are entitled in a modern 21st century school.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is how the schools progress from step to step in this process.  Members should not have to raise the case of three or four schools on the Adjournment every week.  We should know where schools are on the list of projects and the schools that move up the list.  Such a list should be no different from an accident and emergency list, a waiting list to see a consultant or to have an operation.  The position should be clear and projects should move from one stage of the process to the other.</P>
        <P>Transparency is needed in this process.  While I appreciate that the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply will be circumscribed, as that is the nature of these matters, can he tell me when these two schools will be given clearance for the process to move to the next stage?  If he cannot tell me that, can he tell the problem preventing such clearance in these two schools?  We are not aware of any problem, the school authorities have met the demands and done everything required of them, but they <Col N="1823"/>still do not know what will happen next.  I look forward to a positive reply from the Minister of State and to hearing that something will be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who is unable to be here.  I assure the Senator that I will bring the contents of his contribution to the attention of the Minister tomorrow.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department of Education and Science.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, almost &euro;600 million in public funding is being provided for school buildings during 2008.  This will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary schools projects that will deliver 7,000  additional  permanent school  places  in new  schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools; construction work on 150 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation scheme which will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools; in the post-primary sector construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects, which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new schools; and  additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit over 7,000 pupil attendees; the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme particularly in rapidly developing areas; and the progression of new projects through architectural planning and design stages.</P>
        <P>On 1 February last, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, announced the first tranche of projects that will proceed to construction this year.  Further announcements will be made as the budgetary position for 2008 allows.  Construction is also due to start in 2008 on the first bundle of PPP schools, while further will be offered to the market next year with a view to building work commencing in later years.</P><Col N="1824"/>
        <P>This is an enormous programme of work by any standards and, while there will continue to be a focus during the year on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also deliver improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools and extensions to provide additionality in rapidly developing areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To address the projects of particular concern for the Senator, Dromclough national school is a co-educational facility with a current enrolment of 193 pupils.  Since 2001, this represents a modest increase in enrolment of 29 pupils.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, seven mainstream assistants and three learning support-resource teachers.  The school authority submitted an application to the Department for large-scale capital funding for an extension project.  The long-term staffing figure, on which accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  It has been agreed that accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal, eight mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>Rahan national school is also a co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 91 pupils in September 2007.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, three mainstream class teachers and one permanent learning support-resource teacher.  The school has applied for a new school building.  The long-term staffing has been agreed at a principal, eight mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P>Both these projects attract a band two rating.  The next step for them is the appointment of a design team.  This will be considered as the school building programme is rolled out over the coming months.  In addition, an application by Rahan national school to replace temporary accommodation this year has been approved by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and point out that over the lifetime of the national development plan the Government is providing funding of &euro;4.5 billion for school buildings.  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable my Department to ensure that school places are available where they are needed.  This investment will allow my Department to continue the school building programme which commenced during the lifetime of the last national development plan when well over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</P>
        <P>I will bring the Senator&rsquo;s contribution to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minster of State for his reply and appreciate what he said.  I wish to make two points following his reply which <Col N="1825"/>he might also convey to the Minister.  He said it was agreed that accommodation should be provided for Drumclough national school, of which the school authorities have been advised.  I am trying to ascertain for them what will happen next in the process and when it will happen.  The Minister of State does not have the answer to that question and I do not blame him for that, but the answer should be known.</P>
        <P>What I find depressing about this process is the time wasted.  I hate the waste of parliamentary time, whether in regard to parliamentary questions in the other House or Adjournment matters in this House.  The official with whom I dealt in the building section of the Department &mdash; whom I will not embarrass by revealing the individual&rsquo;s name &mdash; asked why, if I was so concerned, I would not raise this matter as an Adjournment item.  We are wasting our time like this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principal of Rahan national school asked me where is the dignity for the pupils progressing through a lovely rural location being taught in tight cramped substandard accommodation.  What the Minister of State has told me in good faith is that the next step for these schools is the appointment of a design team and that this will be considered as the school building programme is rolled over the coming months.  That is stated as if this process started today, but it went on all last year and the year prior to that.  The applications have been agreed and the next step is for them to be considered as the school building programme is rolled out.  There is no honesty in this system.  The school authorities should be told that the additional accommodation will not be provided or it will be provided next year, in six months or is under examination.  A major operation is taking place in this respect and the Minister of State, myself and the people in the House tonight are being sucked into part of it in a time-wasting project.  I do not understand it.  It  is not an efficient business model by which to operate and it is utterly depressing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, for his attendance.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s additional allocation of &euro;50 million to disability services in budget 2008.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on the projects to which this money is being allocated.  In particular, I seek an assurance that this funding will be ring-fenced for disability services.</P><Col N="1826"/>
        <P>I understand several service level agreements between the Health Service Executive and disability service providers are due for renewal.  At present, the obligation placed on service providers relates purely to service quantity.  Will the Minister of State use his influence to ensure the new service level agreements that will shortly be entered into between the HSE and service providers will include an obligation in regard to quality of service and the implementation of guidelines for the investigation of allegations of non-accidental injury and abuse?  I welcome the recently issued draft quality standards in respect of residential services for adults with intellectual disabilities.  Will the Minister of State provide an assurance that any such guidelines and standards, when finalised and adopted, will form part of the service level agreements between the HSE and service providers?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State provide an update on the revision of the Children First guidelines?  I understand this revision commenced approximately 18 months ago and that the initial draft is awaited.  The inclusion of an obligation regarding quality of service and the implementation of guidelines for the management of allegations of non-accidental injury and abuse is of particular importance given that State money will fund these services.  It is essential that we learn from the past by ensuring services provided for persons with disabilities are both safe and of a quality to enable these vulnerable individuals to enjoy a good quality of life and to have the opportunity to realise their full potential and participate fully in society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this issue.  I am responding in the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  At the outset, I emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have made in disability services in recent years.</P>
        <P>The national disability strategy, launched in September 2004, reinforces the equal participation in society of people with disabilities and provides for a framework of new supports for such persons.  This programme, together with the enhancement of other key support services, is a key factor in building the additional capacity required to ensure services best meet identified needs.  The strategy builds on a strong equality framework which is reflected in a range of equality legislation.  It puts the policy of mainstreaming of public services for people with disabilities on a clear legal footing.</P>
        <P>The main elements of the strategy are the Disability Act 2005; the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004;  the sectoral plans published in 2006 by six Departments; the Citizens Information Act 2007; and the multi-annual investment programme for disability sup<Col N="1827"/>port services for the period 2006-2009.  In launching the national disability strategy, the Taoiseach also announced the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a multi-annual investment package for disability-specific services over a five-year period.  Since the launch of the strategy in 2004 until the end of 2007, &euro;420 million in revenue and capital funding has been allocated to services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, &euro;50 million was allocated in budget 2008 by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for the provision of disability services.  The Health Service Executive proposes to allocate this &euro;50 million under several headings.  In regard to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism, by the end of  2008, 200 additional residential places will bring the total number of places to 8,462; 467 additional day care places will be provided, bringing the total number of places to 25,196; and 53 additional respite places will bring the total number of places to 4,533.</P>
        <P>In respect of services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities, by the end of 2008, 80 additional residential places will bring the total number of places to 914 and 200,000 additional hours of personal assistance or home support will bring the total number of hours provided to 3,200,000.  In addition, 140 multidisciplinary team posts are being allocated to disability services to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children, as provided for in the Disability Act, with a particular focus on children under five years of age.  By the end of the current multi-annual investment package in 2009, it is expected that 1,235 new residential places, 398 new respite places and 467 new day care places will have been commissioned for intellectual disability services, in addition to 380 new residential places and 1,150,000 extra personal assistance or home support hours for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that all residential facilities for people with a disability are independently monitored and inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, as provided for in the Health Act 2007.  The HIQA has been assigned important powers to examine the nature and quality of services and to determine whether they are of the standard to which people with a disability are entitled as a right.  The authority has commenced work on standards for designated residential centres for people with a disability and these will form the basis for statutory regulations and inspections.  The HIQA is keen to get these standards right and is inspecting all residential services against an appropriate benchmark.  I understand it is the authority&rsquo;s aim to finalise formal standards in 2008 and to commence formal inspections in 2009.</P>
        <P>Service level agreements are currently being finalised.  The HSE and the Department of Health and Children are in discussion on the pro<Col N="1828"/>vision of these agreements.  Among their provisions will be a requirement on service providers to establish and maintain a formal policy and complaints procedure in regard to protection from abuse that is accessible to all service users, their advocates and carers.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Corrigan for raising this issue, as she has done on several occasions in this House.  I will be glad to convey the points she raised to the Minister, Deputy Harney, and to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, who has responsibility in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for one of the most comprehensive replies we have received on the Adjournment.  I ask him to convey to the Minister that while I welcome the HSE&rsquo;s proposals for the allocation of the additional &euro;50 million, I ask that she use her influence to ensure the money is spent on the proposed projects.  I am conscious that moneys allocated in the previous year&rsquo;s budget for mental health services, particularly in regard to people with physical and sensory disabilities, were not used for that purpose even though specific projects were proposed and great detail was provided in respect of each of them.  The funding was not assigned because the HSE had identified other priorities for which the money was required.</P>
        <P>The projects to which the Minister of State referred are worthy and will have a significant impact.  I am delighted that the new service level agreements will include the requirement that there be procedures in place for the management of allegations of abuse.  When the chief executive officer of the HSE, Professor Drumm, was in Leinster House for the last HSE briefing for female Members, I was shocked by his statement that there was currently no obligation in the service level agreements in respect of either quality of service or the management of allegations of abuse.  I welcome the developments in this regard to which the Minister of State referred.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Smith.  I call on the Minister for Health and Children to review and revise the cancer care strategy to ensure that cancer care services at Sligo General Hospital, including breast surgical and diagnostic procedures, are maintained and enhanced.  There has been much comment on this issue in the media in recent days.  The contributions on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last Thursday, Professor Drumm&rsquo;s remarks at last week&rsquo;s meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, Professor Tom Keane&rsquo;s comments on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday and the remarks made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, last night all indicate that the HSE has absolutely no intention of taking on board the points raised in this House in the con<Col N="1829"/>text of maintaining cancer care services, including surgical and diagnostic procedures, in the north west.  This is totally and completely unacceptable.  It is my sixth time to raise it in the House, while many colleagues from all parties have raised it in this House and the other House.  It is extremely frustrating and disappointing.</P>
        <P>It is an understatement to say that the entire population of the north-west region is disappointed.  Approximately 250,000 people, in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, west Cavan and parts of Mayo, live in a region that will, in effect, be left without an excellent service that has stood up to scrutiny.  How would the HSE know about the service when, by its own admission, it has failed to undertake an audit of service, infrastructure or outcomes?  The outcome of the service provided to 480 patients in Sligo was recently benchmarked against the outcome of the services covered by the surveillance, epidemiology and end-result, SEER, database, which is run by the US National Cancer Institute.  The survey found that the outcomes in the north west were as good as, if not better than, those in the SEER database.  The HSE has not undertaken such an audit of service because it is not interested in it.  All it wants is to shut down certain services, thereby disenfranchising the entire north west.  The HSE has not consulted the existing health professionals in the area, despite the fact that they provide a proven multidisciplinary approach, with triple assessment and all the necessary services and undertakings which are consistent with services of excellence.  The HSE seems to have something against the north west.  It is not remotely interested in the region.</P>
        <P>I would like to rebut a number of points made by HSE staff in media interviews over recent days.  When Professor Tom Keane was interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday, he said that the debate on this decision is over.  A number of consultants in the north west have told me that the debate never took place.  The decision to promote eight centres of excellence was made by a cabal within the HSE, albeit based on the executive&rsquo;s so-called international best practice, by selectively choosing aspects of some reports and not others.  I do not want anyone to suggest that I do not support the centres of excellence or that I am demanding services in every corner.  It is wrong to disenfranchise a section of the country &mdash; 250,000 people &mdash; but the HSE has decided that this area should not be serviced.  Professor Keane&rsquo;s suggestion that it is fantastic that the HSE intends to supply grants is an insult to the intelligence and integrity of the people of the north west of Ireland.  I do not accept it.</P>
        <P>Professor Keane also said that travel is not an issue.  One need only ask people in their 60s, 70s and 80s about the distress caused by having to travel long distances to be diagnosed and treated to know that Professor Keane is wrong in this instance.  It is simply inexcusable that we are allowing this to occur.  It is clear from the defini<Col N="1830"/>tive points that have been made over recent days &mdash; by the Minister, Deputy Harney, on television last night, Professor Keane on the radio yesterday, and Professor Drumm last week &mdash; that the direct intervention of the Taoiseach, through the Minister for Health and Children if necessary, is required if the constitutional right of the people of the north west of Ireland to share the same rights as anybody else in this country is to be upheld.  I do not see how anybody, on the basis of any selective interpretation of the facts, can disenfranchise or dilute the level of human rights to which we are entitled under our Constitution.  It is simply unfair and unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I entered elected politics six years ago.  I was born a Fianna F&aacute;il supporter and I will always be one.  My family has been associated with Fianna F&aacute;il for many decades.  I have never known it to be Fianna F&aacute;il policy to seek to deprive the people of the north west of a service that is equitably available in every other part of the country.  On the contrary, Fianna F&aacute;il was established to ensure that the people of the north west get the same level of service and equity of access as every other part of the country.  In my view, it has always sought to do that.  Why and when did that change?  I plead with the Minister of State to deliver the message loud and clear that I am demanding that the people of the north west receive the same quality of treatment as the other citizens of this great nation.  The people of the region, who pay the same taxes and support the same politicians, of all parties and none, who come to this House to legislate and introduce measures on their behalf, deserve better.  On behalf of the people of the north west, I appeal to the Minister of State to join my plea to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children to deliver levels of service to the people of the north-west region which are in line with those delivered within the Fianna F&aacute;il tradition over the decades since the foundation of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator MacSharry for raising this important issue.  This is not the first time I have heard him outline in great detail the need to provide and retain services in the north west.  I will reply to the Senator on this issue on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who is unavoidably absent.  I welcome this opportunity to set out the current position in respect of the restructuring of cancer services, with particular reference to Sligo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, Professor Tom Keane has been appointed to lead and manage the establishment of the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  Professor Keane, who has ambitious plans, has made significant progress in implementing the programme.  The key objective of the programme is to ensure equity of access to services and equality of outcome regardless of geography.  It will involve a significant realignment of cancer services to move from the present <Col N="1831"/>fragmented system of care to a system that is consistent with international best practice in cancer control.  The HSE&rsquo;s decision to provide for four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2008 and between 80% and 90% of the transition by the end of 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE western region, which includes County Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  If diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, much of the treatment other than surgery can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  For example, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.  Sligo General Hospital has a dedicated 15-bed inpatient oncology unit and a dedicated eight-bed day services unit.  Cancer day care units will continue to have an important role in delivering services to patients as close to home as possible.</P>
        <P>The implementation of the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease will ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible results.  The standards provide that each specialist unit should manage a minimum number of 150 new breast cancer cases per annum.  Sligo General Hospital had 57 such cases in 2006.  The National Hospitals Office will transfer full responsibility for all symptomatic breast services to the national cancer control programme by the end of this month.  The programme recently completed a detailed review of resource requirements to create capacity for the progressive transfer of all symptomatic breast cancer services to the eight designated cancer centres, with the objective of completing 60% transfer by the end of this year and 90% transfer by the end of 2009.  Funding of &euro;5.8 million has been allocated from the programme across the eight centres to support additional staff, including consultant, radiography, nursing and clerical posts.  Funding has also been allocated for some necessary additional equipment.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland, in <Col N="1832"/>accordance with best international standards.  The developments I have outlined will ensure that a comprehensive service is available to all patients with cancer in the western region, including County Sligo.  Senator MacSharry has outlined cogently and clearly his faith and trust in the services which are being delivered at Sligo General Hospital.  As I have said, Senator MacSharry has raised this important issue on a number of occasions in the context of the success of the unit in Sligo General Hospital. Constituents in the western part of my county who have attended Sligo General Hospital have been extremely happy with the level of service provided there over the years.  I will ensure Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s comments are brought to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and fully appreciate that he will bring the issues to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, but I also ask that they should be brought to that of the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>I raise a point of correction.  In 2006 there were 57 or so cases in Sligo while there were 93 in 2007.  I do not necessarily want a centre of excellence in Sligo but I want one in the region.  There would be case levels in excess of 170 to 250 in the region, depending on whether one includes Mayo.  I appreciate the reply but it was clearly done by those in the HSE who back up and are sticking to the argument that Sligo had only 57 cases in 2006.  It had 93 cases in 2007, so we are not comparing like with like.  I do not know why the HSE is set against the north-west region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a huge issue which also affects west Cavan in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency.  We must be true to the people.  I appreciate the Minister of State will bring the points to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and I must insist that the matter be brought also to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, Professor Keane said people were voting with their feet on this issue, which was extremely disingenuous.  He was talking about Beaumont Hospital, possibly connected to the Portlaoise scenario.  There is absolutely no evidence to suggest people currently attending a symptomatic breast clinic in the north-west region have voted with their feet and stated they do not wish to be treated in that region.  It was disingenuous of Professor Tom Keane to say that.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and accept he will bring the points to the attention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
