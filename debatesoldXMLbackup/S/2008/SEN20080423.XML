	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the new accident and emergency unit at Mercy Hospital, Cork, is fully staffed and open 24 hours a day without further delay.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to press for the launch and funding of the report on the sub-committee on arts in education under the Arts Council which relates to the Departments of Arts, Sports and Tourism and Education and Science.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider issuing an apology to the families of the people killed in the Ballymanus Mine Disaster prior to its 65th anniversary 9 May 2008.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly of the following matter:</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, a Senator was cast out from this House on the reputation and integrity of members of the Judiciary.  Senator Jim Walsh yesterday stated that the Chairman of the Mahon tribunal was acting as an effective shop steward for the tribunal.  His exact words were and, I quote, &ldquo;we must recognise that the chairmen of some of the tribunals in fact use their position in order to act more or less as shop stewards for the wealthy legal profession&rdquo;.  That is a disgraceful comment by a Senator in this House, one which Senator Walsh has refused to withdraw.  It casts a slur on the motivation, integrity and honesty of members of the Judiciary in carrying out their duties in the public interest.  It suggests that judges act in the interests of a particular profession rather than in the interests of public good and justice.  </P>
        <P>Senator Walsh has refused to withdraw the remark.  This cannot be allowed to pass.  Simply withdrawing from the House is not enough.  I have read the transcript and listened to a recording of the proceedings.  I believe the reputation of this House has been damaged by the remark made yesterday in the House by Senator Jim Walsh.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Cathaoirleach referred to the importance of the separation of powers.  The issue was also referred to by other Members.  It is a cornerstone of our democracy and it is critical it is respected in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  I do not believe it was respected yesterday by the comments made.</P>
        <P>The tribunals were established by the Houses of the Oireachtas and any effort to undermine their work is unacceptable, improper and inappropriate.  If there are political charges, they can be responded to in a political manner.  However, undermining and confusing this House by impacting on the separation of powers is not acceptable in a democracy.  It is also dangerous.  I wish to put the following motion to the House: &ldquo;That this House regrets and distances itself from the comments of Senator Jim Walsh.&rdquo;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I dealt yesterday with the surly remark made in the House in accordance with Standing Orders 49 and 50 and will allow no further discussion on the matter.  I want to put on record that the independence of the courts is enshrined in Article 35.2 of the Constitution which states, &ldquo;All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this Constitution and the law.&rdquo;  </P>
        <P>Equally, the role of the Oireachtas is set out in the Constitution and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this separation of powers is respected in the Seanad.  As I stated on election to the position of Cathaoirleach, my approach to Seanad business has been always based on co-operation and consultation.  However, this must be balanced with ensuring Members respect other constitutional bodies.  I appeal to Members to think twice before making sweeping statements in this House.</P><Col N="271"/>
        <P>I am unable to accept Senator France Fitzgerald&rsquo;s motion.</P>

	<P>I have received no prior notice of the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I give the Cathaoirleach notice now that I wish to move this motion on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have to submit the motion in writing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I can submit it in writing to the Cathaoirleach now.</P>

	<P>The Senator must submit the motion in writing to the office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the seriousness of the situation, it is imperative the House shows its upset and displeasure at what happened here yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Standing Order 26 applies to motions.  The exact timeframe within which motions must be submitted is enshrined in that Standing Order.  I must observe Standing Orders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the Cathaoirleach accept the motion in view of the exceptional circumstances and the slur cast on the reputation of the work of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad is sitting today and tomorrow.  It is a matter for the Senator if she wishes to submit the motion to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I discussed this matter with Senator Fitzgerald and I am happy to second that motion.  I am also happy to accept the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling on the basis that the House knows the motion will be debated.  I am sure others will wish to add their signatures before tomorrow.  I accept the ruling that the motion cannot be taken today but the House should know that some of us are very disturbed by what is happening.  I respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s motion and the very fine words he has put on the record.  It is very important.  I am happy to defer the taking of this motion tomorrow but I will fully support the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  This matter will not go away until it is dealt with.</P>
        <P>Another issue arises from this.  I was very embarrassed by the discussion yesterday.  The Cathaoirleach asked that the position of the Chair be respected.  Apart from the issue raised by Senator Fitzgerald, the Commission on Procedure and Privileges should examine the question of respect towards the Chair.  When the Cathaoirleach gives a ruling, the Members of the House should follow it.  I include myself and this bench of Senators.  We are not demanding anything other than what is required of us all.  I cannot remember any situation involving a Member on this side of the House who, when asked to sit down or withdraw what was said, did not comply.  That is all I say on the matter.  We will deal with it again.  There appears to be an independent republic on the Government side of the House whereby a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il group chose in one situation not to support a Government amendment last week, has rejected a request from his Leader and ignored the rules of the Chair.  I will say no more.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business now and questions should go to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue.  Last night Members of the House may have seen reports of comments made by Senator Hillary Clinton regarding Iran.  This is an issue that <Col N="272"/>Senator Mark Daly and I have raised on a number of occasions in the House.  Our point is that the situation in Iran is like that of Iraq five or six years ago.  We are being offered two alternatives: to go along with the disgraceful regime in Iran or to oppose it through war.  Senator Clinton&rsquo;s statement of last night, that as President of the United States she would be prepared in certain circumstances to &ldquo;obliterate&rdquo; Iran, is exactly what I fear.  There are other options regarding that country and the best of those is similar to what was achieved with Solidarnosc in Poland years ago by supporting the democratic opposition.  There is a third way in Iran.  This country must speak out and so must Europe.  We are heading down the same road as we did in Iraq.  I am very disappointed that Senator Clinton has chosen those words and I hope she corrects them along the way.  When she was asked a question on the subject she confirmed that she would do as she had said.</P>
        <P>In an attempt to be helpful to my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, I have circulated Members of the House with two pages from the Lisbon treaty which we can discuss later.  It is an attempt to show people that the treaty can be easily read.  The pages are taken at random but for the information of the House, and to correct any misunderstanding, Article 113 states that the Council shall act unanimously, with regard to the harmonisation of legislation on taxation.  The phrase is &ldquo;acting unanimously&rdquo;.  The English language is the English language.  There are not two interpretations of those words which are very clear.  The other page was taken at random.  I tried both pages out on a sixth-class child last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who, unlike my privately educated colleague, is not from an old Celtic caste system or the nether regions of same, but is in sixth class in primary school and was well able to read and understand them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator was so helpful, why was he not equally helpful about my contribution on Iran?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Members not to interrupt speakers.  If they continue to do so I will ask the person interrupting to leave the Chamber immediately.  I am unable to hear what is being said if others interrupt.  To be fair, if we wish to run the House as it should be run, such interruptions must stop.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>We continue our debate today on the Lisbon reform treaty.  I spoke to the Irish Countrywomens Association yesterday about the treaty and one of the questions that regularly came up concerned how the treaty might improve equality for women.  My response was that the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees equality across gender.  I am grateful to Senator O&rsquo;Toole for this document because I see there that Article 157 states: &ldquo;Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers . . . is applied.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>There are many things within the treaty that will guarantee equality.  However, the ICA delegates&rsquo; fears are well-founded.  This morning I read a report about the percentage of women professors in Ireland.  The fact that only 10% of university professors in this country are women is pathetic.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Coupled with that, our nation has the second lowest participation rate of women in the political system in the European Union.  Only Malta has a lower <Col N="273"/>rate.  If we look at Spain, the Prime Minister there, Mr. Zapatero, has just appointed his cabinet in which the majority of members are women.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a great opportunity for our incoming Taoiseach.  I ask him to consider seriously taking a leaf from the book of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Zapatero, and increasing the number of women in his Cabinet.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper on local government reform was published yesterday.  There are many good things in it.  Certainly the news that towns such as Ashbourne and Maynooth may soon get their own town councils is welcome.  At the same time I am concerned that the paper contains nothing about how all this will be funded nor indeed any details on local government funding.  As a person who comes from a commuter area I know how concerned people are at how difficult it is becoming to provide basic essential services because of the lack of funding and the lack of increase in funding to keep pace with population growth.</P>
        <P>The proposal for directly elected mayors is welcome.  Many of us who have experience in this regard will know that county managers are like local czars.  They are unelected, unaccountable and in many cases are cosseted from the coalface by their officials.  Directly elected mayors will contribute to democracy if the experience of London is anything to go by. There has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of life in that city.  My only question is why must we wait until 2011?  Why can we not have directly elected mayors sooner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the publication of the Green Paper on local government reform.  It will be followed at the end of the year by a White Paper.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has instituted an important policy of public consultation.  As to the vexed question of local government finance, that will be dealt with by the Commission on Taxation which will report by the end of 2009.  I am confident the twin-track reforms in the structures and funding of local government will be dealt with in the short term and this will help the House to debate the contents of the Green Paper as quickly as possible so that we can help inform that debate and consequent public consultation.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan, Senator Alex White and I are members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution which is discussing constitutional provisions on the freedom of expression.  It may be unfortunate that a recent court case did not deal with the area of Oireachtas privilege because if that were properly defined we might avoid the type of events that led the Cathaoirleach to make the judgment he had to make yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Senator McFadden who indicated she wished to speak yesterday but I missed out on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely understand the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s predicament and I thank him for allowing me speak so soon.  Yesterday I wished to raise the issue of the Athlone main drainage and sewerage scheme.  I had an Adjournment motion about this in February.  The situation has been continuing for two years and we still have no response from Government.  A sum of &euro;15 million was allocated although the cost of the scheme will be &euro;80 million.  As Members will be aware, Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore are part of the national spatial strategy which requires that areas of sufficient scale and critical mass be built up.  We cannot continue to build any more houses or have any further development in the Athlone area because the sewerage scheme is at its maximum.  Raw sewage goes into the Shannon which is <Col N="274"/>an appalling situation considering what has occurred nearby in County Galway.  Our water will be contaminated.  It is a scandal the Shannon is being polluted with raw sewage.  I do not accept that this matter should be fudged and put on the back burner.  It is now a critical situation.  I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, come to the House and answer questions on the matter.  It was not he who spoke to me when I put forward the motion originally.  The sum of &euro;80 million is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the announcement today by the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency of the number of vessels apprehended in Irish waters in the first quarter of this year.  I ask the Leader to either have a debate on this issue or to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to examine this serious situation.  Out of 14 vessels arrested, 13 were Irish and one was French.  A total of 14 other vessels had shots fired over their bow, to use a pun, in so far as they were let off with a warning. </P>
        <P>Some of the boats were arrested in west Cork, Dublin, Galway and so on.  The existence of an apartheid situation is a matter of deep concern to myself and fishermen throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rarely beg the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence on the Order of Business.  Let us assume that two vessels with fish dock in Castletownbere, one of which is Spanish and the other of which is Irish.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority officers can board the Irish vessel and check the quantity of fish and any technical log book regulations but have no power to board a Spanish vessel.  This is happening on a daily basis.  There is anger about this and irrespective of whether the law is wrong or it is due to a European regulation, it does not make sense that fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>At this minute, a significant Dutch fleet is catching thousands of tonnes of fish off our coastline and is being neglected by the Irish Navy and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  At the same time, fishermen, some of whom are struggling to survive, who come in with one box of monkfish over quota are landed before the Circuit Court with penalties that far outweigh the offence in question.  </P>
        <P>It is a serious issue.  The statistics have been announced this morning and are worrying.  In respect of all the vessels caught, there appears to be an apartheid system in place which discriminates against Irish fishermen who have suffered enough.  I have always fought for fishermen.  It is an industry we have neglected through Europe but we should try to protect what we have and not allow Spain, the Netherlands and other countries throughout Europe to maraud through our waters and rape our seas.  When the Spanish vessel unloads its fish in Castletownbere, the Irish boys are being treated like serious criminals and are concerned about it.  The Spanish can say, &ldquo;What we land in Spain is our business and what we land here is none of your business&rdquo;.  That cannot go on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Well said. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent months, we have spent much time in this House talking about two different points.  The first is the serious problems we face in dealing with transport and congestion issues in the Dublin region.  We have noted at great length the difficulty this is causing families, businesses and commuters in the area.  </P><Col N="275"/>
        <P>A second point we have discussed at even greater length is the concern many Members of this House have about the Health Service Executive.  This is an organisation that was set up, asked to do too much and is full of experts and well-meaning people who, however, are not subject to Oireachtas accountability or to people in this House and elsewhere who cannot put questions to them to understand what is happening in their community.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This afternoon, we could do the same with legislation in respect of the Dublin transportation authority.  This is a hugely powerful organisation that will have unprecedented powers to influence and execute infrastructure and transport services within the greater Dublin area.  The legislation is being put before us this afternoon for the Second Stage debate to take place in one afternoon.  No time is being afforded to Members of this House to scrutinise, understand or talk to experts about legislation that has taken the Department of Transport nearly six years to create.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business today to allow us to extend the Second Stage debate on this legislation to next week.  If we do not do this and if Members of the House do not support this amendment, I predict that in two or three years&rsquo; time, Members on the other side of the House will be talking about the Dublin transportation authority in the same way they talk about the Health Service Executive.  They will talk about their inability to get clear answers, a lack of responsiveness to questions they put and an inability to deliver key projects.  If we do not extend this debate and have an opportunity to scrutinise this legislation properly, we will make the same mistake again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I tried to intervene on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business in respect of a point made by Senator Norris about the number of missing children.  I support the call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House.  In respect of the children to whom Senator Norris referred, over 300 children in the care of the HSE have gone missing in the past few years.  They are unaccompanied minors who have arrived alone in Ireland from other countries.  As such, they are particularly vulnerable as there is no one to advocate on their behalf or seek information from the Garda as to how the search for them is going, presuming such a search is ongoing.  </P>
        <P>It is suspected that some of these children leave the care of the HSE to be reunited with their families who are in Ireland.  However, it is also suspected that some have been trafficked into Ireland and then exploited.  I welcome the extension of the inspectorate to residential accommodation for unaccompanied minors but I would like to see the Minister come before the House to specifically address the need for a report on how many children are missing, the exact steps being taken by the HSE and the Garda to locate them, the criteria by which the children are permitted to reunite with people who come forward to claim a family connection and for that criteria to be altered so that reunification does not take place simply on the basis of consistent stories but on the basis of a much more verifiable link.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s position, the way he conducts himself and the rulings he gives.  However, I must reluctantly say that I cannot give an undertaking that I will never interrupt again because it is part of the tradition of this House.  Had I not interrupted and heckled yesterday, the very serious matter we were discussing might have passed unnoticed.  Nobody else stopped the Senator in question and nobody else, including the Cathaoirleach, rebuked him until I heckled and interrupted him.  If one studies the record, one will see what happened.   There is a very useful role for the judicious interruption.  That is part of the tradition of this House.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="276"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did so because it is very dangerous to undermine the institutions of this State.  Perhaps if it is constitutionally possible, we can have a debate on the function of the Judiciary.  I do not know if that would violate the constitutional requirement.  </P>
        <P>It is worth pointing to the name of the person involved.  Senator Callanan said that the allegation should be repeated because it was true.  I clearly heard that.  The report in the newspaper said it was Senator Cannon who said that.  This should be corrected.  It was not Senator Cannon but Senator Callanan, who also included some personally abusive material about me which I do not require him to withdraw.  I do not regard it as being of any consequence because I do not regard him as a person of political significance anyway.</P>

	<P>I will not withdraw it.  It is a political charge.  I am raising the question of the Judiciary and I believe it is very important that we have an opportunity to look at it because it is being consistently undermined.  To be fair, I disagree strongly with the programme of Fine Gael as announced recently, which I am sure is well-intentioned.  It suggested that mandatory sentences is the way we should go and that there must be an automatic 25-year sentence for murder and so on.  If we suspect the judgment of judges, that is a very serious situation.  </P>

	<P>There was a very nasty rape case recently and one sympathises very strongly with the victims.  However, there is a lack of proportion in the attacks upon a Member of the other House who apparently wrote a letter about the family background which said that the parents were decent people.  As far as I know, that may well be a fact.  Yet people attacked the Member when they did not even have possession of that letter.  </P>
      
        <P>It is very important that we have a sense of proportion because included in that is a suggestion that the judge would not be able to reach a proper decision because of a simple letter like that.  I have much more confidence in judges.  When we impugn people like that, we damage things.  It is a different, for example, when we put on record matters of fact, as I did, about the professor of psychiatry.  I pointed out a fact, of which the public must be informed, that the authors of a Swedish report that she quoted contradicted her.</P>

I did not say there was anything  ideological about what she said, although my colleague, Senator Mullen, impugned the reputation of those Swedish researchers without knowing anything about them.  He said they were ideologically driven.  There is no doubt that both he and Professor Casey have an ideological background because they are involved in the Iona Institute, but I am only interested in the question of the facts.</P>

	<P>There has already been a call for a debate on the Green Paper on local government reform, the launch of which I had the pleasure of attending yesterday.  I would welcome an early debate on this issue to which we should invite the Minister concerned to attend.  As Government spokesperson on the environment, heritage and local government, I look forward to such a debate.  There are many interesting proposals included in the Green Paper.  As in the case of every proposal, there are parts of it one likes and parts of it of which one is not fond.  Nevertheless, it is an innovative initiative by the Minister and I would warmly welcome an early opportunity to debate it.  </P>
        <P>I wish to raise another matter, of which the Leader will be aware, and draw it to the attention of our spokesperson on this area, Senator Carty.  A serious problem concerning the depletion of our fish stocks by non-nationals has arisen in the midlands.  I do not apologise for saying that because it has been established that a certain group of people have used a net on one side of a river or a canal and have taken everything, including fish fingerlings, out of the water but nothing has been put back in.</P>
        <P>This is about the tenth time I have raised this matter.  I want something done about it.  I request the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come to the House to bring forward definitive proposals to put an end to this practice.  Westmeath is known as the lake county.  We have many natural lakes and rivers in the county, of which we are proud.  Those resources are a great tourism attraction, but tourists will not come to the county when our fish stocks are totally depleted.  I ask again for an early debate on this matter.</P>

	<P>I second the Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business on the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  It is important legislation.  Since we commenced this Seanad, we have amended three Bills because of errors in them.  It is important that time is permitted for the taking of such an extensive Bill.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">On a transport-related matter, I ask that the Minister for Transport be invited to come to the House for a debate on the Road Transport Act 1932.  It dates from the 1930s but it cannot be applied as it was at that time.  It provides for the licensing of, among other matters, bus passenger services.  I am prompted to make this request by the operation of the Patten Flyer service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport.  The operators of this service provided a much needed service in the area where there was no pre-existing service.  An application for a licence was made in 2006, but it has not been dealt with.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has referred the matter to the Garda.  Efforts are being made with the Dublin Airport Authority not to give stopping rights to the Patten Flyer.</P>
        <P>The manner in which this Act is implemented cannot be considered in isolation from the European framework within which we operate and the freedom to provide services.  I request a debate on that Act and specifically that the Minister would address the manner in which he is implementing the Act, in particular in regard to a service that is operating very successfully between Dalkey and the airport.</P>

We frequently have debates here about the relevance of the Seanad and we question how we can get the media to take more seriously the business of the House.  I suggest that if the Taoiseach of the day were to address the House on a more regular basis, it would stimulate that interest and increase the perception of our relevance.  I ask the Leader to consider this suggestion and to ask the incoming Taoiseach to address the House.  Perhaps we could examine the possibility of it happening on a more regular basis.  It would increase and improve the profile of the House.</P><Col N="278"/>
        <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Taoiseach some of the concerns Members of the House might have about the impact of a recent statement by a prominent businessman on the Lisbon treaty.  I have been contacted by a number of business people querying whether the ratification of the treaty will have a positive or a negative impact on Irish business.  I ask that the Taoiseach address this question tomorrow when addressing the issue of the treaty in the House.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children when dealing with the issue of patient safety in the House yesterday presented global figures that suggested all was well.  I seek guidance on this issue because I am at a loss to know where we can get direct answers to specific questions.  All the local crises do not add up to everything being acceptable globally.  </P>
        <P>This morning and in recent days I was yet again contacted concerning what I would call a silent crisis affecting lone men isolated in rural Ireland.  A GP contacted me to advise that in her clinic alone 20 men miss their diabetic or cardiac clinic visits weekly in the hospital because of a cutback in their transport service.  One of her patients is a double amputee.  He has no vehicle and is totally isolated.  I seek the Leader&rsquo;s guidance on this matter.  Should I request that the Minister be invited back to the House to address this issue?</P>

	<P>Yes, I am seeking the guidance of the Leader on this matter.  There is no equity in our health system.  These cutbacks  represent policy that is penny-wise and pound foolish.  Dialysis patients have a transport service but they are regularly late for their clinic visits.  The local taximan who provided these patients with a transport service for 28 years has been cut off in terms of the service he provided.  He carried three patients at a time for 95 cent an hour.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>These cutbacks are damaging the health of these people, which amounts to another crisis.  This was what I was told by one GP in Lenane in Connemara.  She said to me that if I contacted others who are affected the story would be the same.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for guidance as to how best to handle this matter.  Should we invite back to the House the Minister for Health and Children to address this matter or who is accountable to make sure people&rsquo;s health is not further damaged?  I mentioned the position of a double amputee who has no transport service to his local hospital.</P>

I have been involved with the association for some time and have a job shadow, namely, Lindsay Maloney, who is seated <Col N="279"/>behind me.  She will watch what I do at work.  I urge the Leader to encourage Members, in whatever job they do outside this House or in their work in the House, to adopt a job shadow day in their constituencies as it encourages those people who have not been given a chance to work to discover their abilities, capabilities and intelligence, which they will be able to adapt when they have the experience of working, even if it is only for one day.</P>

	<P>When does the Leader intend to reschedule last Wednesday&rsquo;s business which was postponed owing to the death of former President, Dr. Patrick Hillery?  I am especially concerned about the issue of older people.  As Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Seanad spokesperson on older people, I would like to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor, bring us up to date on developments in her Ministry.</P>
        <P>On 19 March last I spoke in the House about the fact that Dr. S&eacute;amas Hegarty, the Bishop of Derry, raised in his St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day homily the issue of the conditions for Irish prisoners abroad.  He called for the urgent implementation of the Government commissioned report on Irish prisoners abroad.  There are approximately 800 to 1,000 Irish people in prisons abroad. <Col N="280"/> The majority are in prison in the United Kingdom but many are being held in Central and South America in the most appalling conditions.</P>
        <P>The main recommendations of the report were that a special unit be set up within the Department of Foreign Affairs, headed by a senior staff member and that a database on Irish prisoners abroad be set up.  Since I last spoke on this matter, money has been allocated to set up a database on all Irish people abroad, including those in prison.  I ask the Leader to invite a representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the House to outline to us when the aforementioned unit  will be set up.  As the bishop noted, it is a fundamental requirement.  I do not condone the actions of those who committed crimes abroad but I am concerned about their human rights.</P>

However, on an initial reading of it, I am very disappointed to see that it contains a great deal of rhetoric.  It promises much and I am looking forward to a debate on its contents.  There are many issues of interest in the paper.  One suggestion is that there be directly elected mayors, a concept which should be examined.  However, if it applies to Dublin, what will happen to the management system that is currently in place?  There is no detail in the document and as we all know, the devil is in the detail.</P>

	<P>Local government services are the most important services in this country for the ordinary citizen.  Such services need reform and proper funding.  I look forward to the debate on the Green Paper but what I have seen so far does not augur well for real local government reform.</P>
        <P>Some Senators mentioned rural isolation and services for the elderly.  I have just conducted a series of meetings in rural County Waterford where I heard real concerns expressed that services  in the rural areas of this country are in serious decline and isolation is increasing.  Many of the traditional organisations, such as Muintir na T&iacute;re, the ICA, the GAA and others, which have done Trojan work in the past, are suffering badly owing to a lack of volunteers.</P>
        <P>One must ask what the Government is doing in this area.  It is too simplistic to say the decline of the rural Irish pub is the cause of the problem.  While it is certainly a contributing factor, it is not the whole story.  The Government and we, as politicians, have a role to play in giving new energy to rural life.  We must debate the issue in this House.  Since the beginning of this Seanad term the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has not been in the House, which indicates the issue is not a priority for the Government.</P>

	<P>It is an issue that must be addressed.  We must not forget that this country is predominantly rural.  There is a substantial rural population in the country which is becoming more isolated by the day.  We must take cognisance of that fact and act accordingly.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White mentioned the importance of services for the elderly and I agree with her.  I remind the House that the Bealtaine festival was launched recently.  It is a beautiful festival, running for the entire month of May, which engages elderly people in cultural and artistic activities.  I ask that all politicians support the festival and call on the local authorities and relevant State agencies to do likewise.  Organisations which work with the elderly are doing Trojan work locally and must be supported at every level.</P>

        <P>I have received queries from two very competent auctioneers and valuers in County Donegal, one in my own constituency and the other in Donegal North-East.  The people in question are two of the most distinguished auctioneers in County Donegal.  For the past three years they have been endeavouring to become members of the IPAV but on every occasion they have been refused.  No reason has been given why their applications have been refused although they meet all of the relevant criteria.  I call for an investigation into the methods of the IPAV in providing membership to certain auctioneers and valuers while refusing membership to others.  It appears to be unfair and questionable and I call on the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister and to arrange for a debate on the issue in the House.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the property services regulatory authority Bill will be before the House during this session.  I hope it will provide us with an opportunity to raise some of these issues.

I would take such direction on board.  I have often made very strong remarks, both here and in the Lower House, about various Ministers but I would always take direction from the Cathaoirleach or the Ceann Comhairle.

	<P>Many professions in this country, including the medical profession, pharmacists, nurses and so forth, have seen the status of their professional bodies change in the past two years.  They are no longer self-regulated but are regulated by lay majorities.  It is interesting that the legislation prepared by the Government on the creation of a legal ombudsman does not seek to make any change to the status of the councils for barristers and solicitors.  Government Members are still happy for them to be self-regulated, yet they stand up in the House day after day criticising the legal profession and the Judiciary.  The proposed legislation does not amend how these professions are regulated, even though the regulation of the medical profession has dramatically changed.  Government Members must be happy about something and, therefore, they should be honest about what they say in the House.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s comments on the proposed Dublin transport authority.  The debate on this huge organisation will be too short.  If the HSE is for slow learners, as the Senator said, a wider debate is needed on this authority.  This was discussed at length within the Department of Transport and a greater opportunity should be given to every Member to discuss the implications of the establishment of the authority because it will impact on the rest of the country and not only Dublin.  The transport links will affect the rest of the country and every Member should have the opportunity to contribute in detail on the legislation.</P>

        <P>The TUPE legislation, which guarantees workers&rsquo; rights on ferry services, is being implemented in Northern Ireland but not in the Republic.  Recently the Rathlin ferry was awarded a contract and Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy, ensured TUPE legislation guaranteed the rights and privileges of workers.  The same has not happened in this State and we have evidence of that in west Cork.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming powers of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority should be debated.  Its staff can board vessels, confiscate equipment and catches and bring fishermen before Circuit Court judges, in the process criminalising them.  This issue should be debated at length in the House with the Minister.  The lack of a fully fledged Minister for the marine is a huge disadvantage to the industry.</P>

However, I welcome it and I very much look forward to the White Paper, which Senator Boyle said will follow.  The Green Paper is lacking in detail but this will be contained in the White Paper, which will fill in the gaps.  We will have something more substantial to get our teeth into then.</P>
        <P>Many calls for a debate on planning issues have been made.  Perhaps the Leader will consider such a debate in conjunction with a debate on the Green Paper.  People in rural Ireland feel they are being planned out of existence.  I refer to the right of people to live where they were brought up or the right of a retired person to return to the place from whence he or she came.  Preplanning is regarded as a right but I have been contacted by good, hard working county councillors from all over the country with stories about their problems securing preplanning meetings for people who approach them with difficulties.  Will the Leader include this issue in the debate?</P>
        <P>I strongly support the remarks of Senators O&rsquo;Donovan and McCarthy about the operation of sea-fisheries regulations by our enforcement agencies.  Every right thinking person believes <Col N="283"/>these people are operating in a discriminatory fashion against domestic fishermen in favour of foreign fishermen.</P>

Will the Leader reconsider his position on this Bill?  We cannot take Second Stage of such an important Bill later today, followed by Committee Stage next week.  Surely we should learn lessons from the past about rushing legislation through either House.</P>
        <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s call for a debate on fisheries.

        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to discuss the alcohol advisory group report, which was published earlier?  It is a matter of grave national concern and a debate is needed on the abuse of alcohol.  I implore the Leader as a matter of extreme urgency to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the report.</P>
        <P>I have asked the Leader on numerous occasions to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the House because concern is increasing about the quality of life in both rural and urban Ireland.  Community life is disintegrating and an urgent debate is needed because the Minister has not attended the House since this Seanad was elected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I renew my call for a debate on bioethics, with particular reference to the disappointing news that it is to be recommended that embryo destructive stem cell research be permitted in this State.  We need cures we can all live with and I remind Members about the promising research conducted in Japan, which demonstrated that flexible stem cells can be retrieved from adult cells.  It was reported recently that Professor Ian Wilmut, who gave the world Dolly the sheep, has abandoned embryo destructive research because he wishes to pursue promising research in the area of adult stem cells.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Norris, whom I esteem greatly, in my absence criticised my comments yesterday about certain Swedish researchers.  I am not a member of the Iona Institute.  I have, like many other Oireachtas Members, attended the institute&rsquo;s events and I agreed on one occasion to chair one of its conferences on denominational education.  I have been impressed by the institute&rsquo;s thinking approach to issues where previously ideology has dominated.  I stand over my comments but I did not infer any moral fault on the part of those researchers when I suggested they might be blinkered by ideology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no ideology.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not impressed at the way both the Swedish researchers and a UNICEF representative, Melanie Verwoerd, recently sought by means of a bare assertion to <Col N="284"/>criticise legitimate points made by Professor Patricia Casey, who did not overstep the mark in the interpretation of points made.  That is unhelpful because we need facts, not ideology, in such important debates.</P>

	<P>Statements on the Lisbon reform treaty will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and will conclude not later than 12.30 p.m.  The contributions of spokespersons will be ten minutes, while those of all other Senators will be seven minutes.  The sos will be between 12.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>
        <P>We fully agree with and respect the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling on the earlier issue raised by Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole.  We have always done so and if there is a need for a debate at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On a point of order, will the debate on the Lisbon treaty conclude or adjourn at 12.30 p.m.?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It will adjourn at 12.30 p.m.  I am making a request for a ten minute question and answer session before the conclusion of the debate.  We have commenced this process in the House and we should try to maintain it.  Every Member is satisfied with it and all the group leaders are supportive of this request.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan, Boyle, Glynn, Coffey and Coghlan welcomed the publication of the Green Paper on local government reform and asked that Senators be given an opportunity to speak on matters pertaining to the achievements of local government and its future development.  I intend to have an all-day debate on the Green Paper because the wealth of experience of Senators in this area will assist the Minister in addressing the matters raised in the document.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden raised the drainage and sewerage scheme in Athlone.  I will endeavour to assist the Senator in this regard.  I strongly suggest that she seek an update by raising the matter on the Adjournment, possibly tomorrow.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Donovan, Glynn, Carty, McCarthy, Coghlan and Cummins expressed serious concerns regarding the unfair treatment of Irish fishermen.  Our experienced colleague, the deputy leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in the House, Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, cited an example.  I will arrange an urgent debate on this matter and will contact the Minister&rsquo;s office as soon as the Order of Business concludes. </P>
        <P>Senators Donohoe and Twomey called for an more time to discuss the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008.  The debate commences at 7 p.m. and is open-ended.  I will discuss with the party leaders the arrangements for the Remaining Stages on the conclusion of Second Stage.  All Senators who wish to speak on Second Stage of this most important Bill may do so tonight.  The debate will not be stifled.  The Bill will go to the Other House and return to the Seanad in five or six weeks if amendments are made in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Senators Corrigan and Norris cited alarming statistics on missing children and called for an urgent debate on the issue.  I am agreeable to holding such a debate.</P><Col N="285"/>
        <P>Senator Regan called for a debate on the Road Transport Act 1932, particularly on the licensing of buses.  I have no difficulty in making time available for such a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca welcomed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to the House tomorrow.  As it will be his final visit to the Seanad, I would like all available Senators to attend tomorrow at 2 p.m. to show their appreciation for everything the Taoiseach has achieved since taking office.  The Taoiseach will also set out his views on the Lisbon treaty and Good Friday Agreement.  Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dick Roche, will be in the House in a few minutes to discuss the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matters brought to my attention by Senators Healy-Eames I will try to respond to the request made of me.  Like Senator Mary White, I am always impressed by the openness, frankness and helpfulness of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, when she appears before us, for example, in facilitating Senators&rsquo; requests to amend the Order of Business to extend yesterday&rsquo;s question and answer session.  Yesterday&rsquo;s debate was an enlightening experience.  With each visit by the Minister to the House, I become more confident that problems in the Health Service Executive are being addressed.  Please God, they will be successfully resolved but it behoves all of us to assist the Minister in any way we can.  Her contribution last night was uplifting and gives us all great confidence and hope that she will successfully overcome the challenge she has accepted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank party spokespersons and Senators for their contributions during yesterday&rsquo;s debate.  The proceedings of the House are enhanced by such debates and I congratulate everyone concerned. </P>
        <P>I fully support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments on job shadow day, which falls today.  Senators Mary White and Coffey raised issues affecting older people and those living in rural areas.  As someone who travelled from door to door when I started out in life, I am aware of the seriousness of the challenge facing us.  Economic success and the advent and popularity of television mean people are wrapped up in their own affairs and the old ways of visiting our neighbours&rsquo; homes for a chat or a c&eacute;il&iacute; are disappearing.  I commend Senators White and Coffey for their commitment to older people, particularly those living in rural areas.  I will gladly accede to their request for a debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White also noted remarks made by the Bishop of Derry, Dr. S&eacute;amas Hegarty, on the issue of Irish prisoners abroad.  I am pleased to learn that progress is being made on this issue in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A debate scheduled in the House had to be postponed owing to the death of the former President, Dr. Patrick Hillery.  I will seek to ensure a debate is scheduled for the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised problems encountered by constituents seeking admission to the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers.  I will inform Senators tomorrow of the timeframe for taking a Bill, which will address many issues of this nature.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey raised the issue of regulation of the legal profession.  Most Senators would recognise the great contribution the profession has made to society.  A debate on this issue would be timely.</P>

	<P>Senator Coghlan has considerable personal experience in this area.  I noted Senator Mullen&rsquo;s views on stem cell research.  Senator Coghlan called for a debate on planning and expressed support for hard-working county councillors.  I have no difficulty in <Col N="286"/>holding an all-party debate on the issue.  Senators are aware of the plight of public representatives at local authority level and support the role they play. </P>

    <Title>Lisbon Reform Treaty: Statements (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dick Roche, to the House.  It is only 24 hours since I heard him speak about the Lisbon reform treaty at a meeting of the Irish Countrywomen&rsquo;s Association in Termonfeckin.  It was an excellent meeting and the audience appreciated the Minister of State&rsquo;s attendance.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss the treaty.  Ireland is the only EU member state whose citizens have the right to vote on it.  In all other states, it is a matter for the Government to accept or reject it.  Since Christmas, I have been running a survey on my website to see whether people have much knowledge about the treaty.  Some 85% of those who have responded to the question, &ldquo;Do you feel you have an adequate understanding of the upcoming European Reform Treaty?&rdquo;, have responded &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  With less than two months to go to the referendum, it is a serious issue.  People do not know what the treaty is about.  While it may be a complex document, I do not think it is incomprehensible.  Most of its content is fairly straightforward.</P>
        <P>When Ireland joined the European Union in the early 1970s, it was a trading union of nine countries.  It has grown since then to the extent that it now has 27 member states.  It operates on <Col N="288"/>the basis of various treaties, such as the initial Treaty of Rome and the subsequent Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties which were introduced to try to improve the operation of the ever-expanding Union.  Similarly, the Lisbon treaty has been agreed to make sure the EU&rsquo;s structures facilitate good day-to-day management of the Union.  The treaty consists of two sets of amendments.  The first set amends the Maastricht treaty and the second set amends the Treaty of Rome.</P>
        <P>I suggest that the Lisbon treaty can be summarised in five key areas.  First, the treaty includes a statement of the values and objectives of the European Union.  Second, the treaty sets out a Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Third, the treaty makes additional improvements to the operation of democracy within the Union.  Fourth, the treaty makes provision for the first time for the EU&rsquo;s involvement in global issues like climate change and humanitarian aid.  Fifth, the treaty sets out the position in respect of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which is probably the matter that is the subject of most debate.  I will comment on each of these five areas.</P>
        <P>One of the objectives of the European Union reform process is to set out in writing the exact nature of the Union&rsquo;s goals for the 21st century.  The Lisbon treaty defines the values of the Union, such as respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and human rights.  The EU&rsquo;s objectives are to promote peace and improve humanitarian aid throughout the world.  For the first time, the Union has set as one of its objectives the achievement of full employment throughout all member states.  The treaty sets out clear limits to what the EU can do in trying to achieve those objectives.  It can act only in areas in which member states have conferred competences on it.  The Union cannot do anything a member state can do itself.  The principle of proportionality means the EU can act only to achieve the objectives set out for it, and nothing more.</P>
        <P>The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is contained in the Lisbon treaty, has a number of strands.  It is based on the concept of human dignity.  It prohibits the use of torture and sets out the right to life.  It protects essential freedoms such as freedom of liberty, freedom of expression of thought, freedom of movement and freedom of assembly.  It provides for complete equality across genders, age groups, religions and physical abilities.  The charter includes a clause relating to fairness and solidarity.  It focuses on the rights of workers and citizens.  The right to stand and vote in elections is enshrined in the charter, which also creates a right to obtain information from EU bodies.  The charter&rsquo;s justice strand ensures that people enjoy the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.  As a result of this treaty, which gives legally binding status to the rights I have mentioned, the EU will be unable to introduce legislation without making sure it adheres to the rights set out in the charter.</P>
        <P>I wish to give some specific examples of the manner in which the Lisbon treaty increases democracy across the Union.  It establishes a citizens&rsquo; charter whereby a petition signed by 1 million citizens can be used to get the European Commission to introduce new legislation.  The treaty increases transparency and accountability throughout the Union.  Meetings of the Council of Ministers at which legislation is discussed and decisions are made will have to be open to the public.  These provisions will make the legislative process more transparent.  Under this treaty, national parliaments will have a greater role in how laws are enacted.  All draft EU legislation will have to go before national parliaments, including the Oireachtas.  If we do not like some aspects of such legislation, we will be able to hold up a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo;, which will mean those drafting the legislation will have to think again.  If a majority of national parliaments does not like the proposed legislation after the Union has thought again, the legislation can be kicked out.  The Lisbon treaty fundamentally shifts power away from the Commission towards national parliaments and the European Parliament.</P><Col N="289"/>
        <P>The treaty also includes provisions to deal with the increased size of the European Union.  It makes changes to the existing voting process, for example.  Approximately 80% of new EU legislation is adopted by consensus.  The legislative process tends to be a little more divisive in national parliaments.  Decisions are made by means of a vote in just one of every five occasions.  Ireland is usually on the winning side in such circumstances.  If this treaty is approved, more qualified majority voting will be introduced.  There are two strands to qualified majority voting.  If a measure is to be approved, 65% of member states by population &mdash; states representing more than 300 million EU citizens &mdash; have to be in favour of it.  In addition, at least 15 of the 27 member states have to sign up to any new legislation.  The six member states with the largest populations &mdash; Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Poland and Germany, which represent 70% of the population of the Union &mdash; cannot force through legislation unless at least 15 member states are in favour of it.  The largest member states will be unable to have their way while ignoring the wishes of smaller countries.  Equally, the 15 member states with the smallest populations which comprise just 13% of the population of the EU &mdash; countries like Ireland and Malta &mdash; will be unable to force something through without making sure the needs and wishes of the largest member states are taken into account.  The new provisions will ensure that legislation is adopted in a more democratic manner.</P>
        <P>There have been some discussions about the measure that provides that Ireland will have a Commissioner for ten of every 15 years, rather than having a Commissioner all the time as we do at present.  The United Kingdom, which has a population 15 times that of Ireland, will also have a Commissioner for ten of every 15 years.  Ireland will be quite well represented per head of population at Commission level.  If this treaty is adopted, Ireland will elect 12 Members of the European Parliament.  We will have one MEP for every 400,000 people living here, whereas Germany will have one MEP for every 800,000 people living in that country.  We are being looked after quite well on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
        <P>The Lisbon treaty makes new provisions in relation to global issues such as climate change.  There will be a specific legal basis for the requirement on the Union to promote international action on climate change.  The treaty also includes energy policy, which relates to matters like the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For the first time, a legal basis for the provision of humanitarian aid will be introduced.  A European voluntary humanitarian aid corps will be established under the treaty.  There will be a clear basis for the Union&rsquo;s development policy, the objective of which is the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty throughout the world.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the provisions in the Lisbon treaty relating to the external policies of the Union probably have been the subject of most debate on the treaty.  The treaty contains specific proposals in respect of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  I emphasise that any policy in this area can be adopted only by means of unanimity across all 27 member states.  The system of constructive abstention allows countries like Ireland to avoid making a decision if we really do not want to get involved.  The &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; provisions will allow member states to call a halt to legislative proposals they do not like.  The treaty establishes a new post of high representative for foreign affairs, who will represent the EU overseas and co-ordinate the implementation of the agreed common policy.  Any decision to get involved in a humanitarian operation or crisis intervention &mdash; one of the so-called Petersberg Tasks &mdash; can be made only on the basis of unanimity.  Ireland has its own triple-lock process as well.  This means we will not go into any overseas aid or humanitarian mission unless we have D&aacute;il and Seanad approval, Government approval and UN approval.  The idea that our sons and daughters will be rushing off to war without our say is complete scaremongering.</P>
        <P>The treaty has great benefits for the people of Ireland and Europe.  We do not have anything to fear from these changes.  We will retain our right to adopt legislation on taxation and defence. <Col N="290"/> The treaty extends rights to citizens, nationally and internationally.  It improves democracy at local and national level.  It is in our interests to approve this treaty and I will campaign hard for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I wish him well in his objective to steer the reform treaty to success.  The Minister of State is giving a great deal of time to it and I know it is hard work.  I assure him I will do everything to deliver the vote in my constituency.  Every area should take control of itself and this is how we will be successful.  The Minister of State has my support and all the support he can get in every walk of life within our organisation.</P>
        <P>The question that must be asked is why we should vote for the treaty.  I will keep it simple.  Fifty years ago there were six member states of the EEC, today there are 27 member states of the EU.  The treaty must respond to the needs of the 21st century.  The institutions must work in today&rsquo;s world.  They must be clear in their thinking, transparent, efficient and democratic.  They must open up so Joe Citizen will understand what is going on.  This was lacking and in this reform treaty I see major simplification to allow everybody in this country to understand.  They are now beginning to understand what the reform treaty is all about.  It has taken 50 years to simplify the institutions of Europe.  It is only right that we simplify them so that all bodies and organisations will understand.</P>
        <P>The national parliaments have a major role in the decision-making process.  A proposal put forward in Brussels cannot go any further without going through the Chambers of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to be scrutinised.  This is a major concern.  No legislation or decisions can be made in Europe without first going through the democratic process in Ireland.  This is the cornerstone as to why we should go accept the treaty.</P>
        <P>Why must we stay in Europe?  We are an island country on the periphery.  Economically, through the EU market we have access to 500 million people for direct investment.  The value of direct investment to Ireland in 1973 was only &pound;16 million.  Last year, direct investment generated more than &euro;3 billion.  Voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; would undermine Ireland on the European stage.</P>
        <P>We must pool our resources with regard to the impact of globalisation, climate change, energy, security, cross-border crime, trafficking, immigration, poverty and injustice.  We cannot do this alone.  We must work with other member states.  It is the only way forward with regard to these global issues.  It is extremely important to know that we alone cannot deal with crime.  We have cross-border crime and human trafficking and we must work with other member states.</P>
        <P>If we vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; we isolate ourselves.  We cannot do so.  We are a small country.  It would be awful to think that we were outside the loop.  The charter of human rights will have legal status which means the freedom to choose occupation, equality between member states, the right to life and the respect for private and family life are protected.</P>
        <P>Politically, membership of the European Union has transformed us.  It has given us a place in the world and in Europe, particularly in the formation of key policies affecting our future and the future of mankind.  We have an input into climate change, energy and security.  We have been a beneficiary of our membership of the European Union.  It is in our interests to ratify the reform treaty.  It is clearly in Ireland&rsquo;s future economic interest that we vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Rejecting it would serve no use.  We must urge people to vote in favour of the treaty.</P>
        <P>To reject the treaty while the other 26 member states accept it would put Ireland in an extremely difficult position.  How would we overcome the problem?  We would isolate ourselves and for what reason?  There is nothing in the treaty other than that it simplifies the institutions <Col N="291"/>and makes them more democratic.  We will not have any interference on taxation, defence, our neutrality or abortion.  They are our constitutional issues which cannot be decided by Europe.  They can only be decided by this country alone.  This is clear.  The &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners state that it will interfere with our sovereignty, neutrality, abortion and tax harmonisation.  The key point is that there will be no interference whatsoever.</P>
        <P>To object to this treaty would be a great shame.  It would make us a very mean country.  We have done so well and now we would turn around and state we do not want Europe anymore as we have the Celtic tiger and we do not need it.  Today, I urge everybody to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum for simple reasons.  It is more democratic and all decision-making will first have to go through our Parliament.  We have unanimity, which is key.  I wish the campaign, and the Minister of State, every success.</P>

Yesterday, we challenged him on this and he had to agree that where my party is concerned, he could not state we were speaking through both sides of our mouths on the issue.

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to introduce the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008 for the consideration of the House.  The main purpose of this Bill is to put a single public body in overall charge of surface transport in the greater Dublin area.  Simply put, the objective of this Bill is to ensure people living and working in the greater Dublin area will in future have a high quality integrated transport system that meets their needs in a sustainable way.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>The greater Dublin area, GDA, is the most densely populated and traffic congested region within the State.  It comprises seven local authorities, namely, Dublin City, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare.  It has an area of just under 7,000 sq. km and in 2006 had a population of 1.66 million people, or almost 40% of the State&rsquo;s total population.  In 2006, 836,000 vehicles were registered with local authorities in the GDA.  The people of this area and its business community need a transport system that is integrated, efficient and effective and that is the mandate I want to give to the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
        <P>When we launched the ten year &euro;34 billion capital Transport 21 investment framework in November 2005, we recognised the need for institutional as well as infrastructural renewal.  As I indicated at the outset, the new authority will have overall responsibility for surface transport in the greater Dublin area, subject to direction by Government in respect of significant policy issues.  The proposals contained in the Bill have been guided by a number of policy priorities; they are designed to ensure the timely and cost effective implementation of the public transport infrastructure projects in Transport 21; they seek to ensure there is effective integration of public transport infrastructure and services; they aim to ensure that services are organised in a manner that optimises the benefits arising from the almost doubling of capacity on the public transport system under Transport 21; and they include provisions to better align the transport and land use planning processes to ensure that both operate closely together to best meet the future needs of the GDA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To deliver effectively on these policy objectives, the Dublin Transport Authority will be given a wide range of functions covering strategic transport planning, the procurement of infrastructure and services and better integration and traffic management.  The authority will also allocate capital and current funding for public transport and traffic management.</P>
        <P>The authority will be responsible for strategic transport planning in the greater Dublin area.  It will set out a strategic framework for the delivery of infrastructure and services in a strategic transport plan covering a 12 to 20 year period.  This will be consistent with Transport 21 and build on the Dublin Transportation Initiative and Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s A Platform for Change<i>.  </i>It will also prepare a six year implementation plan which will translate the transport strategy into action.  Both the strategic transport plan and implementation plan will be subject to ministerial approval.</P>
        <P>The authority will procure public transport services which are subject to public service obligations in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of EU law.  That will enable the authority to ensure the integration of services and will provide a new framework to hold to account service providers for the quality of services provided to the public.</P>
        <P>It will also regulate public transport fares and have powers to ensure the delivery of integrated ticketing and fares and public transport information schemes.  It will prepare a strategic traffic management plan for the region to ensure a consistent approach across all local authority areas, including during construction works for major infrastructure projects.  The role of the Garda in traffic enforcement will remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a radical improvement of public transport services in the GDA.  Moreover, we are wholeheartedly committed to obtaining best value for the travelling public and the taxpayer from the significant subvention being provided by the Exchequer for public bus services operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in the GDA.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the use of performance-based public service contracts for bus and rail public transport services in the greater Dublin area.  The contracts will set out clearly the services being provided and the payments to support those services.  These provisions are in <Col N="293"/>line with the new regime introduced under the new EU regulation on public service obligations in the transport sector which becomes mandatory from next year.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to improving bus services under Transport 21 by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 to facilitate the optimum provision of services.  It is my intention that proposals for a new bus-licensing regime will follow in subsequent legislative proposals.  The new licensing regime will be designed in a manner consistent with the new EU regulation.  In the meantime, applications for new bus licences and notifications from the State bus operators will continue to be processed under the licensing provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the notification system under the Transport Act 1958.</P>
        <P>To deliver on our commitment to improved public transport services, we need to undertake a major programme of infrastructural investment.  The Bill includes strong provisions which are modelled on the powers which have been so successfully used by the National Roads Authority.  The powers of the Dublin Transport Authority set out in the legislation can be summarised as follows.  The DTA will have responsibility for the allocation of Exchequer funds for public transport infrastructure projects and it will be required to endeavour to deliver public transport infrastructure projects through existing agencies.  However,  if it  considers it more convenient, expeditious, effective or economical to do so it can deliver a project itself and the DTA can issue a direction to a transport agency requiring it to deliver or take a particular action in delivering a project.  Should the transport agency refuse, the DTA can step in and take over the project itself.</P>
        <P>A major objective of this legislation is the delivery of an integrated public transport network.  That will be achieved in a number of ways.  The DTA will be obliged to implement a single public transport brand.  We are all familiar with the Transport for London brand, which is used by a multitude of operators and across public transport modes.  The DTA will also take over direct responsibility for integrated ticketing.  It will also have responsibility for developing an integrated information system, providing a single integrated source of travel planning information for public transport users.  Its infrastructure powers will enable it to ensure the delivery of public transport interchange and park and ride facilities.</P>
        <P>Achieving greater integration of transport and land use planning is central to the success of these proposals.  My objective is to ensure delivery of a common strategic sustainable transport focus between local authorities in the greater Dublin area and the new Dublin Transport Authority through maximising consistency between regional planning guidelines, local authority development plans and local area plans and the DTA&rsquo;s transport strategy.  This can be achieved only if a balance is struck which ensures that transport considerations are fully addressed as part of land use planning while respecting the existing democratic accountability of the current planning process.</P>
        <P>My proposals seek to give an equitable share of responsibilities to the planning authorities on the one hand to engage with the development of the transport strategy and implementation plan and to the DTA on the other hand to engage in the formulation of the regional, county and local planning processes.</P>
        <P>A series of technical amendments are proposed to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to allow the Dublin Transport Authority make key inputs at every stage of the preparation and review of regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area thereby ensuring they are closely aligned with the authority&rsquo;s transport strategy.  A balancing provision allows the regional authorities to influence the formation of the authority&rsquo;s transport strategy to ensure it is consistent with the regional planning guidelines.  Similar arrangements will apply to ensure <Col N="294"/>local authority development plans and local area plans are consistent with the Dublin Transport Authority&rsquo;s strategic transport plan.</P>
        <P>Additional powers will be given to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to intervene, if required, to ensure that regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans are consistent with the transport strategy prepared for the greater Dublin area by the Dublin Transport Authority.  A balancing power is given to the Minister for Transport to intervene, if required, to ensure that the transport strategy is consistent with the planning policies.  Additionally, developers of prescribed classes of development will be required to submit transport impact assessments as part of the planning process and planning authorities will be required by law to satisfy themselves that such developments are consistent with the authority&rsquo;s transport strategy.</P>
        <P>These proposals will provide, in my view, workable and effective arrangements to better integrate transport and land use planning to ensure the full benefits of a more accessible city and hinterland envisioned under Transport 21 are realised for people living and working in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Following my appointment as Minister for Transport in June 2007, I initiated a review of the draft legislation having regard to the commitments in the agreed programme for government and the length of time that had passed since the establishment team completed its report.  In the intervening period, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, had made major progress on the important projects assigned to it under Transport 21, in particular Metro North.  I became concerned that absorption of the RPA by the authority could jeopardise the ongoing PPP procurement process in respect of Metro North, which is at a critical and sensitive juncture.  I have decided to leave the RPA outside the authority.  The authority will have precisely the same relationship with the RPA as it will have with Irish Rail, the other rail procurement body in the GDA.  I am also satisfied that the benefit of providing organisational continuity in respect of the Metro North procurement process far outweigh any other benefits that could have accrued from pursuing other options regarding the relationship between the RPA and the authority.  I was also concerned we would have a service-provider that would be part of a regulatory body and I do not believe that is a good thing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill before the House is incomplete in one respect.  The original proposals for the Dublin Transport Authority did not impact significantly on the issue of taxi and hackney services.  Accordingly, the Bill simply provides for the DTA and the Commission for Taxi Regulation to have regard to each other&rsquo;s policies and plans and to engage jointly where actions by one body are likely to impact on the responsibilities of the other.  However, taxi and hackney services in the greater Dublin area clearly comprise a significant element of public transport in the area as well as making up a substantial part of the national taxi and hackney fleet.  Accordingly, the Government came to the view that, in light of the significant commonality of purpose and interest between the DTA and the Commission for Taxi Regulation, the Commission should be absorbed into the DTA. The new arrangement will have the added advantage of achieving administrative efficiencies.</P>
        <P>My Department is preparing the necessary amendments to the Bill in this regard.  However, this will take a little time. Accordingly, I anticipate that it will be possible to introduce the necessary amendments only on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. The Seanad will have an opportunity to discuss them when it considers D&aacute;il amendments.  I would welcome Senators&rsquo; views in this regard.</P>
        <P>My predecessor appointed Tom Mulcahy as chairman of the interim Dublin Transport Authority.  In the light of my decision to retain the RPA, Mr. Mulcahy will retain his position as <Col N="295"/>DTA chairman-designate but will relinquish his position as RPA chairman in due course.  I acknowledge the important contribution he has made in that capacity during the past 14 months.</P>
        <P>I will shortly appoint the other members of an interim Dublin Transport Authority whose remit it will be to prepare for the establishment of the new authority following enactment of the legislation.</P>
        <P>When the chief executive-designate is in place the interim authority will be able to consider the staffing and financial requirements of the authority, initiate the recruitment of staff, source office accommodation and put in place the necessary support systems with a view to ensuring the authority is in a position to hit the ground running following enactment of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill which Senators will have noted is quite lengthy.  I propose to highlight only the main provisions of each Part.  Members will have already received an Explanatory and Financial Memorandum which briefly explains the purpose of each of the Bill&rsquo;s 114 sections.</P>
        <P>Part 1<b> </b>deals with preliminary and general matters and concerns certain standard legislative provisions.  Part 2<b> </b>concerns the Dublin Transport Authority.  Chapter 1 of Part 2 concerns arrangements for the establishment of the authority.  Sections 10 and 11 set out the general objectives to be pursued by the authority and its principal functions.  Under section 12, the authority is required to prepare a transport strategy identifying the strategic transport requirements for the greater Dublin area.  The DTA will inherit the work currently being undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office on the development of a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area to succeed <i>A Platform for Change.</i></P>
        <P>The authority is also required under section 13 to prepare a six-year integrated implementation plan setting out the priorities, actions and objectives of the authority in regard to the provision of public transport infrastructure and services.  This plan is designed to translate strategy into action.  Chapter 2 of Part 2 sets out the structure and governance arrangements of the authority.</P>
        <P>Under section 14, the authority will comprise ten members appointed by the Minister, three of whom will be executive directors consisting of the chief executive officer and two senior managers.  The Dublin City Manager will be appointed in an <i>ex-officio </i>capacity.  The remaining six non-executive, part-time members must be people with relevant experience.  The establishment team&rsquo;s report recommended the use of an independent nomination panel to recommend to the Minister persons for appointment to the authority.  However, the previous Government took the firm view that there should be strong accountability by the authority to the Minister of the day and to Government given the large amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money being allocated to it and that such accountability is best met by the direct selection and appointment of the board by the Minister.  I believe this is the correct approach.</P>
        <P>Section 17 provides for the appointment by the Minister of a 13 member advisory council which will scrutinise the work of the authority.  Membership of the advisory council will comprise the Dublin City Manager and two county managers from the GDA or their nominated officers, four elected members of the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and four ordinary members nominated by representative organisations.</P>
        <P>The establishment team recommended that the authority should have a statutory advisory council chaired by the authority&rsquo;s chairperson with 29 other members comprising city and county managers, elected members of local authorities and representatives of the community and business sectors.  I was concerned, however, that such a large council might be unwieldy and ineffective.  Accordingly, I decided to opt for a streamlined advisory council with an inde<Col N="296"/>pendent chairperson.  I am satisfied the revisions I have made will ensure the advisory council can undertake its functions effectively and efficiently.</P>
        <P>Chapter 2 of Part 2 incorporates important provisions concerning the duty of the authority to implement Government policy and its accountability to the Minister, to Government and to the Oireachtas.  The Minister will have the power to issue policy directions and guidelines to the authority regarding any of its functions.  Compliance with policy directions will be mandatory.</P>
        <P>In addition there is a statutory obligation on the chairperson and chief executive under section 41 to appear before Oireachtas Committees.  The Dublin Transport Authority accounts will be subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As I mentioned already, the authority will be grant aided through my Department.  It also will be permitted to borrow up to an aggregate limit of &euro;1 billion and those borrowings may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, subject to appropriate terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>Part 3<b> </b>comprises six chapters dealing with various aspects of the transport system.  Chapter 1 sets out the functions of the authority with regard to the provision of public transport infrastructure.  It will be given responsibility for the procurement of public transport infrastructure.  However, in the normal course of events the authority will procure infrastructure through the existing statutory agencies such as Irish Rail in respect of suburban heavy rail and the Railway Procurement Agency in respect of light rail and metro.  The authority will also allocate funding to those bodies or agencies.</P>
        <P>Chapter 2 establishes for the first time in Irish law a performance related contract regime for the procurement of public transport services.  The chapter is drafted in a manner consistent with EC Regulation No. 1370/2007 which will have direct application in Irish law from next year.</P>
        <P>I intend later in the year to bring forward a Bill to modernise the licensing regime for bus services in line with the commitments in the agreed Programme for Government.  That Bill will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932  and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 concerning bus services.</P>
        <P>Sections 48, 49 and 50 enable the authority to procure public passenger transport services by means of contracts and set out the main provisions that are to be included in such contracts.  Incentive clauses for exceeding specified performance standards are provided for, as well as financial or other penalties for non-compliance with contract requirements.  In the case of rail services, the authority will engage in direct award contracts with Irish Rail.  Light rail and metro services will be procured by way of open public tendering.  Bus services will be procured by way of open public tendering and direct award contracts.</P>
        <P>Section 52 establishes the basis for the continued provision of the existing bus services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus in the greater Dublin area and for the ongoing operation by Irish Rail of rail services in that area.  The section gives the two bus companies exclusive rights to continue to provide those services, except in the case where licences for commercial bus services are issued to private operators under the Road Transport Act 1932.  The authority must enter into direct award contracts with the three CIE companies.  However, given their exclusive nature, these contracts must be reviewed from time to time to ensure conformity with EU law.  These contracts are renewable after five years in the case of bus services and ten years in the case of rail services.  The Minister still retains the effective shareholder interest in CIE and the fiduciary responsibilities of the members of the board and the subsidiaries are still retained.  The boards of CIE and its subsidiaries will still report to the Minister.</P>
        <P>As Senators will be aware, a significant range of public transport services operating into the GDA originates from outside the area.  In recognition of this, section 54 gives the Minister <Col N="297"/>power to designate bus and rail services that are provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail and which commence or terminate outside the GDA but which can be reasonably considered as part of the GDA&rsquo;s transport system and are currently the subject of funding by the State, as services that can be regarded as being part of the transport system of the GDA.</P>
        <P>Section 55 provides, in particular, that the authority must review the operation of the chapter at least once every five years or at the request of the Minister.  Section 56 is a contingency provision, which empowers the authority to provide public passenger transport services in circumstances where a transport operator fails to meet or is unable to meet the terms and conditions of a contract.</P>
        <P>Chapter 3 of Part 3 contains a series of important provisions designed to progress the development of a fully integrated transport system in the greater Dublin area, which is of course a key reason for establishing the new authority.  Accordingly, the Dublin Transport Authority will be responsible for, in particular, developing a single brand for public transport in the GDA, delivery of the integrated ticketing project and the establishment of an integrated information system for public transport services across the GDA.</P>
        <P>Chapter 4 of Part 3 concerns traffic management.  The authority will be responsible for deciding the big picture and the individual local authorities will be responsible for implementation.  The authority will, at six-yearly intervals, prepare and adopt a strategic traffic management plan for the greater Dublin area.  The road authorities within the GDA must prepare local traffic plans that are consistent with the authority&rsquo;s strategic plan.  The authority will have the power to give directions to road authorities for the purpose of ensuring the implementation of its traffic plan.  The authority may also issue traffic management guidelines to road authorities.</P>
        <P>The development of more sustainable transport and travel has a critical role to play in enabling Ireland to meet its international obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Accordingly, Chapter 4 also obliges the authority to implement appropriate demand management measures.  While the introduction of congestion charging in the GDA is not provided for at this stage, the authority will be required to keep the position generally under review and may make recommendations to the Minister if it considers that additional demand management measures are required.  I am currently working on a sustainable travel and transport action plan and this may identify further measures which will need to be pursued.</P>
        <P>Chapter 5 of Part 3 requires the authority to collect and publish information and statistics concerning matters relating to its functions.  The Bill obliges the authority, at a minimum, to produce information on the numbers using different transport modes, travel times to work and satisfaction levels with public transport services.  However, the authority can go beyond that at its own initiative or at the behest of the Minister.  The authority is also empowered to engage in, and fund, research on transport.</P>
        <P>Chapter 6 of Part 3 concerns the relationships between the Dublin Transport Authority and other transport agencies in the greater Dublin area.  For example, the National Roads Authority is obliged to consult the DTA in exercising its functions in the GDA and generally to act in a manner that is consistent with the DTA&rsquo;s transport strategy.  The authority may give directions to the NRA for that purpose.</P>
        <P>Part 4 contains a number of provisions relating to enforcement.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has worked  closely with me in recent months to ensure that Part 5<b> </b>contains appropriate provisions to integrate land use and transport planning. The procedures in the Bill will ensure there is consistency between regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area plans on the one hand and the DTA&rsquo;s transport strategy on the other.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have strong powers to enforce this consistency if required.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>Part 6 provides for the dissolution of the Dublin Transportation Office by ministerial order and the transfer of its staff, contracts, rights and liabilities to the authority.  Staff of the DTO will be entitled to terms and conditions of employment with the authority that are no less favourable than those they enjoyed with the DTO.</P>
        <P>The final Part of the Bill, Part 7<b>, </b>provides for the appointment by the Minister of the boards of Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail.  This part also provides that ClE property disposal should be subject to the consent of the Minister which is consistent with Department of Finance guidelines in respect of State bodies.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied the establishment of the new authority will streamline and strengthen the decision making process in respect of the planning and provision of transport services and infrastructure in the greater Dublin area.  It will also strengthen the interaction between land use, planning and transport.  The new authority will have a clear mandate and the necessary powers to deliver on it, but will also be fully accountable to the Minister for Transport and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House to present this legislation to the Seanad.  At the outset I will quote what was written about our city 104 years ago by James Joyce.  He wrote: &ldquo;I chose Dublin for the scene because that city to me seemed the centre of paralysis.&rdquo;  When Joyce made that point, he had a particular form of paralysis in mind.  More than a century later, we can see that other kinds of paralysis have gripped the city of Dublin.  This is why a body such the one envisaged by this legislation is important and necessary for commuters and people resident in Dublin.  On the one hand, we can see over recent years that the ability to travel quickly and safely through the city of Dublin has changed dramatically.  The current commuting speed within the city of Dublin for those on our roads is 13 km/h.  This is a fraction of what it is across other European capitals.  As work by the Department of Transport has pointed out, this commuting time is to decrease to around 8 km/h in the coming years.  Over recent years, we have seen an additional 100,000 cars on our roads.  We have also seen an increase of more than 40% in peak travel times.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The need for a body such as the one envisaged by this legislation has never been greater because the other kind of paralysis we have seen is the overwhelming number of different organisations involved in trying to deal with the needs of our commuting public, both now and in the future.  The National Roads Authority is involved in our roads, while Dublin Bus and, at times, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, are involved in the area of buses.  The Railway Procurement Agency is involved in the Luas and metro.  Among those involved in the regulation of these forms of transport are the national transport regulator, the Office of the Director for Traffic, Dublin, the Commission for Taxi Regulation, and a number of different local authorities within this region, all of which have their own traffic department and are making decisions on behalf of the people within their local authority area.</P>
        <P>It is very clear that there is a strong need for an organisation to come together to deal strongly with the problems the city and regions of Dublin face and deliver co-ordinated and strong strategies and results for people to ensure these issues are dealt with.  However, as much as I want to hail the implementation of this Bill and point out there is a strong need for it and it is good to see we are moving forward, there are a number of important areas where I want to criticise this Bill and make some points that must be made.</P>
        <P>The first relates to the Bill itself.  The Minister said it has more than 130 different clauses.  It has been in development in different ways for nearly 22 years since its predecessor was abol<Col N="299"/>ished in 1986.  The Minister has spent much of the past year deliberating in private on this legislation in recognition of its importance.  Despite this, it is being introduced in the Seanad in less than a week.  We all received the legislation and the accompanying memorandum just over a week ago.  Second Stage is taking place today and I believe Committee Stage will begin next week.  Given that this organisation will have such unprecedented powers and such huge influence on our commuters and the people who work in and provide transport in the city of Dublin, we need more time to scrutinise this Bill.  It is not just that we need more time to talk about it ourselves.  We need time to talk to the people who are experts in providing transport within the city and region of Dublin and who have a good grasp and understanding of what is happening to get their reaction to this legislation to help inform the contributions and amendments we intend making to the Bill.  Owing to the speed with which this legislation is being implemented this week and next week, there simply will not be time to do that.</P>
        <P>The second point relates to the role elected representatives will play in this organisation in the future.  There is no provision in the legislation for the direct questioning of the Dublin Transportation Authority by a Member of the Oireachtas.  If we have an issue in respect of how transport is delivered in Dublin, we have the opportunity to table a parliamentary question to the Minister who will respond with a certain period.  As this legislation stands, no Member of the Oireachtas will be able to table a question to this organisation, which will assume significant responsibility and power within our region.  I made the point this morning about the ongoing discussions that take place in the Seanad about the role of an organisation such as the Health Service Executive and the significant frustration experienced by many Members on both sides of the House in putting questions to it and getting answers.  Are we making the same mistake with the Dublin Transportation Authority?  As we all grapple and deal with the issues our constituents and other representatives raise about transport issues within their community or constituency, where is the provision in this legislation for any Member of the Oireachtas to get a straight, timely and accurate answer from the Dublin Transportation Authority?</P>
        <P>The third point is in the same vein and concerns the role of elected politicians in this organisation.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said last summer:</P>
        <P LI="1">That isn&rsquo;t a viable way of running a country.  That is not a very fashionable point of view, but we have gone down the road a little too far &mdash; I am not talking about the Department of Justice, but right across the range of government business &mdash; of setting up agencies and bodies at one remove from the government to whom the government can then abdicate responsibility for dealing with certain matters.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The point here concerns the role that politicians will have in the running of this organisation.  It will have immense power over commuters and people working in transport in the city.  It will be accountable to the Minister but the people who will make these decisions will not be elected politicians.  I again go back to the many discussions that have taken place in this House about, for example, the HSE, although I could mention many other organisations, where many Senators ask where the power has gone and who is making the decisions about important matters we are facing.  Are we making the same decision in respect of the Dublin Transportation Authority?  When a Member of the Oireachtas or a member of a local authority wants to play a role in influencing a decision that has been made, there will be no other politician in that organisation with whom they can deal.</P>
        <P>There is no factor more immediate and urgent in driving someone to make a good decision than the fact that they are responsible to an electorate.  That is the way our democracy works.  That impulse will not be present in this new organisation.  If, in years to come, people from the Government side of this House blame the Dublin Transportation Authority for decisions that have been made or wonder why they cannot influence and make decisions themselves, they <Col N="300"/>can look back at this legislation and ask whether that was where the decision was made and whether we had not learned from what we done before.</P>
        <P>Two other points that are of great importance relate to value for money.  One of the objectives and principal functions called out in the early stages of this legislation is the role for this organisation in delivering value for money in the spending of billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  This is a superb objective but how is it delivered in this legislation?  Even though it is called out as both a principal function of the organisation and an objective, it is not suggested or detailed in the legislation how this will be carried out.  For example, should we not ask the Dublin Transportation Authority to publish a yearly report setting out how it is spending billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money, its efficiency in doing so and whether it is delivering the objective laid out in the strategy it will produce?  From what I can see, the need for such a reporting structure or line is not identified in this legislation.</P>
        <P>Where in the proposed structure is the recognition of the commuter, the person who has suffered from many years of bad decisions that have been made in respect of Dublin transport?  The board of directors is the unelected group which will make significant decisions on behalf of the Dublin region.  The legislation recognises the input of the local authorities and many other organisations and groups involved in the transport sector in the Dublin region, but the input and needs of the commuter who travels back and forth across the region is not mentioned.  Commuters are given recognition on the advisory council.  I have served on many advisory councils and their role is simply to advise, but the power will lie with the board of directors.  I strongly contend it is within that body the voice and the needs of the commuter should be heard and recognised.</P>
        <P>The amendments we will put forward will reflect the points I raised.  We welcome the establishment of the authority and understand the need for this legislation to be implemented.  It is critical that we learn from previous mistakes made in the setting up of huge organisations that were given vast powers over the people they are meant to serve.  If, in few years&rsquo; time, members of Government complain about transport issues in their constituencies and heap blame for those on the Dublin Transport Authority, we will know that if this legislation is passed unamended, they will be responsible for that situation in the future.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the need for adequate time to be given to debate this Bill.  This legislation has been 22 years in development.  The Minister has spent a year considering it and making some changes to it.  As a House of the Oireachtas, we need some time to do our job properly, to fully understand this legislation and to table good amendments to it.  I hope the possibility that the Minister might be moving on to bigger and better things in the future and, therefore, the need to get this legislation through as quickly as possible is not what is driving the urgency and the speed with which this Bill is being dealt.  If that is the reason, I would be concerned that the commuters of the Dublin region would suffer because of the haste with which it is being put through.  I hope I will be proved wrong in that regard by the Government&rsquo;s attitude to the amendments we will put forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and his introduction of this long-awaited Bill.  The need to establish a Dublin Transport Authority has been talked about for the past number of years.  The need for it has been sticking out like the proverbial sore thumb for the past 15 or 20 years.  Regardless of how this legislation is enacted, we must accept that some people will find fault with it, as that is the case with every Bill that comes before this House.  </P>
        <P>It is important we take into account that this authority is meant to serve the people of the greater Dublin area and those who commute to and from Dublin on a regular basis.  In doing <Col N="301"/>so, it must provide a fast, efficient and integrated transport system.  We are all aware of the problems in introducing the integrated ticketing system.  Work on that project that been ongoing for the past number of years.  A considerable amount of money has been wasted by various bodies which contended they had the ability to do that job but still have not done it.  The Minister has this project in hand.  It needs to be dealt with.</P>
        <P>This will be a powerful authority.  Its operations will extend down to the level of who will or will not get planning permission in certain areas of suburbia.  That is somewhat worrying.  It is also dangerous in that certain planners may overstep the mark on planning decisions.  We have all seen situations where planners have been left with too much power.  Having gone through the Bill, it appears that neither the Minister nor anyone else will have power to override them.  It may be necessary to include a provision to ensure members of the public are protected from adverse decisions which arise from the consequences of previous encounters with planners.  We all know that personal vendettas have often been carried through by planners in this city and its suburbs.</P>
        <P>The legislation presents an opportunity to provide the public with a first class service.  That is very important.  The Dublin Transport Authority needs to be established and functioning as quickly as possible.  I agree partly with what Senator O&rsquo;Donohoe said about the need for accountability, from management level down to the local elected representatives because it is the latter who will take the blame if it does not work.  They are entitled to have an input into how it operates.  The Minister might consider ensuring that some members of the board should be elected public representatives from the local authorities.  The old embargo applying to Members of the Oireachtas being members of boards such as this one is still intact.  It is time it was examined because it discriminates against Members, who have been elected to this and the other House.  Lifting the embargo might be in the best interests of the country.</P>
        <P>The provision whereby Oireachtas Members are no longer allowed to be members of local authorities has not been to the betterment of local government.  Anyone involved in it would confirm that.  When Members were also allowed to be members of local authorities, their time was divided between the two roles and perhaps people thought they could not give a commitment to either one or the other, but the change made in that respect has not led to an improvement in local government.</P>
        <P>In appointing the board, it is important that local authority members be represented.  Of all the people involved in the authority, county managers will play a major role.  Given that, they should be required to take questions on what is happening in the authority at their local authority meetings and not respond to local authority members to the effect that it is an executive power.  That needs to be examined because there is a danger that the authority could become totally executive driven and that the people who are at the coalface might not have an input.</P>
        <P>That authority will have enormous resources available to it directly or indirectly from the Exchequer.  It will be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to Oireachtas committees.  A small section might be included requiring the authority to respond to elected public representatives within 14 days of representation.  That might help to break down barriers.  If there is not a mechanism by which to question a representative of a body such as the Dublin Transport Authority, we may be fobbed off.  It has happened with the HSE.  Elected members have put questions to members of its advisory bodies to which they receive answers one day that are totally different from the answer the Minister may give the following day.  That is wrong and unfair to those who are on the advisory committees and to Ministers.</P>
        <P>The legislation presents an opportunity to ensure that accountability to elected representatives is paramount.  This body will be responsible for major development in this city.  It will designate in terms of bus transport, have a role in rail transport and a major role in the pro<Col N="302"/>vision metro north and the upgrading of the rail system in this city.  It will have an input, albeit indirectly, in that regard.  We need an integrated system and the legislation presents an opportunity to ensure we get that.  We have said and heard enough about the integrated ticketing system.  I hope that this time it will be successful.  We have had promise after promise but there has been a failure to deliver.</P>
        <P>The integration of transport and land use planning is something that causes me slight concern, but it must be done.  Wherever development takes place, there is a need to ensure proper facilities are put in place to serve the people in those areas.  There is not much sense in a major housing estate being built in a 14 ft <i>cul de sac</i>.  That is the sort of planning that is involved.  I hope conditions will be laid down requiring the DTA to respond within a given period in the same way as An Taisce or any of the other prescribed bodies.  There is no point in arriving at a situation where a planning application cannot be processed further because the authority has not made its submission, which it is entitled to make.  The Bill must specify a mandatory period in which the authority must make its submission.  If it does not make such a submission within the timeframe, it cannot raise the matter again later.  It is imperative that such a provision is included in the legislation.  It is useless to give an authority an endless ball of twine with which it can decide to do something at any point in time.  There should be a mandatory period for a response.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides us with an opportunity to provide this city and its hinterland with a first-class transport system and that must be our aim.  The Minister has suggested a 12 to 21-year schedule, which is fine.  However, we must have a three-year schedule initially rather than a six-year one.  This will speed up the process of making the necessary provisions.  I say this because the authority could be used as a mechanism for delaying development in certain parts of the city.</P>
        <P>Is there a case to be made for a semi-permanent board of some description which would report to the overall board fortnightly or monthly?  Where one has only a chief executive and his or her various minions, there must be a division of responsibility among the people who report to the chief executive officer.  The authority will be dealing with rail, metro, Luas, DART, buses, taxis and all  the different elements of our transport system.  I am fearful of a situation developing where no one is responsible.  That will happen if responsibility for each of the various elements is not designated to specific individuals.  Someone must be accountable for the taxi service in our city, for example, and be answerable to the chief executive of the authority if it is not working properly. The same applies to the functioning of the bus service, the integrated ticketing system and so forth.  The chief executive is responsible for the overall system but he or she cannot be expected to have responsibility for problems such as bus lanes in Artane or the DART service somewhere else.</P>
        <P>Whatever structures are put in place, those working within the authority must be responsible and accountable.  They must be obliged to answer to the chief executive and the board of the authority.  The board should have the right &mdash; as should Members of this House through the Oireachtas Committee on Transport &mdash; to call individuals before it to give an account of anything that is causing problems.  We do not want a situation to develop where responsibility rests nowhere and decisions are long-fingered.  It must be the case that specific people have specific responsibilities.  If that does not happen, we will have the same old quango system we have seen in other organisations.</P>
        <P>This Bill is a major step forward and I know the Minister will drive it with all his might to ensure this city has a proper transport system.  Like me, the Minister must get in and out of Dublin.  He knows how bad it was until quite recently.  We now have bus lanes and other facilities which have improved the public transport service and drawn people to use it.</P><Col N="303"/>
        <P>We must develop park and ride facilities far outside the city.  If that means the compulsory purchase of land, then so be it.  In that way, we will ensure more people are able to use public transport.  At the moment, many people would love to do so but have nowhere to park their car safely.  We should consider building car parks for commuters similar to those in the city centre.  It would encourage more people to use public transport.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am very glad he is in charge of the Department of Transport.  I have followed his career with interest and admiration over a number of years.  He is prepared to be decisive, innovatory and to stick to his guns.</P>
        <P>I have some reservations about this Bill which I intend to put on the record.  However, before I do, I wish to say that while I believe it is important we have an integrated transport system, accountability and a small group of people with authority in the area, I would like to discount the rumours that have been circulating around the House today as a result of an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that I propose to be the first elected lord mayor of Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is canvassing too early.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not touch the post with a barge pole.  I would be completely the wrong person.  I do not have the administrative talents that are required.  I would like to advise those who are considering placing a bet, at odds of eight to one, not to waste their few dollars.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point raised in the very fine speech by Senator Donohoe regarding the refusal to allow elected Members to serve on the boards of bodies such as the proposed Dublin transport authority.  That is something we should examine again.  I know the reasoning behind it, namely, a concern to avoid political jobbery and partisanship.  However, I had the pleasure of serving on the Oireachtas Committee on Transport during the previous Seanad under Senator Ellis, then Deputy Ellis.  That committee and all the other committees on which I have served met and made decisions in a non-partisan way in the interests of the country.  I believe if we relaxed the rules and allowed elected Members to serve on such boards, precisely those democratic forces which we want to see might come into play.  I would rely on my colleagues not to act in a partisan fashion and believe they would not do so.  The Members of these Houses are professional people.</P>
        <P>I am a little disappointed in the Bill.  Its title is something of a misnomer.  It is not really the Dublin Transport Authority Bill but rather the Dublin bus authority Bill because it does not address the issue of rail.  While it deals with the Luas and surface rail services, the most critical element of Dublin transport as far as I am concerned is the development of metro.  We pioneered that idea in this House and pushed it when it was very unpopular.  We promoted the idea against very strong bureaucratic resistance. We also pushed the idea within the Oireachtas Committee on Transport.  To omit the metro is a significant diminution of the significance, power and responsibility of the proposed authority.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of his speech today, the Minister referred to surface transport.  It is perfectly clear that some of the lessons that have been learnt were learned as a result of the work done in debates in the Houses and in inquiries of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport on the subject of metro.  The committee, for example, invited Professor Manuel Maynar Melis from Madrid.  He also spoke to the Cabinet sub-committee on transport.  He examined and addressed very clearly and cogently the delays incurred by the absence of legislation in this area, especially with regard to planning and land acquisition.  He made a number of suggestions, some of which clearly are incorporated into the Bill.</P><Col N="304"/>
        <P>It is surprising that lessons that were learned on the issue of metro are being implemented, but only in the context of surface transport.  The metro is the single most important element of our transport strategy because it is the one solution that will reduce the pressure on surface transport.</P>
        <P>I have just seen off a guest from the Middle East.  He adored Dublin but the one criticism he had was about the unholy traffic here.  He found it impossible to believe the traffic jams.  Of course, we walked almost everywhere and the taxi lanes were of some help.</P>
        <P>One could read the Minister&rsquo;s speech and not realise that the underground is excluded.  One would think it was included, particularly given that the Minister said that: &ldquo;The DTA will have responsibility for the allocation of Exchequer funds for public transport infrastructure projects&rdquo;.  One of the biggest spending infrastructure projects is the metro.  The impression given by the Minister&rsquo;s speech is that it is the whole bag but it is not.  It is a partial deal.  Lessons have been learned from the London experience, which is good.  I have in the past complained that we tend to look to British legislation and copy it slavishly.  That has not been done in this instance and we have learned a good lesson.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Railway Procurement Agency the Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the intervening period the Railway Procurement Agency had made major progress on the important projects assigned to it under Transport 21, particularly Metro North.  I became concerned that absorption of the RPA by the Authority could jeopardise the ongoing PPP procurement process in respect of Metro North, which is at a critical and sensitive juncture.</P>
        <P FLI="0">How and why?  Perhaps there are good reasons but the Minister, significantly, did not spell them out.  He became concerned because there might be problems but what were they?  It is not obvious that the PPP process would be damaged at this &ldquo;sensitive juncture&rdquo;.  He also stated, &ldquo;I am also satisfied that the benefit of providing organisational continuity in respect of the Metro North procurement process far outweigh any other benefits could have accrued from pursuing other options...&rdquo;.  What were those benefits and costs?</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in an aside that it would be a regrettable feature if the service provider was also part of the regulatory authority.  I would like further information because I find this confusing.  I may have misunderstood him but I do not believe the RPA is necessarily correctly seen as a service provider.  It may implement Government policy by acquiring land and putting out the construction of a railway or tunnel to public tender but the providers will be commercial companies.  The tunnelling will be done by public competition and tender.  Perhaps this is too insignificant to have troubled the consciousness of other Members but Cormac Rabbitte, a brilliant engineer, has been very much engaged with this issue on a selfless basis for many years.  He produced a number of people who were prepared to tender.  One was a Japanese company, Mitsui, which was prepared to undertake the entire project virtually for nothing on the basis that it would be awarded a 35-year contract to run the system.  I do not necessarily see the RPA as a service provider in the sense it is accessible to an ordinary person like myself.</P>
        <P>The other difficulty I have with the authority relates to the way in which its members will be appointed.  The Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Establishment Team&rsquo;s report recommended the use of an independent nomination panel to recommend to the Minister persons for appointment to the Authority.  However, the previous Government took the firm view that there should be strong accountability by the Authority to the Minister of the day and to Government given the large amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money...</P><Col N="305"/>
        <P FLI="0">Do I sense unease on the part of the Minister because he is landing this back in the lap of the previous Government?  If he feels unease, I share it because if an establishment team recommends an independent nomination panel, it is not appropriate to slap down the suggestion without an explanation of why it is better because that leads to suspicions of political jobbery.  If the Minister accepts what previous speakers said, Oireachtas Members should be involved.  In that case, the process should be independent.  It will exonerate the Minister, who is an honourable man, from any suggestion that he or his successor will nominate to the authority persons from their own political party for reasons of political patronage.  A number of persons will be statutorily involved such as the city manager and, therefore, only a small number of places will be available.</P>
        <P>It is regrettable that the question of taxi regulation has been introduced at the last minute because that means an incomplete Bill has been presented to the House.  At least the Minister has noticed a gap and has moved to address it.  Given that he is introducing an amendment, I cannot see why he could not have done something similar with regard to permitting the authority to examine the underground problem.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill because it has elements of the Wide Streets Commission.  I would like to make a strong plea regarding bus regulation, which the Minister will examine.  I like public transport and I like the utilities to be State-owned.  I like such corporatism and I am not convinced the market is the absolute god.  If these services are provided, they need to be monitored very carefully.  Why, for example, are there no public bus parks for private buses?  Why are they parked dangerously on Parnell Street and Mountjoy Square?  Will the Minister examine the way buses are serviced because a number of them belch out black fumes?  On the corner of Merrion Square under a sign that says, &ldquo;Engines must be switched off&rdquo;, buses are neatly parked every day with their engines running, sometimes with no drivers in them.  That is not acceptable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While it is standard practice to welcome the opportunity to discuss Bills, this opportunity is particularly welcome because this legislation has been a long time coming.  I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward as quickly as he has.  I am based in County Wicklow and the Bill will have an immediate and direct effect on the county once it is passed.  There is a need for the Bill.  Unfortunately, my experience as a county councillor in Wicklow has pointed up the absence of integration between land use and transportation planning, which has caused major problems, and it had the potential to cause further problems had it not been addressed.  I am glad the legislation will address them.</P>
        <P>Much of our population growth in the Celtic tiger years occurred in the east.  The greater Dublin region is now referred to as a metropolitan area.  It has expanded into County Dublin&rsquo;s former hinterland to cover Counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  I am delighted the local authorities in these three counties will also be covered by the new transport authority.  The four Dublin local authorities and three rural county councils are covered.  It has been a challenge for them to deal with the population, housing and development pressures they have experienced because they have had no say over the provision of public transport and that has led to great problems in integrating their work with that of national and regional transport providers.</P>
        <P>Councillors are largely concerned with responding to local needs and a strategic approach to integrating land use and transport planning is needed in the greater Dublin area.  I refer to the development of Bray golf club lands in my constituency, which highlights the need for an authority such as that proposed in the legislation.  A large &euro;2 billion development was planned for the Bray golf club lands, which are very close to the existing town centre and would constitute an extension of the existing town centre.  Bray has a significant number of bus terminuses and a DART terminus and is, effectively, a transport hub in the making.  Unfortunately, the <Col N="306"/>golf club lands were zoned for development without any reservation of land for the Luas to extend through the proposed development.</P>
        <P>The Green Party councillors on Bray Town Council made an effort to reserve a corridor of land but that did not happen as part of the planning process.  Later, when the Railway Procurement Agency displayed its proposals on the extension of the Luas from Cherrywood, its preferred route appeared to be one that would bring the Luas from Cherrywood towards Fassaroe, which is well outside Bray town centre in the foothills of the Wicklow mountains, land that is undeveloped as yet.  It was only public outcry that caused the RPA to reconsider and now we have a satisfactory plan where the Luas will extend right to Bray town centre where it can connect with the DART line, the bus lines and the Dublin to Rosslare line, which makes transport sense.  I hope the establishment of this new authority will avoid that kind of <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the integration of transport and land use planning where it was only public pressure that caused the proper transport and planning decision to be made in the end.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill which is about providing an integrated transport system in the greater Dublin area through establishing the Dublin transport authority and ensuring the delivery of the planned Transport 21 investment.  I understand the general functions of the authority will include strategic transport planning of the area, the regulation of public transport fares, the provision of public passenger transport services and infrastructure, effective traffic management, transport demand management, the carrying out of research, the provision of transport related statistics and the development of a single transport brand.</P>
        <P>The public transport infrastructure area is of great interest to the Green Party.  In this area, the authority&rsquo;s functions will include securing the provision of or providing public transport infrastructure, entering into agreements with other parties to secure this, including joint ventures and public private partnerships, the acquisition of land adjacent to public transport infrastructure and the facilitation of its development.</P>
        <P>I support the comments of other speakers about what was said about privatising public transport services as opposed to provision of services by the State.  I am comfortable with the fact that the provisions of the Bill do not make the privatisation of public transport services in the greater Dublin area inevitable.  The way the Bill is structured appears to favour the continuation of a single main provider but does not exclude private competition.  In the main, a single large provider could continue because in a country as small as Ireland with a limited population, a natural monopoly applies.  If Dublin Bus and the other bus companies can continue to develop and provide an efficient and competitive service for the public, there is no reason we would have to go down the road of widespread privatisation.  I welcome this.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the idea of developing a single brand for the promotion of public transport.  This will help the public to identify an enhanced public transport service in the greater Dublin area.  I hope too that the Dublin transport authority will be able to implement integrated ticketing as soon as possible so that users of public transport can enjoy its benefits.</P>
        <P>For me, the most welcome part of the Bill is Part 5, the land use provisions.  These are important because they allow us deal with issues such as those to which I referred in Wicklow in terms of the integration of land use planning and transport.  I note that the sections of the Bill dealing with co-ordination between planning authorities and the Dublin transport authority are clear.  They set out that each planning authority within the Dublin area shall ensure its development plan is consistent with the transport strategy of the Dublin transport authority.  Reference is also made to regional authorities which must ensure their guidelines are consistent with the transport strategy.  Emphasis is placed also on the powers of the Minister who can direct a planning authority to take measures either to review or vary the draft development <Col N="307"/>plan or proposed variation to ensure consistency between the draft development plan or proposed variation and the transport strategy of the DTA, and the authority shall comply with any such direction.  There is encouragement in the Bill, therefore, for local authorities to take the issue of consistency with the overarching transport strategy for the region seriously.</P>
        <P>If the Bill is implemented and the new authority works well, this will lead to much more efficient movement of people and goods around our capital and the greater Dublin area.  This is in the interest of business, tourism, workers and other members of the public.  I hope we will be able to enjoy the same level of excellent public transport other European capitals enjoy.</P>
        <P>I have two questions for the Minister.  Will he consider similar transportation authorities for other gateway cities or hubs in the near future?  The Green Paper on local government reform was launched yesterday in which there is a clear commitment for a directly elected mayor of Dublin by the end of 2009.  Would the Minister consider providing for the newly elected mayor of Dublin to be the chair of the Dublin transport authority?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Labour Party has been calling for this Bill for some time and though long overdue, it is welcome.  The Dublin transport authority establishment team produced its report more than a year ago, in November 2006, but the publication of the Bill has been delayed until now.  The DTA is a vital agency which should have been established much sooner and the delay in its establishment has had a very negative effect on the already traffic-congested greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>In the absence of such an agency, many essential projects have been delayed.  Integrated ticketing, the green and red line Luas link-up, the integration of commercial and residential planning with transport needs planning and the slippage in major Transport 21 projects are some of the obvious examples.  Phase 1 of the Navan rail link has had its completion date revised from 2009 to 2010.  The completion date for the resignalling of the Maynooth line has been pushed back from 2009 to 2011.  The completion date for metro north, which impacts on my constituency, has changed from 2012 to late 2014.  The Tallaght to Citywest Luas extension has been revised from 2008 to 2010.  The Connolly to docklands Luas has a revised completion date of 2009 rather than 2008 and the linking of the existing Dublin red and green Luas lines has been stalled indefinitely.</P>
        <P>One of the principal functions of the DTA as outlined in the Bill in section 11 is to promote an integrated and accessible public transport network.  Integration and accessibility are very important for Dublin transport.  Provisions in the bill for the DTA to give binding directions in this regard to public transport agencies in the greater Dublin area and to acquire land for public transport services, if necessary, are also very welcome.  Objectives in section 10 to increase the use of the public transport system and for increased recourse to cycling and walking as a means of transport are also to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Section 58 contains measures providing for the DTA to take over the implementation of the long delayed integrated ticketing system and section 61 proposes the development of an integrated public transport information scheme, a road user information system and a comprehensive traffic management plan for the greater Dublin area, which should improve the transport system.  The provisions in section 50 for public transport service contracts and public service obligation measures should also greatly enhance public transport services for commuters.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the Minister has not addressed the bus licensing issue clearly in the legislation and we will continue to rely on the outdated 1932 legislation in this regard.  The Bill indicates that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to provide existing public bus passenger services under the 1932 laws.  The Minister said in his speech that other legislation will follow.  I hope it does soon.</P><Col N="308"/>
        <P>Under section 56, the Dublin Transport Authority is designated as a public transport operator of last resort that can provide passenger transport services if existing operators fail or are unwilling to meet the obligations and standards set out by the DTA.  The Labour Party has long advocated an authority that is placed on a statutory basis, has real powers to oversee the development of transport infrastructure and services and is accountable to the citizens of the greater Dublin area.  This is especially important given the DTA&rsquo;s proposed powerful new role as both the fares regulator and as a public transport services provider of last resort.  As other Senators have noted it is disappointing that under section 17 there will be no directly elected representative on the board of the authority and only four councillors from the seven greater Dublin area local authorities on the DTA advisory council.</P>
        <P>The complete failure to integrate transport needs properly with commercial and residential developments has been one of the worst aspects of planning and transport policy in recent decades.  The Bill has a series of amendments in sections 82 to 96, inclusive, to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to ensure consistency between the authority&rsquo;s transport strategy and the various plans and guidelines produced by planning authorities within the greater Dublin area.  I welcome these amendments.  Many high density developments without adequate transport links have been developed in the past ten to 15 years.  The people in north Dublin have suffered badly in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides in sections 103 to 111, inclusive, for the dissolution of the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, and the incorporation of its functions into the DTA.  I commend the DTO on its work.  Concerns remain, however, that there may be still some duplication and overlap of responsibilities and duties between the DTA and the Railway Procurement Agency which is not being incorporated into the DTA.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I see his logic and I accept the validity of his reasons for not incorporating the agency at this stage.</P>
        <P>Under section 3, the greater Dublin area is defined as the city of Dublin, the administrative counties of South Dublin, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath, and such other areas as may be declared by order from time to time by the Minister for Transport.  This definition should have included, if not the whole of County Louth, at least the town of Drogheda which is now such an integral part of the greater Dublin area that it is difficult to understand why it was not included.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this matter and I hope he will reconsider this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its enactment with whatever amendments might come on Committee Stage.  My colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, may have some amendments to propose in the other House.  I look forward to the speedy delivery of the Bill&rsquo;s long-awaited commitments.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, asked for comments on the absorption of the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the DTA.  It seems there is some logic to this but until I see the proposals, I do not care to comment further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I represent an area where traffic gridlock and lack of transport infrastructure has serious consequences for commuters every day, whether people are stuck in gridlock in Lucan village, held up on the M50 motorway, or there is no space available on the new trains arriving at Adamstown station.  Transport gridlock is a serious issue for the people of Dublin Mid-West, as I am sure the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is aware.</P>
        <P>The Bill should have been published and in place a long time ago and it is disappointing to see it appearing at a time of increased economic pressures.  Many people will feel the transport <Col N="309"/>issues which bedevil the capital city and surrounding areas are matters that should have been dealt with when more money was available, our finances were in better shape and the investment could have been made more easily.  It would have been good to have had a Dublin transport authority to examine what was happening in the Dublin area before now.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and the thinking behind it.  Much work has been done to bring it before the Houses.  I agree with Senator Donohoe that it is a shame the Bill is being rushed because of the changed circumstances and the formation of a new Government.  We would have welcomed more time to consider amendments rather than having to bring them in next week.</P>
        <P>It is a welcome development to have an authority that will co-ordinate transport in the Dublin area.  Everyone in the House knows that competition, rivalry and jealousies have bedevilled the development of transport in Dublin.  This has led to a lack of co-ordination between the responsible bodies, whether it is the bus services linking with Luas or the lack of co-ordination between other bodies.  There has not been the sort of co-ordination necessary to develop effective services for commuters in Dublin.  The hope is that this new authority will be in a position to co-ordinate the transport needs of the capital city and I hope this will be possible.  Much will depend on the relationships that are developed and the power this authority has over the different bodies.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to address this issue and to explain how he sees this working in practice.</P>
        <P>There has been a lack of co-ordination and communication between the relevant bodies in the transport sector in Dublin, leading to a very poor service for the commuter.  It has led to bus lanes with no buses for long periods, which I saw in my area, and delays in development plans.  Given the economic success we have had over the past ten years, what has been created in Dublin in terms of transport has been disappointing.  A co-ordinating body is necessary to deal effectively with the transport needs of the capital city.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister explain how Transport 21 will be integrated into the work of the new authority?  I note the authority will be asked to create a new strategy and outline plans for transport in Dublin.  I have concerns about the timeframe for this and I ask the Minister to state what timeframe he sees for the production of these reports from the new authority.  The nightmare scenario would be the production of more reports rather than their implementation.  Will the Minister reassure the House on the implementation role of the authority?  I assume it will have the power, influence and financial resources to carry out its role, which has not happened to date with the various bodies responsible for transport in Dublin.  Will the Minister address the implementation of plans, co-ordination of the transport service providers and the financial power that he expects this authority to have to carry out its function?</P>
        <P>The Minister pays much attention to the link between transport and planning in this Bill and the power in the legislation to ensure there is a link between transport needs and planning development in a given area.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">The link between transport needs and the planning of developments in a given area has been a significant issue but there does not seem to have been any integrated approach taken to development and to transport needs.  Large numbers of people have been completely inconvenienced and their daily lives have been made a misery by the lack of integration between the development plans of commuter areas by county councils and the lack of transport.  The Bill pays attention to this issue and I wish to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on how this will work.  The Minister referred to the authority having the power to buy land, to order local authorities to integrate transport.  I would like information about the mechanisms to make this happen as this could make a real difference.</P>
        <P>If a new bridge is needed across the River Liffey how will the new transport authority ensure it is built?  What will be the relationship between the transport authority, Dublin City Council <Col N="310"/>and the other councils that might have an interest in this?  Will the authority be relying on a good relationship with the county councils or will it be able to implement such a decision?</P>
        <P>This Bill is long overdue.  Co-ordination between the various transport bodies is essential.  I regret the Minister is not bringing forward the legislation on competition in bus transport.  I ask him to give the House an indication of when he plans to introduce such legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I compliment him for bringing forward this Bill which has been a long time coming.  I may not be able to speak very well today as I am hoarse but I will do my best.</P>
        <P>There is a need for such a body as the Dublin Transport Authority.  A network of quangos have been dealing with the issues to do with Dublin Bus, Luas the metro and no decision was being made nor was anybody accountable.  This Bill will bring everything together and create a nucleus.</P>
        <P>The Minister said we must revisit the planning legislation to see how the local authorities can work with the transport authority.  We have talked about the erosion of power from local authority councillors.  This Bill is a golden opportunity to strengthen the strategic policy committee with regard to transport.  The membership of the advisory council includes the Dublin city manager and the county managers, including those of the neighbouring counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  The Minister stated there will also be regional representation.</P>
        <P>The process will begin with the strategic policy committees and move out from there.  If everything is right at a local level then the plan will work.  When the Minister revisits the planning legislation and works closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I ask him to consider giving power to local authorities to help bring about an efficient and effective transport system.</P>
        <P>I have a lot more to say but I am unable to continue today.  I wish the Minister well and I will listen carefully to other speakers.  This Bill is well worthwhile.  I will be interested to hear how its provisions will be implemented and co-ordinated.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members who have spoken on this Stage of the Bill and for the constructive manner in which they have approached Second Stage.  </P>
        <P>Some speakers on the Opposition benches have referred to this but I wish to clarify it is not my intention to have Committee Stage before the House next week.  I believe the House should have another week before Committee Stage to allow for Members to table amendments.  I am in the hands of the House in that respect and I will try to facilitate its wishes.  I agree with Members who said it is important that due consideration be given to this Bill.  We will be returning to the House with the Bill because I do not believe I will have the time here to insert the couple of amendments to which I referred.  The Bill will return to the House after being dealt with in the other House.</P>
        <P>Members raised a number of points in the debate about different aspects of the Bill.  When I was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government some years ago there was talk then about some kind of a co-ordinating agency in the greater Dublin area.  There was talk ten years ago and even before that a couple of attempts were made.  It is important that the agency be put in place.</P><Col N="311"/>
        <P>I want to reassure Senator Fitzgerald and other Senators that this will not delay Transport 21 projects.  The authority will have the responsibility for implementing Transport 21 projects.  It will have a responsibility in planning strategic transport in the greater Dublin area for 12 to 20 years hence but it will not interfere with the plans already in place.  The Bill allows the Minister to retain powers so that if there is a Government policy such as Transport 21, an agency such as the Dublin  Transport Authority or any other authority cannot decide to abandon such a policy and implement a different policy.  This agency will have the responsibility to deliver Transport 21 and will have the power to deliver it.</P>
        <P>In answer to a number of points raised by Senators on both sides of the House about the power of the authority, it will have the power to direct agencies, including the NRA, to take certain actions.  This may include directions on buying land or property in order to facilitate road development which is necessary for either public transport corridors or for road transport.  It will also have responsibility for disbursing in the greater Dublin area the &euro;12 billion to &euro;14 billion of expenditure which is currently earmarked under Transport 21.  If agencies are not doing what they should do with regard to Transport 21 this agency will have the power to step in and either provide the service itself or ensure that some other agency provides it.</P>
        <P>A number of Members raised the issue of the membership of the board.  Senator Ellis, in particular, was concerned that mechanisms be put in place to ensure timely responses to Oireachtas Members.  I am in favour of that.  However, without casting aspersions on Members of this or the other House, I do not want this or any other body&rsquo;s time to be taken up with answering frivolous questions.  If we are to go down this route, consideration must be given to drawing up an agreed code of practice or protocol.  All Members may be guilty in this regard from time to time.  I am sometimes dissatisfied to see departmental officials spending time on particular parliamentary questions.  I would not like to be obliged to ask any agency to tie up valuable staff time answering those types of questions.</P>
        <P>However, the central point, which was made by Senator Ryan as well as Senator Ellis, is extremely important, namely, the necessity to ensure there is accountability from these bodies.  This includes accountability to Oireachtas Members; to local public representatives, who have a legitimate interest in such matters; and to the Minister, who must ensure policy is implemented in accordance with Government wishes.  I hold up my hands in acknowledging that mistakes have been made in the past.  Particular entities have been given too much freedom and power, and an insufficient degree of accountability was demanded in return.  I am prepared to consider any suggestions that will strengthen the Dublin transport authority in this respect.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris asked why I, as Minister, should seek to retain the power to make nominations to the board of the authority.  We may have philosophical differences on this point.  It is my view that a board, authority or agency that is established by a Minister must be answerable to that Minister.  The latter must take full responsibility in the Oireachtas for the actions of that entity.  He or she must, therefore, have confidence in its members.  That is why the Minister should have power to nominate to the board of the transport authority.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca made several points about the activities of the Railway Procurement Agency in respect of the Luas extension into north Wicklow.  I will bow to her superior wisdom on this given her local knowledge of the area.  However, I am not sure it is fully accurate to say that the RPA was obliged to change its plans as a result of a public outcry.  The process that took place was a good exercise in consultation which allowed people to make their views known.  As a result, an agreed solution has been devised for that line.  The RPA has generally engaged positively in that type of consultation and people are usually satisfied that their concerns are addressed.  That is the feedback I received on metro north, for example.</P><Col N="312"/>
        <P>Several references were made to Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006, which has been a bugbear for Oireachtas Members and local authority staff in recent years.  One cannot possibly separate land use planning and transport provision, although it was done in the past, by omission rather than anything else.  This Bill aims to bring the two together to ensure there is communication among the two Departments, the local authorities and the Dublin transport authority.  The basic approach we are adopting in regard to development plans is that the local authorities, comprising the democratically elected public representatives for the area in question, retain their supremacy.  That is extremely important.  However, they must take full account of the area&rsquo;s transport needs when drawing up the development plan.</P>
        <P>Where the Dublin transport authority has some issue with the development plan, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will make the call.  When the opposite is the case, that is, it is a transport issue, the Minister for Transport will decide.  The reason for this is simple enough.  Senator Ellis made the point about the process going on forever, with no statutory period.  There is nothing greater than the capacity for two official bodies to procrastinate and put off decisions where there is some dispute.  If there is a dispute between local or regional authorities and the Dublin transport authority, in either direction, the relevant Minister must take responsibility and give the go-ahead or otherwise.  That will obviate some of the Senators&rsquo; concerns in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have referred to most of the main points raised by Senators.  I thank them for their contributions and look forward to Committee Stage when we will have an opportunity to tease out some of the issues that have been raised.  I welcome whatever amendments Members wish to put forward.  Some of them have experience of me in this regard, particularly those who spent many long hours debating the Planning and Development Bill 2000.  Where I conclude that an amendment will improve the Bill, I will be perfectly prepared to accept it.  I will approach the debate in a constructive way.</P>

	<P>County Louth was fortunate enough to be designated as part of the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region and to enjoy the benefits arising from that.  It has not been included in the greater Dublin area for the purposes of this Bill because it cannot be designated as belonging to both regions.  As Senator Ryan observed, however, there is provision to extend that definition and the Dublin transport authority can make recommendations in this regard.  I am familiar with the area to which the Senator refers, which is just beyond the Meath border, and there is merit in considering its inclusion.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to the House.  I thank her for coming here to listen to my words on this issue.  The proposal I am making involves something slightly different from what we usually do during the school building process.  I am calling on the Government to put in place a project management procedure that I can understand.  There is a need to publish the precise criteria and weightings under which schools qualify for building projects.  The Government should introduce a tracking procedure whereby projects can be tracked through the various stages of the process.  I ask the Minister to establish an internal and external quality assurance audit of school building procedures and to publish the results.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should be asked to carry out a value for money audit.  A stock inventory of primary schools infrastructure, including the <Col N="314"/>number of temporary and permanent buildings, should be carried out by the Office of Public Works or some other body.  The Committee of Public Accounts should be required to scrutinise the equality and fairness of the procedures for awarding school building grants.  Future schools building projects should be advanced &mdash; fast-tracked, where necessary &mdash; through the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment to my motion, which is interesting in its own way, has nothing to do with the motion.  I do not have any particular problem with the content of the amendment.  I would be happy to accept it as an addendum to my motion, or to add my motion as an addendum to the amendment, in line with the Minister&rsquo;s wishes.  I emphasise that I am open minded and fair about this matter.  I do not mind acknowledging the good work the Minister has done, but that is not the issue being debated here.  I am not criticising the Government in my motion.  If the Minister is happy to accept my motion as an amendment to her amendment, or to do things the other way around, I will be happy to act in such a manner.  I am sure the Minister is willing to consider the various possibilities.</P>
        <P>I do not intend to get involved in a detailed discussion of the individual projects which could be used to illustrate the kind of stuff with which I am dealing.  While it is not my business to do so, I will mention some schools to put my argument in context.  The Minister might know Blennerville national school in Tralee, County Kerry, as the school beside the windmill.  I first raised the school&rsquo;s needs with the then Department of Education in 1996, long before the Minister was assigned to that Department.  At that stage, the school was awaiting the appointment of a design team.  That is still the case.  I raised the problems at Drumclough national school, which is outside Listowel, County Kerry, on the Adjournment some time ago.  It has been waiting since 2006 for a design team to be appointed.  Rahan national school, which is near Mallow, County Cork, was in the news recently and is encountering difficulties all the time.</P>
        <P>The gravity of this issue was particularly well illustrated on today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, when a principal teacher was interviewed about a problem that is developing with a school building project in north Cork.  When it was put to him that the Department of Education and Science has said it will move ahead as soon as a design team is appointed, which sounds very logical, cogent and acceptable in normal terms, the principal read from a letter he received from the Minister in October 2006 stating that the next step, which was about to be taken at that stage, was the appointment of a design team.  That is the difficulty.  It is not a question of where we are going &mdash; it is a question of how we get there.  What do the various steps mean?  How can a school get from one step to another?  I have studied the various stages which are outlined on the website of the Department of Education and Science.  There is nothing wrong with stages.  The difficulty is how one gets from one stage to another.  I raise this issue tonight because I am concerned, as a public representative, that ordinary people are unable to get information about these matters from the Department.</P>

	<P>While I do not tend to get involved in schools building projects, generally speaking, I have taken up a few cases in recent times.  I have learned that public representatives are unable to access information.  If I cannot give people a proper explanation of what is going on, there is surely a problem.</P>
        <P>I will give an example of the difficulties I have encountered, without mentioning any names.  When I rang the building section of the Department of Education and Science in Tullamore about a school, I spoke to a helpful lady who said she had been told she was not allowed to give information about the school in question.  She told me I had to go through an office in the <Col N="315"/>Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I have the name of the person and the date written down.  When I put down the telephone, I rang the office in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I gave the details of the case to another named official and asked what would happen.  The woman in question said she would try her best to get the information for me and would get back to me.  When I rang back the next day to ask if I could be given the name of the person who said public representatives could not be given information, I was told I could not be given that information either.  I was put on hold for a while before being told I had to ring another office in the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  I was trying, as a public representative, to get information in all fairness and honesty.</P>
        <P>Apparently, the theory that has developed is that information should not be given to Deputies and Senators.  I do not mind if that is the case as long as adequate information is given to stakeholders, but that is not happening.  The problems I was encountering in the case in question continued to the stage that someone in the Minister&rsquo;s Department suggested to someone in my office that if I was so concerned about the matter, I should stick it down as an Adjournment matter.  To say that I was furious would be to put it mildly.  Not only was it an unfair and incorrect way to deal with things, but it also demonstrated that there are no proper internal line management controls in the Department.  It is a total waste of parliamentary time to raise each case in the House.  We should not have to do our business in such a manner.</P>
        <P>When I decided to examine where the Government stands on these issues, I found that an &ldquo;organisational review programme&rdquo; has been established by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The programme involves a new way of managing the delivery of customer service at departmental level, an examination of the question of governance at departmental level and an evaluation of performance measurement and customer and stakeholder feedback.  Is a similar approach being taken in the building section of the Department of Education and Science?  Is there a system of customer feedback on performance in the Department?  When I visited the Department&rsquo;s website, I learned that it has a change management unit and that a customer action programme was in operation between 2004 and 2007.  The plan sets estimated response times for customers, stakeholders and clients who have queries.  It sets out the Department&rsquo;s commitment to informing customers of the standards they should expect at the point of service.  Under the plan, stakeholders should be given an idea of the standards of service they should receive and the estimated time it should take to process applications for main services.</P>
        <P>That is what the Department of Education and Science says it should be doing.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, should take responsibility for it.  I am not trying to initiate a personal attack on her.  I am absolutely agitated about this issue.  The way things are being done is wrong &mdash; it should not be like that.  If the Department lived up to the standards it has set, I would not be wasting the House&rsquo;s time tonight.  The Department&rsquo;s stated intention is to monitor its achievement in meeting its targets and to review progress regularly.  It aims to set standard response times to be achieved by its school building service and to inform its customers of such standards, but that is not happening.  I would be happy if the Minister were to tell me that such standards are to be achieved, and if public representatives could find information on behalf of school authorities or tell such authorities where information can be accessed.</P>
        <P>I do not know what level of governance we have in terms of internal audit and quality assurance systems.  I want to have in place what almost every other public body has, namely, a quality assurance scheme where an internal and external auditor take a number of projects, in this case schools building projects, follow them through from start to finish and check whether they follow established and agreed procedures and timelines.  In terms of how an internal audit review should be carried out, these procedures and timelines would be written on the website of the Department of Finance.  The audit review should examine whether these are followed step by step, where a project goes wrong and value for money issues.  This governance is not in place.</P><Col N="316"/>
        <P>Several years ago when the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission was created, it had to establish an internal audit function and a method of calculating a response time to customers and examine how it dealt with the public.  It also had to report on each of these and establish a risk factor.</P>
        <P>An inventory should be established.  I have followed recent discussions in the other House and elsewhere.  It was interesting to listen to the discussion at the meeting last week of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not have time to go into all of it but it began with a simple question many of us have asked, namely, how many prefabs we have in primary education.  We do not know, and it not only a matter of not being able to get the information from the Department as the appalling thing is that the Department itself does not have the figure.</P>
        <P>From my involvement in audit functions in various organisations I cannot understand how auditors can sign off on the assets of a Department without knowing what those assets are.  I do not know how this is done and it raises a query.  I am following up on this.  I have been in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General because I want to find out how this can happen.  When thanking the people from the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General for coming before the committee, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I hope that when the witnesses return before the committee next year, some progress will have been made on carrying out the inventory.  I consider it to be a major failure on the Department&rsquo;s part not to have carried out such an inventory in light of all the comments that have been made for the past ten or 15 years.  It is incomprehensible to think the Department is planning for the future without knowing what it has ... However, this must be done in the public interest and progress should have been made by the time the witnesses appear before the committee next year.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When the Secretary General of the Department tried to soften it down, the Chairman stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">No, I made my remarks in the context of one of the issues we discussed today, namely, the use of prefabs, whether they are owned or rented, their quality, their age, how many pupils are condemned to prefabs and over what period of time ... I refer to basic information that will allow the Department to carry out proper planning.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Chairman did not put a tooth in it.  The Committee of Public Accounts was established to investigate these matters.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether a quality assurance programme is in place.  This discussion is a marvellous opportunity.  In a political context, it is quite in order for people on this side of the House to argue with people on the other side about a Government decision.  It is equally in order for people on the Government side to state they cannot take action because they do not have the money.  This is the normal political process.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that I cannot explain to people why they are in the position in which they are.  If the Minister were able to tell me the Department of Finance will give the Department of Education and Science so many hundred million euro this year, this is our programme, this is what we intend to do and we will keep a certain amount aside because we know we must prioritise certain people, I would understand it and defend it as I defended schedules of appointments on which I had to shake hands, write in stone and sign in blood.  We will live with these.  We might not like them but there is an understanding.</P>
        <P>What is happening here is that we are creating a major political structure of some description.  We all write letters to the Minister and local TDs and letters go over and back.  This morning <Col N="317"/>on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a Minister was quoted as stating the Department could not give him information on the particular school in Cork they were discussing.  I am not interested in the individual school.  I am interested in the lack of information.  Something must be done.  I want the Minister to tell me what she can do about the issues of internal audit, quality assurance, organisational reviews, governance structures and how we develop and implement policy in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for tabling it in the name of the Independent Senators.  He has put his finger on a serious problem.  While we pay lip-service to education, I see real dangers and a similarity between the state of Irish education and the state of the Irish economy when the Celtic tiger started taking off.  What we seem to have had in 1993 was a tremendous boom in the underlying and operating economy but no infrastructure to shelter it.  We saw the lack of roads, airports and infrastructure of all types and we have suffered as a result.</P>
        <P>Today, we have a great commitment to the burgeoning number of pupils in primary education and an infrastructure which seems to be in chaos.  This will not be a disaster but it will have serious consequences for the future of the economy, those pupils and all stakeholders in education.  What Senator O&rsquo;Toole is doing is firing a warning shot over those politicians who state we have a tremendous commitment to education, as the Government amendment to the motion states.  It boasts of the amount of money invested by the Government but it fails to address any specific problems.</P>
        <P>I do not apologise for the fact that I am one of those politicians who has, from time to time, lobbied for particular schools.  I have raised such matters on the Adjournment.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct to state the replies one receives from Ministers on such issues are almost insulting.  They are insulting not only because one is provided with a piece of flabby material which tells one nothing but they also reveal that the Department of Education and Science does not know very much, the Minister replying does not know much and somewhere in the queue rests the school one is representing but neither the Minister nor anyone else knows where it stands.</P>
        <P>If some of the proposals in this motion were put into effect we would have at least a certain transparency so people could go onto the Internet, see where they stand in the queue, know what their expectations are and what commitment is made.  At present, the replies we receive are inadequate and leave many schools, teachers and pupils in a state of uncertainty.  Not only does it give rise to great frustration, it also gives rise to the suspicion that politicians can jump queues in this area.</P>
        <P>The lack of information breeds uncertainty which we, as politicians, inflame and encourage to a certain extent by responding to public opinion by agreeing to try to obtain information about where a school is in a queue.  When the Minister cannot tell them the answer people feel something is going on behind the scenes because we have no transparency.  It would be helpful if the Minister announced that the website will contain information on where every schools building project stands, what its expectation is and when it will be finished.  People would not need politicians to find out for them.</P>
        <P>As the motion states, we could also have weightings as to who gets priority and why, which schools building projects are considered vital, less important or placed down the queue for reasons such as other schools in the area or not as much demand existing.  We do not know which projects gets priority or how funding is allocated.  It is very important for teachers and pupils that this done.  There is a tracking system in certain states in the US, which works quite well.  People can access the education website and find out exactly where they stand.</P><Col N="318"/>
        <P>I appreciate the clause in the motion which states we should have fast track planning.  It is inexcusable that some schools are unable to proceed with vital building projects for reasons of which they are unaware and because of trivial delays in the planning process.  The result of that is what Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, namely, a type of prefab education system which will badly affect the morale of teachers, pupils and parents and will affect educational standards.</P>
        <P>This issue is not unrelated to that of class size, which is often raised here.  We are concerned with space and if space is not provided for schools, it is obvious there will be no space for pupils, class sizes will remain large and teachers will be working in cramped conditions once again.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to respond to this motion, not in the usual way as in the amendment to the motion boasting about what the Government has done, but in a positive way with specifics telling us she will produce an inventory, provide information, introduce transparency in order that we know the way schools are prioritised, lift the morale of teachers, pupils and parents by giving more information and not cloak this issue in secrecy which makes people suspicious about how decisions are made.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Senator Ross said he does not like the Government amendment and that we are boasting about what we are doing.  The amendment does not boast but gives the facts on what is being done.  On many occasions listening to Members, one would think the door had closed in the Department of Education and Science and nothing was being done.  Given that &euro;4.5 billion is to be invested in the school modernisation and building programme under the current NDP, investment has far from stopped.</P>
        <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning I heard about a school in need of a new building.  I do not know the individual case but what I took from the piece was that a new school was needed because three resource teachers were coming in to teach but there was only a spare toilet in which to teach pupils.  The main part of our problem is that we are resourcing schools better than we have done in the past, although more resources are always needed.  If extra people were not coming into the schools, would we need the building programme?</P>
        <P>In many respects, it is very hard to gauge what a school&rsquo;s needs will be.  In my constituency, there was a terrible row about a particular school which needed two extra classrooms.  There were protests, the school was closed and much political pressure was applied.  Given the political pressure, the school got the two extra classrooms, although whether that would happen under the current regime is another question.  The school now has two empty classrooms because the population in the area decreased rapidly.  There was no collaboration with the local council, for which our amendment provides.  Those involved should work with the council to anticipate the needs of an area, for example, to ensure the council is encouraged to locate new housing developments in areas where there are schools to sustain the population, especially in rural areas.  In the case to which I referred, the council was not locating new housing developments, with the result that the opposite of what I know Senator Healy-Eames will speak of happened, that is, the influx of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>----of many new people moving to them.</P>
        <P>Each case does not fall into the same category and each school should have a priority rating.  We have the banding system of bands 1 to 4.  While everybody believes their school is a priority, it is important that there be criteria in place.  The criteria regarding band 1 refers to the needs of schools in rapidly developing areas, the provision of specialist accommodation for special needs pupils, schools which are structurally unsound and rationalisation projects.  However, it is not perfect.</P>
        <P>When the Minister was first appointed I raised the case of a school with her.  It had not been prioritised by the Department so I am sure she thought it was not a genuine case.  Political pressure was applied only to ask the Minister to look at the case and establish whether it was a band 1 type of school.  When she visited the school, she realised that one would need a heavy overcoat to go to the boys&rsquo; toilet and a mask to stay in it for any length of time.  The mould <Col N="320"/>growing in most of the classrooms was unseen in this day and age.  Those in officialdom and politicians could not understand how the school had slipped through the system.</P>
        <P>The system should prioritise schools which most need support.  Through the devolved grant, the Minister has enabled many projects to proceed in an innovative way.  I suggest that it is tracked like the sports capital grants and the child care grants.  People are often given money to draw down and most do so in a very efficient fashion but it is important the Department applies a certain amount of pressure to ascertain the status of a project to ensure those following from behind are able to move as fast as possible.</P>
        <P>Value for money is important.  The initiative to look at models of schools where considerable sums of money are not spent on architects&rsquo; fees is very important.  The green energy initiative is also very important and I encourage the Minister to continue to work with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to open up the national grid in order that schools can engage not only in green flag activities, such as reducing the number of plastic bags used, but that they can use energy generated by wind turbine.</P>
        <P>It is impossible to say in the time available all that needs to be said.  I believe schools are now getting involved in activities they were previously unable to get involved in and this is putting pressure on the building programme.  The economy has been such that many people who left Ireland have returned to raise their children and avail of our good education system. The recently published OECD report ranks Ireland high in respect of competitiveness in terms of its outcomes.</P>
        <P>We are, in some respects, victims of our success.  I agree we should ensure continued investment in education.  The return of the summer works programme is important.  In this regard, small amounts of funding were invested in useful projects.  I agree with Senator Ross that planning issues often can get in the way of developing schools.  Schools often simply cannot get sites.  These are issues with which the Minister or Department cannot deal even if they prioritise a school.  There must be a certain amount of development at local level to ensure that when schools are prioritised they can proceed and draw down funding.</P>

        <P>I have known for some time that the schools building programme is not working adequately.  I accept the Minister has invested and continues to invest money in schools.  Clearly, based on population needs and in other respects, as identified by Senator Keaveney, it is not working.</P>

	<P>It is failing communities, teachers and pupils.  I want to use this opportunity to provide the Minister with evidence the schools building programme is not working.  It is in many ways a national disaster.  I also want to be helpful by proposing some solutions which I ask the Minister, in her privileged role, to consider.</P>
        <P>It became evident during last week&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that the Department of Education and Science and the Government has no detailed view of the school network for which it is responsible.  It does not know how many rented prefabs are in use, what equipment is in place or the size of school sites.  The officials admitted the Department has no database showing the specific details of schools already in existence.  The Department&rsquo;s Secretary General, Brigid McManus, said it would be highly desirable to be able to quote from such an inventory.</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>How can we adequately plan without this essential baseline data?  It is obvious the Department is not aware of its stock in hand.  This is a major embarrassment for the Minister and her Department.  Like other speakers, I would like genuine answers to questions about what steps the Minister is taking to address this problem.  I propose that the Department immediately conduct a stocktaking exercise by way of a well-constructed, one-page survey of all school buildings, including prefabs and land.</P>
        <P>In preparation for this debate I made a series of calls to schools throughout the country.  The schools building programme is too slow and is failing to meet current teaching and learning needs.  The most damning comment I can make is that the Minister and the Government are fooling the public and the children of the nation in that no one is measuring how the lack of an appropriate educational and learning space is impacting on educational achievement.  This is a major factor.</P>

	<P>The building programme is not meeting schools&rsquo; needs; it is failing.  For example, Moycullen national school, County Galway, has been on the schools building programme list for 11 years.  Its representatives are unhappy with the Department of Education and Science building programme.  When I asked them how the system could be improved they replied that applications for schools waiting more than three years should be prioritised.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
        <P>Newcastle national school, Athenry, has been on the list for almost 12 years.  It cannot get any details on its position on the list.  The school is bulging at the seams and believes it is being ignored.  One of the school&rsquo;s resource teachers has to teach in the staff room, a hut used also by the principal and another resource teacher.  The hut leaks and the heating fluctuates with the weather.  The school&rsquo;s secretary must work from home.  This is Government under Fianna F&aacute;il in 2008.</P>

	<P>More than 50% of accommodation at Athenry national school is prefabs, some of which are 20 years old.  This school is supposed to be at the top of <Col N="322"/>the list in County Galway but they do not know what this means.  Does the Minister know what it means?</P>
        <P>Scoil Mhuire, Oranmore, a lovely school, is doing fine work.  However, the teachers&rsquo; desks are located in the corridors owing to a lack of space in the classrooms.  The school is overflowing.  The Minister will be aware of Doughiska which has a population of 8,000 and no school.  The children from this area are attending surrounding schools which are overflowing and cannot cope with the pressure.  They believe there should be more forward planning.</P>
        <P>Blennerville national school, Tralee, referred to by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, has been condemned for some time following a health and safety audit.  Each child is due 15 sq. ft. of space.  Children at this school have only 7 or 8 sq. ft. of space.  This legislation will only be enforced in respect of new school buildings.  Like many other schools, staff at this school believe they were duped by pre-election promises when brought to Tullamore and given letters of commitment.  The same applies in respect of St. Mary&rsquo;s and St. Gerard&rsquo;s national schools, Enniskerry.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoileanna in particular are in bad shape building-wise.  Gaelscoil Dara in Galway city has existed in prefabs for the past 26 years and has only recently acquired its first site.  Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de, Oranmore, of which I am intimately aware having considered sending my children there, opened in 1994, received permanent status in 1998 and still is in negotiations in respect of a site in 2008.  This school, which has 200 children, was classified last year as a band 1 school.  Some &euro;750,000 of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been spent on prefabs for Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de.  That is very damning.  It is outrageous that 200 children must attend a school located on only a half acre site.  Lunch breaks must be staggered to ensure the children can play safely in the yard.  Current rent for the school is &euro;125,000 per annum.  How much of a mortgage would that amount have serviced?</P>

	<P>At a meeting last week of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, Mr. D&oacute;nal &Oacute; Conaill, representing gaelscoileanna, listed seven schools that receive from the Department between &euro;45,000 and &euro;186,000 per annum for rent.  This is taxpayers&rsquo; money.  An average of &euro;120,000 per annum is spent on prefabs.</P>
        <P>While the Government speaks of accountability and transparency, these schools have no notion of their position on the schools building list.  When they do find out, it matters little as commitments are not met.  I ask that the Minister when responding clarify delivery time for a band 1 and band 2 school.  The Government must set aside annual funding for school buildings.  While I acknowledge there is investment in this area, it is not enough.</P>
        <P>I propose that the Minister examine a new development in school buildings, namely, the construction of modular buildings as a means of filling the urgent need for decent schools.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat.  Ba mhaith liomsa mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.  The one thing that is clear is that all of us are genuinely interested in ensuring that our schoolchildren get their education in the best possible quality accommodation.  At the same time I know there are a number of schools that are waiting for their building projects to progress.  I am very conscious of the fact that this can lead to frustration for the children themselves, for the parents, the teachers, and for public representatives.  I know the Senators are aware that there are 4,000 schools in the country and the majority of these had no capital investment whatsoever in the decades before this Government came to office.  As a direct consequence a considerable backlog of modernisation and refurbishment works must be undertaken.</P>
        <P>At the same time, rising enrolments at primary level, populations shifts and significant increases in teacher numbers have necessitated the construction of new schools and extensions throughout the country.  Many of the schools that we hear about are looking for additional classrooms because we supplied additional teachers, reduced the class size by two points and because we ensured that every school in the country had access to resource teachers.  In the course of consultations with the Irish National Teachers Organisation about reducing the class size it was agreed that teachers would get involved in team teaching.  I have yet to go to a school where two mainstream classroom teachers will work together within the one room, yet the teachers are seeking extra space and extra rooms.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the needs of the new areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The challenge before the Government, therefore, in addressing the historical legacy of under investment in school buildings and in meeting the needs of developing areas has been a significant one.  Major progress has been made and continues to be made over a relatively short period of time.  During the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the Government accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems.  Over &euro;2.6 billion was invested in more than 7,800 building projects.  Last year, in the first year of the new NDP, 1,500 more projects were completed, ranging from small scale works, such as new roofs and windows, up to extensions and entirely new schools.  With this scale of activity underway in recent years, virtually every school has benefited from at least one building project.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out an investment of over &euro;4.5 billion in school buildings to ensure that further progress can be made in coming years.</P>
        <P>This year, &euro;586 million will be spent on school buildings.  The progress of any individual school in the building programme is conditional on the amount of money available.  It would be very easy to assure teachers in these schools that the works needed will be done this year.  If I had billions of euro to spend this year it could be done but I do not have such money.  I <Col N="324"/>have &euro;586 million, which is a substantial amount of money but within that we must prioritise.  What will happen with that money?</P>
        <P Just="Left">This year it will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary school projects that will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools.  It will also fund construction work on more than 150 devolved projects under the permanent accommodation scheme, which will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.  In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large scale-projects which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in four new schools and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit over 7,000 pupils.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The direct post-primary capital allocation of &euro;196 million will be boosted by the public private partnership programme, which predominantly features the delivery of second-level school buildings.  With so many small projects having been completed since the summer works scheme was introduced in 2003, the focus this year is on major works. As I have said previously, however, there will be a new summer works scheme in 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Good job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I now wish to turn to how applications for building works are prioritised, a question that Senators have asked.  In 2000-01, following consultation with the education partners, the Department published a list of criteria against which all large-scale building projects would be assessed and information on the four bands into which applications would from then on be organised, depending on the nature and urgency of the work required.  Since then, when an application is received it is assessed against these criteria, looking at factors such as the demographics of the area, proposed housing developments, the condition of existing buildings, site capacity, etc.  As part of this process, each project is assigned a band rating.  Information on the criteria and band ratings are publicly available on the Department&rsquo;s website. Each school is told what its band rating is.  The highest priority projects attract band 1 status, while the lowest fall into band 4.  Each band rating is sub-divided to allow for selection within the bands where this becomes necessary.</P>
        <P>As Senator Keaveney has already outlined, band 1 projects address the needs of schools in rapidly developing areas, the provision of specialist accommodation for special needs pupils, schools that are structurally unsound and rationalisation projects or amalgamations.  Band 2 addresses the needs of schools that have a deficit of mainstream accommodation or which require refurbishment.  There are six sub-categories in band 2.  Each individual sub-category reflects the extent of an accommodation deficit or a refurbishment needed in a school.</P>
        <P>Band 3 addresses the needs of schools that have no deficit of mainstream accommodation but that have a deficit of ancillary accommodation.  There are five sub categories in band 3.  Again, each sub-category reflects the extent of ancillary accommodation deficits or the extent of improvement works needed for ancillary accommodation.  Band 4 addresses the needs of schools that have desirable but not urgent needs.</P>
        <P>I specify again that each school knows exactly what is its band and sub-band rating.  When it is necessary to select projects from within the same band, as a general principle, projects will be selected on the basis of enrolment stability, projects that have been the longest period in the planning process and the most cost effective solution.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the prioritisation criteria are clear and unambiguous and that they bring an openness and transparency to the school building and modernisation programme.  Their introduction has improved the management of the building programme in that a clear cut <Col N="325"/>selection process ensures an orderly advancement, over time, of school building projects with the most urgent need being addressed first.  I should also point out that with the introduction by the Government of the permanent accommodation, summer works and small schools schemes, the circulars governing these new initiatives have made it clear to schools which type of projects would qualify for funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The school works budget is slashed for this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already said that and I said also that the summer works scheme will be reintroduced next year.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the current status of individual applications for building works.  The school building and modernisation programme operates on a multi-annual basis.  This means that the Department must constantly have projects ready to proceed as and when the budgetary situation allows.  This approach ensures that the allocation in any given year is, on the one hand, spent but on the other hand it is kept under control.  Any other approach would make the management of the budget virtually impossible.</P>
        <P>The projects allowed to proceed at any given time are those that have the highest priority.  For example, at the time of an announcement, while there might be a number of band 2 projects ready to go to tender and construction, the number and cost of higher band 1 rated projects ready to proceed may be such that those on band 2  cannot be approved at that time.  As to when lower banded projects can proceed, this is determined by the extent of higher competing priorities on an on-going basis and the level of funding available.</P>
        <P>This is the dynamic of the school building programme and that is why it is not possible to provide indicative delivery timeframes for lower banded projects.  These can only be given when there is certainty that they can proceed, taking into account the financial resources available in any given year.  Projects that will deliver extra capacity in developing areas have been given priority under the banding system since its introduction.</P>
        <P>Delivering additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas must be a priority for the school building programme.  It is projected that 100,000 additional school places will be required over the coming years.  Senators will be aware that in the past newly-recognised schools have generally had to open in temporary accommodation and reference has been made to that here.  I have been anxious to move away from this  approach in developing areas, so there is a particular pressure on my budget this year.  We are working hard to ensure that as many new schools as possible open in permanent accommodation. That is a particular pressure on our building budget but it is the right thing to do.</P>
        <P>We will find this year that schools will open in developing areas with brand new buildings that have been built off site and dropped in with new innovative methods used, and those buildings will not be full this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The modular approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but they will fill up over the next couple of years.  It means that there is a particular draw on our budget this year because we are spending so much in those developing areas.  At the same time we are aiming to progress the projects in other areas.  In recent years, thousands of schools outside of developing areas have benefited from projects under the summer works and small schools schemes in recent years.  Many more will benefit from improvement works under the main programme and various devolved schemes in the years ahead.  It is also important to point out that all primary schools get an annual minor works grant which can be used at their discretion to carry out small-scale works.</P><Col N="326"/>
        <P>In November 2006, the Government increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year.  Around &euro;27 million was paid out to primary schools throughout the country late last year to enable thousands of small-scale works to be completed without the need to interact with the Department.  Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per pupil.</P>
        <P>The question of the provision of prefabricated accommodation has been raised on a number of occasions recently and again here this evening.  Senators will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has increased significantly in recent years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers, such as language teachers teaching English as an additional language, to schools in recent years, the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent accommodation could be provided.  However, we prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible.  This was the right decision.  Against this background, my Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low.</P>

	<P>At &euro;35 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Expenditure on the rental and purchase of temporary accommodation amounted to only 6.2% of the total investment in school buildings in 2007.  </P>

	<P>Not gaeilscoileanna.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This compares with 10.8% in 2003.  Suggestions often made that spending on prefabs has grown dramatically in recent years are misleading.  It should be also noted that temporary accommodation is not limited to prefabs and can also involve the rental of high quality buildings.  I assure Senators that the Government is determined to keep expenditure on prefabs as low as possible.  The database of temporary accommodation is currently being finalised and will obviously inform the Department&rsquo;s future decision-making in this area.</P>
        <P>The motion before the House today also refers to value for money.  Key initiatives in this area include the production of generic repeat designs to reduce costs and the use of the design and build model to transfer more risk to contractors.  As well as improving value for money, both of these developments have also helped us to deliver projects much faster.  The tendering of all school building projects on a fixed price basis also underpins the requirement to achieve value for money and the new forms of Government contracts will further assist in this.  The Department has also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects and, again, to achieve value for money.</P>
        <P>Senators may be also interested to know that we have prioritised energy efficiency in the interests both of the environment and of reducing schools&rsquo; running costs.  This has proven quite successful with modern-day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</P>
        <P>In respect of school planning, in recent years my Department has developed much closer working relations generally with local authorities, particularly in rapidly developing areas.  Last year, I met the county managers for Fingal, Meath, Kildare and Westmeath to follow up on communications between officials on school planning needs for 2008 and beyond.  The motion proposes that the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 be used for advancing future school building projects.  I assure the Senators that I am very anxious to <Col N="327"/>improve the procedures both for acquiring sites for schools and for securing the necessary planning permissions in a timely manner.  I have met the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss how the programme for Government commitments in respect of these matters can be progressed and a range of options are currently being explored.  We are also examining how the whole process of planning for schools can be improved with a view to ensuring large-scale residential developments are not approved by local authorities without adequate provision for schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>With a view to improving its own planning procedures, my Department&rsquo;s school planning and building unit has been recently re-organised with the establishment of a forward planning section and a developing areas unit.  A number of new staff were employed by the Department to work in these areas and there has been a significant redistribution of existing staff within the building unit.  That might give rise to some of the lack of information that was given to Senators.  I certainly accept that some of the answers that were given to Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in particular about raising a matter on the Adjournment, were inappropriate and should not have been said to a Senator.  It may be the case that staff were not able to give the information because we have made so many changes within the building unit and moved people around because of all the extra staff.  I will ensure that as soon as staff settle down in their new areas of responsibility, they will be able to give whatever information is available.  When dealing with all of this, what most schools want to know is whether the project is going ahead and if it is going ahead now.  As Senators are aware, all of the information as to what is moving was publicly available earlier this year.  I announced 38 school projects that were going to construction almost immediately.  Again, people will see that they followed precisely the main banding criteria.  Special schools were included because they were special schools.  Schools were included that were in developing areas.  We announced almost 30 new drop-in schools for developing areas which will be prioritised this year.  There are schools that have been on the list for a long time.  No school jumped a band, prioritisation or rating.  Anybody can look at the list and see that this is the case.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my speech, band 1 will always get priority.  I can only move on band 2 depending on what the costs are and the numbers in band 1 that are ready to move ahead.  There is a particular problem this year because of the developing areas and the fact that we have taken a policy decision not to build them up prefab upon prefab but to put in new buildings from the beginning so that we do not make the same mistakes that were made ten years ago from which schools are still trying to escape.</P>

	<P>The developing areas unit is tasked with meeting the immediate needs of areas experiencing significant increases in their school-going populations while the forward <Col N="328"/>planning section is responsible for identifying more medium-term needs so that we can plan for them well in advance.  To further strengthen the Department&rsquo;s planning capabilities, a geographic information system is currently being commissioned.  This system will be capable of bringing together information from a number of different sources on increasing population trends in areas of rapid growth.  In this way, we will be able to develop a digital picture of the country using these various sources of population-related data that will identify potential gaps in current or future school provision.  I say this with the rider that one can get population shifts that do not become known to the local community or schools until 1 September.  This has happened in areas in the past where people moved during the summer and suddenly looked for school places.  Hopefully, the buildings will now be available for them, particularly with the provision of new buildings in the developing areas.</P>
        <P>This Government has never underestimated the scale of the challenge facing us in ensuring that in the region of 4,000 schools all over the country have good quality accommodation.  Significantly increased resources for the building programme have enabled record progress to be made.  Transparency has been prioritised with the development, publication and implementation of the clear criteria which are used to prioritise applications for building works.  There also has been an emphasis on improving value for money through the range of initiatives I have outlined.  We are proud of what has been achieved in the past few years but, equally, I am fully conscious of the needs that remain throughout the country and am determined to address them, bearing in mind the needs that exist and taking into account the amount of money that is available to the Government from the taxpayers and other sources to enable us to do as much as we would like at any one time.</P>

	<P>I thank the Independent Senators for moving this motion.  I am pleased to see the Minister here tonight to listen to our concerns.  </P>
        <P>No matter what part of the country one goes to, one will find a primary school struggling with more or less the same three problems, namely, a lack of funding, school size and access routes and road safety in front of school buildings.  Those are three vital issues that affect the service provided to children and their parents.</P>
        <P>Education can have a direct impact on the state of our economy.  Last week, the OECD report on the future of the Irish economy pointed out that we are not making sufficient investment in education.  Inaction from the Department of Education and Science and parsimony from the Department of Finance mean that our schools are underfunded when compared to schools in the rest of Europe.  As a result, teachers are struggling to provide the education that is required by our schoolchildren.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have been in contact with a number of schools in my area in the past few days in advance of today&rsquo;s motion and one issue that comes up again and again is the lack of funding.  The level of capitation grant is essential to the service that is provided by schools but the money they receive from the Department is barely enough to cover the costs of electricity, heating and insurance.  After spending their capitation grants on these essentials, some schools cannot afford to buy a stick of chalk.  They cannot afford to put additional books in the library.  As a result, principals who should be dedicating their time to working out how best to provide an education for schoolchildren wonder how they will raise more money from the next cake sale or if an egg and spoon race will be held on Saturday to raise additional money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has promised to double the capitation grants but there is no indication when this money will appear.  As a result, there is a concern that primary schools can be run on the generosity of parents and on how much money they can contribute.</P>
        <P>Class sizes are also a major issue.  Large class sizes have resulted largely from the lack of a coherent school planning programme at a time of an expanding commuter belt and of expanding towns and villages within that belt.  Housing estates were built with no forward planning for the provision of schools and additional classrooms to cater for the increased school population.  It has led to a huge increase in pressure on schools in nearby towns and a dramatic and unpredictable increase in class sizes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will focus on some schools in the commuter belt.  Class sizes of 27 pupils per teacher are being managed in Duleek national school.  Class sizes of 30 pupils per teacher are anticipated in the national school in Donore from later this year.  Kentstown national school, which is in dire need of a new school building, expects to have a massive increase of pupils and it is expected it will have a pupil-teacher ratio of 33 pupils for every teacher this September.  Those class sizes can be compared or contrasted with class sizes in the member states of some of our European Union colleagues.  Slovakia has class sizes of 17 or 18 pupils per teacher, which is nearly half the pupil-teacher ratio we have.  Despite this, we expect to compete with these countries in Europe in the future.</P>
        <P>Stamullen national school, which is just north of Balbriggan, is also suffering in terms of class sizes.  As Balbriggan has continued to grow more and more parents have found it difficult to enrol their children in schools in the town, class sizes in Stamullen national school have increased.</P>
        <P>For a Government that made so many promises just nine months ago about how it would reduce class sizes, there is no real evidence that anything has been done.  If anything, concerns about this issue are now even greater than they were in 2007.  When there is a large increase in enrolments, a school can apply for development status and following approval by the Department, the allocation of additional teachers can be sanctioned for the school.  However, it makes little sense that teachers in a school such as Kentstown national school or Donore national school who teach under the pressure of large class sizes must make do with their allocation for the whole academic year before the Department allocates additional teaching resources.  Surely a better system should be put in place.  If it is known that schools predict a large increase in enrolments, surely that can be acted on earlier than the start of the next academic year to ensure the required teachers are in place.</P>
        <P>Another issue that is a cause of concern is the location of schools, access to them and road safety in their environs.  A new commercial development has been built beside Donore national school which has caused additional traffic not only during its construction but also following it.  Parents are concerned about the impact of the additional traffic on road safety and on their children accessing the school safely.</P>
        <P>In another school in Bellewstown in east Meath, quarry traffic passes the school daily but, unfortunately, the council can only afford to improve road safety outside three schools in east Meath every year.  This year road safety will be improved outside the schools in Knockcommon, Stackallen and Lobinstown, but other schools such as the school in Donacarney will have to wait their turn, and the impact it will have on children&rsquo;s safety is worrying.  It is vital that more money is invested in initiatives such as walking buses and safe routes to schools to make it easier for children to go to and from schools.</P>
        <P>The primary education system is the bedrock of our economy.  Our future economic growth depends on it.  I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s speech with interest but am concerned it amounts to <Col N="330"/>just more empty promises.  We cannot survive on empty promises.  More money needs to be invested in our schools.  More teachers and better school buildings are required.  The Independent Senators&rsquo; motion reflects that and more money needs to be invested in this important area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the presence of the Minister of State for this debate and that of the Minister earlier.  The Government amendment states a number of facts.  More money is being spent in Department of Education and Science than has ever spent previously.  More money is being spent on the schools building programme.  More new schools are being built and more schools are being maintained than ever previously.  Despite this and partially because of something the Minister said in her contribution, expectations are not being met.  Tolerance levels that prevailed many years ago were far too high for school conditions that passed for acceptable but were far too low.  School communities and the parents of children rightly do not expect their children to be educated or to spend their time in an environment where they are not provided with proper resources and facilities over prolonged periods.  That is the position in which we find ourselves, despite the increase in resources in this area.</P>
        <P>Much of the frustration that exists is not only because of failure to deliver school building projects within an understandable span of time but also because of the existing information systems advising the people concerned whether their schools building project and their communities will be provided for.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can cite an example of a public meeting I attended on 14 April concerning the Star of the Sea school in Passage West in the area I represent.  Five D&aacute;il Deputies and two Members of this House were present at that meeting.  An expectation had been created regarding that school in 1999 when two primary schools merged, but it has still not been met.  It is the fourth such public meeting I attended concerning that school over a three-year period and its status has not changed.  When that kind of limbo approach exists towards schools building projects and the development of a community, we must recognise that the system is not working and we need to come up with better alternatives.  During the nine-year timeframe while that school has been waiting for something to happen, during which little or no progress has been made, we have had four successive Ministers for Education Science and three separate systems of providing information as to where the school exists on a list within the schools building programme of the Department of Education and Science.  Each of those systems was inadequate in its own right.</P>
        <P>The encouragement offered in the Government amendment is a commitment towards providing or seeking to improve information systems, which is the crux of this problem.  If people do not know the status of a school project, the expectations that are being created may never be met.  The Minister spoke about the banding system, a type of a league system comprising bands 1 to 4.  If a school is categorised in band 4, the school in question and community concerned can be assured that there will be very little activity or movement in the granting of that schools building project.</P>
        <P>It is a little like asking a school and community to consider themselves the Kilkenny Gaelic football team of school provision.  I did not mean to refer to the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s constituency.  It is a reality that some teams never win games.  Even if they win once every four years, what they might get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>If a team manages to win a game once every four years, the nature of that win, in school terms is that a design team has been appointed.  That is the case of the school in Cork in respect of which several of us attended a public meeting the other day.  That is the essence of the frustration experienced by all public representatives.

	<P>I understand that.

        <P>The amendment proposed by the Government includes the key commitment of working towards improving the information-giving systems.  As a member of the Government, that is a commitment I hope the Minister can deliver upon.  I do not want to see a situation whereby the school in which I have attended four public meetings in the past three years will conduct a further four public meetings but will still be at the same stage with the same level of expectation and with no-one in the political system either providing them with answers or with hope that what they as a community should have a right to expect will be delivered upon.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I restate the arguments of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Boyle.  This motion is not about finance or resourcing but about categorisation and about people knowing where they are on the schools building programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion is about providing answers to school principals, staff, parents and pupils.  If the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, does nothing else tonight but relays that simple message to the Minister, we will have got somewhere.  If Senator Boyle can use his influence in Government, which he professes to have, then he will have done a great day&rsquo;s work.</P>
        <P>There are schools in my constituency of Cork South-Central to which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the former Minister for Education and Science, made a plethora of promises.  I will not name those promises but we all know what they are.  There is no transparency, accountability or openness in the Department regarding the school building programme.</P>
        <P>I telephoned the Department recently to inquire about the Star of the Sea school in Passage West.  I was told that the principal officer who had been dealing with the matter had moved to another section.  The person to whom I spoke claimed to have only taken over responsibility and suggested I call again in four weeks&rsquo; time.   I rang again and was told that the person responsible had changed jobs again.  It is not good enough.</P>
        <P>Why are Members of this House constantly tabling matters on the Adjournment and why are our colleagues in the other House tabling endless numbers of parliamentary questions about the schools building programme?  It is because of sheer frustration.  If Members on the Government side put themselves in the position of a school principal, the chairman of a board of management, a teacher in a sub-standard school or a pupil who is being educated in a school with no running water or with sub-standard toilet facilities, they would not be happy either.  They should not tell us that everything is great.  We know there has been substantial investment in schools.  The former Deputy, Ray MacSharry, coined the phrase &ldquo;boom and bloom&rdquo;, but boom and bloom has been replaced by absolute chaos in the schools building programme.</P>
        <P>The people are despondent and angry and are waiting in the long grass.  The teachers of Ireland are sick of it.  This is not a matter of the INTO playing politics.  It is about absolute, genuine frustration.  I say that as a former schoolteacher who meets colleagues daily.  Let us have a debate about transparency and openness.</P>
        <P>The bands are fine but schools do not know where they go when they get to band 3, 2 or 1.  How do they get onto step one of the categorisation?  When will they be told they can move from the design to the build phase?   The people in Passage West watched while a school up the <Col N="333"/>road from them was fast-tracked by Ministers playing politics.  That is not good enough.  We are talking about the children of Ireland and our education system.  If we are serious about being a knowledge-based economy, the Government must be honest and transparent with the people, which is not happening at present.  Senator Boyle knows that quite well and would agree with me.</P>
        <P>It is about time we woke up to the reality.  Let us get rid of the scripts.  We have Adjournment debates in the House and they are a joke and a farce.  My six-year old niece could write the replies.  We get flowery rhetoric.</P>

	<P>It does, thanks to the teachers.  The Senator is dead right.  We get flowery rhetoric but no delivery and no accountability.  The time has come to deliver on the schools building programme and to be honest with schools and boards of management.  They should be told when their waiting time begins and ends.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion and I congratulate the Independent Senators on tabling it.  What is clear from comments from all Senators is that the secrecy and mystery around the school building programme must go.  It causes endless upset to teachers, boards of management, parents and children.</P>
        <P>We need more transparency and this motion says it all regarding the schools building programme.  I hope the Department will take on board what it says.  What is the problem with being open about the decision-making involved?  It will help everyone and will take pressure off the Department and the Minister.  If there was a tracking procedure, for example, whereby people could<i> </i>consult the Department via its website or by telephone and obtain proper information, it would ease the pressure on the Department in many ways.  The lack of transparency, the secrecy and the lack of information means schools do not know where they are on the list or what the waiting time will be.  This causes enormous frustration, disappointment and anger among parents and children.</P>
        <P>There are a number of schools in my constituency which have been waiting for schools building projects to begin.  Pupils from St. Brigid&rsquo;s school in Palmerstown visited this House approximately two weeks ago.  They asked me when they would be moving into the prefabs so that their school could be refurbished.  Those prefabs cost &euro;10,000 per month to rent and are standing empty.  They have been in place since September 2007 when pupils expected to move while the school was being refurbished.  The Department of Education and Science has spent &euro;80,000 already on rent for prefabs that are unused.  They are under a one-year contract so they will cost a total of &euro;120,000.  That is wasteful and inefficient as well as being disappointing for everyone involved.  The refurbishment of the school has been put on hold and no one knows what is going to happen to the prefabs.  Will the contract be renewed for a further year?  No one can find out what is going on.  I cannot find out, either through Adjournment debates or parliamentary questions tabled by my colleagues, when the school will be provided with the money required for its refurbishment.</P>
        <P>Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige, a school in Clondalkin, is in a most appalling condition.  The problems have existed since the school opened eight years ago, including holes in the floor.  The conditions are dreadful for the children attending that school.  A new gaelscoil complex was promised before the general election last year but there is no timeframe, transparency or clarity on when whatever band the school is in will mean delivery of a new school building.</P>
        <P>The list goes on.  Another school in my constituency, St. Andrew&rsquo;s, was told the Department of Education and Science is looking for a site for the school.  To the best of my knowledge, the <Col N="334"/>same reply has been given time and again with no sense of progress being made.  No one knows when the school will get a site or funding to develop, even though the school has a long waiting list.</P>
        <P>Where is the transparency?  Why is it missing?  Where is the accountability?  How can one establish where schools lie in order of priority and the rationale behind their positions in the Department&rsquo;s priority list?  That is what is needed and the motion before the House addresses all of those issues.  I ask the Department and the Minister to take on board the contents of this motion and make the kinds of changes recommended therein.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan.  In the National Development Plan 2000-2006, funding of &euro;2.6 billion was provided for 7,800 building projects.  A further &euro;4.5 billion is to be invested in school buildings in the next few years.  The crux of this issue is that the new planning and building unit has been reorganised along with the forward planning section for developing areas.  The Minister has placed huge emphasis on this and it is important that the unit liaises with local authorities, identifies where schools are needed and ensures they are delivered as quickly as possible.  That is what the Minister and myself want and we must push for this.</P>
        <P>Information systems must be improved.  Population trends must be assessed for enrolment at primary level and increased migration must be taken into account.  The Minister emphasised she wants transparency about this and she has made no bones about that.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the proposed joined up thinking involving the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities, county managers, the Minister for Education and Science and the Dublin transport authority.  All the stakeholders should work closely when planning schools building projects.</P>
        <P>I recall when I was a member of South Dublin County Council being involved in drafting a local area plan for Adamstown, which worked well.  We assessed the area&rsquo;s needs, acquired a school site, developed the infrastructure in the area and everything worked beautifully.  This method may not work properly everywhere but it has worked for me and Adamstown is a prime example of joined up thinking working on the ground.  That must be the way forward and this is the Minister&rsquo;s concept for the future.  Housing, education and community facilities must be considered together and that must be replicated throughout the State.</P>
        <P>The information systems used by the building unit must be improved because this is a weakness.  However, the Minister has put emphasis on opening up our thinking on how we link with the public at large.  Her heart is in the right place and she wants to go in the same direction as us.  The building unit must be upgraded and she will take note of the issues raised in the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NedOSullivan"><NameTxt>Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ormonde for sharing time.  I support the amendment to the motion but I cannot pretend that I fail to understand from where Senator O&rsquo;Toole and his Independent colleagues are coming.  Anybody in the real world or anybody who comes from an education background like myself will be aware of the immense frustration of school authorities at primary and secondary level regarding where they stand on the building programme.</P>
        <P>I would like to instance three schools in my constituency, Kerry North.  Drumclough national school may have been mentioned by Senator O&rsquo;Toole who is very involved with it.  The authorities have been waiting two years for a technical inspection team to visit.  That is difficult to explain because it is a matter of priority, not planning.  Listowel Presentation primary school has seven prefabricated buildings and it is groaning for space.  The school authorities do not know what band they are on and when progress will be made.  They cannot make proper plans <Col N="335"/>for the future.  I was briefed earlier by Councillor Norma Foley from Tralee on Blennerville national school.  The school authorities have a major problem.  They were approved for a new school in 2000 and eight years later students are in rooms measuring 17 sq ft and nothing is happening.</P>
        <P>The Minister rightly expects that local authorities will consider educational provision when they grant planning permissions for large scale residential developments.  I spent 25 years in local government and there are two sides to that story.  It is a big ask of county planners to unilaterally say they cannot grant permission for a 50-house development, for example, because access is not available for a school.  There must be communication in this regard and this has particularly affected the development of gaelscoileanna in Kerry, of which I approve and support 100%.  Very often the enthusiasm to establish a gaelscoil outruns common sense and provision.  Gaelscoileanna have started up in unsuitable accommodation such as private houses and the local authority is then expected to provide school wardens, roads, lighting and so on.  It is a two-way issue.  The Department must put up its hands and get involved as well.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on her move to rationalise education.  She initiated the north Kerry educational review and it has been a great success.  It is supported by the trustees of the various schools, parents, teachers and boards of management.  If such a hands-on approach were taken on school planning, it might be a better way to go.  As Senator Ormonde said, the Minister&rsquo;s heart is in the right place.  Money is important to every venture and perhaps it is not as fl&uacute;irseach as it was over the past five years.  We must be sympathetic towards the Minister&rsquo;s position in that respect but the Department has questions to answer and it needs to be more hands on in the provision of school buildings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Mullen.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this useful and pertinent debate.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole refers to the inordinate amount of parliamentary time consumed by these matters.  Every Member has tabled an Adjournment matter on schools building projects and has large files on the matter and numerous examples have been outlined in the debate.  The Minister attempted to address a number of the issues but, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said to me when I whispered in his shell like ear, what one needs is the spade in the ground.  Getting on to bands may sound good but action, a timetable and information are needed.  One does not need to be given the run-around and this is why there is so much frustration among school authorities and why they write to even people like myself.  Members receive a significant number of inquiries in this regard.</P>
        <P>The motion is extremely sensible, as it proposes clear visibility in the criteria and clear accountability so that schools know their ranking and have an idea of the date for a project.  There are too many prefabricated buildings and it is not fair on the children.  I welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s contribution.  He proposed a decent approach.  He accepts the reality, as did Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan, and it is not easy when one is on the Government benches to acknowledge this.  That indicates we are all going in the same direction, although it is not possible for the Government Members to be as trenchant as some of us.</P>
        <P>I refer to the new Carbury school in Sligo.  It is the only Protestant school in the town.  It began as a model school in a historic building, which is now the Model Arts and Niland Gallery, having been handed over by the board of management.  In 1977 a new school was built on a site belonging to the Incorporated Society of Ireland, next door to Sligo grammar school.  Because the school has been successful, conditions are cramped, with six portakabins on the campus.  Three are used as classrooms, two for resource classes and one as a staffroom.  The school has no dedicated assembly hall for daily use.  The teachers and pupils must juggle between classrooms, having to move desks and so on to take part in indoor activities.  The <Col N="336"/>portakabins are rented, which is an expense.  The parents have raised the amount required &mdash; &euro;63,000.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Department granted approval for a new school building and planning permission was granted in April 2007.  The parents have been campaigning for the school for ten years.  They were asked to get ready to decamp.  They received planning permission in December 2007 and in the same month a decision was made not to proceed.  This is dreadful and demonstrates the kind of agony and frustration applicants are put through.</P>
        <P>This matter related to Carbury school, but to demonstrate the non-sectarian nature of my interest in my constituency, I would like to refer to the Holy Rosary national school in Oldcourt, Dublin 24.  Sr. Mary O&rsquo;Neill and some of the parents were in touch with me about the school.  One of the pupils wrote to me and said they used to have a playing field, but now it is covered with portakabins.  This little girl told me she and her friend found a dead rat one day and a girl who walked on it was sick and had to go home as a result.  This is grim stuff for a child to endure.  A mother of some of these children wrote to me and said her oldest child is in a prefab and her next child will be in one next year.  They move the children on from the prefabs each year because the conditions are so bleak.  The buildings are miserable, cold and rat infested.</P>
        <P>Conditions are terrible.  Teachers going to class have to drive their cars between the prefabs in the playground and it is only a matter of time before a child is injured.  The home-school-community liaison teacher has a desk in a corridor.  Is this acceptable in this day and age, considering these cold, flimsy prefabs cost the State a non-returnable &euro;100,000 a year?</P>
        <P>The Minister also should give consideration to the Montessori schools which are anomalous because they get no funding at all.  The Montessori school in Celbridge, the Glebe Montessori junior school, needs to upgrade its building and equipment, but it gets no assistance because it is not on the register.  This is another little bureaucratic technical manoeuvre that gets the Department out of funding one of the best educational systems in the country.  I hope the Minister takes this on board and considers the possibility of providing funding to Montessori schools which do such an excellent job, in particular the one at Glebe.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for tabling this motion and support the proposals he has made.  Like Senator Norris, I too have been in touch with individual cases in this regard.  Some time ago the principal of a school in my parish, Eglish national school in Ahascragh, County Galway, wrote to me.  Although the principal provided an excellent summary of the situation in the school, it had to be seen to be believed.  I spent some time in the school and thought I would see the problems the principal had outlined in her letter in 20 minutes, but it took an hour or more to view the various problems.  The problems are typical.  The school has approximately 48 pupils, has no central heating and is very draughty, which gives rise to a terrible waste of money because a significant proportion of the capitation is spent on ESB payments.  The principal had described in her letter the mould and damp throughout the school and had mentioned that a family of snails had taken up permanent residence on the ceiling of one of the classrooms.  She had not exaggerated, because I met that family subsequently during my visit.</P>
        <P>In fairness to the Department, the principal&rsquo;s letter was given a sympathetic response and she has been in touch with the Department&rsquo;s planning and modernisation section.  However, an interesting point to consider is whether there is flexibility in the system.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others have spoken eloquently about the importance of having a transparent system where people will know exactly what stage their school is at.  The Department gave approval to Eglish national school for a devolved grant to build prefabs on the footprint of the school and it hopes <Col N="337"/>to get a more permanent facility, but when it sent its plans to the prefab manufacturers it was offered another option and told it could have a more permanent modular school building, to the same specification, for a relatively small extra cost.  In such a case, does the Department have the flexibility to choose the good economic option and allow what is needed?</P>

	<P>I accept there must be an emphasis on developing areas and ones of rapid population expansion, but it is also important not to forget rural areas.  In County Cavan, for example, we see the greatest increase in enrolment apart from Dublin.</P>
        <P>We also need to know about current planning and whether there is real vision in what the Department is doing.  Take for example the new proposed Phoenix Park community national school which is to be opened in September 2008.  We have discovered that this school is in the wrong place and has a very small enrolment application, not even enough to make an infant class.  Why has this gone ahead, particularly when in St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in the parish of Castleknock there are still approximately 20 vacant places and also vacant places in Blanchardstown.  Why was the decision made to situate the Phoenix Park school in that area?</P>
        <P>The Muslim community in north Dublin has been offered a site for its school that is outside its catchment area.  If the school moves to that site, it will lose half its enrolment, but if it does not move, it will be pushed back down the list.  We seem to have a situation where the Department asks what sites are available, what schools want a site and decides a school should go to one of these sites regardless of the school catchment area and where people live.</P>
        <P>I will finish with a plea for consultation.  It is vital the Department continues to consult all relevant parties.  I am aware the commission on school accommodation has failed to meet trustees and education partners for three years.  Why do we have a situation where boards of management are told to prepare for building while trustees are not spoken to until the last minute?  This is a sign of bad planning and communication and I hope it ends soon.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, but I am somewhat disappointed the Minister had to leave as only she can understand what I have to say.  I support the motion moved by the Independent Senators and commend them on tabling it.  I have raised the matter of the band ratings of schools several times on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>While the Minister was in the House she spoke about schools in developing areas.  Athlone community college is in a developing area but the plans for its development have been dragging on for years.  A public meeting has been called for next week, to which all Oireachtas Members have been invited.  The new development unit in the Department appears to me to act as another delaying tactic and a cause of confusion for the parents and teachers in Athlone community college.  The college went to tender and design stage and has been years waiting for development, but all of a sudden, in response to the matter which I raised on the Adjournment last week, we have been told that a development unit has been set up for developing areas.  Athlone has been a developing area for a long time.  The school is to cater for 1,000 pupils and already has that number of pupils.  Therefore, there is no need for it to go through a procedure involving the development unit.  I feel frustrated by the r&aacute;im&eacute;is that is being thrown at us in this regard.</P>
        <P>The principal of a school in Nenagh wrote to me about the summer works scheme.  I do not know why he wrote to me because I am from Athlone but I suppose as a Senator I represent <Col N="338"/>all the country.  I welcome his letter.  The summer works scheme was an excellent scheme and I welcome the announcement of its return.  However, what are schools to do this year?  The architect told the principal of the school in Nenagh that all areas checked need serious attention and should not be left as they were much longer as they pose a health and safety risk in their current state.  No other alternatives to the summer works scheme are available for such works.  What is the school to do while its pupils face these health and safety risks?  The Minister said the scheme will be available again next year, but what are school principals to do in the meantime?</P>

	<P>Can the Minister of State find out and inform me in writing the situation with regard to the devolved building programme scheme?  Funding was made available through this scheme to local communities so that they could get involved in building their own schools.  This scheme would work well in an area such as Killucan which is a developing area with significant numbers of new houses.  This proactive community has found its own site so this scheme would work well for it.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has met the Westmeath county manager to discuss the situation, which is a good idea.  As chairman of the strategic planning committee, I had asked for a school needs assessment.  We need this sort of joined-up thinking in each county.</P>

	<P>The imminent building of a number of schools &mdash; there is a glaring case in my own area in Virginia, County Cavan &mdash; was announced during the previous general election, but as yet there is not a sod turned.  Unfortunately, such sinister and cynical announcements are common in politics at present and this needs to change.  We need objective criteria and fair, transparent tracking procedures.  It must be clear to people where they stand in the pecking order, the reason they stand there and how the waiting system works.  If we do not separate such announcements from narrow party politics, all confidence will be eroded.  The Department of Education and Science should establish an e-mail address so that schools may access information about their position and what will happen at any time.  The schools should know their ranking.</P>
        <P>There has been poor planning for increases in population.  In south County Cavan, which is part of the area I represent, there has been a population explosion due to the growth of the Dublin commuter belt.  This has not been reflected by an increase in the number of school buildings.  There should be co-ordination between the planning sections of local authorities and <Col N="339"/>the planning unit of the Department of Education and Science as a matter of urgency.  Schools must be built to meet a burgeoning population.</P>
        <P>It is perverse and wrong that portakabins are taking up space in playing areas in schools and it is equally perverse that these cost significant sums of money in the short term.  It is similarly perverse that we need distinct architectural reports and designs for individual schools.  Several in-house designs at departmental level should be available instantly.</P>
        <P>There needs to be an immediate audit of where we stand and a transparent system put in place so that for eternity &mdash; this will apply to my party in Government in the future &mdash; no party will ever engender mystique around the building of schools and no party can mollify and fool the people, who subvent these schools, into believing they are in a certain position and that political patronage is giving them their school.  We need an objective process immediately.  This is urgent and I congratulate my Independent colleagues on tabling this motion which merits a proper response from the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey.  The Minister of State should put his hands up, be generous and say that it is time to end the nonsense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments of Senator O&rsquo;Reilly and thank the Independent Senators for tabling this motion.  The first line of the motion refers to the inordinate amount of parliamentary time consumed by a contentious stream of Adjournment motions.  I have brought four of these since Christmas and I need to bring another motion next week.</P>
        <P>I am sure Senators on all sides of the House know of examples of schools, whether primary or secondary, where there are ongoing difficulties with the schools building programme and placement of these schools on the programme.  I welcome the opportunity to have a full and frank discussion about the problems that pertain to this matter.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed by some of the sentiments I have heard.  I did not hear the remarks of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, but I read what she said.  It seems to me from some of the sentiments expressed by Senators on the Government side of the House that, to an extent, they are talking out of both sides of their mouth on this subject.  They accept the merits of the motion yet they will vote for the Government amendment.  This is rather neat as it ignores completely the motion we are discussing and the amendment does not tackle any of the substantive issues raised.</P>
        <P>An issue that has bothered me when examining the schools accommodation system is the excessive reliance in many areas on prefabricated buildings and several previous speakers have mentioned this.  I was alerted to the startling fact that since 2000, Government spending on prefabricated structures in schools has increased ninefold to more than &euro;35 million last year.  If ever there was a case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish this is it.  In a response to a parliamentary question recently the Minister for Education and Science was not able to outline the number of prefabricated school buildings in the State.  The Minister said that such statistics were only available on school files and not in the Department of Education and Science.  This is the reason a central part of this motion proposes there should be an audit of school buildings, lands and prefabricated buildings attached to schools throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I know of a number of schools including Col&aacute;iste Pobail Osra&iacute; &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, was in the House some weeks ago dealing with this issue &mdash; where no site has yet been agreed for a building.  It has been a struggle to get engineers from the Department of Education and Science on site to examine the options.  Colaiste Pobail Osra&iacute; has had continual problems with the number of students housed in prefabricated buildings.</P>
        <P>Scoil Airegail in Ballyhale, County Kilkenny, is a relatively modern secondary school and the main school building was built approximately 15 years ago.  However, up to half the students there are accommodated in prefabricated buildings, which defeats the purpose of building a <Col N="340"/>new school.  Ballinkillen national school in County Carlow is another example where this is the case.  The entire gaelscoil in Carrick-on-Suir which is on the edge of my constituency &mdash; my first cousin is a teacher there &mdash; is a prefabricated building.  It does not have a single solid structure.</P>
        <P>I refer to the shocking situation with regard to education in New Ross, County Wexford, which I raised recently with the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, and some of his colleagues.  In this case because of the ongoing difficulties with the amalgamation of primary and secondary level, there has been no capital funding for schools in New Ross for the past six years.  It was either Senator McFadden or Senator O&rsquo;Reilly who mentioned that schools are installing prefabricated buildings in the playing areas.  At St. Canice&rsquo;s national school in Rosbercon the multi-purpose room is now two classrooms and there are four prefabricated buildings in the yard.  They do not have a playing area of any description anymore.  There are numerous other examples throughout the country.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments of Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole on the governance issues.  I am not very information technology literate but I spent several hours this afternoon trying to decipher the Department of Education and Science website.  To say it is not user-friendly would be putting it mildly.</P>

	<P>Senator Ross is correct to mention that a school principal, parent or pupil should be able to look at the departmental website and see where they are on the waiting list for additional school buildings.</P>
        <P>Senators Ross and O&rsquo;Reilly were among the previous speakers who mentioned the perception of stroke pulling in the area of providing new school buildings.  Whether it exists in reality, the perception exists.  If the Government is to do anything, it is essential that it no longer allows the provision of school buildings, whether at primary or secondary level, to be a political football.  It is clear to me a points system needs to be put in place.  Senator Dan Boyle mentioned a band system, which is not mentioned in the amendment.  Perhaps the Minister for Education and Science mentioned it.  Some local authorities operate housing lists on the basis of a weighted or points system.  This type of system for school buildings should be put in place.  There is an urban-rural conflict.  Senator McFadden referred to urban areas such as Athlone where the population has increased greatly in the past ten years, leading to a scarcity of school facilities.  In many cases schools in urban areas have been provided with prefabricated buildings which is a short-term measure, whereas schools in rural areas have problems with loss of teachers, dilapidated buildings and infestation by all sorts of undesirable creatures.</P>
        <P>This motion is clear in its intent and I endorse it wholeheartedly.  I congratulate the Independent Senators for tabling it and it would be beneficial to the provision of educational facilities and services if it were to be adopted by the Government.  I am disappointed at the mealy-mouthed amendment proposed by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a magnificent motion and I also congratulate the Independent Senators on tabling it.  Much good sense about not making the subject of school buildings a political football has been spoken tonight.  This has been the case all too often, particularly at election time.  I refer to two schools in my area, Bunnyconnellan national school and an exten<Col N="341"/>sion to the sports hall at Davitt College in Castlebar, which have been used as political footballs on numerous occasions.  I am disappointed with the Minister for Education and Science in regard to a sports hall for Davitt College in Castlebar which has been coming on stream every year for the past 20 years.  Prior to the last general election the Minister for Education and Science informed us it was on the way, but there is still no sign of the funding.  I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister the cases of Bunnyconnellan national school and the urgent need for a sports hall for Davitt College in Castlebar.  I am being parochial but this is a school of 600 to 700 pupils and it does not have a sports hall which is unusual in this day and age.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why the Department of Education and Science does not use standard plans for a one, two, three or four-teacher national school.  The Department goes to the expense of hiring very expensive architects who produce extensive plans when a two-teacher or three-teacher school should be the same whether it is in Donegal, Dublin, Mayo or Kerry.  That makes common sense but the Department of Education and Science and the architects employed to build all these different types of new schools do not seem to think that.  One can recognise a school building a mile away and they cost a fortune in architects&rsquo; fees.  The process should be streamlined and simple off-the-shelf plans that could be rushed through should be used in order that extensions or new school buildings, particularly for two to five teachers, are not delayed.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make those points.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place a mechanism so that people can find out where in the queue lies their school project, whether it is an extension, a new school or a sports hall.  This would remove much of the drudgery for politicians and for parents who are often very excited at the prospect of obtaining such facilities for their children, which they deserve.  As Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly said, people should have access to a website where they can view the progress in the queue of their school projects.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, to the House and thank him for paying attention to the debate.  I thank all the Senators who spoke in the debate.  These include Senators Keaveney, Healy Eames, Hannigan, Boyle, Buttimer, Fitzgerald, Ormonde, O&rsquo;Sullivan, Norris, Mullen, McFadden, O&rsquo;Reilly, Phelan and Burke and their contributions contained a common theme.  I refer to the point made by Senator Burke, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, about the design issue.  This is not a new idea.  Anyone driving around the country will easily recognise a school building, such as the one visited by Senator Mullen in Ahascragh, which are what I describe as the Boyd Barrett-type schools.  They were designed by Boyd Barrett in the 1950s and 1960s and are long schools with a water tower to one side. </P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not a new idea.  More than 20 or 25 years ago I made a presentation to the Department of Education that there should be a set number of pre-designed schools.  I received a contemptuous response from the Department in which I was asked whether I was trying to &ldquo;bungalow bliss&rdquo; primary school buildings.  People of a certain age will remember a book of house designs called <i>Bungalow Bliss</i>, written by a former Member of this House, Jack Fitzsimons from County Meath.  It was a cheap method of sourcing house designs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  I understand the Department has made a move in that direction and it has a number of standard plans which it will propose.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to take note of a few points.  Politics is being demeaned by this process.  Irrespective of whether it is true, people believe that focal sa ch&uacute;irt is what is making this work.  I listened to a man on the radio this morning who spoke about receiving a letter from the Minister before the election stating that a project was going to start and I listened to Senator Burke talking about the sports hall in Castlebar which was promised also in a letter sent before the election, but neither has happened.</P><Col N="342"/>
        <P>I ask my colleagues on the Government side to take note that there is no mention of resources in my motion tonight.  I deliberately did not include the issue of resources so that it would not be necessary for people to tell me what the Government is spending.  Whether there is &euro;1 million, &euro;1 billion or &euro;10 billion to be expended, the issues I set out in my motion must be dealt with.  It is disgraceful that the senior Minister in the Department in her response was not able to deal with the questions of audit &mdash; internal and external &mdash; of governance or of inventory, except in a passing reference to rented prefabricated buildings.  That is the measure of the importance of the motion.  It is disgraceful that whoever put the speech together in the Department could not even answer questions on simple issues.</P>
        <P>I want to say something else to my colleagues on the Government side.  There is no mention of bands.  A page and a half of the Minister&rsquo;s speech referred to bands but there was no need for that as the information can be downloaded from the website which contains six pages about the different bands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There has been no mention in the debate of the stages of the building process.  These are the preliminary stage, initial sketch scheme, sketch and design stage, detailed design, tender action and evaluation, construction and hand-over of works.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not say a word about these stages.  This leaves the House with a shortfall in information.  It precisely illustrates the point I am making that one can hear much but learn nothing.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If the Minister says a particular school is in band 1 and outlines the appropriate criteria, I accept that without question.  The question is, as Senator Norris asked, how a school can move from band 1 to the stage where a spade is put in the ground.  How long after attaining band 1 status will the JCBs move in?  When a school gets to the detailed design and sketch stage, how does it move to the next stage?  Reference was made during this debate to a school whose management was told 11 years ago that a design team would be assigned.  Nothing has happened.  I heard a school manager speaking on the radio this morning about the absence of any progress since he received a letter from the Minister in October 2006 informing him that a design team was to be appointed to the school.  Blennerville national school in Tralee began the application process in 1996 and was told it was ready to move to stage one.  The school is still waiting for a design team to be sent in.  Dromclough national school is waiting since January 2006 for a design team.  Rahan national school in Mallow is awaiting the arrival of the design team it was promised in 2003 or 2004.  There are too many such examples to recount.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>This is the crux of the issue.  It is not a question of the bands but rather the stages of the building process.  Every time a particular schools building project is raised on the Adjournment debate, including schools in Senator Keaveney&rsquo;s county, the question is always about when the design team will come or when the construction contract will be put out to tender.  Today, however, the Minister did not make even a passing reference to this process for the simple reason that she did not dare do so.  I understand well her reluctance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>She offered no specifics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I completely agree with the Minister that the urgent will always displace the less urgent.  That is the nature of prioritising, and political leadership is about setting priorities.  In the case at hand, I accept that a school which is considered the number one priority one week may, for various reasons, be displaced by another school the following week.  There is nothing wrong with that.  However, when was the last time we heard anyone in the Department of Education and Science be truthful to any school authority in this regard?  If that information were made available, we could assess whether it is right or wrong, fair or otherwise.</P>
        <P>The points I have raised do not relate to resources.  There is nothing in this motion that requires an increased allocation of resources.  The fewer the resources, the more important it is that there should be accountability.  The reality is that the Department of Finance has issued a demand for internal audit processes, but we heard nothing about that in the debate.  As I mentioned earlier, the Department of the Taoiseach has set up a new structure to oversee a briefing and organisational review programme dealing with such issues as customer service and delivery, governance, and customer and stakeholder feedback.  None of these issues is currently being heeded.  There is an information deficit.  Senator Boyle made the same point although he did not express it as eloquently as I have.  We must tackle these deficiencies.</P>
        <P>I assure the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, that I will not relent on this issue.  Any Member who wishes to raise a particular schools building project on the Adjournment must be prepared to box clever.  An t&eacute; nach bhfuil l&aacute;idir, n&iacute; fol&aacute;ir d&oacute; bheith glic.  He who is not strong must be a little clever.  I suggest that Members be more specific in framing these Adjournment matters.  We must ask precisely what stage in the building process the school is at and exactly what is required to advance to the next stage.</P>
        <P>I intend to table an Adjournment matter asking the Minister to explain the internal audit process and the quality assurance schemes that are in place.  I will ask direct questions which the Minister may refuse to answer.  In that case, I will approach the Committee of Public Accounts, either by writing to it or asking to make a presentation.  I will ask all these questions and have them answered.  We are talking about taxpayers&rsquo; money.  There would be uproar, for example, if the national lottery used the same types of blindfolded procedures for spending the moneys assigned to it.  The same accountability is required of the schools building programme.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Smith.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, can make progress with the issue I am raising if he is not moved in next week&rsquo;s reshuffle.  The Mercy Hospital is one of the most important hospitals in Cork.  The Government and the HSE provided funding of &euro;5 million for an accident and emergency department at the hospital which remains idle.  Last week, the chief executive and the board of the hospital were forced to go public about the fact that they do not have enough funding to staff the department.  They have decided to open the department from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. only.  The Minister of State will agree that the shortfall in funding is not good enough.  The new accident and emergency department unit at the Mercy Hospital is lying idle as a result of the inexcusable delay in arranging a meeting between the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the board of the hospital.</P>
        <P>This is unfair to the people of Cork and to the patients who are suffering.  They are again being forced to endure a second-class service.  What this means in real terms is that between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. we will send 10,000 people to the accident and emergency department of Cork University Hospital, the second busiest hospital in Cork.  The hospital deals with 25,000 patients and allowing for 40% of these to present after 8 p.m. gives a total of approximately 10,000 people.</P>
        <P>It is time that the Mercy Hospital, which has given great service to the city, receives recognition.  It is not good enough that it took the board and chief executive of the Mercy Hospital to <Col N="345"/>go public with this dilemma to obtain a meeting with the HSE.  Meetings and promises have been postponed.  This issue involves at most 24 full-time staff and must be resolved.  It is time the Department of Health and Children and the HSE took responsibility.  This is about commitment to the people of Cork and the Mercy Hospital.</P>
        <P>It is almost the end of April and a new Taoiseach is about to take office and select a new Cabinet.  However, the same problem pertaining to the Mercy Hospital remains.  The Minister of State will reply that the Mercy Hospital is over budget, or whatever is the line from the HSE.  I am sure Professor Drumm is a very good surgeon and consultant.  However, his management of the Health Service Executive leaves many questions to be answered.</P>
        <P>We are not talking about a Third World country.  Cork is Ireland&rsquo;s largest county and second largest city.  Its people are left with a second-class service despite having a brand new &euro;5 million service facility waiting to be used.  This is not good enough.  I look forward to the reply of the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this Adjournment matter which I will take on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Improving the delivery of accident and emergency services continues to be a top priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive.  At national level, significant additional resources have been provided to address the problems which manifest in emergency departments.  Among the developments which have taken place are additional public and private long-stay beds, additional home care packages and home help hours, major capital developments in emergency departments and the provision of acute medical assessment units and community intervention teams in Cork, Limerick and Dublin.</P>
        <P>As Senator Buttimer knows, Cork city has three accident and emergency departments located at Cork University Hospital, the Mercy University Hospital, and the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  These units are cross-covered by a team of consultants in emergency medicine.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;4.7 million for the provision of a new accident and emergency department at the Mercy University Hospital was included in the HSEs capital plan for 2006 to 2010.  Building work on the new accident and emergency department was completed on schedule in January 2007.  The work of equipping and commissioning the new facility was completed at the end of October 2007.</P>
        <P>The new department consists of a large patient waiting area with a separate paediatric waiting area, a triage area, a three-bay minor treatment area, a ten-bay major treatment area, a two-bay resuscitation room with adjacent x-ray suite and a treatment, therapies and procedures room.  The overall size of the new department is almost four times as large as the existing unit.</P>
        <P>A total of 46 staff are assigned to the existing accident and emergency department at an annual cost of approximately &euro;2.5 million.  The staff complement includes the equivalent of 18 full-time nurses, one full-time consultant in emergency medicine, two registrars and seven senior house officers.  The working of the existing department is underpinned by close working relationships with physiotherapists, a social worker, an occupational therapist, a radiographer, a pharmacist and psychiatry and other support services, including chaplains, security and housekeeping staff.</P>
        <P>The original approval for the project included an additional revenue allocation of &euro;400,000.  I understand that in January 2007, the Mercy University Hospital submitted an application to the national hospitals office of the HSE for an additional 24.5 full-time staff for the new unit <Col N="346"/>at a cost of almost &euro;1.5 million.  This would substantially increase the total running costs of the facility.</P>
        <P>The HSE has indicated that it has been engaged in negotiations with the management at the Mercy University Hospital on how best to organise services so as to run the new department effectively.  Last December, both sides agreed to an evaluation of the staffing requirement for the new facility in an effort to advance the issue.  This process is under way and discussions are ongoing.  A meeting between the HSE and hospital management took place on Monday, 21 April and a further series of meetings is scheduled for the coming weeks.  I am hopeful that this process will advance matters and enable the opening of this new facility to proceed.  I assure Senator Buttimer the contents of his contribution will be brought to the attention of senior management of the HSE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to press for the launching and funding of the report of the sub-committee on arts and education under the Arts Council which relates to the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Education and Science.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, with responsibility for children, Deputy Smith, who has an interest in the development of children and their rights to which, in a way, this is also related.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a Deputy I was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs when the new Arts Act, which has been in force for a couple of years, was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We spent many months receiving correspondence on elements of the Arts Bill.  There was nothing as controversial in the Bill as what was not in it.  One of the most important items which seemed to be absent was how to deal with matters closely connected to the arts which were seemingly abandoned at that point in time.</P>
        <P>An issue which received priority and precedence was traditional arts.  What constituted &ldquo;traditional arts&rdquo; caused its own controversy and we had some fun over a long period of time dealing with that aspect.  The conclusion was that a section was inserted in the Arts Act which enabled the Arts Council to form sub-committees on issues of importance.  It was deemed a sub-committee would come together for a brief specified period of time and present a report which would be acted upon to resolve the issue.</P>
        <P>The first sub-committee was on traditional arts and the procedure seemed to be exceptionally well organised for this sub-committee.  The report came back relatively quickly.  The response was funding of &euro;3 million that year and subsequent funding in other years.  It seems the traditional arts have been quite satisfied with the recognition they received.</P>
        <P>The second sub-committee established, again under pressure, was on the arts in education.  This sub-committee was to report back by May last year.  However, the report has not yet been published.  Why is this and when will it be published and funded?</P>
        <P>Why is arts in education important?  I am a music teacher by background so I am the wrong person to present the case because I am biased.  The arts play a major role in a child&rsquo;s development.  What is language?  Language is a rhythmic pattern.  What is music?  It is a rhythmic pattern.  What does a child need to start?  It is movement.  What is movement?  Physical movement involves co-ordination.  What better develops co-ordination than a baby hitting a drum with a stick or a child trying to play the recorder?  Anybody who tries to play the recorder moves certain fingers and leaves others down.  I challenge most non-musical adults to try; they <Col N="347"/>will have great difficulty.  Hand-eye co-ordination comes from the work which music can do.  It is fundamental, particularly for children aged up to six years of age, and we must invest in it.</P>
        <P>In recent months, we have seen more descriptions of the use of music in special schools, for example, bringing speech to and reducing repetitive behaviour in some autistic children.  It is both a stimulator and a soother in special schools.  The use of music therapy is also valuable in other areas, such as strokes.  I am diverging slightly, but we never challenge the idea that a physiotherapist will recover a person&rsquo;s ability to walk after a hip operation.  We challenge, however, the concept of a music therapist to try to bring back speech after a stroke, a coma or an acquired brain injury or recognition after a coma.  Music can keep our mental health stable most of the time.  If one faces medical problems, music can help.  It is not good enough that this report is on the shelf before it has been launched.  A great deal of work went into it on both the arts and education side.</P>
        <P>Music is a curriculum subject.  One can get a substantial mark for a practical performance in the leaving certificate and yet a music teacher in a secondary school does not have to teach the practical side of the subject.  Can one imagine studying leaving certificate art and never using a paint brush or studying science and never using a Bunsen burner?  However, one is expected to study music and become a performer without ever having been taught to become one.  That is a core issue in the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Music is a core part of people&rsquo;s lives from birth to death.  It has the ability to assist in core functions and in our quality of life from birth to death.  It is fundamental to one&rsquo;s development in one&rsquo;s early years and continues to be at many stages.  Although a core part of our lives, it is very much taken for granted, especially when one considers the amount of money spent on the arts compared to sport, for example.  I have been told I should be very excited because the Arts Council is getting more money than ever.  I am excited about it but it is not what it should be and that is why I am adamant that this report is launched.</P>
        <P>I would like us to get an anniversary present this May, if not before, and that the report is not only launched but funded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Keaveney for raising this important matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, who is unavoidably absent.</P>
        <P>Education in the arts is a lifelong learning experience involving a range of different people interacting with the arts in a variety of education settings.  Primary and post primary schools are key education sites in providing for children and young people&rsquo;s education in the arts.  Education functions to develop and nurture the young person&rsquo;s innate creativity and intelligence and facilitates their understanding of themselves and the complexities of the world in which they live.  Arts education is fundamental to achieving these two functions of education.</P>
        <P>I consider that the benefits of the arts for the individual are greatly increased if exposure to the arts takes place during a person&rsquo;s most formative years and for that reason it is a real priority that the position of the arts in our education system must be enhanced, as lucidly outlined by Senator Keaveney.  With the introduction of new and revised arts curricula and syllabi at primary and post primary schools, an increasing number of teachers and schools looked towards national and local arts resources to enhance the teaching and learning of the arts curricula.</P>
        <P>A degree of work and consideration of this emerging issue has taken place in recent years, for example, the production of the Artists in Schools Guidelines document in 2006, which was a joint project of the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council, and the <Col N="348"/>product of an extended period of research and consultation with policy makers, providers and practitioners in both the arts and education fields.</P>
        <P>Against this background, and in view of the growing interest and awareness of the arts in our community and the important role it plays, it was decided in October 2006 that a special committee be established to advise the Arts Council on how best to align the council&rsquo;s strategies for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.  The committee was established under section 21 of the Arts Act 2003, which makes provision for the establishment of special committees to advise the Council.  This mechanism had been used earlier to establish the committee on the traditional arts.</P>
        <P>The members of this special committee on arts and education, which was chaired by Mary Nunan of the Arts Council, were representative of the Arts Council, the National Centre for Training in Technology, the inspectorate from the Department of Education and Science and the National Association of School Principals and Deputy Principals.</P>
        <P>In its deliberations the committee was to have regard to the wide-ranging demands on the school curriculum bearing in mind that responsibility for determining the content of the school curriculum rests with the Minister for Education and Science; the need to prioritise and cost its recommendations &mdash; these recommendations were to have regard both to their resource implications for the Arts Council and the fact that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next four years to the Minister for Education  and Science for the development of services in the education sector must be allocated to fund existing policy commitment; subject to the foregoing, the identification of what additional sources of funding, if any, might be available to fund its recommendations; and the roles and partnerships that are appropriate for relevant State and other agencies and bodies in this context, including the Department of Education and Science, the Arts Council, vocational education committees and local authorities.</P>
        <P>The focus of the special committee&rsquo;s advice was to be on making specific deliverable recommendations for implementation over three to five years.  The committee carried out its role thoroughly and conscientiously inviting public involvement through a series of focus groups, written submissions, invited speakers and special advisers as well as drawing on its own areas of expertise and research.  In the course of its deliberations, it considered more than 90 public submissions and conducted three focus group meetings.</P>
        <P>As is known, the special committee finalised its work last year and presented its draft report to the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Education and Science for consideration.  This is the first such study of its nature for some considerable time and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism took the view that a reasoned and practical approach should be adopted to considering its recommendations, which reflect the result of the wide-ranging and indepth research conducted by the committee and for which I and the Minister wish to congratulate it.</P>
        <P>Having considered the draft report, therefore, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism organised a series of meetings between its officials and those of the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council to consider the recommendations of the report.  This interagency working group is currently in the process of identifying ways to give practical effect to the crucial recommendations of the draft report and is drawing up specific actions designed to respond effectively and efficiently to its conclusions.  Work is progressing well and we are confident that announcements on the next steps to be taken will be possible in the near future.</P>
        <P>I am mindful of the anticipation of those in the sector for the publication of this report.  The publication of the report of the arts and education committee is a matter for the Arts Council, as the committee&rsquo;s remit was to advise the council on how best to align the council&rsquo;s strategies <Col N="349"/>for the promotion and encouragement of the arts with the priorities of the formal education system.  We would be failing in our duty, however, if we did not have ready the necessary actions to facilitate, as far as possible and practicable in the current environment, the proposals recommended in this report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I point out that the preparation of a report such as this should be viewed as a positive step in the evolution of the arts in our society.  Giving the arts a higher, more consistent profile at both primary and post-primary levels can bring significant benefits to the students concerned and, ultimately, to society in general.  It is important to stress that this applies to all students and not only to those who are recognised as being particularly gifted artistically.  As is the case in sport, because the future of the arts in Ireland resides with our children, it is vital that the arts are embedded in our education system at all levels.</P>
        <P>I would also point out that it is due in no small measure to the massive investments made in recent years by this Government to the capital and everyday costs of the myriad of arts entities throughout the country that this debate is taking place.</P>
        <P>In the past five years, for instance, the Department for Arts, Sport and Tourism has allocated a total of &euro;90 million towards the cost of providing vital arts and cultural infrastructure and venues for communities to present the arts in all its forms.  Complementary to this the Arts Council has seen its resources increase exponentially from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to its present allocation of &euro;82 million in 2008, an increase of over 72%.  The Arts Council, in turn, has at all times pursued a policy of engaging with young people, whether through its specific programmes or by its support of existing organisations that specialise in arts in education interventions, such as The Ark and Team in Dublin, Graffiti Theatre in Cork and Cups and Crowns Educational Theatre in Galway.  These are signs of a maturity in our arts role and the integration of the arts into every aspect of our society.  The outcome of the special committee on arts and education will be a further piece in the jigsaw of this exciting and wide-ranging arts and education spectrum.</P>
        <P>Again, on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, I thank Senator Keaveney for giving us the opportunity to bring this positive story to the notice of the Seanad.  I assure her that I will bring the contents of her contribution to the attention of the Minister.  I take this opportunity to compliment the Senator on her work as a former chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs over a number of years.  With her special expertise and interest in the arts, she gave that committee great leadership.  Her interest, knowledge and expertise in this area is welcome in the Oireachtas but, unfortunately, we do not often get the opportunity to listen to her play great music on a variety of musical instruments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and kind remarks.  One would think I had seen his response earlier as I anticipated much of what was said.  </P>
        <P>If the arts is core to personal development then it must receive equal recognition in terms of funding from the Departments of Education and Science and Arts, Sports and Tourism.  It is not good enough to leave it to the Arts Council to develop its own strategy and to obtain a couple of euro to do so.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State who has responsibility for children will consider speaking with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Devins, to see if the four ministries and the Minister for Health and Children, whose role in this regard is central, can come together on this.  We are underestimating our potential in this area.  While funding is being increased it is not increasing as exponentially as this demands.  The crux of my point is that a euro spent now will save many euro during a child&rsquo;s lifetime.</P>

    <Title>Mine Disaster. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; l&uacute;ch&aacute;ir orm go bhfuil an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Smith, anseo tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to raise the issue of the Ballymanus mine disaster on behalf of the families who lost loved ones in the disaster on the evening of 10 May 1943 in Ballymanus, which is located along the Donegal coastline between Annagry and Kincasslagh.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1943, when the Second World War was raging throughout Europe, the small island of Ireland was light years away from the horrific brutality taking place on land and sea.  As a consequence of the war, a continuous flow of wreckage was being washed up on the shoreline of the Irish coast.  As many of the battles of the Second World War were fought at sea, an important feature of naval policy was the laying of sea mines.  The sea current often altered the direction of these floating mines away from intended targets and in to unintended areas.  One such mine was washed ashore in Ballymanus, County Donegal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the evening of 10 May 1943, word went around Ballymanus that a curious and strange looking object was floating in the water close to the coast.  Some 23 young people went to investigate the object which turned out to be a mine approximately 8 ft. high and with some of its spikes bent owing to being crushed against the waves and rocks.  Some of the people gathered on the shore tied a rope around the already bent spikes and an attempt was made to haul the object closer to the shore.  The mine subsequently exploded with a horrifying bang which could be heard up to 40 miles away.  It was only when the dust settled that the true extent of the incident became known to all.  It was a horrifying experience.  Many were killed instantly and others died later in hospital.  Four people survived the explosion.  However, 19 men ranging in age from 14 years to 34 years lost their lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening on behalf of members of the families, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, who lost loved ones in the tragedy and who to this day, some 65 years on, remain aggrieved that despite the attention of the local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being drawn to the presence of the mine close to the shore, no action was taken to isolate the area until the mine was rendered harmless.  There was available to the authorities a period of time, prior to the locals finding the mine, that could have been used in a more efficient manner.  Had this happened the lives of those who died could, in the opinion of the families, have been saved.  The results of the subsequent inquest into the tragic event chaired by Dr. McGinley from Letterkenny were never published or conveyed to the families.  The inquest was held in the community hall in Mulduff.  The representative for the area at the time, the late Tom Breslin, represented the then Taoiseach at the funerals.  According to newspaper articles made available to us, he acknowledged at that time that the relevant authorities did not take the required corrective action when the presence of the mine was first brought to their attention.</P>
        <P>A mass will be held on the 65th anniversary of this tragedy.  It takes place on Friday, 9 May.  The tragedy will also be marked by the publication of a book by a son of one of the men who died, Pat Gallagher.  Pat and his brother S&eacute;amus are in the Visitors Gallery.  The families are requesting that the State examine the failure of the relevant authorities to take the required steps to isolate the mine.</P>
        <P>I respectively urge the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the need to, if at all possible, provide an apology to these families ahead of the 65th anniversary on 9 May.  The Minister&rsquo;s assistance in respect of this sensitive issue would be well received by the local community and those families who lost their loved ones, young men in the prime of their lives, working and rearing families and helping their parents.  What happened can only be described as a tragedy.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I hope the State will acknowledge what happened on that evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who unfortunately, due to other business, cannot be here this evening.  The matter raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill concerns a tragic incident which occurred almost 65 years ago.  I will briefly give the details of the tragedy as they appear in the documentation file in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 10 May 1943, a report was made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at Annagry, County Donegal, at 6.45 p.m. that an object, believed to be a mine, was floating in the sea between Mullaghdearg Point and Broad Strand.  The Garda reported the matter to the lieutenant in the local marine service who went to Ballymanus Strand shortly afterwards.  The mine was more than a mile off shore at this time.</P>
        <P>The lieutenant warned a group of men present on the strand to stay away.  He waited there for more than two hours until the mine came ashore and again warned those present to stay away from it.  It appears from the report that some of the people he spoke to reacted negatively to his warnings.  The reports say it appears that when the lieutenant left the site at 9.50 p.m. to report the matter to his ordnance officer, some of the men present on the strand immediately proceeded to haul the mine ashore with ropes and some attempted to unscrew portions of it.  The explosion occurred at 10 p.m., killing 17 men at the scene and another man died in hospital the following day.  Five others were injured.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This was a terrible tragedy.  A sad fact to note is that three sons of one family were lost in the explosion and three other families lost two sons each.  The grief that overcame those families must have been unbearable.  Those who died ranged in age from 13 years to 34 years, eight of whom were under the age of 18 years.</P>
        <P>With the forthcoming 65th anniversary, I can understand the enduring sadness which must still stir in the families of those who were killed and injured.  As well as the suffering of the families involved this was a terrible event for the local community and the grief was shared by the country as a whole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the request of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, recently asked his officials to examine the file on this matter and the details which I have outlined were obtained from it.  The file had previously been available to the public in the National Archives.</P>
        <P>The file shows that an inquest was held the day after the event.  Consideration was given at the time to holding an inquiry into the matter.  It seems from the file that there was little local demand for such an inquiry at the time. In fact, it was noted that a number of local representatives were of the view that nothing would be gained from one.  A meeting of local clergy apparently also came to the same conclusion.  A report on file states that a meeting of the next-of-kin of the deceased was held on 24 May and that they decided unanimously that no demand be made for an inquiry.  The Departments of Defence and Justice also came to the conclusion that an inquiry would not serve any useful purpose.  The coroner was informed that no official inquiry was proposed and the inquest was reconvened on 28 May.</P>
        <P>The verdict of the inquest was that the deaths were caused by the explosion of the mine and the jury added riders to their verdict which stated that the disaster could have been avoided if the Garda sergeant at Annagry had cordoned off the area in the immediate vicinity of the mine until the arrival of the military.  There was disagreement in the jury as to whether the lieutenant <Col N="352"/>of the coast watching service was negligent and it was the jury&rsquo;s opinion that the military authorities should be asked to establish a coast watching post in the vicinity of Ballymanus.</P>
        <P>A report on file from the Garda superintendent in the area states that the sergeant involved had failed to go to the scene before the explosion and that no attempt was made by him to cordon off the area.  It appears this had become the occasion of bad feeling in the district.  What happened was an appalling tragedy.  However, it is questionable  at this distance from the tragic event  whether it is possible to pass judgment on the actions of the individuals or organisations involved.  Few of those involved directly are still alive to defend or explain themselves and those who are would have distant memories of what occurred.  It is difficult to see how any further investigation of the matter would add anything to what was found at the time.</P>
        <P>The file on this issue will shortly be available again in the National Archives and I hope its contents may help the families of those involved to understand what happened and to come to terms with their grievous loss.   This event will be of wider interest to social historians, who may ultimately form their own judgments on the terrible day 65 years ago.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to conclude by expressing my sorrow at what happened and extending my sympathies and those of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the families who continue to mourn their loved ones who were lost or badly injured in this tragic event.  I will bring the contents of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill&rsquo;s contribution to the personal attention of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, for his response which was quite comprehensive.  While we all acknowledge that an investigation may serve no purpose at this stage, 65 years on, I ask the Minister of State to convey the following to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to whom I wish to speak on the matter shortly.  </P>
        <P>We should examine the verdict of the inquest and decide whether an apology should be issued based on that.  &ldquo;An apology&rdquo; may be the wrong term to use, but perhaps &ldquo;ownership of responsibility&rdquo; might serve.  As stated in the Minister&rsquo;s response, the verdict of the inquest stated that the deaths were caused by the explosion of the mine.  The jury added riders to the verdict which stated &mdash; this is very important &mdash; that the disaster could have been avoided if the Garda sergeant at Annagry had cornered off the area in the immediate vicinity of the mine until the arrival of the military.  That did not happen and that is the crux of the issue for the families.  They want the onus of responsibility to be shared by the State.  I ask the Minister of State to convey that message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I fully appreciate that he cannot be here this evening.</P>
