      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted he will be here when we return.  Having said that, I believe the Government is leaving it dangerously late to set a date for the referendum treaty.  It has also been left dangerously late to inform the public of the benefits of the Lisbon treaty because many people are still very unsure what it is all about.  There is a risk that it will be defeated if people do not know what they are voting for and are clear about it.  That no date has been set means there is not a focus on it as there ought to be at this stage, given the short time left.  I welcome the fact that the President of the European Parliament will address the House and that we will spend the day discussing European issues.  I am sure it will contribute to a better understanding of what is at stake among the public. </P>
        <P>There are many urgent issues to be discussed on our return, one of which is the Lisbon treaty.  Another is the economy, which Senators Ross and Alex White spoke about yesterday.  There is a very serious deterioration in the public finances and a changed situation from the time of the budget.  We have high inflation, the downgrading of economic growth by a huge amount, the public finances are &euro;516 million off target, people are worrying about job security and unemployment queues are growing, which is a sad situation facing people.</P>
        <P>I am concerned there has been no statement from the Government on its plan to deal with this situation.  While Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers have been very quick to take credit for progress in the economy, yet when there are difficulties they all seem to be caused by international factors which, clearly, is not the case.  In the absence of a plan we see cuts in frontline services, day care centres being closed or not being staffed, patients waiting for services and the HSE has said it is not filling any of the posts which were vacant on 31 December.  This is having a huge impact on OT services, speech therapy centres and centres for the homeless.  All kinds of areas are being affected, without any debate or discussion.  Instead of burying its head in the sand, we need a discussion and a plan from the Government.  We need to know how the change in the public finances will be handled.  We need a discussion to ensure the frontline services will not be affected but rather the waste and the bureaucratic nightmare that we see in the HSE report will be tackled.  I seek a debate on the economy in the early days when we return.</P><Col N="2135"/>
        <P>We must ensure more topical discussions more immediately.  When an issue arises, I ask that the House has an opportunity to discuss it immediately rather than several weeks later.  There is no reason we cannot have a discussion when an issue arises, with the views of Members put on the record, even if the senior Minister is not available.  We must change that and that must be the decision today: that we come back and discuss issues when they arise so that what we discuss is topical and relevant.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; maidir le r&iacute;omhair&iacute; sna scoileanna, agus an gh&eacute;argh&aacute; at&aacute; le infheist&iacute;ocht i leith r&iacute;omhair&iacute;.

Caithfimid tosn&uacute; leis na scoileanna agus an b&eacute;im a chur ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; teicneola&iacute;ochta sna scoileanna.  Is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil aon plan cheart againn don todhcha&iacute;.</P>
        <P>It is very worrying that a private, confidential report commissioned by the Minister for Education and Science states that the Government&rsquo;s &euro;252 million plan for computers in schools is insufficient but it is something we all know.  According to the joint managerial body, there is on average one computer for ten children in our schools.  To reach the OECD average we need to have one for every five.  That would require trebling the current spend of &euro;46 per student per year.  It is important we start in our schools and provide the necessary equipment and technological know-how if we are serious about competitiveness.  It is not enough to trust that many students will have computers at home and that somehow they will have the technological know-how.  It will be a shambles if our education system falls behind.  According to that report we fall well behind the EU average on information and communications technology in schools.  Elsewhere it states that we have one of the lowest rates of information and communications technology usage in education in the developed <Col N="2136"/>world.  This is in a country that prides itself on its education system and planning for the future.</P>
        <P>There has been great success, with institutes of technology a major factor in our competitiveness and our ability to attract investment by providing highly skilled people in the workplace.  We must redouble our efforts for the future and it seems that proper computer facilities in our schools would be a basic part of such a plan.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il in Government has a great record in asserting republican values at certain times internationally.  One thinks of Frank Aiken and the courageous stand he took when it came to admitting China to the United Nations.  It is regrettable that we seem to be losing some of those values.  I wonder whether we can have a truly independent political stance in a globalised world.  I accept there are economic pressures and that we must keep good relations with countries such as China as much as possible.  None the less, it is tragic that it was left to our Minister for Foreign Affairs to instruct officials at home to make the point about Tibet, while a Minister of State was taking part in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations in Beijing.  We are losing our moral voice internationally if we cannot assert our core principles in support of the dignity of the person.</P>
        <P>I worry about whether we are trading republican values for purely commercial and economic values.  How can we have confidence when we are reassured that the Government is ensuring at European level that our values will not be interfered with if the same Ministers of State do not take a stand in China on issues that are obvious to all reasonable people?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald regarding the House discussing topical matters, on which there is a consensus.  When the Seanad returns, working collectively to ensure topical discussions would be a plus for the Chamber.</P>
        <P>As I did not have a chance yesterday to speak on an important issue, I will discuss it today, namely, the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US.  I accept that all Senators have concerns in this regard and that they want a successful outcome, but the record must be put straight.  The Taoiseach and the Government are all over the place on this issue.  It does not bother me whether Senators agree, but it is the reality and is the opinion of most people in the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform in the United States.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday evening, I spent nearly two hours speaking with members of the ILIR and others.  I spent some time in Boston with a number of my friends who are in the US illegally.  Their plight is scary.  They are disgusted and bewildered by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s latest comments and do not understand why he would make them.</P>
        <P>Since the failure of the US Congress to pass immigration reform legislation last June, the ILIR and others have been working closely with the Irish and US Governments to introduce a bilateral agreement.  This is achievable because the Irish have a strong lobby in the US.  If agreements can be made with Chile, Singapore and Australia, surely an agreement can be reached with Ireland.  The idea is to have a permanent swap of work visas.  I will not go into the detail too much because a certain amount must remain confidential.</P>
        <P>When the ILIR met with Ed Gillespie, President Bush&rsquo;s closest adviser and the son of a Donegal man, he admitted that the American Government had never heard of Bruce Morrison&rsquo;s proposal.  That the Irish Government, despite claiming to be pushing the proposal, has never lobbied in respect of it is unbelievable.  Why would it not pursue the proposal?  This is a cause of concern for everyone.  Subsequently, the Taoiseach made his insulting comments on the most pivotal day for the Irish diaspora.  He should apologise, as they were unacceptable.  When the Taoiseach stated that people do not really know what they are talking about, did he mean Niall O&rsquo;Dowd and Bruce Morrison?  The comments regarding people sitting on bar stools beggar belief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not debate this matter now.  If the Leader agrees to a request from the Senator, there will be a debate in which the Senator can outline the details.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have just had a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Every Senator has sympathy for the people in question, but the Senator should make his request and stick to the Order of Business because our time is limited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his comments.  We should have a proper and timely debate on this issue.  A good move would be for us to meet members of the ILIR when they visit the Seanad to get their opinions.  The Taoiseach should apologise for his comments and reiterate his and the Government&rsquo;s support for a bilateral approach to the issue.  In one month&rsquo;s time during his address to the joint Houses of Congress, he will have a chance to leave a legacy of support for the people in question and the work to date.</P><Col N="2138"/>
        <P>A number of times, Senator Ross raised the issue of the country&rsquo;s finances.  I agree with his comments yesterday because a debate in the House is necessary.  The Minister for Finance has not attended the House yet and was not present for our discussion of the Finance Bill last week.  All the measurements and key indicators pertaining to the economy are going in opposite directions, which is scary.  While obviously there is an international dimension, the handling of the economy also is at issue and the competence of the Minister must be examined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader did not have an opportunity to respond to two issues I raised yesterday and I wish to reaffirm them today.  The first was raised by Senator Mullen this morning, namely, the question of Tibet, and the House has an opportunity to speak with one voice on this issue.  While No. 17, motion 8 on the Order Paper in the name of the Independent Senators does not refer directly to current events, it might provide the bones of an all-party motion, having been checked by the Department of Foreign Affairs, and could come back before the House at an early date.  It is important that the House should speak on an issue of concern as the 50th anniversary of the annexation of Tibet will take place in 2009.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the need to have consistency in foreign policy.  Ireland recently recognised Kosovo, which is a country that has nothing like the territorial and national integrity of a place like Tibet.  We must be truly consistent in our foreign policy actions.</P>
        <P>The second issue pertained to the community development support programme on which the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is making a decision that will come into effect at the end of May.  The House should be given the opportunity to discuss the impact of that decision in respect of the community development support programme.</P>
        <P>As for the ongoing programme of the House, it is clear that two major themes will dominate proceedings on Members&rsquo; return from the recess.  The first is that of the Lisbon treaty while the second is that of the economy.  In respect of the Lisbon treaty, I also welcome the impending visit of the President of the European Parliament and the promise of contributions from Members of the European Parliament who represent Ireland.  This will be a useful exercise in its own right.  It is especially important that those members of the European Parliament from Ireland who have an alternative view should participate in such a debate in the House.  Members must have an open and rounded discussion regarding the benefits or otherwise of the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>On the question of the economy, Members would benefit from having a number of debates.  In particular, I would like to hear the views of Opposition Members as to what they would do <Col N="2139"/>differently.  Would they raise taxes or how would they order public spending in different ways?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>No one wishes to see a return to the time when our debt-gross domestic product ratio was 140% of what was being collected in taxes in any given year.  Many factors can be considered in respect of the economy&rsquo;s future that will put us in a better position in an uncertain world and global economic climate.  I would like the opportunity to discuss such matters in the House when Members return after Easter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald made some interesting points on how Members should proceed on their return after Easter, with which I concur completely and I am sure the Leader will take them up.  All Members wish to keep the House topical and entirely relevant.</P>
        <P>As Senator Boyle noted, yesterday the Leader inadvertently overlooked or did not have the opportunity to respond to some points he made.  The same is equally true of some points I made regarding No.3 on the Order Paper, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  My understanding is that this Bill will provide for a legal services ombudsman.  However, in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Brennan, who was deputising for the Taoiseach, mentioned the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  While I do not believe he was talking about the same Bill, the Leader should clarify this matter because the Minister spoke of the necessity for some restructuring.  When is it intended to introduce the Bill?  Is it true that it is being restructured and, if so, what is the reason?</P><Col N="2140"/>
        <P>The second point pertained to the matter of the national property services regulatory authority Bill, which also is promised.  As Members are aware, that authority is in being run on an interim basis without statutory effect at present.  This is a matter on which Senator Ross initiated debate in this House in 2005 and it had the support of the House.  It is largely as a result of that debate that the Government took action.  We now have this authority and a Bill is promised to give it statutory effect.  I understand that approximately half of auctioneers have already signed up to the code of conduct.  Given the importance of proper standards for public confidence, I ask the Leader to indicate when the Bill will be forthcoming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s comments on the Lisbon treaty, the Government should have an open mind on a date for the referendum, although it should announce one as soon as possible.  I personally favour a date in September.  Last night I attended a function in County Meath at which a number of people asked me to explain the treaty.  We all have had opportunities to read the treaty, yet nobody in this House could provide a detailed analysis of its implications for the development of Europe.  Irish voters will have a wonderful but enormous responsibility because we will sign the contract for the treaty on behalf of 500 million Europeans.  We are all equal in that regard because every voter has the same influence as the Taoiseach or the President.  A major educational campaign must be undertaken throughout the country to explain the treaty in detail and time for this is of the essence.  By holding the referendum later, the parliaments of the other 26 EU member states will be more likely to have signed up to the treaty.  We would therefore be at the centre of Europe as far as this decision is concerned.</P>
        <P>I commend the Leader on inviting the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hans Gert P&ouml;ttering, MEP, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, although I understood the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barrosso, was to address us instead.  I would have preferred the latter because I had a number of questions to ask in regard to the activities of the Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Mandelson.  The motion inviting Mr. P&ouml;ttering, which we cannot discuss, refers to him as &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; although he is President of the European Parliament.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are to decide on the motion as set out on the Order Paper.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2141"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider inviting Mr. Barrosso to address the Seanad before the treaty referendum takes place.</P>
        <P>I support the request made yesterday by Senator Mary White regarding the Chris Flood report on the 1,000 Irish people in prisons throughout the world.  She asked that a dedicated unit be established in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I reiterate the call made by the Most Reverend Seamus Hegarty, Bishop of Derry, in that regard.  Rather than condoning the crimes these people have committed, we want to support their families.  With the support of this House, I travelled to Greece in 2003 to visit one of our people who was imprisoned there and assisted in having him released.  He was found innocent of the charges made against him.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter to make people aware they should avail of the services of Members when contacting their loved ones abroad.  In some cases, prisoners could be brought back to serve their sentences in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the economy.  I would like the debate to focus in particular on the impact of the international banking sector on Ireland.  In recent weeks, a major European bank, Comerzbank, announced a &euro;450 million exposure to the sub-prime market.  This week Morgan Stanley suffered a 42% drop in its earnings for the first quarter and this Monday the share price of Lehman Brothers dropped by 35% on its closing share price on Friday.  What all these organisations have in common is that they are clearly in difficulty.  However, they have another factor in common.  Two are based in the IFSC and are major suppliers of local employment, while the third, Lehman Brothers, is a major stakeholder in the IFSC given the amount of business it directs towards it.</P>
        <P>We are in a place where the new economy upon which this country has built its recent success is in clear peril.  We need clear and substantial direction from the Government with regard to recognition of this situation and what it is going to do about it.  When the Seanad returns after the break, it is incumbent on us to recognise this issue and to hear from the Government what it wants to do about it.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle is correct.  If are to comment on this situation, we should say what we will do about it.  We will do so.  We will discuss what we want to do with regard to the national development plan, the opportunities presented to Ireland because of changes in the UK taxation system and the opportunities for us to grow our country&rsquo;s share of business aggressively in the Asian and Chinese economies.  We have an opportunity to do all this, but the Government has an obligation to govern.  It has an obligation to recognise the seriousness of this situation and to come to the <Col N="2142"/>House to talk about it and tell us what it is going to do.  That is crucial for consumers and the ordinary man and women in the street who find themselves in a situation where forces beyond their control are beginning to influence how their banks treat them.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point and plead with the Leader to give us clarity in regard to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I raised this matter in the House previously.  A number of the sections in that Bill have a huge impact on the ability of small businesses to lease commercial property from landlords.  Due to the non-implementation of the Bill, the ability of those small businesses to survive is being threatened.  We are spending time in the House talking about forces that are beyond are control.  Some are within our control.  Businesses are being threatened because we are not implementing this legislation.  I ask the Leader to tell us what is happening with this Bill.  He should use his influence to make sure that small businesses and their viability are not threatened because this legislation has not come before the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom aont&uacute; go hioml&aacute;n leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an tSeanad&oacute;r Leyden inn&eacute;.  Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to raise the matter yesterday as my time was running short but I would like to support and compliment Senator Leyden on the stand he took in regard to the Council of Europe and the abortion issue.  When we have the President of the European Parliament here, will the Leader arrange that appropriate questions be put to him on the need for the subsidiarity principle to apply in regard to social legislation?  We have seen the European Commission write to Germany about its civil partnership laws and the European Court of Human Rights overruling the courts in France with regard to gay adoption.  Those are issues which should be left to the countries themselves to make their decision on.  While there are different views in this country and in these Chambers, it is up to us to decide those issues in our own time and in our own way.  I am a strong proponent of this position.  If Europe begins to interfere in this area, as a lifetime proponent of the concept of European union, I would begin to have reservations.</P>
        <P>I support the call by the deputy leader of Fine Gael in the House, Senator Coghlan, for a debate with regard to the forthcoming legislation on establishing a legal ombudsman and an overarching system for the legal profession.  A report in the past week showed that with regard to the non-deafness cases in the Department of Defence, of all the millions paid out in compensation, 40% of the total cost went to the legal profession.  That is greed on a grand scale and nothing has been done about it.  It is time an independent body, not a self-regulating body which would be absolutely ineffective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Fitzgerald aptly and correctly put the Lisbon treaty on the agenda today and sought a response from the Leader.  I consider it of significant national importance that we pass the Lisbon treaty.  It goes without contradiction that our membership of the European Union has had enormous social and economic implications for this country.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise with the Leader one issue that is a backdrop to the Lisbon treaty, that overshadows it and puts it at risk but, more importantly, puts the country&rsquo;s entire interests at risk.  I refer to the Mandelson negotiations on a world trade agreement that are in progress.  They are of critical importance for this country&rsquo;s agriculture industry and related employment sectors. <Col N="2144"/> In excess of &euro;1 billion has been spent in this country, and rightly so, on farm waste management grant schemes.  It is good to see it but that expenditure will be the greatest waste of public money in the history of the State &mdash; a white elephant &mdash; if the Mandelson proposals are accepted.  The implications of the Mandelson proposals would result in the complete closure of Irish agriculture and would render wasteful the expenditure on these grants.  That is critical.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to convey to the Government the need for a major national diplomatic offensive on a scale never seen previously against the Mandelson talks to protect Irish agriculture.  I acknowledge and welcome the participation of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the European Council talks last week and her stance there but we need involvement at all levels of Government, including the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, in a diplomatic offensive on the EU stage from capital to capital and from Commission to Council to get a change in our position on the talks.</P>
        <P>We need to do this for two reasons.  One is to show to the public that we are standing up to this development because if the public do not perceive that, the Lisbon treaty will not pass.  We also need to do it in the hope that we will have a level of success because Irish interests are at risk.  It is a little like Nero fiddling while Rome burns.  We could be fiddling around with other issues and miss the main point, namely, that this is the greatest threat to our country we have faced for many a day and we need to do something about it urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what Senator Leyden said and what Senator Mary White said yesterday.  At one time I did a great deal of work on the issue of prisoners in Britain.  Under the European Convention on Human Rights, they are entitled to serve their sentences at the point closest to their homes.  We need an expansion of that concept here.  Whatever about the person who committed the crime, the families did not commit the crime and that is the thrust behind the convention.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald about the need for a date for the Lisbon treaty.  Nothing will focus the mind quicker than a date.  When one has a long time to think about something, one does not think about it until the date is pressing.  I am not sure if the date is as important as getting a date.  People will be bombarded by information at that stage.</P>
        <P>There are two issues on which we must focus after the break.  The issue of alcohol and drug abuse is an important topic with which we dealt in the first half of this year.  That should not go off the agenda, because it is central to our social difficulties.  I commend the GAA for reclaiming its sporting events back from the drinks industry, <Col N="2145"/>as was announced last night.  We could have a debate with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism.  It could be based on the committee report carried out a few years ago which highlighted the links between alcohol sponsorship and sports.  We should keep addressing this topic so that in the future we can point to what we did.</P>
        <P>The other issue is related to the economy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, should come before the House after the break to debate this issue.  Senator Mullen spoke about schools and the need for computers.  It is not that long ago when schools did not have any computers, while they have a basic facility now.  There has been a lot of investment in primary and secondary schools, and particularly in research and development at the institutes of technology.  We should be looking at the link between the investment in education and the needs of our economy.  The Minister of State works in both the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science.  He has a policy statement due, if it has not already been published.</P>
        <P>There are other issues that arise but it would be a great start to debate the state of the economy and the social issue of drug and alcohol abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with interest that I listened to the calls for a debate on the economy.  There is much focus on what is happening in the markets, but it is important that the House is satisfied that the Government is monitoring the situation closely.  While we can exert no influence over external developments in the markets, we should be satisfied that we can ensure that our economy absorbs shocks which emerge from the international marketplace.  We must also ensure that our financial institutions continue to fuel the necessary investments required to keep our economy ticking over.  This is an issue I raised with the Leader on the Order of Business some time ago.</P>
        <P>The current global financial crisis is the most severe since the end of the Second World War.  There are few safe havens in times of such financial crisis and market uncertainty.  It is very important that we as legislators show confidence in our economy and that we are satisfied that we have proven economic policies that are well thought out.  We must be satisfied that the basis of our economy remains strong and that tax revenue and public finances are solid.  Our medium term growth prospects remain very favourable and we have achieved one of the lowest levels of debt in the EU.  While one may criticise where we are today, sometimes because it affects one&rsquo;s constituency, we should still look at the bigger picture.</P>
        <P>I noted with interest the concern expressed over the human rights violation in Tibet.  I note also Senator Mullen&rsquo;s comments on the changing global environment.  I hope he and other Senators are in favour of taking all available opportunities <Col N="2146"/>to engage in constructive dialogue, exchange views and highlight areas in which progress can be made on human rights.  I wholeheartedly support any Minister raising with the Chinese authorities concerns about Tibet.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to indicate at an early stage what amendments will be made to the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill on Committee Stage?  While it welcomed the legislation, the Irish Human Rights Commission also raised concerns regarding many of its provisions, as have many other eminent authorities.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers did not refer to the fact that today marks the fifth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq.  I do not propose to discuss the issue in detail other than to state, and I believe the House will support me in this regard, that the war has been a disaster.  Iraq is in a sad position especially in terms of the entrenched conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims.  It is likely the war will continue to produce large numbers of body bags at immense cost.  Five years down the road, I am very concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the economy to allow the House to recognise the strength of the economy.  As Senator Callely stated, it is important to acknowledge the external influences over which we have no control.  Despite these, the economy is in a strong position to respond to inevitable problems.  This is an opportune time to have a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, on the Order of Business, I raised a local issue, specifically how the actions of a local authority are affecting business.  This appears to have given rise to a criticism that I was too parochial.  When local authorities behave in a manner that affects business, it is the job of Senators to raise the matter in the House.</P>
        <P>This is an opportune time to carry out a review of the Health Service Executive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators from all sides, including Senators Callely and MacSharry, have raised this issue.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate to examine the option of breaking up the HSE.  Some of the measures it has taken have had a disastrous impact.  The organisation is undemocratic, unaccountable and has no mandate.  The Eastern Regional Health Authority managed health services in Dublin and part of Leinster.  A similar model should be put before any review of health services organisation.  If we are to review the largest spend of public moneys, at approximately &euro;15 billion, it is important to lay our cards on the table and examine where money can be saved.  There is an opportunity in this regard.</P>

	<P>I strongly agree with a point made on the Opposition side and strongly disagree with a point made on the Government side.  In both cases they should be non-partisan issues.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s contribution on the economy.  It was in the great tradition of Alan Dukes&rsquo;s Tallaght strategy.  There is an economic recession in the US and we have little control over economic structural matters.  This economic crisis should not be a partisan affair.  As this is a small country, we need all the intelligence and talent on all sides of the House to rally the troops.</P>
        <P>I use the word &ldquo;troops&rdquo; deliberately because it is like a war.  When one is winning in battle, it is easy to lead a charge or rout from the front.  It is difficult, however, to rally troops when matters are poor.  Senator Donohoe&rsquo;s contribution was made in a non-partisan spirit.  In the same spirit, I want more activity by Ministers.  It is not just the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance who should be out front.  I want to see all officers on the battlefield rallying the troops out front in tackling the economy.  Nothing else bothers the people but the economy &mdash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the economy stupid.&rdquo;  Everyone knows there is a recession and is nervous.  We do not need Ministers to go missing at a time like this during battle.  We need to see the officers on the battlefield.</P>

	<P>I strongly disagree with Senator Callely&rsquo;s contribution on Iraq.  Iraq was under the control of a very evil dictator which it is no longer.  The latest opinion poll taken there showed the people of Iraq are very hopeful about the future.  We should not talk down Iraq either.</P>
        <P>I will not say the Iraq war was worth it but it was not an ignoble war.  It was a war to depose a dictator and the people of Iraq seem more confident that it was worthwhile.  The other night I watched Jon Snow and all the other trendies on Channel 4 news discussing this poll.  Every bit of good news to come out of Iraq seemed to put another line on his face.  If, like Jon Snow, one spends all one&rsquo;s time predicting economic collapse, one cannot take it when the indices are positive.  The people of Iraq are increasingly in control of their destinies, and a good thing too.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business for a debate on the pro-life issue and the important point made concerning a recent report from the Royal College of Psychiatrists.  The psychological effect is the very argument used by those who support abortion.  The report, however, has clearly shown <Col N="2148"/>that abortion is a strong probability as a cause of suicides and depression among women.  The psychological effect argument has been trotted out for many years.  Surely at last it can be put away.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I also support calls for a debate on the economy.  Part of the problem and reason for current economic difficulties is due to greed running riot.  Where the pennies were watched with a microscope, billions were allowed to be traded, used and abused on financial markets without checks.  There is not just one example of this; there is a litany.  Nick Leeson brought down Barings Bank.  John Rusnak caused problems for Allfirst in Maryland.  Recently in France, &euro;55 billion of a bank&rsquo;s money was traded out on a position.  Nobody else in the bank indicated he or she knew what was going on.  It is incredible.</P>
        <P>What is equally as bad is that on Wall Street traders were being paid a percentage of the total amount packaged in loans and those repackaged loans were called &ldquo;securitised&rdquo;.  If somebody is getting commission on a securitised loan to the effect of millions and hundreds of millions, as some traders were getting, that person would not care if there were vital life signs in the mortgages as he or she would still get the commission.</P>
        <P>It is surely time to guarantee this does not happen here and the regulator should be asked to account, in every fashion, for all major trades and positions taken by banks so people are not affected.  White collar crime is not victimless and thousands will lose their jobs because of greed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, Boyle, Kelly, Walsh, O&rsquo;Reilly, Keaveney, Callely, Butler, Harris and Hanafin all called for an urgent debate on the state of the economy after the Easter recess.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed and there is no difficulty in having the debate.  Senator Keaveney also asked that the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, Deputy Michael Ahern, be invited to the House.  It is an opportune time to do this and I will endeavour to have the Minister of State present for part of this debate also.</P>
        <P>The Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, was very wise to ensure the anticipated downturn in the economy, or the realignment which was very badly wanted after 12 or 14 years of growth, is taking place.  It is possible we have gone past the halfway stage and we are well on the way to the second half of this downturn and realignment.  I congratulate the Government on increasing its spend on national development plan projects, particularly in essentials such as the roads, hospitals, schools, water and sewerage systems by 12.5%.  It is keeping a major part of the construction industry going.</P>
        <P>The construction industry is being affected by the downturn currently but there is demand for agricultural facilities, such as slatted sheds, etc.  There are quarries where cement is being manufactured that are in huge demand, and these will be very fortunate to get most of the orders looked <Col N="2149"/>at and attended to in the coming 12 months.  That is on the positive side.</P>
        <P>Unprecedented events are happening in the United States of America and even in the UK this morning, the rumour machine is ripe.  It is a dangerous time.  Senators should realise that banks only survive if they loan money; essentially they survive on credit.  The Governor of the Bank of England was correct this morning, as I heard on a dispatch on the radio that he would be at pains to point this out.</P>
        <P>There is no point in the institutions not opening their books for the next year or two years and hoping the entire world will stop for them.  We owe them nothing and they owe us quite a lot.  The shareholders of these banks and everybody associated with them make money on the endeavour of the entrepreneur and the hard-working decent men and women of every country that is making the economy function.</P>
        <P>Ours is one of the top countries in the world and we are very proud of it, especially on an Easter weekend.  Look at what we have achieved since 1916.  We will commemorate the 92nd anniversary on O&rsquo;Connell Street at 12 p.m. next Sunday with the President, Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers.  I would like to see a big turnout by Senators to participate and acknowledge the forefathers who gave us this great nation and brought us where we are today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the discussion of the Lisbon treaty, the format I have already discussed with the various leaders of the groups in the House is that the visiting dignitary will address the House first.  The leaders of the various groups will make a contribution for ten minutes and we have agreement on this side of the House that spokespersons will then ask a question of the visiting guest at the end, and the guest will conclude with a five-minute contribution on the questions asked.  These arrangements were agreed among the leaders but I must obtain agreement in respect of them from the Cathaoirleach and the Clerk of the Seanad.  It is hoped the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, will come before the House in the afternoon of the same day for a three-hour debate.  With the agreement of the House &mdash; this matter must still be discussed with the Cathaoirleach &mdash; it is hoped that a day will be set aside every second week to debate European matters.</P>
        <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Reilly pointed out, members of the farming community are extremely concerned with regard to the Mandelson proposals.  Some of those present are aware &mdash; I refer, in particular, to Senator Bradford in this regard &mdash; that we have been engaged in a struggle in respect of these proposals since the WTO negotiations three years ago.  Senator Leyden made a number of valid points in respect of this matter.  I intend, in conjunction with the leaders of the other groups <Col N="2150"/>and with the agreement of the Cathaoirleach, to put forward proposals to CPP to see how we might keep Seanad &Eacute;ireann centre stage in the context of informing people about what they are voting for and the pluses and minuses involved.  We should, with the agreement of the Cathaoirleach, as Chairman of CPP, invite Members of the European Parliament who have views for and against the treaty to come before the House to debate this matter and answer questions.</P>
        <P>Many Senators have indicated their grave concerns with regard to the HSE.  Deputy Moloney, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, has the ideal opportunity to follow the example of the former Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Small Business.  The Deputy&rsquo;s committee should take on the challenge, carry out an in-depth analysis over the next four years and &mdash; in view of the fact that &euro;15 billion has been provided &mdash; assist in the creation of a state-of-the-art, patient-led health service.  Everyone would love so see the emergence of such a service.</P>
        <P>I call on Deputy Moloney to consider my proposal that legislators in the D&aacute;il and Seanad provide him with assistance in respect of this matter.  For example, we could invite those on all sides to come before the joint committee to discuss and tease out matters.  People could, before the joint committee and live on television, make their allegations or statements and representatives on the others side could answer questions, etc.  That is how the former Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment made progress with its inquiry into the insurance industry, which led to a reduction of between 30% to 40% in the cost of premiums and made our roads safer.  It was a win-win situation.  Something similar could be achieved by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I will make time available in the House to debate, and, where possible, assist in, improvements to the service provided to patients.  As already stated, everyone wants to see the emergence of a patient-led health service.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and Coghlan referred to the need to discuss certain urgent matters.  Since the Seanad commenced its business last September, a practice has been established whereby Members can engage in question-and-answer sessions with Ministers and Ministers of State.  This is a wonderful step forward and I thank all Senators, the leaders, the Whips and everyone else involved for the understanding they have shown in the context of trying to establish such a practice.  We could never put such a system in place heretofore but, under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach, we have now done so.</P>
        <P>We are taking a step-by-step approach to this matter.  As Leader, I have an open mind with regard to how the business of the House will be conducted in the future.  Any measure that will place Seanad &Eacute;ireann centre stage will have my full support.  I have views on this issue and I have discussed with one or two colleagues how certain <Col N="2151"/>matters, some of which were brought to my attention by Senators this morning, might be addressed.  I am looking forward to the deliberations of the administrative committee and the commission on the possibility of live broadcasting of the affairs of this House.  I would like to see the Order of Business broadcast in a regulated way, with each Member having one minute to make his or her point to the Cathaoirleach.  There is too much repetitiveness.</P>

As one of the two Houses of Parliament, that is the direction in which we should go.  I have always been proud of the proceedings of this House, but unfortunately the public is not given an opportunity to see them at first hand and appreciate what is taking place.  Members of the commission who are represented in this House, including the Cathaoirleach, should do everything in their power to ensure that two dedicated channels are allocated to this.  At one stage, when I was a member of the Joint Committee on Broadcasting and Parliamentary Information, the European Commission was considering the allocation of channels 61 and 62 to our affairs.  I am prepared to propose to the House, under your stewardship, a Chathaoirligh, a change in the time of the Order of Business to allow the proceedings to be broadcast live to the people of Ireland.</P>

	<P>Senator Mullen made his views known on education.  I will pass his views on to the Minister.  I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Education and Science of &euro;58 million in funding for the refurbishment of research facilities at various universities and institutes of technology.  This is money well spent.  The secret of our success and the Celtic tiger is that the ITs have played a major role.  I also welcome the donation of &euro;24 million by Mr. J. P. McManus to allow two students from each county who qualify for medical cards to access third level education.  I can identify with these students and I congratulate him on his generous donation.  I also thank the Minister for enhancing the fund and proceeding with the proposal.  If we take these two Holy Thursday allocations together, they give a total of &euro;72 million being spent on education.  There has been a big change since this day 20 years ago, when we were in a difficult situation with regard to the then Department of Health.  Most of us came home from a health board meeting in Tullamore after protective notice was given to two thirds of the <Col N="2152"/>workforce of the Department.  We have come a long way, although a realignment is occurring.</P>
        <P>Senators Mullen, Boyle and Callely expressed their strong views on the situation in Tibet, which I will pass on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Senator Kelly expressed his strong views on the undocumented Irish in America.  As I said yesterday, when I covered this issue comprehensively, we all want to see the same result.

        <P>On Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s query yesterday in respect of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, it is intended the House will deal with this Bill following the Easter recess.

I will communicate later today with Senator Callely in respect of his query on the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler outlined to the House his serious concerns in respect of support by local authorities for business and, in particular, small businesses.  I have a gut feeling he may have something in mind for his particular area.  We all support Senator Butler&rsquo;s call that appropriate infrastructure be put in place in every county to ensure all counties can attract major investment and employment to their areas.  I have no difficulty in allowing time for a debate on the issue.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and Harris expressed their views on the fifth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq.  I will pass on their views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and Walsh once again made known their views in respect of the abortion <Col N="2154"/>issue.  This issue was also mentioned in the House yesterday by Senator Leyden.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify matters relating to new cars registered between January 2008 and July 2008.  They will be taxed through the existing motor tax system.  Can the Minister clarify whether there will be retrospective payment on taxes already paid?  People can re-register under the new system if they pay tax on 1 January for a year.  Will they receive retrospective payments for overpaid taxes in the older system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will put this on the record because this was discussed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  The Bill is drafted on the basis that rates under the CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>-based system will apply to tax discs taken out for licence periods commencing on or after the intro<Col N="2156"/>duction of the new CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>-based system on 1 July 2008.  This applies to all new cars, whether they are registered after July 2008 or between January and June 2008 and subsequently switched to the new system on renewal of tax.  This approach is in keeping with the long-standing practice of changes to motor tax rates.</P>
        <P>The system we have always applied does not give refunds as they would be very difficult to administer.  We are doing this in keeping with long-standing practice and it makes sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister has said.  There is no going back on it but it does not make sense.  Where a person buys a car in January 2008, and another person buys a similar car with the same CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions  in July or August 2008, he is penalised to some degree because the new system is not retrospective to January 2008.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I can give the Senator an example.  A motor tax exemption clause was extended in April 2001 to include mountain and cave rescue vehicles.  The tax exemption did not come into effect until the motor tax for any such vehicle was due for renewal.  A precedent has been set.  I am operating on precedent.  What the Senator has suggested would be unprecedented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>It would make more sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a few points on the issue of payments.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a very good motor tax on-line system is in operation, the take-up of which is increasing.  It is a welcome development.  Traditionally, people had to take almost a half day off work to have their cars taxed.  This facility is working well throughout the country.  What are the implications for the new dual system on the on-line system?  Has the Minister taken that into account to reflect the additional IT resources or changes that may be needed to allow the system to continue to operate successfully, without any confusion with the new system?  </P>
        <P>With regard to the phased payment of motor tax, it is welcome that people can pay in three or six monthly instalments.  Many people believe that the differential in the three or six monthly payment of motor tax for a full tax year versus the payment for a full year is more expensive.  This is unfair to the less well off who probably cannot afford the full year payment.  This matter should be looked at.  What would it cost the Exchequer to ensure equality for the full year term versus the quarterly and half-year term?  For the small amounts involved I do not see why <Col N="2157"/>there should be a differential.  Nowadays people are budgeting and cutting their cloth to suit.  Where people renew their motor tax on a three monthly or six monthly basis they should not have to pay more than those who pay for the full year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>At local motor tax offices there will be a change in the arrangements for the processing of motor tax applications.  The national vehicle and driver file, referred to as the NVDF, which is managed centrally by the vehicle registration unit in Shannon, will be adjusted to provide for the application of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>-based rates.  The changes associated with the introduction of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>-based motor tax charges are quite complex since they involve the creation of an entirely new basis upon which tax may be charged.  The estimated cost of the NVDF enhancements is around &euro;250,000.  Currently, on first taxing or upon renewable tax, the vehicle owner may attend the local motor tax office or correspond by post or make the application on-line, as the Senator rightly said.  We have made those changes and we signalled early on that this was our intention.  The adjustments have been made.</P>
        <P>The Senator&rsquo;s second question related to cost.  The actual cost of a motor tax disc for six months is about 55.5% of the annual rate and for a three-month disc it is 28.25% of the annual rate.  This works out at a surcharge of 10% to 11% for a six month disc and 11% to 12.5% for a three-month disc.  For a 1.4 litre car, over 50% of the car fleet is below 1400 cc, the extra annual cost is &euro;34 for a six month disc and &euro;40 for a three month disc.  The surcharge in the United Kingdom for a six-month disc is about 10%.  A three-month disc is not provided for.   That is how it is done and it appears to be working effectively. I do not see any real need to change it.  It is not for me to decide, it is a matter for Revenue, which is doing it effectively and has complied fully with any requests we made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is how it is.  I know that Revenue does its job very effectively and collects all revenue due.  This is an anomaly in the system.  Is it a surcharge for extra administration?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, precisely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With the ever increasing use of on-line registration and payment of taxes, this administration involves the click of a button and posting out a disc.  The surcharge is excessive and although it is quite small, it matters to the people paying it because the reason they pay on a quarterly basis is that they cannot afford the full annual payment.  Every euro counts in many family households and it is the small things that count.  In future reviews I ask the Minister to address this issue in his discussions with Revenue.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="2158"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The surcharge is to cover the higher administrative costs involved.  The current surcharge levels are lower than those permitted under motor tax law.  It was slightly reduced in 2001.  My Department will continue to keep the level of surcharge under review in light of the expansion of the on-line system to which the Senator referred.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday, I mentioned smaller engines and the 9.5% increase on such engines.  Is it possible, at this late stage, for the Minister to examine this issue?  They are not contributing enormously to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and never have done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible.  I was quite clear in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad that we are talking about revenue raising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is where there is a conflict.  The Minister is revenue raising and seeking to lower emissions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course there is a conflict.  The Senator&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad are, in many cases, speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  They are referring to the need to fund local government, but accusing me of being anti-family because we are taxing cars and accusing me of being anti-rural.</P>
        <P>The system for funding local government that I inherited is, by any standard, novel.  In the context of the forthcoming Green Paper we must examine how we fund local government.  I am also the Minister with responsibility for the environment so I wish to reduce emissions.  I am trying to do so in as judicious a way as possible.  That is the reason we have increased the cost by 9.5% for smaller cars and 11% for larger cars.  That ensures a good revenue base for the local government fund.  It has not increased for quite some time, even though the rate of inflation in that period is 15%.  We have examined the issues and done this in the proper way.  We have made amendments suggested by Deputy Coffey&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  These were addressed in detail on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  We must examine and review the situation constantly.</P>
        <P>In the UK, the bands have been expanded from four to 11 or more because they have noticed that people have changed their behaviour.  They are buying lower emissions cars, which has an effect on revenue.  We must keep the situation under review, which is what I will do.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister has inherited a system that has existed for <Col N="2159"/>many generations, but the local government fund, of which motor tax is the bulwark, is a debate for another day.  Unless all factors are right and there is a proper public transport system, there will be difficulties when people try to use public transport and the motor tax take starts to decline.  Where will local government funding come from then?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I do not agree with the Minister about my party colleagues commenting on his anti-rural and anti-family measures.  His intent is genuine and the Bill has good aspects, but people and families in rural areas depend on cars.  This is a fact of life.  We are entitled to raise the issue of the implications of increasing motor tax.  When going to work, a city dweller can hop on a bus, the Luas or so on, but the situation for people in rural areas &mdash; we must not forget that a large portion of Ireland is rural &mdash; is different and there is no point in claiming otherwise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?><Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Kingdom will go to 13 bands in April 2009.  We must keep under review how to progress.  I must take the labelling system I want to introduce into account in the new environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.</P>
        <P>Regarding rural transport, obviously we will require more buses, but it is important to point out that we must ensure people use the buses.  Many of the comfortable buses that get people in Drogheda and Naas to and from their places of work in Dublin are half-empty.  The car is seen as being more convenient and a status symbol.  We must move away from the idea of going from door to door by car because the result in Dublin, for example, is congestion.  Buses must be used and we must avail of every means to promote bus transport in this city and elsewhere.  The bus companies want to make a contribution.  Some of those with which I have spoken want space on the new motorways reserved for buses to get people to Dublin quickly.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Coffey, but we must change people&rsquo;s mindsets to ensure they consider the bus as a means of transport.  People in Dublin are happy to use the DART and the Luas.  The latter is not the most comfortable way of travelling because people must stand while holding onto the roof and sides.  However, it is reliable and is on time, which is what people are interested in.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that vintage cars will be taxed at a lower rate than they would have been had they been part of the <Col N="2160"/>new Schedule.  Many vintage vehicle clubs partake in good social events.  Perhaps people could save on motor tax if they recycled very old cars instead of buying new cars.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an interesting suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yesterday, Senators raised the matter of car disposal.  Is any element of motor tax similar to the electrical fund, namely, a person buying a new electrical appliance pays a small amount of tax for its eventual disposal?  Has consideration been given to a similar scheme in respect of cars?</P>
        <P>Local authorities labour under a huge liability in respect of old vehicles that have been abandoned on roadsides and similar locations, which ultimately must be collected and disposed of by proper means.  This costs local authorities a considerable amount of money.  Has thought been given to this aspect of the disposal of motor vehicles which are old or of no further use?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the end of life motor vehicle directive, which addresses many of the issues raised.  There are some difficulties pertaining to it and I have received a number of deputations stating that certain people are favoured in this regard and seeking to ensure an even playing field.  However, such issues are being addressed and the type of car on the road has improved immensely because of the NCT, the manner in which cars are being disposed of and the way in which cars now are recyclable.  A number of EU directives address this issue and one no longer sees many old bangers going around the place.  Progress is being made at European level in particular.  While there was resistance from a number of countries, particularly those countries that manufacture cars, I perceive a sea change at present and a different attitude has arisen.  Changes are afoot in respect of the type of cars being manufactured &mdash; they are much lighter &mdash; what they are made of and their recyclability.</P>
        <P>During yesterday&rsquo;s debate, the Senator&rsquo;s colleague, Senator Bradford, noted that although more environmentally-friendly cars with lower emissions are being manufactured, the problem, which I acknowledge, is that more people are buying cars.  Families no longer simply have one car and one may see three cars parked in front of a house.  We must address car usage and must induce people to use their cars less and to use public transport.  However, although this is slightly contradictory because it will result in reductions in VRT, motor tax and all the rest, I also firmly believe that we must ensure that people also buy fewer cars in the long term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I accept that people now drive better and more environmentally-friendly cars.  The point I was trying to make, which the Minister picked up on, pertained to the <Col N="2161"/>disposal of redundant cars.  Such cars have little resale value and I am told fully motorised vehicles can be acquired in some places for &euro;30 or &euro;40.  Sometimes one sees them lying about in fields and on roadsides.  Local authorities and the Garda are encountering difficulties with them.  Youngsters probably buy them at a very cheap price simply to joyride in them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moreover, people who are unable to trade in cars that are very old and cannot command a good price simply abandon them.  The plates and chassis numbers are removed and the cars are dumped in forests or at roadsides and it costs the local authorities a lot of money to dispose of them.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister to induce the Department to examine this aspect of the disposal of vehicles to ensure that local authorities have adequate resources to deal with this problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members for their contributions to this debate.  As I said at the outset of the deliberations on this legislation and reiterated in the D&aacute;il, the Bill is intended to address a number of issues.  The need to expand funding for local governments is the reason behind the increase of 9.5%, and 11% in respect of larger cars.  More importantly, it will move motor taxation to a<?oasys _jy ?>CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> -based system and bring about a change in behaviour among motorists.</P>
        <P>I have been candid about the need to make amendments in the D&aacute;il because of the changes in behaviour which we have already seen.  People were waiting until 1 July before purchasing cars, which gave rise to the possibility that they may have decided to further postpone their purchases until next year.  That would have resulted in a major decrease in VRT revenue.  We addressed those issues in a fair minded manner while retaining the essence of the legislation.  We are breaking new ground, so it is essential that we review, and refine where necessary, the new system as we implement it.  The need for regular reviews is highlighted by the experience of the United Kingdom, where the initial four CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>  bands will be extended to 13 bands from 1 April 2009.  We are on a learning curve and will have to observe <Col N="2162"/>carefully how behaviour changes.  With the Minister for Finance, I will have to work carefully to prevent any major losses in revenue.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this Bill and I wish them a happy and peaceful Easter.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for attending all Stages of the Seanad&rsquo;s deliberations on this Bill and commend his officials on drafting it.  Attitudes are beginning to change and we have turned a corner with regard to car purchase decisions.  The general thrust of the Bill is positive and I hope it achieves its objectives.</P>
        <P>The Minister has assured me that he will keep motor tax under review.  It is an important element of local government funding, although I am not sure of its long-term sustainability if we reduce our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?>  emissions and improve public transport.  A conflict in thinking arises in that regard.  The Minister will be breaking through his projected &euro;1 billion ceiling for motor tax collection.  I hope that money will be well used by local authorities.  They need the resources if they are to carry out their functions properly and, while they are doing much good work, improvements need to be made in certain areas.  The forthcoming Green Paper on that issue will be very interesting and I look forward to the debate on it.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister and his officials a happy Easter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>In the spirit of goodwill being expressed by all parties in the House, I do not doubt that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will accede to my request in a fit of Easter generosity.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of the need for the Department of Health and Children to secure core funding for the Irish Osteoporosis Society. <Col N="2163"/> It is obviously a delicate matter when one addresses the relationship between the HSE and voluntary societies such as the Irish Osteoporosis Society.  However, there is a middle way whereby both the Irish Osteoporosis Society and sufferers from osteoporosis can benefit if the HSE and the Department take a rational view of their activities.  If core funding were given to the Irish Osteoporosis Society on an annual basis, it would not only be more efficient for the HSE, it would be in the interests of patients and would also save a certain amount of money for the Exchequer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Osteoporosis is a somewhat under-appreciated disease in Ireland and its extent is not properly recognised.  The statistics which have come to my attention, thanks to the information provided by a very dear constituent, are staggering in the detail they give about the extent to which osteoporosis is prevalent in this country.  As everybody knows, the real danger of osteoporosis &mdash; its lethal nature &mdash; is that it is not immediately detectable and many people suffer from it but do not discover they have it until they break bones.  Prevention would certainly benefit patients &mdash; obviously, as they would not be invalided &mdash; but it also might benefit the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>One in three persons over the age of 50 suffers from osteoporosis, which is a pretty staggering figure.  Some 20% of those who get hip fractures from osteoporosis die within one year and 50% are demobilised.  That is the human element.  If hip replacements are necessary and are given to patients, the cost is &euro;26,000 per hip replacement, which is a huge cost to the State.  We are in a win-win situation if we can give core funding to the Irish Osteoporosis Society because not only would many people perhaps have their lives saved but much damage and many injuries could be prevented.  This is why it is so important that it should be considered as a vital part of improving the health service.</P>
        <P>Osteoporosis affects one in five men and one in three women, and one in two people over the age of 65.  It also affects children, which is not so widely appreciated.  It is a silent disease.  The Irish Osteoporosis Society is the only real point of information for the public about the disease.  It provides a fantastic service in an almost impossible situation.  The society was given &euro;250,000 in 2007 by the HSE but this was not necessarily on an annual basis and it is now living in a kind of limbo, not knowing what it will get this year or next year.  As a result, it has one office with a staff of just two in Pearse Street, which is in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency so he will be familiar with it.  One member of staff is working at least a 70-hour week to try to combat this disease.</P>
        <P>It seems logical, sensible and humane that this service should be properly extended and that at least there should be some permanent and regular form of funding.  How in the name of God can an organisation like the Irish Osteoporosis Society manage to recruit efficient, dedicated people to its flag if it does not know whether it <Col N="2164"/>will be in existence in a year&rsquo;s time?  Very few people would take jobs on that basis.  It is important for the Minister to resolve that uncertainty by promising regular core funding for the society.</P>
        <P>This is an opportunity for the Government to save money.  It has been slow to respond to the demands of this great organisation. Only EU regulations and EU pressure, not local pressure, persuaded the Government to give this funding in 2007.  It is an opportunity for the Government to reconsider its attitude and to invest in an organisation that can reduce hospital costs.  If more funds are made available there would be fewer journeys to accident and emergency units with breaks and fractures and this would free up hospital beds.  This is an extensive problem as osteoporosis affects so many people.  In turn, this would free up money which the HSE could distribute in other areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen the HSE making ham-fisted efforts at saving money, especially in the dispute with pharmacies and in other areas.  Here is an opportunity for the HSE to save money and to do so in the long term while also improving the health of the nation.  I urge the Minister not just to consider this but to give a commitment that funding will be available to the Irish Osteoporosis Society to continue and expand its work to prevent this disease and to save the State money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this issue as it gives me the opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to services for older people and to outline the context in regard to the Irish Osteoporosis Society.</P>
        <P>Osteoporosis can affect men, women and children of all ages.  As many cases of osteoporosis remain undetected until a fracture is sustained, it is difficult to give the exact incidence and prevalence rates for the disease in Ireland.  However, as indicated by Senator Ross, osteoporosis is currently estimated to affect one in three women and one in five men over 50 years of age.  Furthermore, loss of bone density, symptomatic of the potential to develop osteoporosis occurs with advancing age.</P>
        <P>In addition, rates of fracture increase markedly with age thus giving significant rise to morbidity and mortality.  The Department of Health and Children has supported the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Health Service Executive in the establishment of a steering committee to oversee the development of a strategy to prevent falls and fractures in the ageing population.  This committee is chaired by the HSE and it is understood that a sub-group has been established to examine the area of osteoporosis.</P>
        <P>The IOS was established in 1996 with the overall aims of reducing the incidence of osteoporosis and promoting bone health.  It provides information to the public and health professionals on all aspects of the disease and offers support to <Col N="2165"/>people with osteoporosis and those at risk from the disease.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The former Northern Area Health Board, and subsequently the HSE, met with the IOS in recent years to agree funding for various initiatives undertaken by the society.  This resulted in grant aid of &euro;100,000 in both 2004 and 2005, and &euro;128,000 in 2006.  A service level agreement was reached between the society and the HSE for 2007, which included the provision of &euro;250,000 once-off funding towards the following objectives: to develop an osteoporosis and bone health lo-call telephone help line and information database; and to launch a new website to support<?oasys _jy ?>earlier detection and prevention of osteoporosis in the wider community through educating and informing health care professionals, co-ordinating a range of awareness campaigns at national and local level and availing of opportunities to promote osteoporosis in other generic health materials.</P>
        <P>In the wider context, the development of services for older people continues to be a priority for the Government.  This is reflected, for example, in the funding committed to the sector in budgets 2006 and 2007 where over &euro;400 million was provided for much needed initiatives across a range of services nationally.  The 2008 budget provided an additional &euro;22 million for a range of community service developments.  This includes &euro;2 million for increased supports to voluntary groups working in partnership with the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provides the HSE with responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. As a statutory body, the provision of these services is a matter for the HSE, including the delivery of services by agreement with voluntary and community organisations such as the Irish Osteoporosis Society.  Funding for health services has been provided as part of the executive&rsquo;s overall Vote for health and personal social services this year.  The allocation of resources is a matter for the executive in accordance with the overall priorities for particular services, as set out in its service plan.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the HSE recognises the valuable work undertaken by the Irish Osteoporosis Society and makes every effort to assist it in line with resources available.  This is reflected in a practical way in the funding given to the IOS in recent years.  The question of any revised funding arrangements is a matter, in the first instance, for the executive in the light of its overall competing demands and through any new agreement with the society on future service provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise that this is not the Minister&rsquo;s portfolio so a detailed question would be inappropriate and unfair.  However, the Minister&rsquo;s reply was not encouraging and when he says there is a Department, a council, a steering committee, the HSE and a sub-group, all in a few sentences, then we are not going very far.  It is a giveaway that this issue will be submerged in bureaucracy.  That is a little bit <Col N="2166"/>depressing for those who are suffering from osteoporosis and for the Irish Osteoporosis Society.</P>
        <P>Even though the society operates in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, I ask him to take the message to the Minister for Health and Children that there is a serious need for consistent funding for the Irish Osteoporosis Society and not just once-off funding.  Can he assure me that he will do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do that.  The Senator is right to point out that I am not the Minister with direct responsibility for this issue.  This is the second day in a row I am taking the Adjournment debates in the House.  That is not a satisfactory situation for Senators, but I will pass on the message to the Minister for Health and Children.  I also will impress upon my colleagues the need to be in the Chamber to answer questions.</P>
        <P>Senators have a slight advantage over Deputies as they can ask supplementary questions on the Adjournment, which is a very good idea and which could be advanced in the other House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to hear this issue on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  The issue is related to a 2005 application by Gaeilscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n in Tramore, County Waterford.  The school management has applied for a permanent building because the school is currently housed in a completely prefabricated building.  I am sure that everyone agrees that is an unsustainable position.</P>
        <P>Tramore is the largest town in County Waterford and has increased in size rapidly in recent years.  It is now larger than Dungarvan, which is the civic headquarters of the county.  It is about seven miles from Waterford city and the gaeilscoil, operating under the principal, Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; de Paor, and his staff, is very successful in the promotion of the Irish language in County Waterford.  They are becoming increasingly frustrated in their correspondence with the Department.  It is appropriate the Minister is present given our discussion with him yesterday on sustainable planning for urban areas, of which Tramore is one.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has issued guidelines which call for greater collaboration between Departments and local authorities and communities.  In the case I raise, a community established a Gaelscoil to respond to its needs and received support from the local authority.  However, since 2005, it has received no grounds for hope from the Department of Education and Science that a new school will be built.  A design team has not even been appointed.  This must be considered in light of ongoing debate on the need for sustainable communities and promoting education for young people.</P>
        <P>Senators Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill and Pearse Doherty will shortly discuss the need to provide physical education facilities in schools in County <Col N="2167"/>Donegal.  In Tramore we seek a badly-needed building to house students and staff, although physical education facilities will also be needed.</P>
        <P>Much work remains to be done.  From the perspective of sustainable planning, as communities grow progress must be made to improve co-operation and collaboration between local authorities and Departments.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to achieve this objective in the planning guidelines.</P>
        <P>I am hopeful the Minister will give me some positive news or at least an indication that a design team will be appointed.  Surely this step should be taken at an early stage as part of forward planning.  Three years down the road, a design team has still not been appointed and the school hopes the project will proceed to the planning stage.  Construction remains some way off.  The Minister will agree that residents of areas such as Tramore which are not receiving the required service from Departments are frustrated, particularly given that we are repeatedly told that plenty of money is available for services and facilities.  I look forward to the reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position regarding Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n, Tramore.  All applications for capital funding are assessed in the modernisation and policy unit of the Department of Education and Science.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.</P>
        <P>As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.</P>
        <P>Funding to address the capital investment requirements of approximately 3,200 primary and 730 post-primary schools is ongoing.  The Government has dramatically increased investment in the school building programme from slightly more than &euro;90 million in 1997 to &euro;586.2 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P><Col N="2168"/>
        <P Just="Left">On the specific matter in hand, the application for a new school for Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n, Tramore, was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and assigned a 2.2 band rating.  Having regard to competing demands on the building programme for funding for higher priority projects, it was not possible to progress the building project for Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n, Tramore.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a developing areas unit.  This unit was recently established and will focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas, including Tramore.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In this context, the status of the project for Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n will be reassessed and banded accordingly.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the developing areas unit, progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the multiannual school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding Gaelscoil Philib Bar&uacute;n, Tramore.</P>

	<P>While I accept the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not directly responsible, his response contained buzzwords such as &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;, &ldquo;2.2 band rating&rdquo;, &ldquo;priority of need&rdquo;, &ldquo;increased investment&rdquo; and &ldquo;capital projects&rdquo;.  I, and I am sure many in the House, do not know what these terms mean.  To me they are bureaucratic speak.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt the capital funding is available and the programme for Government is proactive in delivering it.  However, there is a need for a permanent building for the gaelscoil in Tramore.  Three years after the first application, a design team has not even been appointed.</P>
        <P>These issues will confront the Minister when promoting his guidelines for sustainable planning for urban design.  One can have all the guidelines one wants.  However, only when Departments are streamlined, red tape is removed and heads banged together with local authorities, school boards and Departments will real progress be achieved.  If we can focus on these areas, the programme for Government will achieve real targets.</P>

Buna&iacute;odh an scoil i 1973 nuair a c&oacute;nascadh Ard Scoil Mhuire i Machaire Chlochair agus an ghairmscoil i Sr&aacute;th na Corcra.  Bh&iacute; an phobalscoil &aacute; reacht&aacute;il idir an dh&aacute; fhoirgneamh go 1980 nuair a t&oacute;gadh scoil &uacute;r ar shu&iacute;omh nua ar an Luinnigh.  Oscla&iacute;odh an scoil sin ar 3 Bealtaine 1982.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Freastala&iacute;onn an scoil ar phar&oacute;iste Ghaoth Dobhair agus ar &iacute;ochtar na Rosann.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, is pobalscoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge &eacute;.

        <P>I and Senator Doherty wish to raise the urgent need for the provision of a physical education hall at Pobalscoil Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal, to proceed without delay.  In 1985, the school&rsquo;s board of management was assured by the then Minister for Education that the project would proceed.  In June 2006, some 21 years later, the go-ahead for planning, tender and construction of the hall was granted.</P>
        <P>The parents&rsquo; council has raised concerns, however, that the sports hall is not progressing as planned and may be removed from the Department&rsquo;s priority list.  That would be an alarming scenario.  The availability of physical education is a necessity to young people, especially teenagers given the growing incidence of obesity.  It is important the school curriculum contains a daily physical education element.  While I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is not the line Minister, I know he will use his good office to impress our concerns on the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, there are 322 pupils attending the school, of which 165 are female and 157 are male.  Those pupils deserve the right to physical education and they live in an area in Donegal where the weather is not as good, perhaps, as in other parts of the country.  That is the reason it is so important to have an indoor physical education facility.</P>
        <P>I understand there is a community dimension attached to the project as well, which is very welcome as the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is providing counter-funding to the Department of Education and Science to allow the facility proceed.</P>
        <P>We are seeking an update today as the people from the area, the parents, the parents council, the teachers and pupils want this project to proceed.  I am impressing today the urgency of allowing the project to proceed to tender and construction without delay.  I hope this can occur in the very near future.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for his commitment to Seanad &Eacute;ireann this week.  While others are abroad, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is certainly looking after the home patch.</P>

	<P>Is ceist t&aacute;bhachtach an cheist seo, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach freisin gur chuir Seanad&oacute;ir &oacute; thaobh an Rialtais an &aacute;bhar seo ar an athl&oacute;.  T&aacute; muintir Gaoth Dobhair ag iarraidh go rachaidh an halla sp&oacute;irt seo ar aghaidh gan mhoill.</P>
        <P>As has been already mentioned, this goes back to the early 1980s.  I can remember being in primary school when past pupils of Bunbeg national school came to our school and told us they were pupils of Pobalscoil Gaoth Dobhair and that it would be great when we would go because the sports hall would be constructed.  Guarantees had been given in the D&aacute;il as far back as the early 1980s by, at that time, Fine Gael Ministers.  They were repeated by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers.  That is 20 years ago, I left Pobalscoil Gaoth Dobhair 11 years ago but there is still no gym in the area.</P>
        <P>There is huge frustration in Gaoth Dobhair that Pobalscoil Gaoth Dobhair has never had the gym promised to it well over 20 years ago.  There are schools right across the country with such PE facilities because it is part of the curriculum.  This issue also concerns other factors which have been mentioned, such as obesity.  There is a financial aspect as well, as the pobalscoil has to bus pupils here, there and everywhere to avail of community facilities, such as the GAA pitch or venues for basketball or other sports.</P>
        <P>I know the Minister would be very concerned about that and we spoke yesterday about proper design and planning.  It does not make sense for us to bus hundreds of students a couple of miles every year to avail of facilities which should be on-site.</P>
        <P>There has been progress on commitments to the sports hall.  It was given the go-ahead in June 2006 and again in May 2007, and funding has been committed by the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The school itself also had to raise money.  A letter was given to the board of management in May which stated the project would be on-site no later than eight months from the sending of the letter.  That would mean the project should have been on-site in January.</P>
        <P>The problem is there have been a number of obstacles to it being put to tender and construction, centering on the mechanical and electrical design.  On five different occasions, the Department has rejected the designs coming forward.  That does not make sense because the Department appointed the contractor itself.  It has been rejected because of 16 points, 28 points and 34 points; it seems the goalposts are being moved time and again.  When it was rejected in December on the grounds of electrical and mechanical design, the problems were not stated.  Every other part of it has been approved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I share the serious concerns that the Department is now trying to put this project on the long finger.  The Minister mentioned in a speech, given to him to deliver by the Department of Education <Col N="2171"/>and Science, that the main emphasis in 2008 is to provide sufficient school places in developing areas.  We know the Minister has repeated that time and again.  The fear in Gaoth Dobhair now is that the Department is moving the goalposts and using the mechanical and electrical designs to hold back this project and that that funding is being directed into the areas around Dublin where the population is expanding.  Will the Minister address the points I have raised and obtain from the Department clarification on the nature of the stumbling block that exists in respect of this issue?</P>

        <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 731 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  None the less, the Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>The Government has dramatically increased investment in the schools building programme from slightly in excess of &euro;90 million in 1997 to almost &euro;600 million this year.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan almost &euro;4.5 billion will be invested in schools.  This is an unprecedented level of capital investment which reflects the commitment of the Government to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>With regard to sports in our schools, the PE curricula at primary and post-primary level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary.  Consequently, they offer a level of flexibility that allows each school to tailor its programme to the facilities available.  Within available resources and overall published criteria for prioritising projects, it is the policy of the Department of Education and Science to provide post-primary schools with PE halls where no such facility exists.  This is considered as part of the design brief for new schools and for major renovation or extension projects.</P>
        <P>The number of schools with general purpose rooms and PE halls is increasing all the time, while practically all schools have outside exercise space.  In addition, many schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing <Col N="2172"/>fields and swimming pools.  Considering the facilities schools have on site is just part of the picture because they also may have access to excellent local sports facilities, which have been greatly expanded and improved in recent years through funding from the Government&rsquo;s sports capital programme.</P>
        <P>Pobalscoil Gaoth Dobhair is a co-educational facility with an enrolment of some 300 students.  I am pleased to inform the Senators that a PE hall of 630 sq. m. is being provided for this school and that the project has reached the advanced stages of architectural planning.  The project is being co-funded by the Departments of Education and Science and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  While it is not possible as a result of higher competing priorities &mdash; I refer in particular to the need to provide new schools in rapidly developing areas &mdash; to be precise regarding when this project will go to construction, it will be considered for progression on an ongoing basis as the school building and modernisation programme is rolled out.  As stated, the latter is being underpinned by an investment &euro;4.5 billion under the national development plan.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Senators for raising this matter.  I assure them the Government is acutely aware of the need to ensure all our schools have adequate sports facilities.  Such facilities will be put in place over time.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  To tell the truth, I am shocked just reading it.  The parents&rsquo; committee and the board of management received an official letter from the Department confirming that the sports hall was approved and should be on site within eight months, but there was a caveat that it could not go to tender until the mechanical and electrical designs had been approved.  However, what we have been told by the Department in this reply is that it cannot be precise about when the project will go to construction because of higher competing priorities.  This has realised our greatest fears.  The project is now in the mix with all other projects and the commitments that were given to the school as recently as May 2007 are null and void.  I am deeply shocked.  I know this is not Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s portfolio but I ask him to pass on our serious concerns to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

	<P>I share Senator Doherty&rsquo;s concern that the final go-ahead for construction appears to be in question.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to convey our concerns to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  I will also raise the matter on a personal basis with the Minister in the near future.</P>
